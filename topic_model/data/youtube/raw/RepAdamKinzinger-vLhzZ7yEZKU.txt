like committee congressman adam kinzinger republican of illinois joins me now congressman we have a lot to get to but first i do want to ask you about this breaking news overnight that gang members in haiti kidnapped as many as 17 american missionaries who are originally from ohio including three children as the missionaries were returning from an orphanage according to a source in haiti security forces you're on the house foreign affairs committee um what should the u.s do to to rescue these kidnapped americans yeah first and foremost uh you know pray for them i think uh secondarily uh we need to track down where they are and and see if uh you know negotiations without paying ransom are possible or do whatever we need to on a military front or police front but yeah i mean i think probably everybody watching at least one or two you know i guess kevin bacon's away uh knows somebody that has been a missionary to uh haiti at some point and uh and so this is this hits home so we keep him in our prayers and the us government will do everything we can to get them back let's turn to the january 6 committee i want to take a listen to what president biden said on friday congressional subpoenas on the january 6 committee i hope that the committee goes after them and holds them accountable do they be prosecuted i do yes now the justice department later clarified that they would make their decisions based only on the law and on the facts do you think it's uh appropriate for president biden to say that does it make your job on the committee more difficult no i think it's appropriate i think the president has every right to signal i think he has every right to make it clear where the administration stands i mean god knows the prior administration every you know two hours was trying to signal to the justice department but you know that had to do with with other pretty horrific things and i think the president has made it clear that we need answers to this and i think you know the vast majority of americans agree so this is this you know potential criminal contempt referral or will be criminal contempt referral for steve bannon is the first shot over the bow it's very real but it says to anybody else coming in front of the committee don't think that you're going to be able to just kind of walk away and we're going to forget about you or not both you and the chairman of the committee benny thompson would not rule out a subpoena for former president trump uh but you and all the members of your committee have also pointed blame for insurrection squarely at him for inciting it do you really think you can do a thorough investigation on the insurrection without subpoenaing president trump former president trump i don't know i think if i had that answer now i'd probably go in you know and not be able to see all the pieces what we really want to do is make sure we're getting every piece of this puzzle and that's going to include people that have already come and talked to us it's going to include people that will potentially subpoena in the future whose name you probably have never heard of who have very good incentives to come in and talk and that begins to put the building blocks of this together and i think you know just speaking quite honestly if we subpoena all of a sudden the former president we know that's going to become kind of a circus so that's not necessarily something we want to do up front but if he has pieces of information we need we certainly will this is not jake here's the thing this isn't about necessarily even getting answers for tomorrow and hoping that you know the the people that believe the insurrection was really some antifa you know false flag thing are going to believe it when i think about what we're doing on the committee i think in terms of yes i hope we can change minds tomorrow you know after we get the report basically sometime in the future but this is about the 10-year argument you know what are our kids going to think when they read the history books who's going to win that argument and i've always believed since i've been a kid in sunday school that truth needs to win out so i know you're worried about protecting democracy and you've been very outspoken um you have opposed both bills from the democratic party that are intended to strengthen protection for voters the john lewis voting rights act uh of bill reinstating the justice department's power to block some states and localities from enacting what they view as discriminatory voting rules why did you not support those bills and is there a bipartisan effort that you and other republicans could get behind that could actually protect the rights of voters and get through the house and senate for president biden to sign i certainly hope there is i think there is i think there's been discussions in the senate from last i've heard look you can call a bill the voting rights act and then left-wing twitter goes nuts about this by the way and they can say you voted against voting rights without even looking into the details of this so the quick details you know the voting rights act in the mid 60s came out with a temporary provision called pre-clearance which required certain states to get clearance for any changes to any election system that they did that went on into perpetuity it was intended to be temporary in 2013 the us supreme court threw that provision out and said history changes we can't keep pretending like it's 1965. and so for the last eight years we have not had that provision in the john lewis voting rights act would simply put to re-implement that provision to have again the justice department make any approval to any changes by the way that would have been the trump justice department and and and anything like that so yes we can get to a solution the problem is you know i admonish my side all the time about playing politics the democrats have to quit playing politics on some of this too you can call it the for the people's act which was the other one and really what that is is public funding for campaigns among other whole host of things if we actually went into this as adults with real discussions i think we can solve stuff but instead we just wait for these twitter comments of at you know adam voted against whatever and then i can put a bill out there you know the god and puppies act and see people vote against that and say they're against god and puppies we only have a few seconds left but i did want to get your reaction to the fact that there was a rally in support of republican gubernatorial candidate glenn younkin in virginia in which uh it was announced that there was an american flag that was carried at the rally uh with trump on january 6 and they pledged allegiance to the flag what was your reaction to that when you saw that uh a hundred percent disgusted you know and it i wasn't surprised when i heard it which is sad it was disgusting you know the the governor mr yonkin did a good job denouncing it it took him a while to do it but let's just be clear to every leader and everybody involved anything like that in the future if you bring a january sixth insurrection flag boo the person bringing it and save the pledge to a flag that didn't fly that day yeah glenn younkins called it weird and wrong afterwards adam kinser thank you so much good to see you

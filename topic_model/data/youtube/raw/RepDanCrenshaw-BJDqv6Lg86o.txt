we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created as a member of congress i get to have a lot of really interesting people in the office experts on what they're talking about this is the podcast for insights into the issues china bioterrorism medicare for all in-depth discussions breaking it down into simple terms we hold we hold these truths we hold these truths with dan crenshaw okay so we're recording um this is a little weird of a hybrid thing where technically since uh dan is going to i can call you dan on this for these purposes right that's not you and call me tell me tycoon so dana's gonna be running this cross-posting this at his podcast which he hosts and i'm running it at the remnant which i host so i just we flipped a coin i i'm talking first but take that as you will and uh we had talked about him coming on to address my continuing complaints and indictments about congress and he has he has his thoughts he has notes as they say in hollywood on all of this so um thanks for doing this dan and i'll just start with a my my sort of standard indictment of congress which is that it's not doing its freaking job and i don't mean that just in terms of not producing the legislation i like i mean that it's supposed to be the place where where politics is adjudicated where people of different points of view from different interests and different perspectives come together to hammer out and debate the important issues of the day in ways that educate the public and educate the members of congress about the different perspectives involved congress is supposed to be where politics happens and when congress isn't the place where politics happens it makes politics spill out into the rest of the culture and one of my great indictments of congress is that it is i mean let me there are all sorts of things you can do you could talk about how i think the last time you actually had 14 appropriations the 14 appropriations bill done the right way was i think 1997 the last time a budget was done through regular order i think was 2 000 power under both parties has accrued to leadership um both it seems like someone had a secret meeting somewhere and said woodrow wilson was right and we should have party government where you elect a party to do stuff um and uh and members of congress should just act on what their party what what what the party that was elected was expected to do without actually negotiating and legislating and working across the aisle and um and lastly i'll just say just to start it off is that i think the project for conservatism going into the 21st century we did a pretty good job even though there's a lot of back pedaling these days on uh making making the argument for originalism in terms of the constitution or textualism or or basically advancing the idea that what a conservative believes is that the constitution actually means something and that was an important victory for the right over the last quarter century or third of a century and the new project needs to be congress actually doing its job and not outsourcing its functions to the legislative and judicial branches as well as to the sort of permanent bureaucracy have at it what do you think of all that um there's a lot to impact i'm just gonna i'm just gonna start with my first reaction to the to the first thing you said and what what struck me as what you were saying was the the question of whether when a representative is a trustee or a delegate um because what you talked about was you know where politics happens and and you you you brought out this idea that what should happen in congress is honest debate where people might actually be persuaded no no of course that's not how it works not even a little bit but it is impossible for me to persuade a democrat now some issues yes like you can you can get them somewhere but these are usually fringier issues not nearly as controversial on the really big stuff you can't be persuaded now but but then again is is that really so unexpected um because it's not like there's not thousands of bipartisan pieces of legislation there there certainly are um i think deals do get hammered out to some extent but but but i think what you're getting at the question of where the politics happens i i do think that's interesting and i think it does get to this question of look is somebody when i say the trustee or delegate dichotomy i mean are you elected because of your judgments are you elected do people elect you to to judge legislation for them and to make decisions on their behalf or do they elect you to simply you know put your finger up to the wind to see which way it's blowing or just take up take a poll and say look i 51 of my district wants this therefore i do this like you're an algorithm you're a robot and you're like a proxy and a shareholder thing right right you just you're voting for how you were told to vote right right you're a delegate um and you know trustee you're entrusted to to make decisions and the public kind of wants you to be both uh generally speaking it sort of depends on the issue you know on on some issues i i um i have a hard time making an argument for like term limits but am i in favor of them yes because people want me to be um but but i but i have a really hard time making an honest argument in favor of them or at least or at least making an honest statement that that they're going to help you and they're going to solve the problems you think should be solved all right i don't know that they'll do a ton of damage if you have term limits and i you know frankly i don't really care um but like i care if they would do damage i mean i i'm just i'm a little agnostic on on which which way to go on term limits but people want them so i'm in favor of them but i always say yes i'm in favor of them because you want them however um here's a lot of cons and problems associated with term limits that maybe you're not seeing and frankly when i'm done with this list you know are you sure you're still in favor of them and people are like well i like you but you know pelosi she's just been there forever and i'm like yeah do you really think that some reasonable new democrat would replace pelosi if she was term limited out you know in san francisco yeah no of course not so um you're right i think that's where politics is supposed to happen it doesn't how do you change that i don't know i mean you know some of these are are more cultural or are more attached to the american culture than they are to the the institution of congress itself um and uh and i think that's a perhaps an outgrowth of the increased use of social media the ability of the public to really have much more of a voice frankly than it ever did before and although although if you ask somebody they would say the opposite which is interesting and so you know maybe maybe i'm kind of rambling here as i think through what you said so i so i agree with it but i would offer that extra analysis okay so let me let me change gears a little bit here when you talk about persuasion which i'm a big believer in and i think conservatives outside of congress have really lost track of the idea of persuading people who disagree with them and there's just so much of right-wing media these days is just is fan service right it's just telling people what they already agree with but we can put that aside for a second i like persuasion persuasion's good persuasion is important persuasion is grounded in the in the enlightenment and in all all sorts of principles that we both hold dear but i don't mean that like on the floor of the house it should be the school of athens where some where you reign reason down upon your political opponents and through the force of pure intellect and logic you'd make them change their positions my point is is that that the by making committees weaker by getting rid of earmarks by getting rid of smoke-filled rooms by uh by by virtue of the fact that we are the only advanced democracy in the world where the parties cannot choose their own nominees where you have to put it up for a primary vote which makes it very difficult to get people to make difficult votes if they know they're going to be primaried and i think a lot of the problems that we have in congress have more to do with the primary system than they do with uh you know a lot of other things that usually get blamed um when you get rid of all of the stuff that was up until the 1970s with reforms of congress understood as politics of wheelie dealing and of of ex of trading votes and trading favors and using things like year marks and committee assignments to to to you know wrench compromise uh you lost the ability for congress to effectively govern in a lot of ways and um i was part of the anti-earmark crowd ten years ago i was it was a big thing at national review it was a big thing in american politics i was a tea party guy back then and i still don't like wasteful spending but i would take earmarks any day at this point if i could bribe every member of congress with a bridge or a rec center or a swimming pool in exchange for entitlement reform and i would say pennies on the dollar doing that and my point is that the committee system is how you actually we gain consensus in this country how you gain how how you let let politics actually do the things politics is meant to do if you actually give congress the power to do it and that's i think that's been lost does that make sense with you yeah yeah that does make sense well i think there's actually two two aspects to this one is is what you what you noted maybe without realizing it but but the problem that i see oftentimes is the the the lack of desire for persuasion and so you know i often say like there's there's two types of members um in congress i'm really looking at my own side on this and i suppose this applies to democrats too but i i care less about that i care more about my own side and there's two types there's there's entertainers the performers and there's let's call them statesmen you know people who are who are pretty serious they're not exactly charismatic but they're serious uh they they know things about tax policy right there and these are generally the people that end up show horses versus workhorses right yeah yeah for some reason i don't like that terminology i think cause somebody called me a show horse once and i'm just really pissed off about it so i never use it but um but uh fair enough ever again yeah don't ever say that again jonah um the but but yeah it's the performers versus the policymakers and um you know generally our uh committee chairman our subcommittee chairman are uh you know fall into the category of people who actually know issues and um and and care to look at them um but it's increasingly popular to try to be a performer now now look and a lot of people fall on and straddle both sides of this i for one straddle both sides of this uh i would like to think that i have plenty of substance and can think through the philosophy of conservatism and i know the issues pretty well and especially the ones that i focus on but i also understand that what the public wants is reality tv uh and they need to be spoken to on social media you need to deliver them content content in in the modern form uh so so so yeah i mean i i mean i did a campaign ad where i jumped out of an airplane and landed like iron man obviously i understand the nature of performance you know so so i'm not i'm not saying that's a bad thing but i'm saying it's definitely a bad thing when when the goal of it is not to persuade but to rile up only your base and that's where we get screwed up that's where you lack the persuasion and i wrote an op-ed for daily wire um i did a whole podcast explaining it too on um the difference between fighting and performing because everybody goes up there and they're like i want i wanna fight i'm gonna stand up and fight okay well what does that end up meaning it usually just means performing for you that would be great if what it really meant was to win because fighting should always end up in winning if if the outcome of the fight that you want to put yourself in isn't winning i don't know what the hell you're doing and um you know i could run into a hail of gunfire as a navy seal and it would look cool right it would make a really good movie scene but it'd also be dead and that's not good so fighting in politics means persuasion and you and expanding your base so fighting smartly and and and i think it's reasonable to say that the conservative base was was increasingly frustrated with the republican party for not quote unquote fighting and so it's up to us as politicians to kind of figure out what they mean by that do you want me performing for you do you want me to do marjorie taylor green for you what has she accomplished nothing what have i accomplished i have brought on quite a i get because i get these kind of messages all the time you're the only republican i can actually like i i don't have to be embarrassed to say it and that means a lot to me that means we're persuading people that means we're bringing people into the fold that's really really important okay so that's one aspect of it um and but then but that i think that the second thing that you you were talking about which is really true and this was first brought to my attention before i was even in politics and i didn't even i had no inclination to run for congress and i was at the kennedy school and one of our professors um i assume that he's probably finished this work by now but um he's he was studying why that divisiveness happens you know why you know that youtube video where you see all the red and blue dots and uh over time there's a time lapse and you're in the red dots i mean a red member of congress blue dots been a democrat member of congress and they're they're all mixed together in the 70s and 80s and 90s and then they start to like drift apart like this and they're like this is what's happened this is supposed to indicate that there's increased divisiveness in in congress um i know now it's an interesting take on it i i cause i think how the only way to measure that is is voting records and so the question is why do your voting records diverge um is it because you have legitimate policy differences have been has the policy platforms changed i think on the left they certainly have i think that's that's very easy to prove i'm not so sure that's the case on the right but it's certainly the case that we're less likely to talk to each other and that gets that gets to what you were talking about where's the smoke-filled rooms um earmarks are no longer an option although that's now kind of changing the democrats are going to bring back earmarks and um there's a very robust conversation on in the republican side about this and what to do about it and we can get into more detail on that if you'd like um but but yeah i do agree there's no these mechanisms for debate just don't exist and and what my professor had found was it has nothing to do with something like gerrymandering everybody points to something like gerrymandering is that's the reason that we get crazies in congress and and um a lengthy analysis of this shows that it's just not really the case because you see the same phenomenon happening in the senate for instance and there's no gerrymandering in the senate so you know and also again the shape of it this is a whole other conversation you know gerrymandering people's frustrations with it um and what it really means what it doesn't mean but it appears more that what they what they found was that the the origin the origin of of this divisiveness was um the committee votes in committee hearings being public he used to be able to take votes and i can't remember what year this changed but it was a while ago um that's that's the moment when you started seeing this this great fear of being primaried and and i know one of your solutions is just end primaries uh um i'd like to hear or allow committees to hold on you know non-transparent meetings i'm fine with both i mean like real i think c-span in congress was a huge mistake and i love c-span i love brian lam but i think it was a huge mistake there's like four of you who watch it and we appreciate every one of you well i mean letting cameras into everything i mean i'll give you an example i mean i just i'm curious about your tickets i remember when it was trump was still president bill barr came to testify democrats were convinced that he was you know satan incarnate republicans were convinced that he was uh being crucified cruelly and horribly he comes to testify there were legitimate questions for this guy to answer you know as someone who defended barr for a long time and then became critical and then uh but wanted to know the facts i can't remember what the exact details were um at the time some of it had to do i guess with the the the the violence outside the white house not january 6 but like back you know with the black lives matter stuff but anyway there were like legitimate factual questions that needed to be asked and needed to be answered and instead we saw um one politician after another on each side use up all of the time to craft videos that they could send home to their constituency showing how they were on the righteous side of the issue given whether they had a d or an r on their name and not even the the republicans wouldn't even let barr answer questions and instead it was one speech that was almost cut and pasted identical to the next person after again and again and again because even though all of these things had already been been said not everybody had said it and they wanted to be able to have their clip that they could send home to congress i mean send home to their district showing them saying it get the freaking cameras out of there you can still print if you need to have print reporters in there fine but you know when you say only four people watch the c-span stuff you know who the four people are they're lobbyists you know with the idea that like shining a light on the stuff would get special interests out that didn't work what happened was you shine a light on it you felt put into everyone's home and people stop don't pay attention to it except for the people who have a vested interest in it on k street and you can't have real negotiations in public i mean this country was founded in a smoke-filled room that was barred from the public you know the constitutional convention it did not have scribes in there taking down transcripts to be published in the newspaper every day because you can't do negotiation with that kind of transparency and this sort of gets to my larger point of just i think in a for a democracy to the flaw for a democracy to thrive it's key many of its key institutions need to be to one degree or another undemocratic in order to be able to have the kind of stickiness and power that allows them to function in the way that they were intended yeah it sounds like such an elitist jonah i don't know i don't have to run for office so i don't shrink from the charge of elites yeah it's um it's at a bar here you're absolutely right i never answered anything these are often what these hearings are like um it's i would say it's a mix um in a high profile hearing like that that was extremely frustrating i think the democrats made total fools of themselves never letting him speak i mean they this happens a lot as the a question is asked and it's usually a compound question and then the witness is like okay well actually it will be in here and then they start explaining it remember yes or no yes or no this happened in um it really it caught a hilarious way during the big tech hearings we had at the on the enc committee a couple weeks ago now um in defense of us members of congress it's really hard to ask any substantive question in five minutes it's and often times if i really care about this issue listen before the big tech hearing i was i had long conversations with facebook google and um and twitter on the on just separately like that that's just what we did leading up to the hearing just so i could ask the real questions that i wanted to ask um because these are very very complicated issues regarding section 230 and i want to let them know where i'm at so it wasn't with the witnesses i was i didn't have the ceos on the phone but i have their people and so often times when we really care about something like that's what happens um we there's lots of separate meetings going on so it's so it's so the so yes the hearings have become purely for show i mean it's it's it's hard to argue otherwise not all the time every once in a while if it's not a really highlighted partisan issue it's you're actually fact-finding and there are hearings like that um but it's not the bar hearing it's not the big tech hearings these are these are purely for show and what i was getting at was so jack dorsey in particular on this in this particular case um kept getting asked compound questions complicated questions questions that require him to explain things and every single time the democrats would say no just answer yes or no wait come on can't you just answer yes or no why is this so hard for you they were just mean it's we could talk forever about the the interesting bipartisan outrage against big tech and and how it really shouldn't be bipartisan it's it's where we fundamentally come at it from different angles but uh they kept doing that and so dorsey starts tweeting and he tweets out a poll that simply says choose yes or he no just trolling the democrats the whole time which i thought was great um but yeah i mean to your point and look i i think the other problem is you know we we can find we can befriend people in congress and we do from the other side of the aisle and that's good to bounce ideas off of each other it's good to say look find an honest democrat and say how do you guys react to this and how would you react to this and then they sort of give us their incentives now unfortunately it doesn't change much in when it comes to the public sphere because the same the same incentives remain the same even if you discuss it behind closed doors in a very honest way the incentives on the outside still remain the same and those incentives are structured around primaries they're structured around generals they're structured around you know how badly you're going to take it on the chin from your activist groups the left i think we have pretty mean right i don't know there might be the same honestly but but but the the both sides deal with that right they're they're puritan wings that are always looking for traitors in their midst um i'm not as concerned about it on the democrat side frankly i like watching it on our side i'm very concerned about it and i think it's unbelievably detrimental um you know i've never called anybody a rhino or establishment i'm not sure what these terms mean to people it's it's usually just it's it's it's usually something said when when you want to bypass the debate right just like the left calls a conservative racist every time they don't want to actually have a debate um we do the same thing we just use the words rhino and establishment and it's it's that's that's probably our greatest threat you know so it's like we can quibble about what to do about the institution itself i'm not so sure that there's any reforms that could happen at the institutional level in congress that would change a damn thing because what we're really talking about are cultural problems i'll leave it there yeah i mean look i mean you in many ways uh jonathan roush has this great chapter in this book uh um uh congress is broken or broken congress i can't remember what the title was where he basically he makes the argument that most the problems with congress have to do with problems outside of congress and and i'm totally open to that i i think that's right in some broad macro cosmic sense but at the same time you can fix institutions to be part of the solution rather than to reflect the problem and right now i mean look i mean we'll put the last two weeks of allegations about matt gates aside uh i think matt gates symbolizes almost everything i've been talking about with the problems with uh with congress you know he he talks about how you know it's better to be on tv because that's where you make news and if you're not making news you're not governing which to me is a complete inversion of what you're sent you're not sent to congress to have a better platform to go on tucker's show you're sent to congress to accomplish things and the sort of hot-taki own the libs kind of culture um is it which is has its by definitely has its own versions on the left i mean aoc has mastered a lot of this stuff too um it's you know it's part of the attention economy that if you're talked about that's more valuable than if you're actually doing something and um and i i think at the end of the day you know the the congress is supreme the congress you know is the first branch of government it's the only branch of government that can fire members of the other branches of government it has the power to declare war is the power to raise taxes which is kind of important it does it creates the laws it creates all the courts except for the supreme court um and it is by far the weakest institution in terms of policy making in this country and i think that is one of the reasons why a lot of people feel like like elite wrenching deletes how unseen powerful forces are making decisions that they have no control of because the place where they're supposed to make their voices heard is congress and congress and i'm not this is not a criticism of you this is a criticism going back 100 years has steadily outsourced its responsibilities to the point where it is now just a platform not just a platform there are good people there you're one of them but it is it is a place where performance is valued more i mean you have these i mean i have these stats i can call them up the number of of congressmen who are coming to washington who don't even have legislative operations they just have comms operations and social media operations the number of people who have social media in their title has skyrocketed and i get that part of that comes with campaigning but part of that's a problem too i mean social media i think everybody can agree has downsides to it and uh i just don't see a lot of sense that as an institution congress is pushing back on that you are free to answer that or if you feel like i'm just filibustering that's fine too if you want to use this we're about halfway in if you want to turn the tables on me and say oh yeah goldberg what the hell are you talking about how do you explain this that's fine too i i i hand the i'm turning the microphone around a little bit to you so you can um well ask any questions that you i mean i kind of hit this before right it's um again there's two types of people performers and policymakers and then there's that spectrum in in between if you're too far to the one side you're not that effective and and i i i try to be right in the middle um because i do see i do understand the value of of the performance and that that high social media following that performative capability the fact that people want to see on tv and invite you to their events because they've seen you on tv that gives me power legislatively that gives me the that means that democrat as long as i don't act like a total jerk democrats with good bipartisan legislation i'm on the top of their list so they come to me about this that this this helps me get on the energy and commerce committee where i am hitting the the the subjects and the issues that i care about most that are important for my district which is energy environment and care those are these are the subcommittees um that i that i deal with so you know there's that that balance is important and it's just important to call people out when they're out of balance frankly um and and to and if you know you always talk about how our parties aren't strong enough the problem is that we have no elites the problem is that we have no establishment and i fully agree with that i tell people that all the time and maybe i stole it from you but now i'm just gonna say it's my original thought um and i'm like you know this is going to shock you guys and i say this at events a lot but there is no establishment if there was then there would be certain members that never would have made it because we have plenty of members that just have no clue what they're talking about look i mean gates at least has like he really he's at least the smarter guy like he at least knows generally he can at least go on msnbc and debate he's done it many times there's a lot of performative members in congress who would get torn apart doing that because the only depth they have are slogans that's if there's enough if there's something that irks me more than anything on our side it's the slogan earring it's the it's the empty shallow slogan earring you know and find slogans are useful for shorthand but you need to be if you can't explain what you mean by that when someone you were pressed on it and if you just fall apart in the moment then you are useless to our movement and you should leave you should just get out just go be an activist go hand out flyers that's about all you're good for and i mean that i i'm kind of being mean about it but it's true and no i think you're right and the members we have who are like that they need to they they need to catch up quickly i'm very upset about it to be honest because it really hurts our cause it's very easy to put them up it's like i mean they're our aoc you know and and and aoc is a there's a reason that you know if you haven't noticed over the last year or two the the left-wing media almost never reports on aoc they they took the rug out from under her a long time ago it doesn't mean she's not influential anymore but that's that's mostly because of her social media following um and uh but but i think it was very deliberate by the democrat establishment if there's an establishment it appears to exist more on the democrat side than it does on the republican side um but i don't you know i don't know i'm not a fly on the wall behind the scenes there and i don't analyze it as much but it's a certain yeah fox's coverage of aoc is is is rich and part of that is just the trying to start a fight thing which is part of journalism um but you know msnbc pays a lot of attention to i don't know uh um marjorie taylor green and um and you know i think it was very smart to get her off of committees because it just reduces the number of opportunities where they actually have a legitimate excuse to cover her you know although unfortunately that gave her plenty of time to keep calling for these emotions to adjourn which has just been uh annoying and uh you know what i point out there i was like everybody's like that's fighting this is a good example of like performance versus fighting i'm like everybody's like that's what it means to fight she's actually fighting what are you doing i'm like i'm doing real things i mean actual real things we're really working on issues what she's doing is swamp politics so that's that's the trick right she's actually using swamp tactics procedural swamp tactics that nobody outside of washington cares about to try and make some kind of grand point that does nothing in the end that has that has a zero good outcomes that's that's a problem we get really wrapped up in those things because they're easy real fighting is hard [Music] yeah no i i think i mean it's funny i mean i'm curious what you think about this and then i i promise we can get off of congress's dysfunction i don't care on one of our s on our sister podcast here at the dispatch uh um steve hayes and sarah isgur interviewed um mick mulvaney and it was an interesting um conversation uh mulvaney's very good at making the best case for the things that he needs to make the best case for um but he tells an interesting story which i don't i don't mean this is necessarily a criticism of multani even though i did think was pretty slippery um but it's sort of emblematic of one of the problems of where we are so steve was asking or maybe sarah was that they were they were asking him about how did the house freedom caucus which came in as the most aggressive deficit and spending hawks in the republican party they were tea party guys they were screaming bloody murderer about getting budgets in line and not spending beyond our means and all these kind of things how did they become the the the shock troops the political shock troops for donald trump who does not care a wit did not care a wit about spending or deficits and um and he tells us so mick tells the story where he says well it's interesting i was talking to the president and the president thought that he was going to have a problem with the freedom caucus because they were such you know deficit hawks and mulvaney tell says that he told the president no mr president don't worry about it because at the end of the day they're going to be your biggest supporters because their their their first instinct is to be anti-establishment yep and your anti-establishment right and so it's an interesting explanation i think it's you know one of the things i really try to emphasize particularly with my own kid is there's a huge difference between an explanation and an excuse like you can tell me why you did something but that doesn't necessarily excuse that you did it right and regardless i remember back when boehner was speaker i would give speeches around the country to conservative groups and they would tell me about how the establishment is so liberal establishments full of sellouts the establishment is full of rhinos we need to purge the rockefeller republicans from the republican party i'd be like who are these rockefeller republicans they went out in the pleistocene era you know the the the boehner ryan mcconnell leadership whatever its flaws and i can have my criticisms i'm sure you have your criticisms is more conservative in terms of just sort of movement conservative positions than any previous republican leadership in the last 75 years but there's just this because of this populist thing that just assumes it's sort of like a weird play on the groucho marx thing you don't want to belong to a club that would have you as a member the second you become part of the establishment you need to be protested against regardless of what you're trying to accomplish and the idea that the house freedom caucus would turn on the conservative leadership in the republican party or support trump to the extent that they would abandon the issues that they said were at their core because it was more important than to be anti-establishment than to actually get things done i think is a pretty damning indictment of the house stream caucus and i don't mean that as everybody because i actually know people who are in the house freedom caucus who are who are good guys who who don't go along with all that but as a sort of as a matter of optics at the at the macro level it says something pretty pernicious that people would rather stay rebellious than actually work within the system to get stuff done yeah that's the incentive structure on the right look it's um i think that's an unbelievably honest answer from mulvaney i don't think it was an excuse or an explanation i think it was just blatant honesty um anti-establishment is the buzzword it will always be the buzzword because look the left is these are the two p's the left is power hungry the right is paranoid and we're always looking for traitors in our midst it's it's again it's one of the most frustrating things that i see and it it's utterly self-defeating um but there's an incentive structure around that and because we have that sort of deep sense of paranoia that we're always going to be betrayed because our our media leaders and our pundits and our influencers and our politicians have been telling us that all the time because it helps them one-up it helps them get a a leg up and maybe a primary or or especially in fundraising um if you're being victimized by the establishment this is our own victimhood culture too this is this is how i always pointed out how we're copying the left the left victimhood culture now we do it differently than they do it's more of an internal struggle but it does happen you're victimized by the establishment you're being lied to you know they they don't care about you don't care about what you care about and if you say like well what do you mean like what well that then the argument falls apart because there's actually nothing but but this is the buzzwords that are used and it works very very very well um our most victimized members of congress fund raise the most off of just being victimized everybody's picking on me i'm the one fighting the establishment again don't ask me what that means because i can't tell you but i'm doing it just trust me um and then and here's but here's the worst part of it all they like losing i don't know if the tea party likes losing although um some might make that argument but it's certainly beneficial in many ways because you know think of think of your influencer who who basically monetizes um they monetize outrage you know they monetize it by getting extra clicks by getting extra shares which improve their following and the only way to do that is to convince people that the truth is found where you're at because because you're anti-establishment so this this buzzword just carries with it so much power and it's so tempting and it's especially tempting if people don't have the intellectual capacity to to do better than that i mean you know because what i point out to people is look you can be the fighter for people but also have substance that's persuasive and really makes our case that's what i try to do ben shapiro is a great example of that i you know i think that's a good example of how to do it nobody would accuse this guy of being a rhino sellout but but then again they would because because anybody who ever engages in nuance and always like i'm like what makes you establishment it's like maybe somebody who engages in nuance every once in a while instead of sloganeering because sloganeering is the language that you're supposed to use and if you don't use it yeah it's an indication that i can't trust you and uh it's it's a problem i always make fun of people i'm like okay yeah guys get your rhino guns get them rhino guns out and hunt for them rhinos you know i just made five i just i just directly go at it just like we just gotta start making fun of it because it's it's really become comical and clownish in every way it really is silly one also i mean i mean like i i'm i'm i'm with you on the problems of tribalism and you know in in in in the the the internal witch hunts on the right but there's there's also just a matter of practical politics right like as a in a two-party system you want to be the majority party to be the majority party means you're going to have more factions in your coalition that disagree with each other than the minority party i mean the classic example of this was the fdr coalition which had communist jews and urban blacks and southern segregationists and everybody in between all in one party and it always would drive me crazy um when people would focus all of their attention on how terrible the sort of northeastern squishy rhino republicans are and i have profound disagreements with them you know i think arlen specter was a horrible human being uh but you know like scott brown uh susan collins these kinds of people like the first thing you expect you have to demand from them like in the senate context is that they vote for a republican for the leader right so they vote for the the party to organize to be the leader um to the majority party after that have some freaking negotiations i mean everything else can be a conversation but if you want to be a majority party you have to have tolerance for people who have to take votes that will get you know that so they can get elected and you could have if you if you only want purists pure hardcore rock ribbed goldwater right republicans voting and running in massachusetts then you're just never going to have republicans from massachusetts and it would be better to have power and have internal conversation and descent than to be smaller and pure and that's why i used to have real problems with like the guys from wyoming or montana who you knew were going to get reelected by 10 or 20 or 30 points who never swung for the fences and took risks when it was safe for them to do so but they all the attention was always on these traders on the rhino squishy side um who were the majority makers for the republican party i just think it's it's so counterproductive just as a matter of like balls and strikes how do you play the game kind of thing yeah i i fully agree i'm not sure i can add too much to it i mean what i what i tell people often too is is like in my district i have a squishy suburban district um uh donald trump won my district by one point and uh but i want it by 14. so there's 40 000 people that voted mostly down ballot republican but not for for donald trump now it is a unique election and trump's a very unique candidate and um but but i think it tells us but i'm not squishy either i i've never i never take positions of the left but but however people and i'll take this as a compliment a lot of people in the middle moderates independence will be like well you're kind of moderate and i'll say okay thanks so what is it about me that makes me moderate because i've never voted that way and i've never in my positions are very clear and i suppose it's tone and i suppose it's simple it is it's such an easy formula just explain why you think what you think it really is that easy people appreciate that to an extensive degree um especially so-called independents and moderates and there's a lot of there's a lot of interesting things in there like what makes somebody moderate or independent all the different types of people i always i always um i got us this on rogan earlier this week and i always get asked this by people mostly people outside of politics and it's like well why can't we when are we going to just where's the center you know where is it and i'm like well there isn't really a center it's a knife edge and and we're okay with that you should be okay with that a lot some things can be negotiated but some things are eternal battles because we have completely different dispositions in the role of government why it even exists and how we should solve problems and you know it it's we should be comfortable with that i think what we should we should demand from our politicians is better explanations for why and in a more substantive policy debate as to as to why we disagree and then and then let the public um support kind of fall where it will um that would that would be nice to have do you want to move on to some of the um i don't know how much time you have i'm actually a little bit flexible with time but but um let's maybe we move to the woke fascism discussion about everything going on this uh this past week and um i've started to label it as woke fascism i'm not sure which label i like better let's let's pull it with you jonah woke fascism or progressive fascism um know woke fascism maybe rolls off the tongue a little bit better but i think progressive fascism is perhaps more accurate but the point is is you know i look up this definition of fascism and i've read your book liberal fascism and i know you're not it should people you're not saying that current liberals are fascists you're just making the argument that a history of fascism seems to have a lot more in common with left-wing philosophy than it does right-wing philosophy at least in the american sense and um and i'm kind of sick of getting labeled as an american right-winger with well if you go too far as a right-winger you're a fascist like that's that's so not true it might be true in europe but it's just not true here if you take my philosophy to its greatest extent to its greatest extreme you kind of end up with no government you end up with you know in theory you would end up with something closer closely resembling anarchy because you know we're so if you take a limited government to its extreme so it's just such a it's just such a lie but what i do see is is when you when the left is is conscripting institutions into their side and asking them to do their bidding and basically tarring and feathering via cancel culture anybody who disagrees with them this appears to me to look like fascism you know we see anti-fascists running the streets in their black-clad gear engaging in fascist tactics it appears to me to look like fascism um it's cultural it's it's physical um it's all of the above and um it's concerning it plus it's based on a lie in the in the in the case of these georgia election reforms and texas election reforms so i i think this is the point where they really got out over their skis because there's really there's no gray area here when you really look at the uh facts and i think they've really embarrassed themselves on this one i am so i have complicated views on all of this in part because yes or no i've been working on uh [Laughter] i've been working honestly for a long time about what i i've been working on an essay for a long time about what i what i stand by in liberal fascism and what i don't and um i still stand by a lot of it i stand by the first four or five chapters pretty much entirely i mean you know this footnote here this paragraph there you know those kinds of quibbles are fine but um i gotta say i i'm with you about the lie about american traditional conservatism that you can't get from extending sort of reaganism to fascism uh without stealing some intellectual bases i have to say that the events of january 6 the way donald trump emphasized nationalism over patriotism the way he had lots of blood and soil rhetoric um the way he essentially encouraged mob violence on on the insurrection that looks a lot like generic fascism to me too and i as a matter of my own intellectual honesty i have have to admit it and we can talk about that if you like or we can just leave it there like a uh you know something to be continued later that's fine in terms of like the corporation stuff and the the the way that the left is behaving under you know what you call woke fascism um it does bear a lot of anatomical features that are similar to to to the economic and the sort of economic and governing doctrine of of both italian fashion fascism and german nazism and one of the things a lot of people don't like to hear is that there's actually an interesting scholarly debate about whether or not nazism was even fascist but that's we used the term to describe both so that's fine and the core idea behind both of them was corporatism now the left likes to use corporatism to say rule by big corporations but that's not what actually means it comes out of italian uh uh doctrine in the 19th century and it's basically this idea that all the major players in society trade unions universities the church um businesses you know syndicates guilds government they all should sit around the table and they're the stakeholders and they should make the decisions for everybody and they should all agree and the germans had this word which they borrowed from from electrical engineering called gleichelton which means coordination and it was this idea that all the ores in every aspect of society have to pull in the same direction right so you could be a nominally independent institution a fraternity you could keep your independence but the rule was the institution had to subscribe to the prevailing nazi orthodoxy and ideology and wokism works very much like that is that the the institutions that swim against the grain of the sort of social justice mantra that's what gets them labeled fascists right because fascist in that sense doesn't mean storming poland or anything right it means um forced conforming it means yeah it means disagreeing it means dissent and that's why i've always said that the single most fascistic thing that is said regularly in american life is if you're not part of the solution you're part of the problem which is that there's no safe harbor right you can't you can't disagree you can't just you you'll be made to care you have to subscribe to every issue on the agenda and and that that is whether we want to call it fascist or not is very fascistic in its um in its psychology it's very tribal um and i think it's very dangerous i think that sort of tribalism whether we call it fascist or not is a problem in our culture generally but it's definitely going on in in what we see with the woke crowd and i agree with you about the georgia thing it's not jim crow they're perfectly legitimate things you can criticize in that law but jim crow was a legal system that basically gave license to white people to kill black people to humiliate black people to deprive black people of achieving uh of working in the economy it was primarily intended as an economic thing the political part about not voting was was was bad but that was an attempt to keep black people from organizing and changing the economic part about it they wanted to once once the slaves were freed the plantation owners wanted to turn slaves into serfs or indentured servants in effect and not them let them use their labor power not let them move it was a profoundly evil system shortening the number of days for absentee ballots uh to be filed is not that and it's you know it drives me crazy because so much of the debate now is whether or not people people think the question is do you know what's in the georgia bill um that's important but it's also important to know what jim crow was yeah and so many people don't know what jim crow was and so because they don't know what jim crow was they feel free to call the georgia law jim crow because they don't know what the hell they're talking about the sorry my rant's over no it's it's it's extremely frustrating and i think this is like this is one of these moments where um they're really losing this debate and you can see that in the polling on support for the georgia law you can see it in basic polling for voter id because the georgia law is really surrounding voter id you need a driver you need to put a license number on the absentee ballot this makes a lot of sense i am not a fan of signature verification i think this is nuts how do you i mean it is not reasonable to expect people to be able to properly analyze a signature my signature maybe because i'm so used to doing it you can tell when it's my signature but somebody can also copy it rather easily um if 500 this is a stat that people always need to know 550 000 ballots mail-in ballots were thrown out during the 2020 presidential democrat primary just that this does series of elections it's a lot of ballots so why are they thrown out maybe some kind of clerical error sometimes but but oftentimes it's one of two reasons either either the election official caught legitimate fraud somebody attempting to commit fraud or the election official threw it out and threw out a valid person's ballot because they just screwed up their signature in either case this is a really really bad thing um it's it's it just goes to show how we probably shouldn't use this practice um anyway that i want to get down down that path let's keep it on um but also we should clarify it doesn't have to be your driver's license number yeah i mean yeah yeah it can also be like the last four digits of your social security number yeah or your voter id number i mean there are other things other than a driver's license i think it's important to point out because this is one thing that drives me crazy is people say well not everybody has a driver's license um not everybody has a voter id card a lot cheaper to just get everybody a voter id card just send everybody 100 solve the problem if there's really a problem and there's not see they're lying about it but but let's say that there is you're going to get republicans on board real quick to say oh my god there's people without there's that many people without ids there's entire communities without ids oh my god i think that would be a national emergency frankly considering how badly you need an id to do basic things in this world um so yeah i mean how do you get a lease how do you get a credit card how do you get a car loan it is it is it would be a scandal if there were millions of poor people who had no identification in this country and i would let's throw that in the infrastructure bill get people their id's right so they can participate in the modern economy you know right it's um yeah i think i think they generally lose this one um but yeah it's the these fascist tactics are concerning i wonder what what do you think the incentive structures are in the in the corporations themselves um is it is it a is it a knee-jerk reaction to mitigate risk like why why would they jump on this head first or are there are there truly progressive ideologues sitting on the boards uh as members of you know acting as ceos is it a mix of both are they just deeply afraid of those 1000 mean tweets that they might get i mean like you know that means nothing to me um but it might scare them a lot you know what what what what do you think drives this yeah so one of my one of my frustrations with this argument is uh that's going on out there not not with your question but is the way that some of this stuff surprises people as much as it does because this has been a problem for a very long time right milton friedman used to complain about this problem about how corporations wouldn't protect you know wouldn't wouldn't uh stand up for their own self-interest um and uh one of my favorite stories you may not know this so there's a great book called the suicidal corporation where this guy talks about how ford was getting all this grief because of nader and all that kind of stuff and decided it needed a much more aggressive government operations unit to uh to fix its image and and and fix its washington problems and this guy goes to work for he leads like the wall street journal he thinks he's going to be fighting for capitalism in the american way and instead of like an aggressive pushback campaign ford motor company decide i think it's 99 shorts ford decides no no that's not the way we're gonna go instead we'll buy goodwill by funding washington week in review on pbs and they thought that this was the way they're going to like fend off the regulatory state whatever the fortune 500 companies have been funding their enemies for so long that i think it comes as second nature whether it's the sierra club and you know all that kind of stuff um i think in this context a lot of it has to do partly because of um a lot of ceos defer to both hr types and to social media types because they don't understand that stuff directly themselves and the advice they get from those directions is pretty progressive but also a lot of these companies you know they care about 18 to 34 year olds a hell of a lot more than they care about 48 to 70 year olds and um they think that there is this major incentive of holding on to sort of brand loyalty with young people if they're on their side of various social justice causes and uh i think sometimes they may be right which is an argument for why republicans need to get better and how to talk about these things that appeal to 18 to 34 year olds um a lot of it comes from i think i think also part of it comes from the fact that of the sort of the the sort of social bubble that a lot of these guys come from in terms of the c-suite crowd or they come from the you know the sort of meritocracy ivy league they're used to farming out certain tough questions to mackenzie type experts and um and one of the problems you get with that you know people people understand that when you hire a lot of these kinds of consultants in the private sector it's not necessarily to get the best option to get the best decision of the best course of action it is to have an excuse if things go bad where you get to say hey we hired mackenzie you know i mean like we followed the best advice and that's why we did it and i think in that sort of hr social media modern communications world there's an enormous amount of groupthink where those people are much more tied in to what reporters at the new york times and the washington post and msnbc think than what actual consumers or people close to the ground think that's probably that i hadn't really said before and thought about before and i think that's probably extremely accurate um you know mckenzie for instance certainly hires almost exclusively out of hbs and um and there's certainly groupthink at harvard business school um and yeah so when they're thinking of what consumers want and it and they and they believe and i bet if you ask them that they don't even think that they're thinking in partisan terms but they are because they live in a bubble and um it was so easy for me to and it's so interesting for me to debate somebody at grad school at harvard because they've never heard conservative philosophy before they've never heard they now they they build straw man arguments out of conservative ideas and so they they're like this is what you guys think i'll be like that's not that's literally not what we think i mean it's certainly or if it's the policy it's like that's not why we think this policy is here you've they they attach these very strange motivations um to what we believe a good example is just i mean i remember this professor trying to sell me on the idea of a carbon dividend and i'm like and they're like see it's a conservative idea because the government doesn't actually make money off of this carbon tax revenue and that's what you guys like right i'm like no no you don't understand us at all that's not that's not anything excuse because you're basically saying you want to tax people you want to send it through a bureaucracy and then send out checks back to people that's not conservative that's that's that's highly inefficient and also i'm not sure it gets the outcome that you're even looking for but that's a separate conversation about energy policy and so they think these things and and i love watching like like a real liberal a real liberal who's who's just there to talk um which i've distinguished from a progressive who is who is there to bully you into some kind of conformity via fascistic tactics different but a real liberal their lies light up something they're like why never heard that before and i'm like really you're this politically involved and you've never heard that explanation before you truly live in a bubble and we're at a huge advantage as conservatives because it is easy to understand the left it's really not that hard um you know it's go to their institutions you're you're not going to be that surprised frankly um they they're the the belief is very strong there that you can that you can really structure the perfect policy on a policy memo and um and it will just work if you just get to give them enough power that that that philosophy has not changed um even if it's well intentioned it certainly hasn't changed and but they have no idea what we think um and and that that certainly carries over in the corporate side i think that's i mean i think there's a lot of truth in here you know one of the ways i often talk about it is um uh you know there's a reason why this is how i began the introduction to a book about young conservative writers that i edited years ago there's a reason why blacks gays jews and canadians dominate stand-up comedy and and one of the reasons why is that they're all minority cultures that are sort of slightly outside the fishbowl of the mainstream culture so they know their own culture but they also know the mainstream culture and like canadians you know they're just all looking down at us absorbing our tv and they're a little alienated from it and that's a good source for comedy um but the same thing is true about a lot of about conservatives is that particularly college-educated conservatives if you go to any halfway decent college in this country and i don't mean decent like you can't get a good education at community college sometimes i think you get a better education i mean halfway elite you know selective school if you go to any of them and you're a conservative and you come out a conservative without being some sort of lunkhead you are not only going to be better at articulating conservative positions you're going to be better at articulating liberal positions because your professors are liberal your fellow students are liberal you're going to argue with them you're going to internalize it your arguments are going to get better as a result you know the best learning comes from sort of the socratic thing uh you know the the fish that swim upstream are strong fish that go with the flow are dead and um and so long as you don't come out a jerk which i think one of the problems we have with a lot of the sort of right-wing campus stuff these days is they're teaching kids to be jerks because it's politically incorrect to be a jerk rather than you know i mean be provocative but be provocative for a good reason you know and um but and i think there are some studies about this you know in in science there's a thing called a turing test and it's how you could tell if a computer is achieved artif you know like human intelligence as if you were having a dialogue with it you couldn't tell it was a computer they do these tests these ideological turing tests and conservatives generally my understanding score much better than liberals about understanding and articulating what the other side actually thinks yes liberals are yeah the liberals are taught that what conservatives believe is this straw man stuff that they're evil that they hate puppies whatever and conservatives because they actually have to live in and i think this is changing a little bit but they you know up until the last 10 years or so conservatives particularly college educated conservatives they experience living in majority liberal institutions and so they just understand it better yeah now it's true on a psychological basis too i mean jonathan heights work um really went into detail on that on the kind of the moral psychology aspects of conservative liberalism and that is that what you're referencing or is that is it that's some of it yeah yeah yeah yeah and so you know it's a pretty overwhelming evidence i mean these aren't like small sample sizes these are hundreds of thousands of data points so um and then in my and then in practice you certainly see it play out that way as well um maybe the last thing i would ask about a um article he wrote on um on secretary blinken's performance with the chinese um and uh what was interesting about it was the the conversation about how we lost patriotism and um conservatives often accuse the left of doing this of basically going on apology tours and uh this seems to be yet another example of that uh and it's and it's frustrating um but maybe on the but i i bet you would have some criticisms for the right also on on a sense of patriotism and maybe and so maybe maybe talk through that um and expand upon that yeah so i mean first of all for just explaining what this is in reference to blinking as secretary of state he had this meeting high level first meeting with the chinese in alaska first one since biden was elected and the chinese were the real jerks and the real bad actors in this story but they broke protocol and denounced the united states of america when the united states said hey we're planning in these talks to talk about what you're doing with the uyghurs what you're doing with hong kong blah blah blah and the chinese went on this harangue denouncing the united states of america as having no right to criticize china given all of the evils that are you know and problems with american democracy and america's record on race and all this kind of stuff and blinking's response there are two ways of thinking about it either he was unable or unwilling to give a full-throated defense of america instead what he said was look no one here denies that we have problems but we talk about them openly we we confront them directly yadda yadda all true and it's a necessary thing to say but it's not a sufficient thing to say in the sense that um you know look if i if i if i accuse you on this podcast of being a uh a shoplifting pedophile you know uh three-state killing spree serial killer and your response is well jonah i never said i was perfect um that's not a denial right right that's something else and what and and so i think blinken has been pretty good so far i i don't mean this as like something like he's some pink oh comey who hates america or anything like that people tell me you know he's he's a better democratic secretary of state than a lot of the other options and so and i and he should be congratulated for confronting china as much as he has that said the idea that america look america has its problems but the idea that america is has no right to judge china or what the chinese communist party is doing is so incandescently stupid i mean china right now is committing cultural genocide it is committing literal genocide there are reports of forced rapes and sterilizations they have jim crow in their country you know we're talking about georgia having jim crow they literally have jim crow with your if you're not part of the right ethnic group you cannot get the papers required to travel internally you can't get into certain schools you can't get certain jobs they are um committing ethnic cleansing in tibet uh the idea that somehow we don't have the standing to criticize that is insane and so what concerns me concerning about that is that i suspect blinking knows that but for reasons that i just don't know he felt like that's not the full-throated answer he could give yeah and maybe that has to do with our diplomacy diplomatic agenda with china i don't know maybe that's due with global diplomacy i don't know or maybe it has to do with the fact that huge swaths of the democratic base do think we have no right to judge china do think that we have you know that racism has never been worse which is insane um do think that you know white supremacy defines america and that the real founding was 1619 and he didn't think he could say though he didn't think he could defend america the way it deserves to be defended without pissing off his own base i don't know that that's the case but it worries me that it might be a possibility that was my take on it yeah and the question you posed is you know was he unprepared or unwilling and maybe a mix of both but i doubt that he's unprepared because it's not that stupid um and you and this is a very common refrain from the chinese they say this kind of thing all the time so it should be it should be fully expected that when we criticize their human rights abuses that they'll criticize well you guys had slavery and jim crow they say it all the time um and it's pretty obvious what the response should be i mean you've you've basically said it it's like it's like yeah well you know we fought wars to get rid of that you know we we fight to live up to our ideals what the hell are you doing don't judge us um you know and just slam it right back in their face um that you know we are not the same and we will not even let you pretend that we won't even we won't even we don't even pretend that notion is true and he didn't do that at all it's like well you know yeah it's like mom where nobody's perfect uh that's basically that is basically the response and no i i think it was probably pre-planned and i think it's exactly the i think it i think it is does originate from this problem of of basic patriotism um and you know i have like a list of uh conservative guide to the culture wars and um and number one starts out with that america is a is a good place worthy of our love and affection and patriotism that's a it's a very simple statement and it's a shame that it even has to be a statement these days i've heard them from college professors and you know elite northeastern schools and they'll and they'll ask their class who's proud of their country and all the international students raise their hands it doesn't matter where they're from they're almost always proud of their country even if they're from like a civil war-torn country there's still like a deep sense of patriotism that occurs but the but but it's a fad and it would be it would be it would be expected and it's certainly how it how it turns out that american students simply don't raise their hand because it's it's part of the bandwagon it's part of this new cultural fad to just denounce your own country um and it's it's extremely problematic there's this sort of idea on the left and i you know hear it from my liberal friends often i just love my country so much that's why i advocate for change because i love it it's like yeah tell your spouse that i love you so much i mean that's why i need to fundamentally transform your personality right uh you know that's that's not love sorry it it also and it would be fine if it was objective um you know but it but it's just it's not objective either um it really falls out the falls outside the i think the standards of of what would be deemed uh a rational assessment of what is good in a country i i think they're very much outside of that and i think there's political opportu reasoning for that because you have to convince people that they're in crisis constantly that they're in constant need of change because that's the only way that you can justify some of the most radical agenda items that you're pushing because you know why why would you need these drastic changes unless things were so bad already that so i think there's there's a a psychological manipulation happening there as well with the voter base and people fall for it um what's interesting too i mean because you look at polling and you ask people about their own lives and you know this is this you know donald trump should have won just based on these polls alone my life is significantly better than before so many people were saying that a vast majority of americans but they also think that everybody else is doing very very bad that's a really interesting psychological phenomenon it's um it's and i don't know how to fix it but and that's and i think it's a direct result of the less propaganda you might be doing fine but trust us there are people in misery you know children are hungry people are dying from air pollution like they throw out the statistic one in five people are dying from air pollution this is a lie this is a total lie it's based on global data and it's it it's it's basically almost entirely because people are burning dung and wood inside their homes in small villages around the world and that's the equivalent of smoking 40 packs a day you know why they're doing that because they don't have fossil fuels you know so it's just it's just such a there's so many lies being told and i think it and that's these lies accumulate in this extremely embarrassing moment with the chinese where we can't defend the wonders of america and it's um it's it's the first it's the it's the there's a reason it's number one on the culture wars i think it's important yeah i mean i i i'm with you on on a lot of that and i think i mean this gets to my thing about how it seems to me both parties whichever party could convince the majority of americans that they're just not crazy wins yeah and the problem is is that both parties at the at the macro level seem really eager to be minority parties today and um uh and just just don't be like a great example is to talk sort of tie all this together about the bubble and all that kind of stuff there was this i i really should commit the numbers to memory i bring it up so often you know there was this survey from a progressive polling firm that looked into [Music] what the preferred label is for hispanic americans that they use about themselves and latinx came in at like two or three or four percent something like that yeah a huge chunk of people had never heard of it yeah and it turns out that like and you probably know this better coming from texas than i do but like a lot of hispanics want to be known as mexican-americans or just americans or cuban americans or whatever but like like latinx is like what the hell is that right but in the bubble that say elizabeth warren lives in where she probably knows and i'm not trying to disparage anybody but she probably knows more transgender people right than uh uh i'll just be generous than the average person the way she talked about like transgenderism latinx people all these kinds of things she made it sound like someone had convinced her that she was doing outreach to a large swath of americans you know when in reality she's doing micro targeting of a handful of hyper-educated people who are in these sort of diversity consultant universe of professions who are telling her this is how you do outreach to ethnic groups and then when you look at like the actual polling of hispanics often hispanics come in you know the immigration is sometimes second third fourth on their list of priorities but for democrats who live in this kind of bubble they assume that the way you reach all hispanics is talking about immigration even though first of all like puerto ricans are already citizens like why would they think that immigration is like the most pressing issue for you and i think that you get this kind of situation where it's sort of like uh plato's cave you only see the shadows on the wall up front of you and they give you a really distorted view of what america is like and if i had one piece of advice for like republicans about all this stop talking about real america as if it's defined by a pickup truck and in a in a ford commercial i like that america all in for that america i have members of my family in that america but most americans actually live in cities and major metro areas right and um there are enormous number of low-hanging fruit problems in these democrat-controlled cities out there about zoning and how to start a small business that would appeal to immigrants that would appeal to descendants of immigrants that would appeal to people on bread and butter republican issues about low taxes and low regulation and all that kind of stuff and when the message is if you're not listening to a certain kind of country music you're not in real america which means that is so self-defeating for a party if it wants to be a majority party because the majority of americans don't live those lifestyles don't that doesn't speak to them and i wish the gop could figure out a way to go back into cities and be competitive in them because that's where the if you want to be a majority party in this country that's where you got to go what do you think about all that because you come from you come from you're basically the suburbs of houston right yeah central houston but it's yeah yeah and it's an interesting point like yeah like how do you um the question is how do you present yourself culturally speaking um that is appealing to the broadest the broadest masses and i think the answer to that might be have a diverse set of people presenting themselves because one person can't do it all right um i think i do an okay job i try uh my natural state is jeans boots and like a camouflage hat now that's that's somewhat that's a mix of my texas background and military background that's a very military way to be as well i dress like a military guy um and i'll never stop it's just it's just who i am um you know i worked on a ranch growing up so i can kind of fill that role too but yeah does it apply to like your but i can also i i went to harvard so i can also i can have a latte with you know it and i and in my drink at starbucks it may or may not be like a triple espresso tall almond milk mocha okay i can do that i can i can play that role because you know and it's authentic the point is just be authentic and i think you'll be fine um but yeah i didn't mean any of that as a criticism of you no i know i know i'm just like i'm just using it as an example but there's a branding problem that the gop has you know yeah yeah yeah like wave the american like like like stab you with the american flag and yeah no it it got a little excessive um recently to to say the least and like it it it is it's extremely prevalent for instance and you know because we're going to have this debate now it's the you know because joe biden's putting all out all these gun gun control executive orders and so what's going to happen we're going to we're going to our second amendment community may and hopefully get smart about this but but i'm not so sure that'll be the case they will fight it in the most unpersuasive way possible and and talk about the tyranny of government and and strap up with that uh you know that ops core helmet and that kit that they bought online but they've never worn it in combat never worn it overseas so you look ridiculous you're dressing up like your favorite call of duty character you're scaring the hell out of suburban housewives and and you're pretending like you're fighting for your rights you're not you're you're you're setting us backward in this argument and we've gotten a little smarter about this i mean i'm i'm friends with um the spokesperson for gun owners of america antonio coffort and she's that's the right spokesperson a young black woman with a young child who says look i need to equalize myself against an attacker that's the right argument and you know what you can't tell me what kind of gun i'm going to use and if you're going to try to restrict guns you better be able to make a much better argument for why you're restricting types of guns or magazine capacities how on earth does that result in less crime and gun death it doesn't nobody would and you can't argue that so just stop it that's the right argument and that's the right that's the right presentation as well so i mean it's in yeah but but instead it becomes this sort of like 1776 kind of like you know flag waving and um it's fun like it appeals to me um but it doesn't appeal to the people you're trying to persuade um i think we have less of a problem than the democrats i i think that latinx problem is much more severe than some of the problems that we put forth because in the end that flag waving patriotism still is fairly inclusive um you know and we're and we're very open about that and i think i think we just need to lean into the lean into these conversations a little bit more than we have donald trump really did that i'll give him credit for it um and he did see some benefit from it in the black votes and latino votes and because look latinos one they hate illegal immigration because if they are immigrants um if they're not multi-generation latinos they're and therefore they basically call themselves americans um then then they then they immigrated here legally and their citizens and they speak english and they don't need to be pandered to um and that's because that's how you end up with ridiculous jill biden moments the sea say broadway and like which which looks like it was a scene from veep which was maybe one of my favorite things of the year 2021 so far um all we have to do is tell these communities look these are our principles this is why we think they'll make your life better we're not here to promise you things we're not here to lie to you and we're certainly not going to pander to you or tell you that you're a victim how do you like that i think that's a pretty good message frankly and it's an extremely honest one and i think people appreciate that i think i think people are are starting to react to this to this left-wing notion that you should you should be divided according to your race or gender or preferred gender or whatever it is i i think this is driving people a little bit crazy because it is very anti-american um and so you know just some honesty from our side um um probably frankly it goes a long way and and if the tone is right i don't think the message needs to change all that much i just think often times it's just the tone it goes it goes a really long way um and maybe and again i see that because i i'm in inner city i mean i'm right now i'm inside the loop in houston that's my district so it goes all the way down to rice university i've got these you know i've got all sorts of different types of um constituents and it can get somewhat rural out in the northeast and so you know i have to appeal to everybody and and i think there's i think there's ways to do that i don't know that we're that far off i think we're getting better i'm optimistic is maybe what i'm trying to say i think we have more reason to be optimistic now than maybe we did a while ago um despite some of the challenges we've had over the last few months um yeah i mean i i it's probably a subject for a whole other podcast i am less optimistic because of uh you know from where i sit outside of a lot of this stuff and maybe i'm too much in a bubble and too too concerned with my intraconservative you know egg headery and what i see happening at places like the claremont institute and other places um and what i see sort of with some of my colleagues at fox about sort of embracing a a kind of identity politics for white people that i find very disturbing but i hope you're right and and just to bring it first circle because i actually i do have to go and i have another call i have a thing i have to get to but um the point you were making you know where you're describing your district is being diverse and having everything from the city to sort of semi-rural and all that the first part of our conversation we were talking about the instructed delegate versus the trustee envision of leadership and i would argue particularly given how big congressional districts have gotten vis-a-vis where the founders wanted them to be and i'm in favor of expanding the house of representatives that if you have a diverse district you almost have to be the trustee kind of leader um because you're going to have people in your district on different sides of the issue and sometimes one group is going to be right and sometimes the other group is going to be right and you have to make that call about who is right or maybe both of them are wrong i mean i can tell you i'm not a fan of populism i would i would i don't give money to politicians but like i would be very tempted to take out my checkbook if i saw a politician on the left or the right speaking to a cheering crowd that was chanting at him and saying you're great and you're awesome and then it chanted some sort of slogan of advice about something and the politician responded i'll take your opinion under advisement because um i i just think that that's what we we need more statesmanship um and less sort of my congressman or my my politician is a remote control for my grievances um kind of leadership and i think you get that and um and i appreciate it but we need a lot more of it it seems to me yeah well i mean i think trustee is the preferred uh option for sure somebody who exhibits their own judgment just explain why you're doing it obviously you fall you know you run on a certain set of principles and so you have an obligation to abide by those sets of principles i i label conservatism as look yes we end up on certain policy platforms but conservatism is much more about process it is much more about a set of limiting principles that that that from which you derive a framework for solving problems that's conservatism we need to remember that and so that allows us some wiggle room but it's anchored it's anchored and that buoy moves around a little bit see progressives have no such anchor that's i think that's the danger of progressivism doesn't mean we don't listen to them sometimes they point out things like hey you know what i think it's good for everybody to have health care that's not a crazy thing to point out i'm not going to like i'm not going to say oh you commies no but but let us solve it because why we'll solve it with any on a set of limiting principles that is better um i don't think the house of representatives should be bigger i think it's too big i can't imagine more people up there so you just keep those ideas to yourself buddy that's too much all right to be continued on that all right dan this was fun um i'm sure we have a lot of things we could circle back and talk about but this was this was great to do thanks for coming on and thanks for having me on right because this is this is some double whatever yeah we're both hey man yeah it was a lot of fun but we should do it more appreciate it jonah absolutely

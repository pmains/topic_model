miss mace thank you mr chairman and first of all i want to thank everyone all of our witnesses this afternoon for being on this panel and sticking around and spending much of your day and answering our questions being a freshman on the transportation infrastructure committee i've learned a lot today and a lot leading up to the testimony um first i want to thank mr konar for his testimony and pleased to learn that as an industry that you all have adapted and largely in response to tax incentives and utilizing those to sell lower carbon intensity alternatives to gasoline and diesel and being innovative and we have many innovators who are on our panel today and and all those this also echoes the comments we heard earlier today by mr hernick and who said that federal policy the federal policy playbook should first and foremost really harness the power of free markets and you really were speaking my language i want to turn to mr allen who's on here today and i wanted to turn to you next um really excited to see the innovation of proterra and what you're doing not only in the state of south carolina my understanding is that your company in greenville that your location there is expanding you're looking to hire employees particularly during a really challenging time for many businesses and industries in my in my hometown of charleston south carolina we have six electron electric buses and our goal is to have 32 by the year 2022 and i learned today that it's not just tesla that's creating batteries uh like for electric vehicles and battery technology but proterra also um is being very innovative and i appreciate and commend your your your leadership and your company's leadership on on that technology oftentimes the government uh when we're looking to be innovative can inhibit innovation through heavy-handed regulation and picking winners and losers through different types of programs or funding mechanisms are there some areas that you could talk to where the government could potentially get out of the way or where we might be holding up growth and development for the industry going forward so that we can create better next-gen technologies and a need for batteries for vehicles buses and the like uh thank you very much congresswoman we we have been in in south carolina greenville specifically since 2010 uh we love being there we love our workforce uh they're just incredibly dedicated hardworking people and i enjoy spending my time there as much as i can also and in addition those are our buses with our battery technology that you're experiencing uh in charleston right now so we're very proud of that also in terms of how uh we can work with with the government i would say from a you know from a manufacturing and development standpoint the government doesn't get in the way of what we're trying to do we have you know a number of training programs in concert with government agencies and local community colleges to get our people trained and we're very proud of where that is i think the biggest thing that could help uh to accelerate this industry really is on the demand side as i've stated earlier and have the the government uh help agencies begin the transformation you know there's about 400 transit agencies uh in north america today and i believe less than 200 of those have their first electric vehicle so i think it would be great for the government to continue to help agencies move towards electrification and then again to incentivize domestic supply chain and provide incentives through the atvm program that would apply to our industry would be great and then the third would be support fleet electrification and primarily this is on municipal fleets and the school bus transformation to electrification i think those three areas the government surpri supports today and i think a a continued focus there and acceleration would be uh wonderful for our country thank you thank you and my my last questions we only have about a minute left we really would go to anybody on the panel today and learning more about electric vehicles across the board obviously there's cart before the horse to develop electric vehicles you've got to then have charging stations all around and and there seems to be some disparity in terms of what it costs maybe to put an electric a charging station and a residence like at somebody's home in your driveway or in your garage versus maybe at a c store or a gas station or a restaurant or some other commercial location i don't know if there's anyone with the few moments we have left that can kind of talk to that a little bit for those who might be watching congresswoman uh if i if i if i may answer that uh at least a little bit there is a there is a substantial difference between uh charging side communities as opposed to charging on the highway when you have time the cost of the charging stations which are level two chargers is not very much but when you're looking to charge things in 20 30 40 minutes then the cost and the infrastructure needs expand substantially so um you know and and it could be as much as 10 10 plus times um when you're putting in these dc fast chargers so that's just to give you a little bit of uh perspective but we're happy to follow up with it with that later if you thank you thank you mr chairman

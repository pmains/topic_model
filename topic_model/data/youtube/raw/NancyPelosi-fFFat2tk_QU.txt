your subject she takes leadership on congresswoman eleanor holmes norton a senior and respected member of the committee thank you very much leader pelosi and yes and i have a vote in this committee and i called for a vote when women when our witness sandra fluke was excluded it's important to remember how the hearing occurred in the first place the hearing arose out of a controversy that had two sides two compelling sides religious liberty and reproductive freedom by the time the hearing had been held had been called we are fortunate that the administration had worked a compromise that in fact allows women to receive their contraceptive insurance while at the same time recognizing the religious uh concerns of religiously affiliated institutions such as universities and hospitals who under the accommodation do not have to pay at all for contraceptives which are now which are to be received through the insurance company and have no involvement with contraceptives this is very important to bear in mind because in my more than 20 years in the house of representatives i have seen a compromise that worked out a issue of such importance to both sides as favorably as this compromise did the committee appeared to want to exploit the religious side of the issue by excluding the only witness that the democrats that the democrats requested sandra fluke was essentially defined out of last week's hearing in defining her out of the hearing and having a hearing about only one side of a clearly two-sided issue the majority managed to define out most american women the silent majority representative represented by sandra fluke was not at the table last week i am very pleased and madam leader that you have convened us here so that the concerns of women can be heard through their representative sandra fluke this morning i thank you very much and

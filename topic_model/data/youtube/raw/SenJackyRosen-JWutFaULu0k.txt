I'm one of the authors of the Broadband section of the bipartisan infrastructure law including the middle mile Broadband deployment Act so I want to ensure that we meet the Law's goals Nevada is home to vibrant rural communities like Ely Lovelock and Pahrump where residents are really counting on the new infrastructure law to bring long-awaited high-speed Broadband to our state Broadband access is not just a Communications issue it's an economic issue it's a Workforce issue it's a public safety issue and it's a health care issue and that's why I'm so severely disappointed by the recent Broadband Maps released by the FCC which vastly overstate current coverage in rural Nevada Broadband funding it is directly tied to these Maps so we need to get this process right that means isps must be forthcoming about where they actually serve but it also means that the FCC challenge process must accept challenges based on actual engineering and the facts on the ground not whether merely an ISP can theoretically serve a particular Community actual facts not theoretical because our constituents they are counting on us all of us to get this right and I'm going to continue to work with the FCC chairwoman until we do so

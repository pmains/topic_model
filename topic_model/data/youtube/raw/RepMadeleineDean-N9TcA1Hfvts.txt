at the race for 2020 pennsylvania of course a critical battleground state in next month's presidential election in recent weeks several headlines have been warning of the tug of war over ballot counting that could drag out the election result saying the state has emerged as a tipping point and could become the center of election chaos joining me now pennsylvania congresswoman madeline dean a democratic member of the house judiciary and financial services committee welcome back to the broadcast always good to see you let's get to the washington post which as you know points out that the battle for pennsylvania's 20 electoral votes could well continue beyond election day with a growing list of balloting disputes and lawsuits setting the stage for that if the race is close for a contested election reminiscent of the florida drama that transfixed the nation after the 2000 election what are you hearing from local officials and is there any serious concern about chaos well thank you for having me on alex good to be with you and what i've been saying is pennsylvania i believe will be the keystone state again i think pennsylvania will deliver very strongly for vice president biden and senator kamala harris i am not concerned over chaos with the exception of what this president might try to do but i have been out in my district people are enthusiastic they are asking for mail-in ballots in record numbers almost quarter million right here in montgomery county requests for mail and ballots it's overwhelmingly uh democrats who are doing that but people know that number one we have secured our ballot system uh here in montgomery county they invested more than a million dollars of pairs money to secure our electoral process so what i hope to tell people is vote everybody needs to come out and vote whether you do it by mail-in or in person uh please come out and vote be secure and safe your your vote will be counted but also know that we won't know the tally on the night of the election but that's okay our system is built for this uh but i'm very uh secure i know that pennsylvania uh will deliver very strongly for vice president biden to become our next president listen you you may have more accurate information but let me suggest to you what the new york times is reporting about the state of pennsylvania in terms of just voter registration since june republicans up 135 619 democrats up 57 985 that would suggest there's a lot of republican push right now a lot of energy are you hearing about that just anecdotally i i have read that anecdotally but what i also have seen is a sustained voter registration that was has been very high among democrats not just in the last few weeks or a couple of months but over the course of the last two years and beyond democrats are registering in record numbers also in pennsylvania just to give you some stats on the request for mail and ballots in pennsylvania 1.7 1.7 million i want to make sure i have that right 1.7 million democrats have requested mail-in ballots that compares with 500 000 republicans requesting mail-in ballots so i think there's high high enthusiasm among democrats uh to show up and to turn out right here in my own county montgomery county 200 almost 250 thousand democrat ballots have been requested uh 228 of them have gone through the post office already 52 000 are back in the hands of our election board uh commissioner ken lawrence is overseeing it i think very very well i do think while there is an increase in registration among republicans recently i think you're going to see extraordinary voter turnout here in montgomery county among democrats i love that you were factually checking all of your numbers as you were reading them off to me so thank you 100 and i appreciate that very much particularly on this broadcast let's get to coronavirus relief negotiations you've house speaker nancy pelosi who's criticized the white house's latest 1.8 trillion dollar relief offer but your colleague ro cono tweeted this people in need can't wait until february 1.8 trillion is significant and more than twice obama's stimulus it will allow biden to start with infrastructure obama won in 2008 by doing the right thing on tarp instead of what was expedient make a deal and put the ball in mcconnell's court congresswoman what are your thoughts on this where do you stand oh i have been eager uh for a deal for the american people that's what's important so i'm disappointed that a deal hasn't been made i guess there's blame to go around everywhere but the american people deserve better republican senators the leaders in the republican senate have been very difficult to deal with and of course they can't even deal with their own president the president has zigzagged on relief to the american public he's a very transactional man he didn't want to send any more relief to the american people who are suffering with 220 000 americans dead until it looked like it was politically important that he send relief i believe and i know that speaker pelosi has been negotiating day after day after day in good faith but she's negotiating with a very unstable uh president now take a look at what uh general kelly is quoted as saying did you read this today that he general john kelly has told his friends that president trump is the most flawed person he's ever known but the depths of his dishonesty just astounding to me the dishonesty the transactional nature of every relationship pathetic according to the general that's what the american people are struggling under a transactional president who serves only himself not us i'll keep fighting for a deal for the american people yeah i have to say i was pretty stunned when i read that uh by john kelly who heretofore has been pretty pretty quiet about his time in the white house but um pretty powerful statement he made there as are all of yours thank you so much congresswoman good to see you

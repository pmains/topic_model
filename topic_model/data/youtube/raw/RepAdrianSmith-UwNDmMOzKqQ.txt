Thank You mr. Speaker I rise today to recognize the community of North Platte Nebraska for its many decades of service to our men and women in uniform earlier this week the North Platte canteen came together once again to host more than 700 Army National Guard soldiers based in Arkansas who were returning from a training mission in Wyoming not having eaten a hot meal in days the North Platte canteen traces its history to World War two when the community came together to feed more than six million servicemen and women as they traveled by train across the country the North Platte canteen was organized this time to feed more than 700 soldiers like I said and transported they were transported on 21 buses over two days and these experiences included homemade birthday cakes for those celebrating which is that time-honored tradition at the canteen I would like to thank Lisa Burke Muriel Clark Amanda Connick Courtney Victor and Michelle Thomas at the North Platte Lincoln County Visitors Bureau who coordinated what became a whole community effort just with just a few days notice this is really what Nebraska's support for our troops is all about thank you Mr Speaker I yield back

Thank You dr. Esper I appreciate you being here appreciate your testimony and your willingness to serve both in the past and in the future I wish you well I have to ask today about two items involving my home state of Mississippi where we manufacture helicopters and also uniforms and I mentioned this because it involves the industrial base but also involves items that our troops need the first one is the Lakota training helicopter which Airbus makes in Columbus Mississippi now in 2015 there was an award of Lakota helicopters a contract dispute ensued and those helicopters are being held up pending the court case in 2017 the Appropriations Committee appropriated 428 lakotas a separate matter entirely and they gave clear directive language that instructed the army to purchase the 28 lakotas and I brought this up in a previous hearing with acting Secretary of the army Robert Speer as to why this clear language by the appropriation committee had passed by the Congress had not been followed and he said something to the effect it's all involved in a court case well that's not true there are 16 Lakotas from 2015 involved in a court case subsequent to that this Congress ordered the army to purchase 28 Lakotas and that is not being held up in a court case it sounds like an excuse to me I want you to be aware of the detrimental impacts this is what situation is having on on the industrial base but also on army pilot training and I want to ask you do you believe that the army secretary is required to follow clear and directive language expressed in legislation yes senator I do okay are you familiar with this case I'm I am a little familiar with the case yes sir okay well have I got it wrong at all senator I I trust you have your facts accurately okay well if confirmed will you do all in your power to expedite the contracting actions required and to issue a production contract as outlined in the congressionally enacted and signed into law FY Defense Appropriations Act yes Center if confirmed I will certainly look into this issue work it I want to work closely with your office to resolve it as quickly as okay well we really do need to to resolve it now the other thing involves uniforms and treating the uniforms with insecticides we've been doing this in Mississippi for years the manufacturer of the uniform then they put the insecticide out now someone in their wisdom in the Department of the army decided that we should treat the fabric first and then cut it and sew it into a uniform I can tell you the people working at the plants don't like this because obviously you've got a chemically treated piece of fabric you're cutting it and it gets out into into the air that they breathe and and becomes a problem I cannot fathom why the army would want to change and efficient and proven process that leaves no environmental waste and that's to make the uniform then treat it if confirmed will you get somebody to look into this issue and get back to us and try to make some sense out of that yes sir for sure all right good I

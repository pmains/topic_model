thank you it's been a pleasure to rejoin the committee after a decade of absence I believe that science will transform our lives even more this century than it did last century if someone's describing what the future will be thirty years from now and they paint a picture that you think looks like a science fiction movie they might be right they might be wrong but if somebody paints a picture that doesn't look like a science fiction movie you know they're wrong we're going to be living in a science fiction movie we just don't know which one yet there is an issue something in the world more explosive than nuclear fusion and that is intelligence after all it is intelligence that allows us to develop nuclear fusion we now have two groups of scientists working to develop new levels of intelligence they are the computer engineers on the one hand and the bio engineers on the other the last time a new higher level of intelligence appeared on this planet is when our ancestors said hello to the Neanderthal we then said goodbye to the Neanderthal as we develop intelligent computers we will find them useful tools as we find them useful tools we will use those tools to develop faster and smarter computers it is we had a hearing in this room in 2003 in which experts said that computers would reach human intelligence so within 25 years I think they might have been a little premature might be 30 might be 35 years from 2003 which means next decade or the decade after there are those who say that even if a computer is intelligent and malevolent it's in a box and can't affect the war but I believe there are those of our species who would sell hands to the devil in return for a good stock tip what I do draw solace from is that computers may be intelligent but that does not mean they'll be self-aware or ambitious by ambitious I mean a desire to protect themselves expand and affect the world so that they can do that my pet mouse my computer doesn't seem to care whether I turn it off or disassemble it a mouse does that leads us to the next form of enhanced intelligence and that is what the bio engineers are doing they can start with human DNA and we're LARM by what happened in China where the CRISPR technology was used to create a quote designer baby and they could also start with that the DNA of some other mammal DNA is inherently ambitious those microbes that didn't seek to replicate and survive didn't sow some you could view this as a contacts contest between the bio engineers and the computer engineers to see we will be first in developing super intelligence will our successor species be carbon-based or silicon based what should this committee do most immediate is the area of artificial intelligence we fund it we develop it we authorize it the US government is critical to it and as we develop smarter and smarter computers we should direct one or two percent of the effort to preventing self-awareness ambition self initiative and autonomy this should be done both by requiring that those who do research in AI have separate studies focused on that and build it in otherwise they'll pay a lip service to this issue but they'll focus on the immediate issue thing they're trying to do when it comes to genetic engineering should prohibit any effort to increase the intelligence of any life-form I don't care if they create a fatter cow or a leaner cow I do not want to eat a smarter cow let alone what can be done to create levels of intelligence either above that of a human being or just below finally we had hearings in foreign affairs that I chaired a law last decade on using the non-proliferation act as a plan to deal with this internationally but I think that I think that the US has to develop its own standards before will be effective in dealing with the world I share the Asia subcommittee now and I talked facetiously with a Chinese Foreign Ministry official I told him that the computers that displace humankind will be created in California not Shanghai therefore America wins no I don't I I don't reach that conclusion it was a facetious one so I look forward to working on this committee to make sure that as we move forward with these in two important areas of scientific development artificial intelligence and genetic engineering that we have the appropriate controls and that we do not create a replacement species without even thinking about it now yield back that's okay I'm in politics you can't believe it I get called so thank you Gerald Johnson and ranking member Lucas I appreciate you very much opening up the process for legislation of those that are not on the committee to be able to address issues that will certainly impact all of us here at home since nineteen the 1960's u.s. has dominated space exploration and has excelled in aeronautical innovation my state of Colorado has played a critical role in the six of this serving as a home to one of the largest aerospace industries in the country in my office we consistently meet with stakeholders who have engaged us in the newer issue of space

gentlemen you all have raised some important issues and and dr. Strauss senator Cantwell and I were just commenting that you kept looking at the two of us Oregon and Washington so we understand what what the stakes are in terms of storm surges and tsunamis and my judgment with respect to some of these key questions about rising sea levels also now factors in the fact that i went to fukushima last week about week or so ago and of course there they had the triple whammy they had the earthquake they had the tsunami which destroyed most of the sites back up you know generators for the plants even one of their emergency battery banks then we had the hydrogen explosions as well now dr. Strauss you noted in your testimony something that I think really hasn't gotten a lot of debate and it certainly should after Fukushima and with the latest evidence and that is that a rising sea level raises the launch pad for storm surges and it is going to raise the launch pad for tsunamis as well now what I'm thinking about on the basis of what I saw a little bit ago at Fukushima unit for you know in in particular particularly damage one just the inventory of the essentially the hottest you know materials you have another earthquake tsunami kind of rupture with these spent fuel you know rods in these pools the spent fuel rods or going to melt and catch fire that's going to release a lot of radioactivity and all of this is compounded by the testimony that you gave essentially this morning with respect to the rising sea level raising this you know launch pad so I believe the the question that i'd like to ask and maybe start with with you doc dr. Barry we've got a lot of nuclear plants located along the coast all over the world because of the need for you know cooling water on the basis of these rising sea levels and also what was seen at Fukushima when I've tried to outline just in a minute or so is it your view that it's time for us to do some rethinking with respect to the location of vulnerable plants plants that are near to catastrophic you know flooding that was for example caused by a tsunami that dr. Strauss all but stared down senator Cantwell and I am kind of talking about this is not abstract issues for us in the Pacific Northwest these are very very real so what is your thinking with respect to that that point dr. Barry Florida has the I think unique distinction of having two nuclear power stations on barrier islands and barrier islands are by definition fragile environments there were good reasons to locate them there but as a colleague of mine says three feet of sea level rise would be a problem for turkey point for example that that nuclear power station because turkey point went out of went out of commission for a few hours with Hurricane Andrew and the storm surge associated with that 383 extra feet and with a storm that was a longer duration Hurricane Andrew was very fierce but it went through very quickly I I would recommend very very importantly that the NRC begin to look very closely at the implications of sea level rise on our nuclear are no nuclear facilities and our other energy facilities that are near the coast one last question if I might for you dr. Strauss can you amplify a little bit on this question of the rising sea level serving as a launch pad because for us in the Pacific Northwest that is going to be a very real issue and I and I juxtapose what I saw a unit for and and these as you know these facilities are right next to the there's what amounts to a makeshift bag of rocks it constitutes a seawall and it just takes your breath away at the thought of sort of what you've outlined in terms of rising sea levels tsunamis triggered by Earth's earthquakes I mean give us a little bit more analysis of the implications of a elevated launch pad and what that means in terms of trying to think through public policies to deal with it Thank You senator I lived in Seattle for a couple of years in Portland for a summer maybe that's why I was directing my days let me start with something a little different quickly the Pacific Northwest seems to get an enormous earthquake magnitude about nine-point-oh every 300 to 500 years the last one was in 1701 thing that those earthquakes do besides creating a lot of direct damage is lower the elevation of the land sometimes dramatically very suddenly the forecast would be for maybe one or two meter drop at the next nine-point-oh earthquake along portions of the coast so while a lot of it you know a lot of areas in the United States are slowly subsiding that's not very much the case in the Pacific Northwest and fact parts are lifting up slowly because the tension between tectonic plates but the earthquake is when that tension relieves the plate drops so you could have places that are suddenly a meter lower which is another way of ranging raising the launch pad once you get past the damage from the quake the other point is that all along the Pacific sea level rise and climate change is making a big difference is along the Pacific sea level rise is converting century storms in two decades storms or annual storms faster than anyplace else in the United States and that's because well you don't have hurricanes so the difference today between a one year storm and a storm that happens only once in a hundred years is relatively small and because that difference is relatively small a small amount of sea level rise converts what's today a once a century storm into an annual storm fairly quickly now if you have steep slopes it may not be a great problem but in flatter areas are where there are critical facilities it is and so what all that means is that in on the Pacific coast you'll start to see water in places where it wasn't more quickly than in other places my time is up but i want to thank you for for your work and your scientific expertise you know dr. Strauss I think this is going to help provide a wake-up call for us to put in place policies to start dealing with us and I thank you

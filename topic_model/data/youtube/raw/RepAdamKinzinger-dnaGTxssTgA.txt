that we're joined now by committee member and illinois republican congressman adam kinzinger congressman thanks to uh thanks for being here so you hear cnn is reporting that the inspector general for the department of homeland security knew about the missing secret service text messages over a year before alerting your committee seven months earlier than secret service officials previously stated does that make any sense to you it doesn't and you know it's all new to me too we found out as a committee as you well know have reported about these missing texts not that long ago we got a letter from the ig we talked to him we had no idea that it went as far back and you think about you know this committee has been operable for a year at least now we've had staff working hard on this we could have had a year of lead time to get to the answer and now you know we're down to however many months to get to the answers of this it doesn't make a lot of sense why the ig wouldn't tell us i'm sure he's going to have to answer to that and of course this whole missing text thing is is crazy nuts and you know the american people not just our committee but maybe the american people through our committee deserve that answer because it's the law to keep that stuff particularly if you're the secret service and it was like one of the more dangerous days since 9 11 that you've been part of yeah i mean just as a day in u.s history the idea that you everything wouldn't be preserved is i mean is it possible they were lost to incompetence was it intentional a cover-up do you have any sense yeah i mean look it's certainly possible that it was you know a scheduled migration nobody cared enough to take the action or you know they're just like whatever i mean i don't want to make an accusation without the evidence which is why it's so frustrating that we're just finding out about this but it is mysterious to say the least and you know i think first off let's say the secret the sacred service knew this over a year ago they knew that the preservation request had gone out from the other committees not the january 6 committee yet um and yet they never alerted the committee hey look we accidentally deleted them and if you did actually delete them probably best to get out in front of it instead it appears that it was covered up until finally the ig tells us so you know i don't know if it's cut trying to cover up gross mismanagement or if there's something more to it but we deserve the answer and i guarantee you there's somebody somewhere in the secret service that knows the answer to that that should come forward and talk to us and the washington post reported as you know the text messages from former acting homeland security secretary chad wolf and deputy secretary acting deputy secretary ken cuccinelli are also missing for this key period leading up to january 6. sources telling cnn both of them recently sat for interviews with your committee i know obviously you can't get into specifics from what they may have said but does it make sense to you now that their texts are missing too no i mean look i without getting too much into it again i think you had played a sound bite by mick mulvaney when you leave government if you have a government cell phone that stays with government and then the government has the stuff they're supposed to do to preserve the records of that particularly again i mean we're talking about we had just gone through january 6th so it's not like you know hey i'm i'm out i got out of service prior to january 6. i didn't think there was anything of importance you went through that process so again you know there's so much mystery here and this is why it's important for the committee even as we look at an interim report to keep this investigation plugging to find out these loose ends of things we can because look it's not about the committee it's not about you know this is about what the american people deserve we live in a democracy we don't live in a dictatorship uh people deserve answers and they deserve transparency yeah the truth i mean that's all people i mean that's what people deserve we've seen a number of other former top trump officials cabinet members sit for interviews with your committee more reportedly negotiations the former trump members of the the administration have they've often obviously claimed executive privilege over conversations they had with the president can you say if any have been more forthcoming about discussions they've had among themselves for example about invoking the 25th amendment or are those also things they might claim privilege over well we're starting to get to the bottom of some questions on that we've again we've had interviews we'll have more interviews scheduled in the future um so you know i i don't i can't get into too much of what we know or what we're hoping to find out or anything along that line but look i think with what we did last thursday in our hearing or maybe i guess a week ago now um you know we put out that letter by eugene scalia where he was basically to the president saying you need to speak to the cabinet you need to come in front of the cabinet that to me and this is just my opinion this isn't from anything else besides my opinion that to me was sort of a warning that you need to come and talk to the cabinet because uh we could invoke the 25th amendment because you have to come up in front of us so i always thought that was pretty interesting didn't get a ton of attention but it's certainly something that's worth looking at as we heard house minority leader kevin mccarthy was asked today about conversations on january 6 between him and cassidy hutchinson obviously she testified under oath he said he didn't remember them he denies even watching the former president speech the rally that day uh what do you make of those comments i mean look i don't trust a thing kevin mccarthy says i'll be honest with you he's sometime about a year or two ago he made the decision that his only goal is to become speaker of the house and he'll do whatever he has to do and he thinks that siding with the insurrectionist is the way to get there maybe it will make him speaker i don't know but i know this cassidy hutchinson testified under oh she is extremely credible all these anonymous sources that have tried to discredit her have not first off none of them have come in and spoken on the record on under oath and secondarily they've all been discredited so look i know this for a fact cassidy hutchinson maintained a lot of outreach to members of congress so it is not inconceivable that she would be the one kevin would call yeah and it sounded like by based on what she said that he had been talking to her throughout the week because he was accusing her of lying to him about what she had said previously congressman kinzinger yeah well let's say real quick i mean the idea that she would just come up with that story and make it up is ludacris yeah uh congressman i really appreciate your time thank you been quite a big week

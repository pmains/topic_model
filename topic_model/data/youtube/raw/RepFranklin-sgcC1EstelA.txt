thank you mr johnson madam speaker i rise today on behalf of families who will enjoy thanksgiving with their loved ones next week this american tradition is an opportunity to give thanks for all our many blessings yet through no fault of their own millions of hard-working families are struggling to count their blessings this year thanks to liberal policies enacted by the biden administration and congressional democrats inflation is soaring gas prices have spiked more than 50 percent and supply chain disruptions are leaving store shelves empty the cost of thanksgiving dinner this year will be the highest in history and it will cost more for folks to drive or fly to spend their family or spend their holidays with loved ones american families are hurting my democrat colleagues and their liberal elite mouthpieces in the media claim to be champions of the poor and the working class yet an nbc correspondent claims it's a dirty little secret that americans can afford to pay more for their groceries because they save money when they were trapped in their homes during the covet pandemic she also had the audacity to say that because more than half of americans are invested in the stock market and it's been doing well then most people are actually better off now how out of touch can she be first clearly she has zero regard for the half the country that isn't fortunate enough to have a stock portfolio second good luck trying to eat your 401k for thanksgiving those are designed for retirement so tax penalties for early withdrawals are harsh here's the real dirty little secret she knows that but she's so beholden to the left that she's willing to provide them free cover washington post and bloomberg op-ed writers are telling us we should lower our expectations and live more like europeans by simply getting used to the idea of empty store shelves these out of touch elites are channeling a let them eat cake mentality while american families are suffering recent elections have shown that americans reject these attempts to fundamentally change our nation from a prosperous environmental country into a suffering socialist regime inflation intrusive government regulations and overarching policies or overreaching policies have left american families with less money and limited buying power no american should ever have to lower their expectations while living in the most prosperous country in the world as americans we're blessed to live in a country where we're free to pursue economic prosperity even during difficult times many of the economic challenges faced by american families today were created by the policies of an out of touch liberal ruling class yet we stand on the brink of ramming through the largest and most expensive tax and spend initiative in history it reminds me the final scene in the movie thelma louise when the league characters drive their car off a cliff rather than face the consequences of their actions democrat party leaders are willing to figuratively figuratively drive our country off the cliff if that's what it takes to pass the buildback broke program in an electric car i'm sure as we prepare to celebrate thanksgiving i ask my democrat colleagues and media elites to take a long hard look at what their policies are doing to working-class americans just say no thank you mr johnson i yield back my friend

we continue following our top story today the brutal attack on house Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband at their San Francisco home joining us now to talk about this is Congressman Brad Sherman representative of California's 30th District here in Southern California Congressman thank you very much for joining us uh must have been shocking to hear about this but I gather you may not have been all together surprised that this took place well I mean to hear that this the assailant was shouting where's Nancy took me back to January 6th when members of the mob were chanting where's Nancy and in both cases they had every every intention of uh of book Hilliard and uh this Society is is is being pulled apart we've accepted the idea of disrupting City Council meetings I don't know if we've accepted it but we see it uh we see uh uh people at uh elected officials uh homes um where they are are scaring at least family members um we just see a heightened level of of violent rhetoric and uh and sometimes violent action as you mentioned there has been an increase in threats to lawmakers recently yet security detail doesn't protect family members even spouses when members of Congress are not with them so many lawmakers are spending their own money for security detail do you think there needs to be some changes made well uh the speaker of the house has a security detail members of the house do not um I they they bought the rised us to at least you know get an ADT system at our homes uh and uh it's uh it's tough to do the job uh without being among people um I talk to people at Ralphs uh that's my job and uh you can't I they couldn't afford to give me a security detail and even if they could uh I got to talk to people at Ralphs what's been your experience with these sorts of threats with these sorts of problems aside from obviously the glaring example of January 6th have you had to deal with these sorts of things where you get calls or or emails or things like that that threaten you or your family far less than Pelosi but uh you see this this attacker and unfortunately uh many of the others who commit violence are motivated by extreme anti-Semitism this guy was saying that Hitler did nothing wrong and um uh being a Jewish member of Congress I get more of course anti-semitic violent threats than other people who don't know I don't happen to be Jewish so uh I get a bit more than my share but certainly nothing uh compared to what some of the nationally famous members get and preservient speaker well Congressman Sherman how are you and your fellow lawmakers ensuring your own safety here in California well um the police know where I live I know where my family lives uh and uh uh it's uh aside from that it's just exercise and vigilance and uh hope that uh that most people you know look the vast majority of people are are good all the time and uh this is just a risk that you you have to live with and as I say if you're if you're the speaker you live with a much greater risk and uh this this illustrates uh that although she has protection that protection doesn't extend to her family wow all right Congressman Brad Sherman thank you very much for joining us have a good weekend thank you thank you so much

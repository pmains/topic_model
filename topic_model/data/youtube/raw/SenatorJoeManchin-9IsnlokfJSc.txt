i want to extend a warm welcome and thanks to our distinguished witnesses today uh who have all taken time out of your important duties for your companies and academic institutions to help educate all of us in cyber subcommittee the senate armed services committee on the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning technology to the critical missions of offensive and defensive operations in cyber space artificial intelligence and machine learning are extremely technically complex topics so i would highly encourage our witnesses to provide as many real world examples as they can what we're saying is bring it down to our level okay all the way in the garden might have to uh and your answers and simplify technical concepts as as much as humanly possible for the benefit of the members and the public that are viewing at this hearing i cannot overstate our need for ai application and cyberspace operations and i believe our witnesses prepared statements will eloquently express your sentiments there's a huge shortfall of technically trained cybersecurity personnel across the country and government and industry alike this shortage is likely to continue to worsen especially as cyber threats intensify in scope and scale keeping up with the demand of capacity in this field will therefore require massive gains and workforce productivity which practically speaking means automation by computers a tech ai technology compared this automation and productivity growth not to belabor the point but china has four times our population there is no way we are going to win a competition in manpower or woman power or person power that can be dedicated to an important mission computer-driven automation powered by superior software innovation is the only option that we have as dr moore wrote in his prepared statement with ai the work of 5 000 people can become the equivalent of 50 000 people additionally ai can discover subtle signals and patterns of malicious cyber attacks in a sea of noise better than faster than and better and faster than humans ai can also help to automate actions to contain and eradicate cyber penetrations commercial computer aided intrusion detection technologies that are widely used today already process enormous quantities of data provide alerts to human analysis analysts of suspicious actions and anonymous uh events but these products generate enormous numbers of false positives false alarms if you will so many in fact our analysts are overwhelmed and cannot possibly investigate them all this is why we fail to find the genuine needles in the haystack even when they may be noted by our current security event management systems ai however will increase the rate of detection of real intrusions while lowering the false alarms ai in short can enable our cyber forces to achieve scale and speed and defensive cyber operations the flip side of this is that ai can also tremendously benefit the offensive side of cyber operations just as ai algorithms can scan our own networks for vulnerabilities they can discover vulnerabilities and attack vectors and adversary networks that we can exploit make no mistake our adversaries will capitalize on this technology using ai to power attacks on our networks as well as increasing their ability to detect our intrusions on their networks and to respond quickly we can use the russian solarwinds attack to illustrate the potential danger the solarwinds software supply chain operation compromised thousands of networks but the russians could only manually exploit a limited number of the targets they infected however the use of ai technology in the future will enable russia or china to take advantage of every target that they compromise it would be disastrous if we fail to be ready yet while the defense department is developing ai applications for business efficiencies and war fight support warfighter support i fear we are not moving the necessary speed in cyberspace commercial cyber security companies have for a number of years been developing and applying ai technology to their products and department of defense is benefiting from that investment microsoft's defender product is a good example but direct dod investment in cyber ai is lagging i look forward to hearing recommendations from our witnesses on what we could be investing and where we need to focus our intention so i turned down to my friend senator rounds for his remarks thank you senator

bianco and team captain tim elko ole miss beat one team after another first arizona and miami in the regional then southern miss in the hattiesburg super regional then auburn and arkansas in the

josh malletts gave up just three runs securing a 10-3 victory the decisive game two was a lot closer for the first five innings it was a pitcher's duel between ole miss's hunter elliot of tupelo mississippi and cade horton of norman oklahoma the bats finally got going for ole miss in the sixth when jacob gonzalez hit a solo home run the sooners quickly answered by knocking in two runs making it 2-1 in oklahoma but in the 8th inning ole miss tied things up with hits by t.j mccants justin bench and jake gonzalez and scored two additional runs on wild pitches making it four to two in the top

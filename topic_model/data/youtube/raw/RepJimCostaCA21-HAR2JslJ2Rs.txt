um of the Mongols who became your citizens it's estimated there are about 5,000 still alive today that were part of the secret guerilla units the SGU that are very proud of their service they're in their 70s 80s and they brought this to my attention ten years ago when general vang Pao was still alive their leader who has since passed away that wasn't there something that we could do to fittingly honor them for their service to our country and so we thought we would take the model that came from the Filipino soldiers who fought with the US soldiers during World War two and those Filipino soldiers who helped liberate the Philippines later on were given the opportunity to be buried in an American Cemetery with full all honors and we thought that precedent would be appropriate for these Lao Hmong soldiers who were part of this special guerrilla unit the legislation without authorize before you that's going to be before your committee that internment in national cemeteries for all Hmong and Lao veterans who served in support of US forces in Vietnam given their dedicated service to our nation into those US citizens we think it's an appropriate honor we think they deserve it and they've earned it senator Mackowski and Congressman Paul cook and our colleague from Rhode Island Sheldon Whitehouse have together worked on this legislation we actually passed it in a omnibus package last year that was signed into law what we've discovered was is is that the definition under who became a citizen before the year 2000 and after created a glitch in terms of all those soldiers we estimate 5,000 who are still alive today that could qualify so they if they so chose would be able to have this benefit in this honor this little legislation corrects that glitch and I think it could be a part of a larger package that the committee might work on and so for that I've exceeded in my five minutes but I think it has a lot of Merit I think many of on a bipartisan basis have supported this legislation and we stand before you this afternoon to move it forward in any way that the committee thinks is fitting and appropriate I thank you dr. Dunn go ahead Thank You chairman chicano and thank you very much represent of Koster for the comments I'm familiar with the Hmong people and the situation you described I do not understand the glitch I look forward to understanding what the glitches were fixing but I applaud your efforts and and the the motivation behind them thank you thank you thank you mr. Costa for advocating on behalf of a group of people who served our country and who were allies of our country and who became part of our country and it's a giass justice long overdue and I agree with you I do believe they they've earned the recognition that you're seeking for them and the doctor none will treat it we'll look through the the conforming changes you're trying to make and your bill and we'll get through this together so thank you thank you very much and obviously we'll work with the committee in any insight that your committee and staff have as to how we can make this work in a way that the Veterans Administration can implement it so that those mala veterans who so choose to be honored will be able to have that appropriate recognition for their service to our country

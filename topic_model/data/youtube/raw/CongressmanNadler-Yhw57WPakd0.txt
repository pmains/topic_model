myself such time as I may consume John was recognized mr. speaker for more than 20 years I've been an atom and supporter of HOPWA and I share many of mr. price's concerns about the outdated formula for how hop-up funding is allocated but I cannot support this amendment the current formulas reliance on cumulative AIDS cases is problematic and does need to be updated to better reflect the new reality of the incidence of the disease mr. prices proposal while well-intended will just shift scarce resources around cutting off thousands of current beneficiaries to move the money to different parts of the country if the amendment changed the formula for new hypo funds if there were new Apple funds it would be more acceptable but the amendment would shift existing funds in which people now rely New York City is a stark example this formula change would eventually cut the city's annual hypo funding by nearly twenty-five percent that cut will translate into real people a quarter of New York is living with AIDS and currently receiving hapa support for their housing would be thrown out of their homes we are talking about people living with AIDS with hopper support being ousted from their present homes I understand that people in many areas living with AIDS need housing but Congress should be focused on growing HOPWA and expanding the number of people enrolled in the program not on throwing more people living with AIDS out of their present homes if people living with AIDS and mrs. and mr. prices district and in other districts need more hapa funding and they do Congress should provide it to them without depriving people living with AIDS in New York Atlanta in San Francisco of their existing housing rather than shifting around limited pools of money in helping homeless people in one parts of the country by creating more homelessness in another part of the country we should be increasing funding for hopper to meet the actual needs of the people living with AIDS in the United States that is why every year I offer an amendment to the T HUD appropriations bill increasing hopper funding and will continue to do so I recognize mr. price's hard work in long years of advocacy for HOPWA but I cannot support this amendment as written today i hope that going forward through regular legislative order we can identify a fair equitable formula update that does not harm current beneficiaries that is to say harm people living with AIDS because of their hopper funding in their homes today thank you i reserve the balance of my time

N DECIMATED AND UNTOLD COST. BUT I WANTED TO BEGIN WITH A QUOTE AND ENCOURAGE MY COLLEAGUES TO LISTEN TO THESE WORDS OF WARNING. QUOTE, THE TSUNAMI OF DEBT CREATED BY THE POLICIES OF THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS TO GO SOMEWHERE. BUT AS THE REST OF THE WORLD COPES WITH THE WAVES OF U.S. DEBT, WE ARE ALL IN THE SAME LEAKY BOAT. THERE ARE SO MUCH OTHER DEBT THAT OTHER NATIONS WANT TO HOLD. THE CLOSER WE ARE TO THE DAY WHEN THEY WILL NOT WANT ANYMORE. AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS, SLOWLY OR RAPIDLY, OUR INTEREST RATES WILL GO UP. THE VALUE OF THEIR FUNDS WILL DROP. WE NEED MORE AWARENESS AND UNDERSTANDING OF THIS FUNDAMENTAL THREAT TO THIS THREAT. BUT THE ROOTS LIE IN THE DISASTROUS POLICIES OF THIS ADMINISTRATION. BECAUSE THIS MASSIVE ACCUMULATION OF DEBT WAS PREDICTED AND IF FORESEEABLE AND UNNECESSARY AND RESULT OF RECKLESS DISREGARD OF THE WARNINGS THAT WERE GIVEN AND FUNDAMENTALS OF MANAGEMENT I AM VOTING AGAINST THE DEBT LIMIT INCREASE. WHO SAID THAT? NOT SPEAKER MCCARTHY OR LEADER MCCONNELL, THAT QUOTE I JUST READ YOU IS FROM JOE BIDEN HIMSELF WHEN HE WAS A SENATOR IN 2006. HE WAS HONEST, HE WOULD HAVE USED THAT SAME LANGUAGE RIGHT UP HERE LAST NIGHT BUT HE DIDN'T. OF COURSE HE WASN'T HONEST. IN ADDITION TO HIS VOCAL OPPOSITION WHEN HE WAS A SENATOR, HE JOINED SENATE DEMOCRATS IN OPPOSING CLEAN DEBT LIMIT INCREASES. IN TWOAF, HE MISSED THE VOTE. THREE TIMES AS A SENATOR, HE OPPOSED THE DEBT LIMIT INCREASE. HE IS SINGING A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TUNE NOW AND HE HEARD. PRESIDENT BIDEN'S MESSAGE WAS A MISSED OPPORTUNITY. THE COUNTRY IS IN MIRED IN CRISIS OF THE PRESIDENT'S OWN MAKING AT HOME, BORDER AND THE PRESIDENT'S RHETORIC DIDN'T MATCH THE REALITY THAT MOST AMERICANS HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING SINCE HE TOOK. JOHN ADAMS SAID FACTS ARE STUBBORN THINGS. AND THIS IS DECLINE. JUST AIR SNAPSHOT, WHEN PRESIDENT BIDEN TOOK OFFICE, WE HAD AMERICAN DOMINANCE AND LOWER AND LOWER INFLATION. BUT SINCE HE TOOK OVER TWO YEARS AGO, WE HAVE WAR THROUGH WEAKNESS AND FOREIGN ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND SKY-HIGH AND INFLATION RATE IN DECEMBER WAS 6.5%. ARE YOU BETTER OFF? NO. AND MOST AMERICANS SAY AND RESPOND TO THE POLLS THINK ARE DOING WORST OFF AND MANY OTHER RESPECTS. PRICES ARE STILL RISING, CRIME IS RISING, DRUG OVERDOSES IS RISING AND OUR LEADERSHIP LOOKS EMBARRASSED AND WEAK. REPUBLICANS URGED THEM TO CHART A NEW DIRECTION TO GET OUT OF THIS MESS AND REVERSE THE POLICIES TO ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE DECLINING STATE OF OUR COUNTRY. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? HE DIDN'T DO THAT? HE WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST AMERICAN TO DO A PRESIDENTIAL RESET. THE REALITY IS THAT FAMILIES ACROSS THIS COUNTRY AND EVERYBODY KNOWS THIS ARE STILL PAYING MORE FOR JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING INCLUDING FOOD AND GASOLINE, LIKE THAT AND RENT AND ACCORDING TO ALL THE POLLS THEY CAN FEEL IT REGARDLESS OF WHAT THIS PRESIDENT WANTS TO SAY. HERE'S WHAT WE NEED TO DO, WE NEED TO CURB THE WASTEFUL SPENDING THAT IS INCREASING PRICES. AND WE NEED TO INCREASE TAKE-HOME PAY AND NEED TO CREATE GOOD PAYING JOBS AND BRING STABILITY THROUGH PRO-GROWTH POLICIES THAT WILL ENLIVEN OUR ECONOMY. BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT THEIR PRESIDENT IS SUGGESTING. THEY SAID MORE GOVERNMENT AND MORE GOVERNMENT GROWTH AND MORE SPENDING. DOES ANYBODY THINK OUR NATIONAL DEBT IS AN ACCEPTABLE OUTCOME IN THIS YEAR'S DEBT CEILING TALKS. JOE BIDEN DIDN'T THINK THAT AT LEAST WHEN HE WAS A SENATOR. LET'S DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. PRESIDENT BIDEN COULD HAVE STARTED LAST NIGHT BUT HE DIDN'T AND IT WAS A MISSED OPPORTUNITY AND I THINK IT WAS SHAMEFUL. AN

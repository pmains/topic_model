>>> TONIGHT, THE JANUARY 6th  SELECT COMMITTEE HAS ISSUED ITS  FIRST SUBPOENAS, TARGETING FOUR  TOP TRUMP LOYALISTS. WE'RE JOINED BY A KEY MEMBER,  THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN, ADAM SCHIFF, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. WHY ARE THESE FOUR WITNESSES WHO HAVE JUST BEEN SUBPOENAED, ALL  CLOSE TRUMP AIDES, SO CRITICAL  TO YOUR INVESTIGATION? >> WELL, BECAUSE THEY WERE IN  AND AROUND THE PRESIDENT ON  THESE PIVOTAL DAYS ON JANUARY  5th, ON JANUARY 6th. THEY WERE IN COMMUNICATION, SOME OF THEM WITH EACH OTHER, OTHERS  WITH THE PRESIDENT, AND WE WANT  TO KNOW WHAT WAS THE  ADMINISTRATION AWARE OF IN THE  RUN UP TO JANUARY 6th, WHAT DID  THEY KNOW ABOUT THE PROPENSITY  FOR VIOLENCE AMONG THOSE THAT  WERE BEING RALLIED TO COME TO  THIS STOP THE STEAL EVENT AS THE PRESIDENT'S CAMPAIGN BILLED IT. WHAT WAS GOING ON AT THE  PENTAGON. AND THIS WILL HELP US FILL OUT  THE PICTURE OF WHAT LED TO THAT  BLOODY INSURRECTION, AND WE NEED TO KNOW ALL THE FACTS IN ORDER  TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT THE  COUNTRY GOING FORWARD. >> INDEED. THE FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP, HE  REACTED SAYING, AND I'M QUOTING  HIM NOW, WE WILL FIGHT THE  SUBPOENAS ON EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE AND OTHER GROUNDS, CALLING YOUR  INVESTIGATION ONCE AGAIN, I'M  QUOTING, UNSELECT COMMITTEE. DOES THAT THREAT BY THE FORMER  PRESIDENT HAVE ANY TEETH? BECAUSE THE WHITE HOUSE, THE  CURRENT WHITE HOUSE SAYS  PRESIDENT BIDEN WOULDN'T ASSERT  EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE. >> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, IT'S VERY ENCOURAGING THAT THE BIDEN  ADMINISTRATION IS NOT GOING TO  ALLOW THOSE THAT WERE  POTENTIALLY IMPLICATED IN  JANUARY 6th TO HIDE BEHIND BOGUS CLAIMS OF PRIVILEGE. THAT'S VERY ENCOURAGING FROM THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION. WE COULDN'T EXPECT ANYTHING  DIFFERENT FROM DONALD TRUMP. LOOK, HE SPENT FOUR YEARS STONE  WALLING ALL SUBPOENAS. HE SPENT THE LAST COUPLE OF  YEARS PUSHING OUT THIS BIG LIE,  AND NOW HE'S CONTINUING TO PUSH  OUT THE BIG LIE. SO THIS IS NOT SURPRISING. WE'RE GOING TO USE WHATEVER  COMPULSION WE NEED TO TO GET  THESE WITNESSES TO TESTIFY, AND  WE WENT STRAIGHT TO SUBPOENAS  BECAUSE WE WERE AWARE THAT THEY  MIGHT VERY WELL TRY TO DO WHAT  THEY DID, FRANKLY, IN THE LAST  ADMINISTRATION. THAT IS RUN OUT THE CLOCK FOR  YEARS AND YEARS. >> THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SELECT  COMMITTEE, BENNIE THOMPSON SAYS  IF THESE WITNESSES DON'T COMPLY, THEN I'M QUOTING NOW CRIMINAL  CONTEMPT OR OTHER MEASURES WILL  BE OPEN TO US. THAT'S A QUOTE FROM BENNIE  THOMPSON. WHAT OTHER MEASURES, MR.  CHAIRMAN, ARE ON THE TABLE? >> WELL, THAT IS, FRANKLY,  PROBABLY THE MOST SEVERE  MEASURE. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF WAYS TO  ENFORCE SUBPOENAS, AS WE HAVE  TRIED OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS. THERE'S CIVIL EFFORTS TO SEEK TO EFFECTUATE THOSE SUBPOENAS IN  COURT, BUT THAT CAN BE VERY TIME CONSUMING. DURING THE LAST ADMINISTRATION  WHEN BILL BARR WAS THE ATTORNEY  GENERAL, HE WAS DOING EVERYTHING HE COULD TO PROTECT THE PERSON  OF THE COUNTRY, NOT THE COUNTRY  ITSELF. WHICH MEANT, OF COURSE, THAT HE  WASN'T GOING TO ASSIST IN  ENFORCING SUBPOENAS. BUT IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT  JUSTICE DEPARTMENT NOW THAT PUTS THE PUBLIC INTEREST FIRST, AND  SO IF PEOPLE, YOU KNOW,  WILLFULLY IGNORE THE LAW, AND  THEY DEFY THESE SUBPOENAS, THEN  PURSUING A CRIMINAL CONTEMPT IS  VIABLE, AND WE WOULD HOPE THAT  WE WOULD HAVE THE SUPPORT OF THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IN THAT WE  HAVE TO REESTABLISH THAT PEOPLE  CAN'T SIMPLY THUMB THEIR NOSE AT LEGAL PROCESS AND GET AWAY WITH  IT.  >> WHILE YOU'RE INVESTIGATING  THE LIES THAT LED TO THE JANUARY 6th ATTACK ON THE U.S. CAPITOL,  THE FORMER PRESIDENT IS  CONTINUING THIS EFFORT, LASHING  OUT AT SENATORS FOR NOT FIGHTING HARDER FOR HIS COUP ATTEMPT,  CALLING ON TEXAS RIGHT NOW, THE  STATE OF TEXAS TO AUDIT THE 2020 ELECTION. HOW DANGEROUS IS ALL OF THIS? >> IT'S EXTREMELY DANGEROUS  BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, WHAT THE  FORMER PRESIDENT IS DOING AND  HAS BEEN DOING IS UNDERMINING  ONE OF THE PILLARS OF OUR  DEMOCRACY, AND THAT IS THAT WE  SETTLE OUR DISPUTES AT THE  POLLING PLACE, THAT WE BELIEVE  IN OUR ELECTION SYSTEM, THAT WE  HAVE FAITH IN OUR DEMOCRACY. HE'S UNDERMINING THAT FAITH. IN CALIFORNIA WHERE WE JUST HAD  A RECALL ELECTION, THE RECALL  WAS OVERWHELMINGLY DEFEATED AND  OF COURSE TRUMP AND HIS ALLIES  AND REPUBLICAN PARTY OFFICIALS  AROUND THE COUNTRY MAKE BOGUS  CLAIMS OF FRAUD, AND SADLY, A  GREAT MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE THEM. I SAW SOME POLLING OUT OF  CALIFORNIA THAT SHOWED A VERY  HIGH DEGREE OF REPUBLICANS, HIGH PERCENTAGE OF REPUBLICANS WHO  BELIEVE NOW THOSE BIG LIES ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA ELECTION. SO IT'S DEEPLY DAMAGING TO OUR  DEMOCRACY. >>

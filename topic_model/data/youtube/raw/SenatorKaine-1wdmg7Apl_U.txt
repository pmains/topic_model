in the Virginia Beach shooting one of the reasons that 12 people were killed so quickly was that the shooter used high-capacity magazines magazines that would contain dozens and dozens of rounds of ammunition magazines that made the rescue operation conducted by brave first responders extremely difficult we say we care about our first responders when I talk to our first responders they say if you care about us do something to restrict high-capacity magazines don't you want us to be able to stop a shooting in progress don't you want us to be able to stop a murder and keep the the homicides and carnage down it's hard to do it when we're up against somebody with such a massive amount of firepower if you care about first responders if you want us to stop crimes in process that enable us to put meaningful restrictions on high-capacity magazines and I think that was a powerful lesson from the Virginia Beach shooting that had the magazine's been smaller they could have stopped the carnage earlier there may still have been those injured or killed but it would have been less of a tall and mr. president I just want to point this out before moving to the next issue as a society we tolerate high-capacity magazines many in this chamber are hunters many in this chamber are familiar with hunting laws in Virginia as in most states there are rules that have been on the books for years if you hunt a deer in Virginia we limit the amount of rounds that you can have in a rifle or shotgun we put a limit and that limit has been accepted for decades why what why do we limit the size of magazines in hunting animals because it wouldn't be fair it wouldn't be sportsmen like it wouldn't be humane to allow an animal to be hunted with a magazine of near unlimited capacity if it is not humane to hunt an animal with a massive magazine then why allow near unlimited magazines to be used to hunt human beings this is a rule that we accept and we should accept it for weapons designed to hurt humans as well the second tragedy in Virginia when I was governor number of years ago the tragic shooting at Virginia Tech and I won't go into it because I'll segue when I talk about a hero but the shooting at Virginia Tech happened because of a weakness in the background check system the individual the young man seunghui Cho who killed 32 people was prohibited from having a weapon because he'd been adjudicated mentally ill and dangerous but weaknesses and the background check system enabled him to get a weapon anyway we learned a powerful and painful lesson that day which is if your background check system has loopholes and gaps disasters will result and so I join with my colleagues who say House bill 8 that's come from the house that's a comprehensive background check system bill that keeps weapons out of the hands of people who are dangerous to themselves or others is something that we should absolutely pass and last let me just tell the story about an American Hero and I've told this story on the floor before but not for a number of years and I want to tell this story because I think everybody should know this individuals name the name of the hero I just want to describe as a man named live youlab rescue live you'll abreast you was one of the 32 people who was killed at Virginia Tech on April 16 2007 let me tell you about him he was born in Romania and he was Jewish during the Holocaust when Germany occupied Romania and began to take over the country Jews were persecuted and live you love rescue veni young child his family was sent to concentration camps and many of them perished just because they were Jewish live you as a as a young child was hidden by relatives and friends and miraculously managed to survive the Nazi campaign of anti-semitism against Jews many Jews left Romania because they felt like their neighbors and friends didn't protect them but Libya lebretia decided to stay I'm a Romanian and I'm going to stay in Romania and try to make my country a peaceful place where Jews can live in peace with their fellow men and women he ran into a second problem he went to the universe he was a talented scientist in engineer but then the Soviet Union moved in and essentially occupied Romania and they punished him because he was Jewish and because he wouldn't join the Communist Party he was a world renowned engineer published in journals around the world but first they prohibited his ability to travel to academic conferences and then they prohibited his right to publish and over the years the Soviet dominated government of Romania took away virtually every right he had he started to try to figure out a way to emigrate to Israel and in the early 1970s at a time when some Eastern European Jews were allowed to immigrate to Israel Livie Allah rescue finally escaped Soviet dominated communism after having survived the Holocaust and moved to Israel his dream he was teaching at the Technion in Israel one of the premier scientific engineering institutions in the world and he got an offer after a few years to come be a visiting professor in Blacksburg Virginia at Virginia Tech for one year and he came in 1985 this Romanian Jew professor at an Israeli Technical University came to Blacksburg Virginia in the mountains of Appalachia for one year and he fell in love with Blacksburg any state in Blacksburg at Virginia Tech for the rest of his career on April 16 2007 Livie legrest you now 22 years in Blacksburg was teaching an engineering class in one of the two buildings that was the subject of the attack by the shooter seunghui Cho the morning of April 16 2007 he had undergrads and graduates in the class when he heard shooting start in the classroom he instinctively knew he should protect his students Livio lab rescue is now over 70 years old this Holocaust survivor and he went and he stood in front of the classroom door on the second floor of this building and he told the students you've got to jump out the window I'm gonna do everything I can to protect your life jump out the window he stood there in front of the classroom door absorbing bullet after bullet every student of Libya loved rescues was able to escape from that building save one there was one student who couldn't get out in time we let others go first Livio lab rescue was killed one student in his class was killed but all of these other all these are the young people he saved their life April 16 2007 was a day that was a very special day in Libya love rescues life most in the classroom wouldn't have known it that that day was Yom Hashoah which is a day that occurs every year in the Hebrew calendar and it is a day that is celebrated and commemorated in Israel it's a day to commemorate remember never forget the Holocaust that's what Yama show it was live you love rescue a Holocaust survivor knew what that day was he knew what it meant and he made a choice because the commemoration of the Holocaust is not just remembering the violent perpetrators and it's not just remembering the victims it's also remembering that there wouldn't have been millions of victor's victims had there not been so many bystanders that's what Yama show is about it's about victims it's about perpetrators but it's also about bystanders and that the Holocaust would never had happened had there not been so many bystanders what Libyan Loeb rescue decided to do that day was not be a bystander as violence was occurring around him he decided I will not be a bystander I will try to take an action to save someone's life think about it he survived the Holocaust think about it he survived the Soviet takeover of his country and then he came to this nation and loved it but he couldn't survive the carnage of American gun violence but he did at least decide he wouldn't be a bystander that is what we are called to do in the Senate of the United States not be bystanders we do not have to demonstrate the courage of Olivia labret you and place our body in front of a classroom door and absorb bullet after bullet to save somebody else's life I don't think I would have the courage to do that I don't know how how many of us would we're not called to make the sacrifice of that magnitude but I do think we're called to make some sacrifices and I do think we're called not to be bystanders and if we are going to be true to that calling we have to be willing to take up and debate and vote on common-sense measures to keep Americans safe from gun violence Thank You mr. president with yet I yield the floor

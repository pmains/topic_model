plaza is recognized Thank You mr. chairman as an active member of the National Guard I see firsthand the importance of the National Guard supporting our armed forces as we protect our country as Guard members returned from overseas many of them stand ready and willing for their next mission as many of my colleagues have pointed out today the National Guard can play a pivotal role in secure in America's borders we've seen successful guard missions in the past with operations jumpstart Phoenix and Nimbus last year I called them the department to use the National Guard to help secure the border in May 2013 offer an amendment in this committee to the border security results Act which would ensure that DHS considers lessons learned from past National Guard missions on the border both the current and previous administrations have used the National Guard on more of a short-term ad hoc basis rather than on any long-term strategic plan secretary Johnson wouldn't it be beneficial for the department to partner with the National Guard and develop a long-term strategy for the guard to assist along the borders and would it be the borders or would be more secure if we had a well-planned budgeted strategy that consistently uses the guard members rather than just using them sporadically um congressman first of all I want to consider every option to deal with this circumstance I take no lawful option off the table as I'm sure you know the guard has limitations including pasa como titus guard can't be involved directly in law enforcement there are some exceptions to that and the Department of Defense obviously has a lot to say about this too it's their resource it comes out of their their budget and there are a lot of demands on the guard particularly in this season you know we're dealing with hurricane season there may be different crises they respond to but I've heard that the calls from some that we put the guard on the border I'd want to understand better what the what the options are for the use of the guard depending on the direction in this situation takes but I don't I don't take any option off the table but there are definitely some limitations on the use of the guard in this respect I think and we have to be mindful of those mr. Vitale I mean you've been with the border protection for a while were you a part of any of these guard missions in the past can can you comment and whether there's pros and cons so yes we've had a great relationship over the years with a National Guard and operation jumpstart and the ongoing operation failings now which in where we use National Guard resources to do things like surveillance and sensor response or sensor monitoring for us it's not without its challenges we we were we were blessed to have the guard when we were building the new 6,000 agents and it gave us a bridge to more capability on the ground we learn from them and in the resources that we're reusing from DoD as they come back from theater and are pressed into service for border security so we've learned a lot from them in all manner with regard to plan strategic deployments etc but having the guard on the border has some limitations it's this work is best done by law enforcement agents in my opinion we were learning from the guard there are some things that they can do I think the Secretary's right to keep our options open but as it relates to this particular problem where its most acute in the Rio Grande Valley it's not a challenge to arrest people who come as children or families with children the other zones along the southwest border in in South Texas are well patrolled and he are either better equipped than they were last year or are just as well equipped as they were last year right well I think originally when I last year it was suggesting the amendment was to ask DHS to study the lessons learned it was to look in it don't take any option off the table but with the guards been basically sustaining combat missions humanitarian assistance missions disaster relief for the past 12 years they've proven that they can multi-task and do numerous things and and i still believe it's much more cost-effective and efficient to surge the guard to the border get the operational control and work them into our plan they're going to train somewhere every year and you can rotate them in you can rotate them out fix the issues figure out what they could do in to congressman Clark's issue yeah we don't want kids walking across the board and being met with guns but I don't think they'd be met with guns there's probably other agencies nonprofit or federal groups that could be out there but the you know our borders are dangerous people are theirs we don't because we don't have control over our borders we don't know what's coming across but we do know there's drug cartels there's gun-running there's drugs and you know that be another mission it could be an esper admission it could be a roving patrol it could be a communications it could be providing the necessary assistance because I don't think it would be wise to expand the full-time employees or of the Border Protection Agency I don't think the American people want to see more federal law enforcement agencies when they have this tool this cost effective tool at its fingertips so I just want to urge mr. secretary to really to consider this I know every member of the National Guard that I serve with would love the opportunity to secure our borders the American people want to know that our borders are secure and that we're safe and sound so thank you for being here today chair now recognizes mr.

america knows we have a health care crisis at the border an america knows this crisis was created by joe biden and america knows that joe biden wants this crisis my big concern are just the number of people crossing the border with infectious diseases we know that millions of people across the border will cross the border this year 20 percent of them are positive for covid twice that many have been exposed to it as well a third of the people that were releasing into america are refusing the vaccine as a senior medical student i spent two months on a medical christian mission in haiti and certainly i was concerned about the largest uh endemic tuberculosis population in the western hemisphere the poorest nation in the western hemisphere but every morning i got to the clinic there was 60 to 80 people lined up to see us and as we saw each one they would describe the worms that they were seeing the worms in their feces the worms in their mouth infectious diseases are rampant in these populations certainly i continue to feel for the people of haiti continue to do mission work through other folks there i also did mission work in central america again infectious diseases are rampant and i can't help but stop and just think about the afghanistan afghanistan refugees coming across as well the the highest rate of tuberculosis in that part of the of the world as well the only countries in the world still with polio afghanistan and pakistan i want to do everything we can to show compassion but at the same time i was sent here to protect our families from these infectious diseases america knows that we have a humanitarian crisis on the border and america knows joe biden could fix it thank you senator

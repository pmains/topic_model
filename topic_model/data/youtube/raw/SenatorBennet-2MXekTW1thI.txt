and joining me now to talk more about the importance of the colorado river is colorado senator michael bennett he recently actually traveled down the river with his republican colleague from the state next door utah senator mitt romney to try to shed climate change issue is real and now it's impacting people's lives senator bennett welcome uh and just let's talk about this trip down the river you guys decided to do this right after the the federal government announced um for the first time that they were going to have to do some restrictions on water use from the colorado river so look this was clearly about bringing more attention to this um but what else did you learn on this trip well you know the the other thing that happened chuck this summer was there was one day when the worst air quality in the world was in northern utah and denver colorado worse than beijing because of the fires from california and so i said admit you know maybe we ought to spend some time on the river talking about climate talking about uh forestry and water issues and i brought some people from colorado he brought some people from utah and basically what we were trying to do was establish and re-establish some relationships because these states are going to have to come together to figure out how to manage a resource that is half of what we thought relies on that river and we're not making any more water so we're going to have to in our own time just as our forbearers had to figure out in theirs figure out how to create a sustainable economy with an approach to the river at the same time i hope we can reach forward on climate change legislation because that's really why the river is in the condition that it's in you know i love this quote from the colorado farm bureau president he said you know politicians can't make it rain they can't make more water but they can be sympathetic so i guess is what is the role of the federal government here in trying to because look the great fear is that this instead of working instead of colorado utah arizona working together in nevada on this issue uh you go to or in the state of georgia you know sue each other over water issues what role do you think the federal government should play in making sure that doesn't happen out west i think it's really important that it is not a top-down approach from washington d.c that's destined to fail what's really important is that the upper and lower basin states come together and create a rational framework and expectation for how we're going to manage this resource in the coming years i think the federal government can support that with uh resources which we're doing in the reconciliation package and the bipartisan bills we actually end up able to pass those but you know that's going to be a continuing need there's going to be more need for water infrastructure there's going to be more need to help farmers and ranchers along the way there's going to be more need to to develop innovative technologies to save water and conserve water and and everybody's going to be in it together and i think the federal government can play an important role doing that i also think my own view is that it's very important for us to make some big moves on climate change at the national level to have a clean electricity standard to put a price in carbon uh so that we can address the root causes of this issue because the farmers in colorado can't address those new causes on their own no they can't and that's what i feel like that this is going to be where their disconnect is like on one hand you talk about the big issues that we've got to deal with to protect us for the next 30 to 50 years but in the meantime these farming communities this is their livelihood this is about survival now they're not going to you know 30 years from now that's nice and there's certainly i think you talked to plenty of farmers they're worried about the next generation but they're more concerned about whether they can survive in this fight over water i mean i understand we can't have a top-down approach but you saw that in nevada we're going to have water police right there's water agricultural community there's going to be perhaps more of an enforcement mechanism in order to conserve water i i think that it's much more likely that we're going to find our way through a agreement among farmers themselves and their states but i'll give you another example of something that's a live issue that the federal government really could do after last year colorado had three worst fires in our state's history as a result of climate change and i asked what would it cost initiation watershed protection that is of our national forests in the west and the answer was 60 billion dollars which is about what we spend fighting fires over the course of five years but when you fight a fire it costs fifty thousand dollars an eight acre to fight that fire if you can do the forest mitigation it costs about fifteen hundred dollars an acre and it can give our farmers and ranchers a real sense that we're protecting the the resource and they do deeply care about americans i think that if we were able to pass that in washington put a serious investment on the landscape and in our watersheds be able to say to farmers and ranchers that's actually what climate legislation looks like you might find yourself building a very unusual coalition of people to support the next round of effort around climate you're an eternal optimist about working across the aisle um look uh when we're doing this interview uh and it's possible people be watching this maybe we've gotten through this round of dysfunction but why should people be optimistic that that we're going to see a bipartisan consensus solve it starting i don't think people should be optimistic about it i think we as a country have to work hard for it it turns out that democracy is much more difficult than any of us ever thought certainly than i ever thought i think the women that spent decades fighting for the right to vote the self-evident right to vote they probably felt that it was should have been people who fought for the self-evident proposition that one group of humans shouldn't own another group of humans we have those fights in our own time and it would be wrong for us to expect that it's going to be easy to do it there are people in washington dc that are completely unwilling to work with each other and and and address for example climate change and we have to address climate change but ultimately and i this is over the long term chuck ultimately what that we think of as american climate policy just like we used to have something called american foreign policy and whether you were a democratic president or a republican president you knew what your job was with respect to the soviet union that's what we've got to do with climate it i know that seems impossible today and i'm not here to be pollyannish or ridiculous about it i'm here to say the only way we're going to create a durable policy solution that we can pass to our kids and to our grandkids if we can get past the ridiculous politics that we're in right now and and and create something durable and and as long as i've got a chance to work on it i'm just going to keep working the debate should be how we do it not whether we should do it and i think that's what you're trying to get there michael bennett democrat from colorado really appreciate you coming on

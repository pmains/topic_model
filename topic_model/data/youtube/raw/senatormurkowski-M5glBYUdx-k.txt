the federal infrastructure bill is said to have a big impact on alaska in the coming years and some 80 of our communities there is no road access so you either access by water or by air the infrastructure bill has a great deal of importance and priority for places all over the country but for me i look at infrastructure like this hard infrastructure bridges roads the rail connections it's not just big airports but small airstrips like this that are kind of the lifeblood of a small alaskan community the goal is for all alaskans to have access to high-speed internet within five years you know there should be no no politics about whether or not infrastructure is good or bad infrastructure allows us to have the economy that we're all looking for for those in very urban areas and those of us in the most rural of areas to connect alaskans that's what we do so infrastructure probably as significant as anything i've done legislatively that investment is going to be paying dividends well well well into the future you

a Senate is not in session right now and that means most lawmakers are now back in their home states today both of Virginia senators right here in Richmond and for Tim Kaine the focus was economic development the senator joins me now to talk about that and several other big issues today senator welcome yeah well great to be with you alright so you were you're talking economic development particularly in the african-american community their access to capital Workforce Development what what does the focus there yeah this is a great week I did Hampton Roads yesterday and south side and the shano abolish mark talking about economic development issues metropolitan business league in Richmond has been you know kind of the voice for african-american businesses for a long time and so we just sat down and had an open discussion access to capital came up a lot of government contracting questions I worked with many of these businesses when I was mayor at the city when I was governor at the state what's the federal system like a lot of questions about the federal budget you know we have a budget that expires on sep tember thirty two year budget the question is will we find a budget deal going forward Virginia gets more affected by federal budget than in the other state will not fall out if there isn't one because of course the drumbeat is already starting up but they're going to head it off at the pass this time we said like you know there there there will not be a shutdown you know I mean they're there no Democrat will allow a shutdown and I don't hear many Republicans talking about it either so the question will be will we find a comprehensive budget deal by September 30 or will we take a little bit extra time put it put in place what's called a continuing resolution which is a short-term temporary as we get to deal the real question is these sequester cuts August of 2011 put in place these significant cuts to both defense and non-defense but that was before we were in a war on Isis that was before we were getting cyber attacked you know from North Korea or China a lot of the world is changing hard it says it does there's no state that be affected by full sequester cuts than us we avoided half the sequester cuts with the two-year budget deal that we did that expires we're trying to find a similar kind of deal going forward and as shifting gears a little bit to Iran one of the big foreign policy issues that you said in fact Barry war with Isis but obviously there's a lot of concern about Iran as well piece in The New York Times today basically saying hey this is one case where the typical gridlock of not being able to get anything done would act be a win for the President and allow this resolution or this treaty to go forward though I wrote the bill that congress is currently 60-day review process based on a bill that i wrote with Senator porker of Tennessee and basically the way the bill sets up is this the president gets to do a diplomatic deal and the deal goes forward and less Congress affirmatively votes to stop it and for a variety of reasons the president's clear power to do diplomacy under Article 2 but Congress's significant role under article 1 to review deals I think it strikes the right balance I would say right now I respect differences of opinion on this it's big and it's complicated but I I put myself in the camp of for example former Senator John Warner former Senator Carl Levin they'd both been head of the Senate Armed Services committee's I think the deal is actually a dramatic improvement over the status quo it's not perfect but we ought to give diplomacy a chance because it's better than the status quo and I think for at least 15 years we will not have to worry about the Iranian nuclear program and hopefully longer and finally while we have you here the campaign obviously going on some surprises on the Republican side were we to talk to three or four months ago we probably wouldn't predict this exact but also a Democratic side Hillary Clinton not doing as well here in Virginia what are your thoughts there you know i was i did a the first kind of fundraising event for Secretary Clinton about two and a half weeks ago in Northern Virginia was a very strong event did well but look I've always known about this campaign it was not going to be a coronation there was no you know automatic favorite I mean Secretary Clinton very qualified but trying to do something that nobody's ever done in American history for a woman to be elected president so I think she has to have and her team does have kind of the underdog mentality until the very last vote is counted but I feel very confident she'll be our nominee and I think right now she matches up very very well against anybody on the Republican side including Donald Trump absolutely i mean Donald's kept it interesting i'll say that he has a lot of ain't cut for him all right Thank You senator King so much for coming in yep thanks Bill

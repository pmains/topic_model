[Music] from the global news network of breitbart.com this is Breitbart News Daily with Alex Marlow on SiriusXM Patriot 125. [Music] Senator Tom Cottons here republican from Arkansas Senator I've got a lot to get to with you a per usual thanks again for joining me on the broadcast but I do have to ask you if you have a take on this bizarre mysterious series of what appear to be explosions in the Baltic targeting pipelines it appears and it's going to be a big environmental disaster could complicate things geopolitically do we have any sense of what actually happened Alex I have suspicions but I haven't been briefed on and I expect to be later uh today or tomorrow on the intelligence committee um so I will uh withhold comment for now yeah it makes sense but I had to just see if you had any insight just I had to give it a whirl because it is a very odd one and I don't know exactly I have suspicions as well and they don't all line up it's a real rare one where I don't have a clear Narrative of my head so I'll be curious to hear what uh you find out um let's turn to some of the other issues of the day first jcpa um pretty uh interesting thing you've been kind enough to come on the show and give us your thoughts on I think you and I are pretty much identically aligned on this I was sort of starting to see the bill Advance last week after markup and tender Cruise kind of flipping on it and is now all of a sudden a big supporter of it and there's this narrative out there that the bill is uh something that big Tech hates this is the talking point the big cat hates this bill I I don't understand how this narrative is taken off considering that big Tech Will essentially be allowed to buy off the media companies are supposed to cover big Tech it just seems like a gift to Big Tech and yet this narrative has come through can you evaluate it and give me your thoughts on on that yeah I well I think the deal is passing the law which I hope it won't be will allow big Tech and liberal media to collude together to further um suppress conservative views uh and harm conservative Outlets like Breitbart I recognize and I hear from small Arkansas newspapers that they feel like they're getting a raw bill from Big Tech and I would like to find a way to help address that challenge but this bill by creating an explicit exemption to our Anti-Trust laws for Legacy Media companies who can then discriminate about who joins mayor cartel just creates more opportunities for Mischief in my opinion so what the bill does is basically allow uh newspapers magazines websites media Outlets to band together and what would otherwise be a multiple pollution or the antitrust laws to negotiate terms under which big tech companies can use their content however the bill also allows those meeting companies decide who they want to let play in their sandbox and I believe they've already told Breitbart for instance they don't want any part of bright Parts uh content in their cartel so while there are many things from the outlets like yours and probably uh as if we went along other conservative Outlets would also be excluded putting them at a major competitive disadvantage I also believe that those companies and the big tech companies would likely work together to suppress conservative views even of those who are in the cartel I don't think the language adopted last week is strong enough to prevent that so again I want to protect you know small daily newspapers or weekly newspapers like the gardener who's dispatch or the Baxter bulletin or the Jonesborough sign but I don't want to empower say the Minneapolis Stark Tribune and Google to try to undermine conservatives in Minnesota and that so why can't there be separate ways of tackling this why do is this the ver this is the thing that I have never understood is why this jcpa the way it's written now which allows for this collusion from establishment media outlets and big Tech while it does not provide any assurances that they weren't won't subjectively Define misinformation and things like that to include uh true content put out by people like like us at Breitbart uh why there's a clear distinction that why we can't have a bill with those things clearly defined why do we have to have this bill that's what I don't get and my cynical conclusion is is money is seems like there's being a lot of money thrown at this thing and there's a lot of Consulting and a lot of people that are getting bought off but maybe I'm being too cynical there do you have any sense senator uh in Washington I think it's naive to believe you can be too cynical Alex yeah um and I think uh as you suggest the old proverb that's the answer to all things my friend is money may be at play here just like it is for instance in the green energy the potholes of the democratic party went voiced upon America um I do think like I said there's other other ways to protect small Hometown newspapers and do an important job of covering local school boards and community events and crime beats in their communities without empowering uh left-wing media which again almost every time almost every media Outlet in America except the New York Times and Washington Post which have plenty of power on their own rights would be able to participate in this organization and many of these kind of regional mid-sized newspapers and pretty critical States uh lean pretty far to the left even if they don't have the national rates to say the New York Times does um I think that there's probably a lot of money behind it and then there's some ideological uh alignment too let me get your thoughts on what's going on in Italy with Georgia Maloney which is kind of conservative media is very excited about this with the first female prime minister now I'm old enough Senator to to remember that if you don't support any female running for the highest office in the land then you are a sexist I was told that and it is uh but yet same people who've been saying that have been lying their hair on fire over this um are do you have any thoughts on this do you think it bodes well for what could happen in November here in the United States if you listened to someone for commentary you have any reaction to it I just kind of want you to free associate well I congratulate Georgia Maloney uh and uh the parties in her Coalition for a big victory in Italy and we look forward to working with some of the former government America is stronger when Italy is strong and prosperous and Sovereign and free I I do have to say I chuckled um which as you say used to celebrate women running for high office uh showing that I'm with her was the only thing you could say but obviously if you're with Georgia Maloney who is now the legitimate democratically elected leader or presumptive leader I should say of Italy sure and you are a neopascist descended from Benito Mussolini but that's just other piece with the way the American Media and this Administration treats anyone who deviates from their left-wing Orthodoxy you know they called 75 million Republican voters semi-fascist um a lot of the American Media also denounced the new Swedish government from a couple the election they had there a couple weeks ago because again it was a center-right party that cares about things like immigrant crime when grenades and bombs are now seen constantly on the streets of Sweden or in Georgia Maloney's case uh when Italy is bearing the brunts of the disastrous policy of Barack Obama and uh uncle Oracle to basically throw the doors of Europe open to any migrant from any country in Africa or Asia that can make the very dangerous journey across Italy Shores so I welcome our cooperation for further steps yeah you cut out a little bit um but you had an interesting tweet where you said that America's stronger than Italy is strong Sovereign prosperous and free I know you didn't choose those words accidentally um the The Sovereign point is so crucial because you know we're very focused on the EU and globalism at Breitbart we think that strong nations are a much better model than unelected bureaucratic super States like we have seen in Europe and being free it'll lead some of those Draconian lockdowns and they were LED at the time by detector Kratz guy Mario draghi who was in charge of the European Central Bank you know almost like you know putting Ben Bernanke in charge of you know making him the president or something would be the sort of the American equivalent to that which was didn't go well um but speak to this the idea of national sovereignty and the nature of when you get these bureaucratic super States you just see less freedom yeah I mean the Italian government uh for many years has not been responsive to its people you know the Italian people voted in 2018 for a center-right government um but the Italian establishment um through all kinds of machinations um put Mario draghi who's kind of uh the perfect image of a European bureaucrat in charge of their government I would note that Georgia Maloney was the own and her party were the only politicians who didn't join that so-called technocratic government uh and they were rewarded by the Italian people with the largest vote share in this election and whether it's very important that governments be responsive to their people whether it's responsive to their National governments and uh Europe not bureaucrats and Brussels or for that matter uh people in America have a say in who runs their government that is to say elected officials whether it's the president Congress Governor State legislatures not bureaucrats in the permanent administrative state in Washington I want to turn to Iran where there's a mounting death toll and a lot of international outrage after 10 days of protest so far due to Uprising over hijabs what's your thoughts on this in general and any news that you think that you should convey the audience but what is America doing here what is our role in this is Joe Biden supporting any of these protests or is he just going to ignore this and talk about the Atlanta Braves well we're doing almost nothing Alec this is a replay of Barack Obama's failures during the Green Revolution protests in the summer of 2009 I mean Barack Obama or Joe Biden had one vague comment last week at the U.N general assembly in a speech in which he otherwise conciliated with the ayatollah's uh continuing to pursue a nuclear deal and those two things are related the reason Barack Obama didn't support those protesters in 2009 it's not because he was naive or flat-footed or inexperienced it was a ruthless decision to abandon uh Freedom loving peoples in Iran to the ayatollahs because he wanted a nuclear deal that he thought would help atone for America's supposed sins Joe Biden is doing the exact same thing it's not that he's caught flat-footed or ignorant of what's going on is that he cares more than anything about getting yet another bad nuclear deal that will empower the ayatollahs except this time the consequences are even more great because Iran is much closer to a nuclear weapon and the Iranian regime is much more Fragile the supreme leader has been on death's doorstep for a long time and there are reports that he's even sicker now and the people of Iran don't want another generation of uh suffering under these crazed ayatollahs it's in their interest and it's in our interests that the United States stand up for them that we walk away from the nuclear deal we impose new sanctions on the regime Thugs and goons who are massacring civilians in the streets and that we ensure that we do everything we can to promote their aspirations if we do that we'll rally the entire region behind us all whom view Iran and its proxies as Grave threats we did an analysis or we looked at analysis of the immigration situation right now and Joe Biden is freed 1.35 illegal aliens in the U.S is taking office that's more than the population of at least eight states in the country right now it seems like another one of these stories along with inflation a couple other things that it just seems like the media will not allow for people to talk about that this is perhaps the worst the Border crisis has ever been I want to get your thoughts on if there's anything in Washington being done about is there any conversation about this uh tragedy is happening yeah I mean I'll I'll tell there's been five million illegal aliens enter the country in less than two years under Joe Biden and you're right that the mainstream media basically will not cover it the only place you get coverage of it is places like Breitbart or Fox News um but you also see grave concerns for most Americans um about uh this open border I was just Downton Colorado a couple days ago campaigning with Joe day and one of the main issues we heard over and over again with the number of fentanyl deaths that they've had that is a direct result of our open Southern border because almost all drugs especially all fentanyl in our country these days comes across the Mexican border so the media may not uh care about our open border and they may want to ignore it but I'm pretty confident the American people are not going to ignore it in 41 days on this uh November 8th election yeah let's talk about that a little bit in Joe days race is interesting as well because Democrats are putting a lot more race into that in Colorado and there's a few other states where they're putting out having to spend resources in Washington and um you know there's a lot of talk about the Red Wave is dissipating but if so then why are the Democrats having to spend in all these places that should be automatic wins for them in a uh in the sort of your typical typical race what are your obviously you've got a dog in the fight here being a Republican senator but is it what are you seeing is there anything you're reading between the lines that you think are uh could tell the tale of this election so far um well I think the American people want to put the brakes on the extreme uh Biden agenda who is totally curried to the uh far left ideology in this party you see that in Colorado and you see the consequences of it not just with the Surge and Fentanyl deaths Colorado now leads the nation in car thefts not exactly what you want to leave the nation in not you know high school test scores for instance uh inflation in California in Colorado still very high gases back up to almost four dollars a gallon Denver is becoming nearly uninhabitable because of drugs uh homelessness and crime and no matter how much the media tries to tell you that oh the tides have turns you know Democrats are gaining strength um I think most Americans realize the economy is still in a very perilous state that they increasingly can't even take their kids to public parks or downtown because of crime and drugs that our border is totally open and that America is disrespected in the world and they want to put the brakes on that and the way they do so is to elect people like Joe O'Day and Washington or Herschel Walker in Georgia Lake Masters in Arizona Tiffany Smiley in Washington in addition to holding the seats that we currently hold whether it's someone like Ron Johnson and Ohio mebanez and Pennsylvania Ted bite in North Carolina I'm confident that we are going to win back the Senate and the house because the American people are fed up with the results of the Biden uh left-wing agenda I want to ask you about military recruiting right now I think that we did something truly devastating with some of these Draconian mandates we put in place and we had an exclusive story of Breitbart how uh one of the objections that was raised by people who are going to get the boot for not complying vaccine mandates was can we at least wait for the FDA to approve of the vaccines before we get the shots and the uh the the defense department the Department of Defense said no we you can't wait you see the shots now before the FDA approves of it it seems like we intentionally shot ourselves in the foot how is military recruiting going right now and are people assuming you're going to save poorly are people being honest about what the causes are of why we're struggling a military recruiting is in a crisis Alex and I was amused and angry when I saw a Biden Administration officials in Congress a couple weeks ago testifying about this crisis and the causes of it I mean the Biden Administration looking for the causes of our military recruiting crisis it's kind of like O.J looking for the real killer Alex it doesn't have to dig very far to the Bountiful in Afghanistan which which undermines faith in our military leadership the vaccine mandates as you say which were totally pointless when it's clear the vaccine does not prevent transmission between persons especially when you're talking about one of the younger healthier populations in our society um the radical gender ideology agenda of the Biden Department of Defense you know the Witch Hunt for so-called racial extremists and white nationalists which turned up almost no one in our military um these are the things they're contributing to the military recruiting crisis uh young kids join our military because they want to learn how to kill the bad guys they don't Point Military to learn how to use like pronouns that is right on and I just don't know if they're gonna be able to have a course correction I would recommend the Senator's book sacred Duty which is about his uh time in our armed services and so do you have any quick recommendations for US senator so I've got a new book coming out Alex in six weeks called Only the Strong which addresses some of these issues and not specifically exposes the left um long-standing plot to weaken American power you know what you see uh at our Southern border what you see with a weakened military uh with Barack Obama and dividends disastrous foreign policy is not an accident it's not inadvertent it's not the result of bad luck or Misfortune or bad timing it's an intentional plan it's decline by Design among these Progressive liberals that I think America and the world would be better off if America would just pull in its horn and a tone for its supposed sins and apologize to the rest of the world become a normal Nation so you can learn to learn about it all on November one you can not pre-order the book now cool that's so funny I wasn't aware of that but I can't wait to read it should be great all right thank you Alex thanks Senator have a great rest your day appreciate all the time and information we'll take a break be right back

hi i'm representative eric burleson with another capital report this week is a final week just before we take a spring break i'll be going back to springfield and and uh continuing to work from springfield but we've gotten a lot done this this session before the spring break including protections on on our rights and protections from federal regulations regarding health insurance and the impending health insurance mandates this week we finalized we passed on the house floor house joint resolution 48 50 and 57. representative tim jones carried this this bill on the house floor and this this resolution now if it's passed through the senate will will appear on the ballot for missouri voters for you missouri voters to have a choice to vote on and if you pass this house joint resolution it'll it will become part of our state constitution and what this will do is will protect missouri residents and businesses from the mandates on the federal government i've received many emails from from constituents that have asked me to do something about the impending regulations and the impending health care mandates we all we all understand what's happening in the federal government and we all understand that sometimes they don't understand what's happening on the local level and they don't understand what's best for the state of missouri and we're seeing all kinds of deals being brokered with other states and we we just feel that this is not this may not be in the best interest for the citizens of this state and so we're giving you the opportunity to reject what's happening in the federal federal government in addition we're trying to do what we can to save to reduce health care costs that's why this week i presented a bill house bill 2205 to to committee to the health care policy committee and what 2205 will do will save millions of dollars in printing fees that insurance companies are required to do right now in statute old statutes require insurance companies to print materials and send them to the mail when this material is often out of date and not even important information for the people they're sending it to and what my bill does is allows us to leverage the internet and other emerging technologies to become more efficient we have shackled insurance and hospitals to these to these regulations when they could try to become more lean and efficient and and reduce their costs hopefully this will allow them to be able to transfer those cost savings to you the customers but if anything it's a better it's a better process those people that do want to continue to receive paper printed and mailed to them have that option as well so you as a consumer can either get your information electronically on the internet or if you like for your insurance company to mail it to you you can request that being mailed as well in addition to that we've also passed something that kind of that clarifies the relationships between hospitals and insurance companies and and that was house bill 1498. often insurance companies and and doctors get in a debate over what information hasn't been collected and and you as the consumer suffer because of that and you suffer because insurance companies hold out for more information before they actually send the payment before they pay the claim and our this bill clarifies what insurance companies can request and what hospitals and providers can or must provide in order for a claim to be called what's called a clean claim this clarifies it and for once we had um consensus amongst both insurance companies and health care providers as to as to what would be a good uh a good bill something that they both agreed on but in the end the consumer you the consumer are going to benefit because insurance companies will be paying their claims more promptly it's in and in a more timely manner we're doing everything we can i have other bills that i plan to file in two weeks that will help reduce the cost for the state in regards to health care but until then i appreciate your comments on these bills and other bills that we've passed already and you can please send those comments to me and my email address that's eric.burleson gmail.com you can also make posts on my facebook page but i i really appreciate your comments and appreciate your input thank you very much

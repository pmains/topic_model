recognize for your questions thank you mr chair i appreciate the participation of all the witnesses here today um let me begin by uplifting a dynamic of disparities you know there's been a lot of uh talk in recent years and not just relative to covid but because of the impacts of kovid responses to kovid a lot of the pre-existing inequities in our society have been exacerbated frankly so although underserved communities in many ways experience disproportionately the harms from the coveted pandemic from a health perspective from an economic perspective and more federal relief programs often fail to reach those most in need federal legislation enhance unemployment insurance benefits for example and expanded eligibility amid the severe economic shock caused by the pandemic however during the first year of the pandemic black and latino applicants were less likely to receive unemployment insurance benefits than right applicants we have the data that tells us that additionally a ucla report found that the first distribution of loans through the paycheck protection program actually widened pre-pandemic racial inequalities by supporting far fewer jobs per resident in black and latino neighborhoods than in white neighborhoods in california i'd be shocked to think that it was an isolated dynamic to california alone now these disparities are certainly not new as i mentioned but the covet 19 pandemic certainly exacerbated them and it's particularly disconcerting that federal relief programs may have made disparities even worse proud of the american rescue plan included language that helped put equity front and center as part of our recovery efforts but we need to make sure that the its implementation actually improves upon those underlying inequities so my first question is for deputy director miller how is the biden administration using coveted relief efforts and other federal funding to address these underlying inequities thank you senator thank you for the opportunity uh to talk about these efforts as i noted in my opening remarks the pandemic pandemic disproportionately harmed underserved communities and too often relief didn't reach those intended one of the early actions of the administration was making adjustments to the ppp program for the items that you noted that were widely and publicly reported in terms of access to ppp loans were some of the smallest and disadvantaged businesses at a time where black owned businesses were closing at twice the rate of other types of businesses making sure that they had access to ppp another thing that we have done with regards to implementation of arp is on the front end of programs bringing together as i noted the gold standard meetings with agency igs the prak omb the arp implementation team and agencies so that we're taking steps in program design ensuring that both relief is targeted where intended and that we're putting in place reporting mechanisms that are get the right balance between ensuring that we're getting the outcomes that we need while reducing burden for applicants no definitely acknowledge the progress that's been made on thinking about this on the front end and certainly hope that it becomes institutionalized and baked into efforts going forward across the board next question is for chair horowitz just like to ask what recommendations you may have for how the federal government can better ensure that underserved populations are prioritized for funding and resources senator thank you for the question one of the challenges we found again is the data gaps here what we've seen is as we've looked to see how have underserved communities been um advantaged by these programs or disadvantaged by these programs we're finding there's a lack of data we're not sure what the backgrounds are of those who've gotten the loans we're not sure about the economic status of individuals who've applied and it's been one of the things we've reported on and we've actually held hearings on about some of the challenges in us even trying to figure out how that came about so i think one of the first things is agencies making sure that they get data another is what gao found in a report they did about ppp and the second the furtherance of the ppp program by ensuring that community development financial institutions were available to distribute loans that was an important step forward very important gao report in that regard also with regard to how programs were run operated and money was distributed what we found is those who didn't have internet service those who didn't have the ability to apply through the processes set up couldn't get it and that harms mostly those in rural communities and in underserved communities generally because of broadband issues right no and that's a classic example where it might have been well intentioned not completely thought through efficiencies to be gained by being primarily digital but without recognition of yes the digital divide is still alive and well in america we are only worsening those pre-existing gaps in inequities can i add one other which is a fraud we've talked about it not only victimizes the program but particularly for several of these programs it victimizes those who they were intended for which often are those most in need and what we've heard we actually had a meeting about this just the last couple weeks on the identity fraud identity theft issue we heard from representatives of underserved communities about how what happens is after when people in underserved communities seek to apply for those benefits that they're the ones legitimately entitled to but their identities have been stolen it turns out they're the ones being questioned as if they're the fraudsters they're the ones that struggle to get their identities back and so that's actually a very big issue when you when we talk about identity theft we think about um how the programs have been defrauded but they harm the people whose identities were stalled i'd love to follow up with you on what we're doing after the fact to assist those who have been victims of identity theft as opposed to sorry we're going to make this hard for you and we leave them on their own to to figure it out i know my time is limit i do want to put one more issue on the table here and that is the use of facial recognition and more specific to how it's been brought up earlier in the hearing as we continue to combat fraud to your point in federal programs it's important that our efforts to provide program integrity do not come at the cost of privacy and accuracy i recently joined senator menendez and other colleagues in sending a letter to the irs highlighting well-documented concerns about the use of facial recognition technology especially for individuals who have poor internet service at home who rely on computers and public libraries for example or who use older phones or for whom english is not their first language i'm pleased that the irs has taken initial steps to transition away from the use of facial recognition technology to verify identity however given the gravity of the threat to civil rights and civil liberties by this technology especially against immigrants and people of color other vulnerable communities i remain concerned about the continued use of this technology and the vast amount of biometric data that agencies and contractors are managing question for comptroller dodaro how do you think agencies can best uphold the integrity of the programs without undermining the civil rights and civil liberties of program beneficiaries well they have to make sure that they first address those issues they recognize what those issues are and properly address it they need to go through the due process of hearing from different people but you have to understand the technologies and facial recognition a lot of agencies are using it now mostly in the law enforcement communities we've made several recommendations about this and some of the technologies have built-in limitations in them so you have to understand the limitations in the technology people particularly for people of color uh for facial recognition technologies and others so there are ways to do it but it has to be a very thorough deliberative careful process to make sure that it's only used with proper understanding of not impinging on people's civil liberties yeah look we obviously have a lot to follow up on there uh in a deeper dive on specifics i would argue just because it is in more widespread use among other departments other agencies other sectors not just the federal government doesn't mean it is not problematic in those areas as well so it's not pointing to what's being used in law enforcement right as to a reason to forge ahead without the uh thoughtfulness i understand and that's what i'm saying i'm saying that even in law enforcement it needs to be careful we've made recommendations on making sure people understand the information that they're getting but if you go outside that area you need to have due care so we're in agreement on that all right and can i just add one thing on that because there has been a lot and there is a lot to be concerned about here but it can't also paralyze us and agencies from taking steps to prevent identity fraud and identity theft and there has to be that kept in mind there's oftentimes this we can't use this tool so we'll stop trying and and i just encourage because it has such wide ramifications the identity theft we've seen it endemic in these programs over the last two years and it's hurting those who the money should go to thank you thank you mr thank you senator pedia senator scott you're wrecking

2015 you can go look it up at the starch with you I put a column in there about calling for a refugee program timeout and the reason that I did that is because of what I saw across the same Minnesota in our nation with problems of assimilation and terrorism associated with refugees and mostly from places like Somalia countries that hate America so I think we need to have a timeout we need to figure that what's going on we going on a neighboring City just up the road and thermal I sat down with one of the bank bracelets a couple weeks back and some of their leaders there and they'll tell you the city of Ur blows changing the city of pheromones of expression a lot of their kids are coming to school them and Medford and elsewhere because the school system is under pressure and it has to do with all these free settlements many of the governor's candidates have picked up on this and they're talking about how we should no longer have we refugee resettlements of Minnesota and I tell them that's good and I understand that's their policy but we have to do it naturally because they'll go to Dayton would come here we just need to figure it out I support safe zones over in those other countries so people can be repatriated to their home countries we have to make sure that we protect our country from people who believe in supremacy who will not adhere to our Constitution who put our way of life at risk who are in odds with Western culture it's just that simple in my book and I would be someone and bring on there was like three months later President Trump waded into the issue after we had called for a timeout so we are lockstep right now relying on that issue

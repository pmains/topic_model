nice now to discuss what's going on congresswoman barbara Lee Democrat of California Congress over thanks very much for joining my place so where do you think the country is right now right now I think the country is morning we're grieving I mean the loss of these two young men in Baton Rouge and in Minnesota the loss of five police officers and in dallas this violence has got to stop and so i think where we are is reassessing where we are and really understanding and there we are our brothers and sisters keeper and we've got to move out of here and defeats what needs to be done right now well many things need to be done first of all we need to have of course our gun safety measures should be passed I mean just very modest measures on background checks gun safety on no fly no no fly no by but also we need to look at the assault weapon ban we need to also look at how we address issues around police transparency and accountability you know the Republicans have defunded in our appropriations bill the cops program the hiring portion and I have little odd that would a bill that would reinstitute that but also Institute racial diversity in terms of inclusion merits of authority your district includes Oakland where there have been a lot of these kinds of issues over the years I want you to listen the Dallas Police Chief David Brown said just a little while ago when he was asked what the protesters should be doing he gave a very important answer listen to this we're hiring we're hiring get off that protest lining and put application in and we'll put you in your neighborhood and hip we will help you resolve some of the problems you're protesting about it's a pretty important answer what do you think of that very important answer because we need to have police officers in our communities who look like us who understand the cultural sensitivities who understand institutional racism and bias and the historic reasons in terms of how we got here and so you know we have to also make sure that the concept that he's suggesting telling a lot of people you know what you want to make a difference don't just go out there protests join a police force get involved going to your communities make sure people are saying well this police chief is phenomenal and he made the first step he took the first step and I think it's important because i think these protest movement and our protesters really get it they want to see change they want to see in justices corrected in the criminal justice system reformed and so i'm very proud and optimistic that young people will listen not everyone wants to be a police officer but some may and i think when they see police departments such as dallas and how it has done a phenomenal job and meaning some of the standards we're trying to get nationally I think some will will heed the call but I think it's important to recognize that these protesters are the black lives matter movement they want change they want systemic institutional change and I think in terms of grand jury reform in terms of the de-escalation of tension before the use of force you know is is is used I think that they are really demanding what needs to be demanding and we have to make sure that these protests stay peace and i think that the black lives matter movement and other movements and those supporters really want them to stay peaceful but i also believe that we have to have police police officers who really understand the communities we have to have more resources into community policing because our police officers deserve to be safe they have a very difficult job and also our communities deserve to be safe from a police misconduct and police killings congress or barbara Lee thanks very much for joining us thank you ma'am

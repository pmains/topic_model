the chair now recognizes the gentleman from west virginia mr mckinley for five minutes uh thank you uh thank you chairman and as a good friend it's always good to see you uh i thought the premise of this hearing was going to be about the decarbonization accelerating the decarbonization united states and i've been functioning for years now on the fact that climate change is a global issue and requires a global solution so we've heard from previous panels including gina mccarthy when they said that if america alone decarbonizes the impact on the global environment would be virtually immeasurable and and they went on to say that if as long as countries like china and india are expanding their dependence on fossil fuels america was still experienced wildfires on the west coast droughts and floods in the midwest and hurricanes on the east so i guess the issue is can america decarbonize absolutely i would agree it can but it what's the cost to families communities and businesses that are relying on fossil fuels this report that everyone's referring to was silent about hazard kentucky gillette wyoming katas ohio there are no transitional employment opportunities and those can be in those areas so to rich powell let me ask you a couple questions with you first i say rich i agree with your testimony where you said serious federal policy proposals must also reflect the global nature of the challenge let me ask rich have you read the national academy report yeah okay do you think that there were maybe there was given that there were no representatives who were not academics among the authors and based on their tweets and papers that they published do you believe that the authors may have had a bias against fossil fuels it certainly seemed like an objective was first to think first about decarbonization and maybe secondarily about the transition impacts did you agree that one of the authors who tweeted out that and his quote was in his tweet showing who these are the people that put this that american can eradicate america can eradicate poverty by decarbonization do you agree with that uh i i don't think it's the first way we would eradicate poverty but that was your statement that decarbonization is going to eradicate poverty and then the then also part of the study was quote that was to build an energy system without social injustices that permeate the current system do you think it does permeate the current system i i don't i i believe that let me let me get back on point oh rich on because i've got some more questions i'd like to get with you so back on point with well the policies outlined in this in this study because it was very comprehensive and very thoughtfully put together from white papers that they publish but what will it encourage other nations like china and india to actually follow our lead and reduce their emissions it focuses on u.s emissions reductions the one piece that might have a global impact is the r d section and that could reduce the cost of global emissions but beyond that it's largely silent on the global quest now since the anti-fossil fuel zealots that we deal with in washington are agitating for america to to choose this simplistic route uh just in other words discontinue fossil fuels that's one way to do it you can that is a fork in the road you can take that and we can not use fossil fuels but wouldn't america wouldn't america be better off better advised if they adopted a more pragmatic approach to capturing carbon through advanced innovation and deployment we should we should be focusing on reducing emissions not eliminating fossil fuels thank you so wouldn't that approach protect the economy reduce carbon emissions and develop a technology that we can export around the world for other nations that are offensive in in their missions wouldn't that be the better approach rather than just doing away with fossil fuels prioritizing carbon capture so that we can make the breakthroughs that the rest of the world can then use to decarbonize should really be at the top of the list of our energy innovation priorities so rich would you think that would you concur that the global environment will not improve measurably if america alone decarbonizes i would okay is there what policies is in the remaining few seconds here what what else would you be saying for us that we should be adapting well i think if you look back at the energy act of 2020 the technology that received the most bipartisan support in that very bipartisan bill was carbon capture that bill now calls for a massive demonstration program for carbon capture technologies but a lot of work remains to actually implement that and so i would encourage this committee and all of congress to focus now on implementation thank you very much i yield back my balance my time

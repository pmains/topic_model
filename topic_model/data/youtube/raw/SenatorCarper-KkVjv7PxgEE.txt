this year on april twenty second we celebrate the 40th anniversary of Earth Day let me get it began today by thanking the earth day and network for allowing me to take a few minutes to share with all of you some of my own thoughts about the importance of this day and what we can do every day to make our cleaner better place in which to live as remember the United States the Senate committee that's charged with protecting our environment earth day holds a special significance for for me Earth Day was founded as you know in 1970 by filename senator gaylord nelson of wisconsin and his purpose was to galvanize an environmental movement and highlight the need for everyone to pitch in and help clean up our environment as a young naval flight officer then i joined thousands of people in San Francisco to celebrate that very first Earth Day in a remarkable way that day in that celebration helped to change my own life and ultimately leading me to serve in the you know the same the same United States Senate believe it or not Cory a lord nelson served all those years ago earth day today is also a celebration of the progress we made to help clean up our nation and on this 40th anniversary or birthday we've got a lot to celebrate since the first earth day in 1970 we've come a long way and cleaning up our environment our air is cleaner our water is safer to drink but there's a lot more that we can do a whole lot more as a member of Congress I work every day with my colleagues to confront and solve some of our biggest environmental challenges climate change air pollution water quality among them however I find some of the best solutions to these challenges can come from a relatively small steps taken by a whole lot of people step that each of us can take on our own daily lives that added together will result in huge improvements to our environment first almost all of us can be more energy efficient as i like to say the cleanest most affordable energy is the energy we never use think about that there can be more energy efficient in our homes more energy efficient in our cars for example lighting accounts for some fifteen percent of all our household energy use fifteen percent if we all swapped out five traditional light bulbs for Energy Star compact fluorescent light each of us would save about 60 bucks apiece per year in electricity costs we'd save energy we'd reduce emissions simply moving up our thermostats by 2 degrees in this summer and down by 2 degrees in the winter from where we'd normally would set them can eliminate about 2,000 pounds of co2 per year now as delawareans were lucky to be one of the first states and in fact we were the first state in the country but we were one of the first states in the nation to have a statewide electrical smart grid program through Delmarva powers program will be able to monitor and track your energy usage making it easier to become more energy efficient we could also be more energy efficient by driving less frequently to work or perhaps carpooling or taking public transportation more often and you might be surprised to know that it in Delaware over eighty percent of our residents drive alone to work we're not proud of that but if just one person for household left their car at home and commuted by public transportation carpool bicycle that household would reduce its carbon footprint by thirty percent per year think about that thirty percent seconds of all thing we could do is to recycle I love recycling because it helps to reduce our landfill input it preserves precious resources in virgin materials and it reduces our dependence on fossil fuels if everyone in our country increased by say ten percent the the number of bottles and cans that we recycle we conserve enough energy to get this heat sift second for 74 million homes provide electricity for two and a half million Americans and save nearly 40 million dollars in crude oil costs you know we throw away enough aluminum cans in the trash and in the United States of America each year to completely fill our nation's rebuild clearly rebuild our nation's domestic airline fleet every three months talk about low-hanging fruit in closing I just want to invite my fellow Delawareans to celebrate this 40th anniversary or birthday not just on this day per year I put on every day per year and if we can do that not not only would we save ourselves a lot of money I would also go long wait saving our planet so on this earth day happy Earth Day together our small choices are going to make a huge difference thank you very much

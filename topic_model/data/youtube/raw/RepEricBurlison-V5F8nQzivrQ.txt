hi I'm representative Eric Burleson I'm coming to you with this week with another Capitol report we're standing underneath the Missouri House of Representatives underneath the chamber and carved into the marble above me are the words that labor is the great producer up well we couldn't be in a better place for the times that work that we're dealing with today in Missouri work for having very difficult times where people are facing nine and a half percent unemployment and while yet we face these difficult times our congressional leaders in Washington are considering mounting further burdens on our honor people in difficult unemployment times and I think that we see the response this very week in Massachusetts when the voters went to the booth and voted to reject what's happening in Washington and this very week here in the House of Representatives I'm proud to tell you that we did the same thing we're listening to you and we want to hear from you and that's why this week i can tell you i've heard from you I've heard got so many emails and responses from people that want us to reject what's happening in Washington and so this week we passed house resolution house concurrent resolution 18 that sent a message to our congressional delegation that we oppose what's happening in Washington and we asked our other leaders other statewide officials as well to join us and telling our congressional delegation to tell senator kit bond to tell Senator Claire McCaskill but they must if they if they care about the stings are they must oppose care proposed in Washington and bring about true reform that will bring accessible health care and quality health care to the people deserve this is something that we have to do is stay with this and I challenge you to ask your congressional delegation to ask also the statewide officials where do they stand on these issues and don't accept don't accept answers that are not I a yes or no whether they supportive they don't you need to know what their opinions are on this issue and i can tell you clearly that i oppose it we have a tough four months ahead of the same azzurri we have a huge budget deficit shortfall estimates are across the board but they're somewhere around eight hundred million dollars that we're sure but i will promise you that we're going to balance that budget without raising taxes it's imperative that we do without raising taxes we have learned from watching the stakes in Washington that we cannot print money and mount future debts on on current and future taxpayers it doesn't work and it doesn't revitalize the economy printing money and government spending doesn't create jobs as you can tell you create jobs the work of your labor is what creates and produces well and that is why it's our responsibility to provide a balanced budget without raising your taxes the role of government is not to create well as much as politicians want you to believe that we're not what creates wealth it's you and that's why it's our job right now when the stop being regulators to start being enables last year we passed many bills that reduce taxes on business and tax burdens on families and this year you can expect the same we in Missouri are going to be passing more bills to help reduce your taxes not increase we don't worry more about the budget that's happening on your kitchen table in your home then we are about the budget budgets and care on the the boardroom tables of all the bureaucrats in Jefferson state we're going to have faced difficult cuts in those rooms but we would rather see those people get cut then you get cut and your families they fight and because of these decisions we've Missouri is positioned well Moody's Investor Services has indicated that Missouri is one of the state's that's going to lead the rest of the nation in in a recovery in economic recovery and they didn't give us this monitor or anything they gave this moniker to Missouri because of the fiscal proves that we had because of the decisions that we made and because we made moves to make Missouri and a job friendly state I'm going to continue to join my colleagues in the house to try to balance the budget this year and make sure that we encourage do everything to encourage job growth in Missouri and I welcome your comments I'm listening to you and I please want to hear from you if you have any comments please get ahold of me at my office in Jeff City or you can call my home or on myself thank you very much

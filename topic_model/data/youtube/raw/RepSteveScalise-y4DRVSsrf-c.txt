people we encountered was a young girl maybe no no more than 10 years old who was crying and we asked her why are you crying and she said because i don't want to be here i'm a father how could president biden and kamala harris allow this to go on and not even come here and see it for themselves it's a disgrace all right minardi with steve scalise up visiting the border the rio grande specifically with a large group of republicans at these first hand for themselves out of mission texas and a boat tour what conditions are like there let's just say getting more crowded we've got the latest from the border as well as the mixed signals we could be getting out of the administration as to who if anyone could be coming next from the white house also we'll be hearing from rick perry the former governor of texas and indeed the former energy secretary of the united states it's a busy show the focus right now is on the border what's going on there largely based on investigations with different parties sending different groups at different times to echo the same theme it is getting to be rather dangerous down there welcome everybody i'm neil cavuto and this is your world alex hogan has been seeing all of this firsthand she joins us right now out of mission texas hey alex hi neil in the early hours of the morning we were able to join border patrol and to step into their shoes and see how they view this immigration challenge and what we found in the dark families and people traveling alone who banded together for safety in numbers some of those people were seriously ill and needed immediate medical treatment others were lost and needed directions not knowing where to go what we've seen also is the number of children increasing there are more than 19 thousand children who crossed the border just last month alone now border patrol council vice president president chris cabrera says that in the last 20 years it's the busiest he's ever seen it the worst thing we can ever do is become numb to something like that because that's not normal but it's becoming all too common to us now that we see these kids that are in situations like that the tour was organized through a trip led by house republican whip steve scalise the delegation will continue their visit to the border meeting with other agencies among them the texas department of public safety scilly's calling on the president to come down to the border and hear these stories for himself and to take immediate action back here live with our fox flight team president biden's 2022 discretionary funding request has eliminated funding for the unfinished parts of the border wall sections here along the rio grande river have been finished through private funding but not all of them however one resident who spent his own money has finished part of the wall on his own land and even built a road for border agencies to use on his property meanwhile back there this morning in the brush when we saw some of these migrants come over from the rio grande river i talked with one boy he was a 17 year old he had been traveling he'd been on the road for one month he was hoping to reach north carolina as we continue to see more and more migrants this is happening every single day every single hour neil and the numbers just grow and grow and grow alex hogan great reporting thank you very very much to rick perry right now the former governor of the state of texas one of its longest serving governors i might point out the former energy secretary of the united states as well governor thank you for taking the time um it just seems out of control semantics uh really don't matter what you call a crisis or serious insurance it's a mess um and it's getting messy and it's getting more crowded so what to do it is the the issue has been around for some time in 2012 we saw the trains that were coming up to the border that's when we first deployed in the state of texas at the obama administration at that particular point in time signaling not anywhere near as strongly as the biden administration but even then they were signaling come on up and that that signaling is the real problem that's the real issue that and then the commitment that you don't see from this administration to secure the border here's the untold story i think neil that we really need to talk about what is happening along that border that the message that's being sent now is that it's okay to sexually traffic children because that's that's what's happening down there in a lot of different cases and that that business now is now greater than the drug trade and not only are you know this administration and and they're seeming lack of caring about human beings that are being trafficked out of central and and central america and mexico up into the united states i mean there's a film that's going to be coming out very soon called the sound of freedom that talks about this issue hopefully it will really get the american people's attention that this isn't about uh you know folks who are just having a difficult time in in their country and wanting to find a better life this is about modern day slavery that this administration by allowing this to happen but by not sending the signal don't come uh they're supporting it i don't know how they can have a conscience at all i mean to to stand up and say you know where's your shame in allowing this type of activity to occur it's just this is inhumane in in the greatest sense neil all right now they'd like to point out that these these cases you're talking about are very rare we could go back and forth on that what we do know to your point in being a governor that that the funding along the border was not a priority in this latest skinny budget that the bite administration released today no border wall funding here a lot of the addresses are uh you know discretionary uh uh non-defense related items but very little to address the kind of thing you're talking about so what so maybe yeah maybe there is a reason to go take a look at this uh for the vice president to you know break away from whatever she's doing that's so important to go to the border you know she didn't have to go to the border of texas if she doesn't decides that's not where she wants to go there's plenty of border in arizona new mexico california what is happening is unconscionable and i don't know how they can stand up in front of the american people and say uh we have a caring bone in our body knowing what's going on there and and i will tell you if they are standing up and saying well these are very rare occurrences of people being sexually attracted they're just wrong they are absolutely wrong this is a massive problem that this open border is promoting and they are going to be held accountable for it and they should be now in the meantime we do know the numbers are exponentially growing at the rate some say i saw one study that would put it at 5 000 to 7 500 a week at this rate now a lot of the people uh you know were first if they're young and they're these migrant minor you know the holding cells or whatever they want to call them they're later sent to other locales all over the country uh we're also litigating a lot of the other cases on the american side of the border prior to the mexican side of the border as it was under president trump what is your best guess governor as to where those who are having their cases litigating the united states now uh where they go how many of them do you suspect will return to either mexico or point south very few would be my bet that's what we've seen through the years i mean history is a pretty good teacher once they get into the united states and they try to dissolve into to the society this administration is uh seems to be rewarding them for for doing that if if you'll just get here we'll take care of you from from now on out um what a what a horrible message number one because it puts them in so many cases in danger uh and to to debate people into uh trying to come on this very difficult trip where you've got cartels and other criminal elements that are going to use these individuals in a lot of different ways as we talked about already in the in sexual trafficking side as mules to bring drugs in i mean there is so much wrong with what's going on down there we know that you know governor to your point to your point to your point governor and i'm sorry to jump on you there but we're getting word that roberta jacobson is the coordinator for the southwest border is resigning she is leaving this is coming from jake sullivan of the national uh security adviser saying that ambassador roberta jenkins leadership in serving as special assistants of the president coordinator for the southwest border has been an invaluable contribution to the biden harris administration and to the u.s ambassador jacobs has dedicated her career to working tirelessly to advance u.s interest in the western hemisphere i could go on but she's leaving she hasn't been on the job long what do you think well i i let her speak for the reasons that she's leaving but my bet is that the individual that you mentioned miss jacobson may have a conscience and she may be seeing what's going on and recognizing that she can't live with herself if she continues to allow the activities that are going on on that border to go uh to go forward without addressing or or she or she could have been forced right she could have been forced out that's been known to happen as well but the point is you know i i think we can't sidestep what's going on down there uh and the idea in particular i'm going to keep going back to this issue of the the sexual trafficking of individuals uh particularly children is unconscionable it is going on down there and the policies that are put in place by the guiding administration it helps that occur and they've got to stand up they've got to face this they've got to address this issue and there's no you know dancing around it they're going to be held accountable for it and they need to be held accountable for it now before it goes on further all right governor i want to thank you very much as always as we do each and every day reached out to the administration or spokesman anyone to come on and address this uh they have not in the meantime i want to keep you arrested some other developments on the virus by and large in most states

hearing will come to order welcome welcome our guests are witnesses the first panel as well as our second panel especially want to welcome back senator Danny akaka whose have been on the DL for for a week or two but he's back can fit and rested and there we need him at his best in that's what we're going to get happy him with here with the senator Akaka was there with the ranking republican scott brown and with with all of you this is not the first hearing that we've held with regards to the Postal Service's financial challenge but it's an important one it's an important one and while the witness list at this hearing is full of familiar names and and organizations the hearing today is likely to be somewhat different from those we've held in the past it needs to be different because the crisis the Postal Service faces is more urgent now than it's been in the past absent prompt and dramatic action on the part of Congress our next postal hearing may well be about how we pick up the pieces from a shutdown in operations is my hope that this hearing will jump start this process of developing a bipartisan bicameral consensus around the changes needed to restructure the Postal Service's finances and transform its operations to reflect the uncertain future that it now faces just last week proposal Service Board of Governors released some sobering data on the Postal Service's financial performance in the second quarter of this fiscal year which ended on March 31st the board also released numbers summarizing mail volume in revenues for the fiscal year to date these data show that as those of us who follow postal issues fear it may happen the Postal Service is not recovering along with the economy as a whole rather the continued electronic diversion of the mail is likely to permanently reduce mail volume despite the Postal Service's best efforts to bring in new customers and preserve those that it has today and the period mature but between the beginning of january and the end of this March mail volume declined by just more than two percent versus the same period last year this follows two quarters of modest growth at the same time the postal service most important product first class mail actually lost six percent of its volume containing its pattern of years of steady decline these developments are contributing to losses by the Postal Service's midway through the current fiscal year the Postal Service's book losses totaling some 2.8 billion dollars its projected losses for the year now stand at eight point three billion dollars nearly matching the record eight point five billion in losses experienced last year these volume and revenue numbers are all worse than the Postal Service initially projected and if the losses at the end of the year are truly as bad as we're now being told they'll be I understand that the Postal Service will have exhausted all of its 15 billion dollar line of credit from the Treasury by the end of sep tember and will limp into the fiscal year 2012 with just enough cash on hand to get by and doesn't get a lot better from there getting by in 2012 will likely mean that the Postal Service will not be able to make its 5.6 billion dollar retiree health pre-funding payment and could even have difficulty making other normally routine pension and workers compensation related payments on top of that a major crisis that occurs over the next year or so such as further economic slowdown or a terrorist attack could well push the Postal Service over the edge into insolvency and result and is shutdown of its operations something that none of us want or need if the Postal Service were to shut down the impact on our economy would be dramatic as postmaster general Donna who will testify to us today the Postal Service operates at the center of an industry that employs some seven million people and generates more than one trillion dollars in sales and revenue each year at such a difficult time for our country we cannot afford to put those jobs in that kind of productivity in jeopardy in recent years the Postal Service's done it's a chair to respond to the declining demand for a hardcopy mail and to better align its costs with its revenues total costs have been reduced by 12 billion dollars in recent years a big contributor to that success has been the elimination of more than one hundred and thirteen postal service jobs since 2007 through attrition and more than 200,000 over the past decade I think that represents a reduction in workforce by a bit over a little bit over twenty-five percent these savings are contained continuing with the Postal Service's new contract with the American Postal Workers Union which includes wage and benefit concessions in significant new workforce flexibilities in addition the Postal Service has introduced and successfully promoted a number of new products a number of them and one of those may be the best known is the flat rate priority mail box we are rapidly reaching the point however at which the Postal Service no longer has the authority under current law to do what it needs to do in order to survive and prosper that's why I've going to now it's why I'm introducing today legislation that aims to clean up the Postal Service's finances and help it implement the ambitious reorganization plan that it announced last spring the main provision in my bill the postal operations sustainability and transformation act or the post Act aims to permanently address the various pension and retiree related issues that have plagued the postal service for years now the Postal Service the Postal Service's Inspector General the Postal Regulatory Commission and two independent actuaries have all come to the conclusion that the Postal Service has overfunded its obligation to the Civil Service Retirement System by between 50 and 75 billion dollars in addition numerous observers and even the posts live in the office of personnel management have pointed out that the Postal Service has paid seven billion dollars more then it owes into the Federal Employee Retirement System my bill would give the Postal Service access to the funds it is overpaid it would be able to use them to make it's required retiree health pre-funding payments taking upwards of five billion dollars off its books each year for the next several years over one rather once those payments are satisfied the funds that this bill would free up could be used to pay workers compensation obligations and to retire debt owed to the Treasury these changes are something very similar to them will need to be a vital part of any effort to improve the Postal Service's financial condition in both the short and the long term but stopping with these reforms and avoiding further potentially more difficult changes simply will not be enough the Postal Service is projecting human love losses of more than two hundred and thirty billion dollars between now and 2020 230 billion the savings generated by the pension and retiree health reforms in my bill and in others that have been introduced including a bill introduced by Senator Collins and bills introduced in the in the house would only address about a third of these losses in addition the Postal Service's latest financial data shows that even if the retiree health pre-funding payment is not made this year the Postal Service would still face the risk of insolvency and shut down in 2012 and even if the 2012 retiree health payment is also not made the Postal Service would enter 2013 with no cash and no borrowing room at all more will clearly need to be done that is why my bill takes important steps toward truly giving the Postal Service the flexibility that those of us in Congress I say we want to give them to adapt to new realities and operate more like a business no business face the kind of difficulties and challenges that the Postal Service faces today would survive for very long if we were told how many retail outlets they should have and where they should be located or if it were or if it were prevented from making operational changes are taking full advantage of the resources and expertise that it has at its disposal yet that's what the Congress does to the postal service my bill aims to address these problems and to take Congress out of the day-to-day management of the postal service assuming that the Postal Service can continue to build on its reason cost-cutting efforts I commend them and the the labor unions that are represented they represent most of the workers but even if the Postal Service can continue to build on its recent cost-cutting efforts these changes could help set the postal service on a more solid footing and of years to come the report that Gao is releasing today on the state of the Postal Service's vehicle fleet provides I believe a valuable case study the report clearly details the negative impact and financial uncertainty and while meaning but sometimes harmful dictates from Congress have on postal operations GAO found for example that do at least in part to the Postal Service's dire financial situation postal management currently has no plan in place to replace its very large fleet of delivery vehicles some of which were first put on the streets a generation ago or more the costs of operating and maintaining these vehicles are increasing and in at least some cases it's having a negative impact on operations I believe it's unacceptable that the Postal Service has no plans to date to begin replacing its aging fleet perhaps with more fuel-efficient vehicles the purchase of which in large numbers could help commercialize important new technologies but it's also on the unacceptable that postal service has been placed in this position financially in part due to the acts of Congress or to the inaction of Congress I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today about these and other pressing issues facing the Postal Service I'd also note that Senator suitland Susan Collins with whom I've worked on a lot of issues and the past including postal issues has introduced her own bill and there's a fair amount of overlap between what she's proposed and what what you'll find in the legislation i'm introducing today my hope at the end of the day that Senator Collins and I who've worked on these issues and others in the past will find common ground that's what we need and we need to as I said earlier we need to develop a bipartisan bicameral approach to these to these to address these challenges in my hope is that the many of the members Democrat and Republican of the subcommittee and this committee will be part of the that solution

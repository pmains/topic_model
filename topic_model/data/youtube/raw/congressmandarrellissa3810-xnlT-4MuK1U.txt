I'm Congressman darrell Issa during the 18 years I served in the House of Representatives there were plenty of times that would have been convenient to his mail in a ballot to just phone in a vote or to hold a hearing by phone we didn't do that because only by coming together can we work in Brotherhood to solve America's problems hearts and minds are not changed without human beings coming together and no place needs to come to common ground more than the United States Congress this isn't just a tradition of two hundred and thirty plus years our Constitution calls on the House and Senate to agree to a common place to meet in the same place and to only adjourn by mutual consent of both houses our founders expected us to do no less throughout our history when the Capitol was burned in 1812 during the Civil War while they baked bread for the Union Army in the basement and even on 9/11 we did not run from the Capitol lightly and we did not fail to meet as one body in fact on the evening of 9/11 even well aircraft and buildings were still smoldering the men and women of the United States House came together on the steps of the Capitol saying in unison and pledged to continue our job there on the floor of the house at a time when men and women throughout the country are going back to work finding ways to work safely in jobs that require they'd be much closer together than just sitting at a dais or walking on the House floor it is reprehensible to consider that Congress would phone it in I call on Nancy Pelosi to reverse her position to bring the Congress together to do the people's work

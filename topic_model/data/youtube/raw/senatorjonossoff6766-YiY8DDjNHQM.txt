right now and finally you mentioned the american rescue plan but there's also the big infrastructure bill you are the youngest elected senator i think you've just turned 34 you're a millennial what does it mean to your generation who's gone through the recession uh you know the threat of climate what what does all of this mean to the future generation of americans look the united states and all of humanity are at an inflection point right now the decisions that we make about the transition to clean energy dramatic reductions to greenhouse gas emissions investments in sustainability and infrastructure will not determine just the continued strength and greatness of the united states but also our capacity as a species to flourish without destroying our environment my generation more than any other is committed to making that transition it is one of our generational obligations to see to it that we make these investments and that we enact policies that will allow our species to thrive without undermining the basis for life on this earth and those are indeed the stakes as we contemplate this infrastructure bill here in the united states but the opportunities christian are enormous as i just mentioned a 2.6 billion dollar electric vehicle battery plant was threatened by a trade dispute recently in my home state of georgia my team stepped in president biden team stepped in we mediated a settlement to that dispute and now thousands of georgians will be working in skilled jobs producing electric vehicle battery technology for decades to come we can employ our people and save our planet by making smart investments in green technology in clean energy production we have to do it now and it is truly a test of our capacity as a country to assert our vision our strength and our greatness by investing in our infrastructure and saving our environment senator also thank you so much and certainly when the infrastructure bill passed we saw headlines all over the united states where local newspapers were welcoming all the projects that they thought might come their way for their people so thank you so much indeed

is recognized for three minutes I rise in strong opposition to this cynical and misconceived funding bill designed to push us into a government shutdown yesterday we saw this majority on a party-line vote Rob food from the mouths of over four million low-income Americans including children seniors and veterans this resolution before us would only further punish American families and accelerate the majority's race to the bottom in fact the majority's leadership has been quite explicit about their intentions they want to lock in the cuts that we have seen to education programs health programs they want to make those cuts permanent that's their opening position they've also been quite upfront that the only way they would mitigate against these cuts is in exchange for cuts to Social Security to Medicare and to Medicaid and even though these deep cuts are producing harmful results all over the country the majority wants to use them as leverage for further negotiations it is about ideology and it is just a game to them people's lives don't seem to matter let me remind this body of what's happening all over America because of the across-the-board cuts more than the 57,000 children are losing access to early learning through head start over 1 million of our most disadvantaged children at thousands of schools across America would lose access to the support they need to provide the instruction that they need already overburdened state local education agencies are being forced to pick up a higher share of the costs for educating more than 6 million students with special needs and over 30,000 kids are losing access to childcare putting the parents job and their families Economic Security even more at risk hundreds of thousands of unemployed adults veterans seniors and dislocated workers are losing access to job training programs the biomedical research that saves lives and cancer diabetes autism that research is being curtailed I'm a cancer survivor biomedical research and the grace of God have allowed me to stand here today but they would cut off biomedical research it's either going to be delayed or lost and the list goes on food safety law enforcement public health we compromise our economy the health and the well-being of American families and our very future as a nation instead of working to pass a compromise bill that addresses the budget in a serious and in a responsible manner they have used this process to try yet again to derail the Affordable Care Act and deny Americans affordable health care for the 42nd time these members have health insurance most Americans do not that they can afford 30 seconds thank you thanks of gentleman is recognized for an additional one minute members of Congress have health insurance people in this nation can't afford health insurance but they would cut it off they would make it impossible for people to get preventive care to keep their kids up to age 26 on their own health insurance coverage and say did the insurance companies go for it again you can deny people health care coverage and talk about pre-existing conditions families all over America is struggling this budget resolution is designed to make it worse for them this is not a game we are talking about people's lives we have a moral responsibility we are here to represent the American people not our own personal agenda not our own political agenda and our own ideology we have to do better and so we must vote against this bill and I yield back the balance of my time

scott on the senate side is trying to come up with a bill that can come out of the senate and i know you've been talking slash negotiating with him uh how are those conversations going let me just say there has been one conversation with senator scott there have been numerous conversations with house republicans for us to have something that's symbolic that actually doesn't have accountability and isn't transformative would really not address the current situation and so the fact that they want to keep talking i view that positively they have not closed the door completely and so we'll see where we get there's areas of common ground but then it comes down to well is it mandated is it required uh can you navigate that i mean speaker pelosi's example of you know how do you navigate uh the middle space between no no choke holds and uh and you know choke holds but only if you feel like your life is in danger which is basically what the senate republicans have put forth well let me give you another example um and to senator scott's bill when it comes to no knock warrants which is what led to the death of brianna taylor what he wants to do is document it and study it but in fact no knocks have already been studied one of the things i think they might not understand is that we're not calling for the public to have access to a database that shows officers who might have shown up late or to have complaints that haven't been substantiated tamir rice died he was killed when he was 12 years old that police officer had been fired from another department but the but the department that hired him was not aware of it and so the number of people that have been killed because of bad officers bouncing from department to department i mean that's not something to really negotiate we're talking about uh substantiated abuse complaints we've actually had this conversation now right for many years what do you think makes this time different that you can get real reform that maybe wasn't possible 10 years ago 15 years ago the public execution of george floyd took us across the threshold where there's no turning back to see for eight minutes and 46 seconds where police officers were ate willing to do to this beautiful man and then when we heard his words on the cat the body cam just recently it just had so much power there's so much power congresswoman best in the past although we have seen a number of people killed on cell phone camera video this one was you could not dispute what happened in the past people would say well we don't know what happened before the camera was turned on and we don't really know who this individual was as the speaker mentioned we all watch this and i think the egregious manner in which he was killed was just horrific and it outright it outraged the entire world madam speaker uh are you optimistic then i i can't tell from this conversation if we're feeling good about being able to actually get something to come out of this time that has a lot of public support at this moment or if you're pessimistic because some of these conversations sound like people are far apart well at this moment i always quote president lincoln he said public sentiment is everything with it you can accomplish almost anything without it practically nothing and the public sentiment is there very much there uh to pass this legislation and there's no reason for the republicans not to accept it in the senate we need to get this done for the good of the country thank you both for joining me the speaker of the house nancy pelosi and chairwoman karen bass joining me thanks guys thank you thank you

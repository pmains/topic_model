michael waltz he's a former green beret commander he now serves on the house armed services committee congressman the russia experts all say the same thing about this case this is one woman one person who got caught up in the u.s russia relationship she's now being used as a pawn this is really just another way for russia to try and stick it to the united states yeah absolutely look um this is uh this is brakeman's brakesmanship at its worst and um this is exactly what our adversaries try to do and this is why having a clear message from the white house is so critical our adversaries are emboldened by weakness and they are deterred by strength uh and and then this is exactly why we need strength from this white house and look uh when it comes to hostage affairs when it comes to having a clear message to our adversaries we can't go down this slippery slope uh and unfortunately this is exactly what the white house is doing well so they say or john kirby and the state department says um you know they have made the terms very clear they've put forward this offer of a prisoner swap uh two people in exchange for a russian arms trafficker who's due to be released from prison in about a year from now but they haven't heard back what do you make of that i mean it's been over a week now i thought yeah but that's because the because the white house offered an unprecedented offer which was the notorious arms dealer victor boot who the russians have been asking for for years for a number of americans uh and this guy listen jillian this guy has provided weapons to terrorists all over the world has provided weapons to the most notorious and brutal of groups and the russians know that the russians want them badly but in this case they see an opportunity they see an opportunity to not only get him because uh brittany griner is a celebrity and she's being celebrated by the mainstream media as a celebrity uh they see an opportunity to not only get him but to get more uh and again you know once people like the russians the iranians the chinese smell weakness they're not only going to go for an unprecedented swap they're going to want double triple quadruple what they normally could get and they feel like they can get this from the white house that's why they're asking for even more that's why they're stonewalling despite this unprecedented offer for the notorious arms dealer victor boot in exchange for brittany griner and an additional american and you're seeing them go for broke right now because they smell weakness in this white house i mean the russia u.s relationship is at an all-time low right now as you lay out we got no leverage so why do you think the president released this statement right after her sentence came down a little while ago uh demanding her release i mean he knows secretary of state knows anybody with you know two eyes and two ears knows that's not happening why would he release that statement well you know i mean one one can only speculate and and again look i i want to be clear my heart is broken for the grinder family my heart is broken for all americans around the world we have several dozen that are held hostage right now or that are in legally or unlawfully detained uh but this is when we have to show strength tonight weakness and i don't think that statement showed strength frankly uh and you know we have to show them that there is a lot of downside to taking americans hostage not upside right now our adversaries whether they're terrorist groups like the taliban al qaeda isis or rogue regimes like the iranians uh and the russians they only see gain they only see upside from taking americans hostage and if we keep continue to cave we continue to make these kinds of deals uh that means there's a target on the back of every american traveling around the world and that's why these regimes or these terrorist groups continue to take americans hostage because they only what they're going to gain from it and that's got to stop and this administration unfortunately isn't putting a stop to it uh there's a good reason these hostage policies and prisoners policies have been placed for decades congressman we got to leave it there but thanks so much for joining us we appreciate it all right thanks so much

we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created as a member of congress i get to have a lot of really interesting people in the office experts on what they're talking about this is the podcast for insights into the issues china bioterrorism medicare for all in-depth discussions breaking it down into simple terms we hold we hold these truths we hold these truths with dan crenshaw has landed welcome back folks another really interesting conversation upcoming here and this is about your health care and look it's dry it's kind of hard to understand a lot of people don't people just want to fix people just want to be cheaper and uh getting to that point is incredibly complicated and understanding the the debate between medicare for all and the more free market approach that republicans have and what that means for your health care what that means for prices and then everything in between that uh it's complicated and and worth unpacking to help me do that um i have lange chen with me and um he's from the hoover institution which as you may know is a uh conservative basically a conservative think tank at stanford university a very good one at that and uh when i visited and and would like to visit again so first of all lanie thanks so much for being on thank you for having me appreciate it so you kind of know what you're talking about here um i'm going to read a little bit of your bio you've uh first of all you've been a long-time policy advisor numerous presidential efforts uh romney ryan campaign uh marco rubio's campaign uh there was the bush cheney re-election campaign 2004 as well you're a senior counselor at the brunswick group a global business advisory firm you do a whole number of things um there's really too many to note here to be honest um what's your well i guess what's your what's your main there's a lot here uh you're very busy guy uh and very well qualified what would you say your day to day is like now yeah well i um i got a couple different things going on i mean i focused on healthcare issues and healthcare policy for the better part of the last 15 years and have been through a lot of these fights a lot of these debates we're going to talk about here on on this show uh i've been very engaged in trying to help conservatives and free market advocates come up with ideas on how we can make health care more affordable and more accessible right at the end of the day that should be everyone's goal and that's what i've been pretty focused on uh so i've got uh you know the fellowship at hoover i teach some at stanford uh do some do some business consulting and and stuff on the side so a lot of things going on but you know it does healthcare is really at the middle of a lot of this stuff it's it's fundamental to um how people view uh a lot of different things and if you don't have good health care it's very hard to do a lot of other things so so it's a huge issue it is and you know philosophically it's worth it's worth accepting some of the premises from the left sometimes on this which is we want people to have access to quality health care fair enough you know you want to have universal health care i can get behind that idea it now now the question becomes how you get to universal health care and uh it's either government-led or it's not or it's a mix and it's a complicated discussion so let's bring it to the immediate term um we're debating a 3.5 trillion dollar human infrastructure bill it's the reconciliation package that we're calling it um there's about a trillion dollars in new health care costs in the in that bill you know a broad question is if you're if we're spending a trillion dollar new dollars on health care and in this case it's really to prop up the aca obamacare medicaid medicare are we getting are we getting a trillion dollars better when it comes to health in america no no we're not i mean i think we have to start in my mind back at the basics and for me the basic question is how do you make health care more affordable right we all i think should share the goal of wanting more people to have access to affordable care and if that care isn't affordable if we don't have a system that's designed to ensure that we have a healthcare system that that costs a reasonable amount of money the conversation's almost worthless you can throw tons of federal dollars at any given problem and what you'll find is that you're really working on the margins you're really working at a very incremental level it's not going to be system changing so basically it's like you've got a car where the fundamentals of the car are are broken in some ways right you've got uh the engine is busted you've got some you know really fundamental issue and you're worried about tinting the windows right that's kind of the the the challenge we have and by the way you're taking it to a very expensive window tinter at that you know that's the challenge we face is that for the left a lot of this is how much more money can we spend the question i would rather ask is how do we make health care better how do we make it more affordable and i wish there were more in this large infrastructure package to lower costs that's not the focus of it right the focus of it is just how many more federal dollars can we throw up there to cover a what is actually in the grand scheme of things a pretty small number of people and that in my mind completely misses the conversation we should be having about health care yeah and like primarily this is extra additional spending for medicare it would expand medicare dental and vision allow more people to sign up for medicare it would uh force this what they call as a negotiation of drug prices it is not actually that we've gone over the hr3 issue uh in the past on this podcast but yeah what's some of the truth on some of these expansion of benefits um yeah well look medicare um medicare's a program that by and large people who are on it like it and and they like what medicare is doing um we added a prescription drug benefit to medicare back in 2003 that was much needed at the time uh it's actually done a pretty good job all things considered in terms of making sure seniors have access to the medicines they need but the medicare program is out of date i mean you you look at the program we have today the program that was first designed in the 1960s the realities of today are very different and we need to modernize the program so our focus really probably should be first of all on creating a program that makes more sense and what i mean by that is for example giving seniors choices and options so they can get their medicare benefits delivered through private plans if that's what they want a lot of those private plans offer some of the benefits that democrats are proposing to add already and so again i don't think anybody says look we want to give more seniors access to dental benefits absolutely we do the question is what's the right way to do it right is it by throwing a lot more money into a government-run program we're trying to create a healthier marketplace even within medicare so that people can have access to the benefits they want and need at a cost they can afford you know the reason why a lot of private plans in medicare already offered dental benefits is because people demanded that and there was a there was a need for that and so what happens in a marketplace is when you have a competitive marketplace and people are competing for business they start to add benefits to make their plans more attractive and that's what we've seen it's a program called medicare advantage right that's been pretty successful so my basic point is you know i'm not against the idea of offering more benefits through medicare i just think we have to be smart about the way we do it and the answer can't always be let's just go spend a bunch more money to expand a program that may or may not be working i think that's the challenge we have right now with what the democrats are proposing so would it be put simply would you just suggest obviously it's more complicated than this but an expansion of medicare advantage particularly because another data that i saw when it comes to dental vision for instance 95 percent of the people on medicare advantage already have these benefits that you'll envision and um but maybe explain for the audience uh what exactly medicare advantage is how it's different from normal medicare how many beneficiaries of medicare are on medicare advantage and just give us the summary of how that works so medicare advantage is is actually technically a part of medicare so medicare has different parts there's a part that covers your hospitalization if you end up in the hospital there's a part of it that covers what are called supplemental medical benefits but that's really a fancy way of saying your doctor visits right your non-hospital visits there's a prescription drug component we've talked about and then many years ago congress created what was originally called part c of medicare for a while was called medicare plus choice and then in 2003 they changed the name to medicare advantage and basically the concept is very simple which is you have private plans providing the medicare benefits but doing it competitively with one another and the the plans themselves assume some of the risk around ensuring you stay healthy as a medicare beneficiary and so we have in some parts of the country uh upwards of 60 70 of seniors on medicare advantage plans in other parts of the country it's lower it really depends on what state you're in and how competitive of a marketplace there are but my point about these medicare advantage plans is that often what happens is that seniors like the idea of being on these plans because they provide access not just to the traditional medicare benefits but these plans have added benefits right they'll say for example hey we're also going to provide you dental and vision at no added cost we're going to provide you a lower rate for example if you're a membership of a health gym if you if you work out or if you try to attend to your health or you walk on a regular basis maybe your costs will be lower so there's been some creativity in this program which because it's fundamentally a government-run program for many years there hasn't been that creativity allowed medicare advantage has really allowed some of that creativity to take off and so what medicare advantage basically is at the end of the day is it's a way for seniors to get their medicare benefits but to do it in a way that looks more like how non-seniors get their benefits through private plans right workplace-based private plans private plans they're buying on their own so it's really trying to take a program that was designed in the 1960s and modernizing it for 2021 and that's i think why medicare advantage plans have been pretty popular with a lot of seniors in some states how does that work for the senior so they're eligible for medicare and they want to sign up for medicare advantage do they just choose a plan but if they want maybe they want a plan that offers more benefits they can they can choose to pay more on top of that so they'll pay a little bit more yeah so they're basically getting they're subsidized by the medicare program to buy those in private insurance plans yeah yeah so so basically yeah there's a there's a certain amount of money that medicare kicks in right because you'd be getting your benefits before medicare advantage everybody got their benefits through a program through the medicare program in a system that we call fee for service that's a very fancy way of saying when you show up at a doctor's office for a particular treatment or a particular condition the physician and the providers get compensated per service they provide fee for service what medicare advantage tries to do is to basically package things together and say we're going to try to the extent we can to take care of you holistically rather than paying for things one by one right and that and that concept is really why medicare advantage plans in a lot of ways are able to be more efficient than traditional medicare and so what happens at the end of the day is yeah look you as a medicare beneficiary the government's going to pay a certain amount for your coverage just as they would if you've got your coverage fee for service if you get it in a medicare advantage they're going to pay a certain amount toward that and if you want more benefits or you want a different kind of plan you're going to pay a little bit more very similar to the way we do things in in commercial health insurance and regular health insurance for people who are not yet 65 yeah and the reason i ask about subsidizing the patient so that they can make choices that's kind of important for what i want to get to a little bit later about how we might look at the individual market outside of the medicare issue but that's so just plug in that for the audience but i want to continue on this conversation on on the solvency of of medicare um how is it paid for let's let's educate the public on this uh so it's paid well i'm just gonna tell everybody it's paid it's paid for through your payroll taxes uh much like your social security is paid for you know a portion of that goes into the medicare trust fund uh which is why it's viewed as this entitlement and people feel as though they've paid into it um and therefore they've earned it and that's i think that's partly true i think in the end though this was this was you talk about an old program it was designed for a population that was not living nearly as long as we're living now so i think most people it would seem tend to get a lot more bang for their buck uh and that seems great except that it also makes the program completely insolvent because we're living longer which is great but it also means that we need to reform these programs maybe talk to us about the financing for a little bit yeah so you've outlined it very well basically as i noted earlier there are many parts to medicare the part that covers inpatient hospitalization part a is financed by what's called the hospital insurance trust fund and that trust fund is paid for by your by your taxes by your payroll taxes out of every check you when you're working you will see a deduction for social security and a deduction for for medicare um what's the problem well the problem is more people are on medicare because we have a demographic shift going on in america where more and more people are the baby boomers are coming onto the medicare program and they're being supported by fewer and fewer workers because that's just the reality of our of our demographics in this country by the way the other problem we have there is that not only are there fewer workers supporting more people going on medicare but healthcare is getting more expensive every year so you have two problems you have a demographic challenge but you also have this cost challenge because healthcare is getting ever more expensive and more and more people are on the program you can quickly see what the problem is with the trust fund you've got the trust fund is being drawn down more quickly and the challenge is when that trust fund is exhausted in other words when the money in that trust fund is done and we start going negative medicare benefits have to get cut that's what the law says actually and there's no you can't choose by the way whose benefits get cut everyone's benefits have to get cut same thing happens with social security so when when people on the progressive left kind of basically say we don't have to worry about the trust funds i couldn't disagree more with that we do have to worry about the trust funds we have to worry about their solvency because those are tied to the ability of medicare to pay benefits and if we're not paying those benefits people aren't getting access to health care so um the financing of the of the that part of medicare is very precarious they're also as i mentioned part b part b is a essentially um medical visits doctors office visits those are funded by premiums people pay and the same thing goes by the way for prescription drug benefits part d those are also financed by by premium so the trust fund that we're talking about is specifically related to the inpatient hospitalization piece yeah which is often the most expensive um especially oh no question yeah uh it's okay so how does that financing get affected if we add a trillion dollars of spending uh to these programs which is really financed from the general fund uh because it would be passed in this reconciliation package how does that affect the overall solvency of it because it's not changing the structure you know what's your what's your take on that well it comes back to the overall problem we have which is that some people think we can print as much money as we want to um and you know the reality is that's going to cause all sorts of problems when you start printing too much money the money becomes relatively more worthless it's a process of inflation that we have that we're already seeing in our economy now because we've gone through a period of massive fiscal expansion a lot of spending has already been approved some of it because of the pandemic and coming out of that but some of it is just you know we've forgotten how much a trillion dollars is really worth honestly and so the challenge becomes the more fiscal expansion you have the fewer dollars there are going to be to pay for the things you really need to pay for like health care another way to look at it is at some point we're going to have to increase the amount of money we have coming in unless we want to borrow indefinitely which creates all sorts of challenges that we don't want right we don't want to be borrowing more money from countries like china who we fundamentally can't trust and so when you have a fiscal expansion it puts pressure on programs like medicare because the dollars there's only so many of them to go around and at some point if you need to bail out the medicare trust fund where's that money going to come from that's the basic point that's why you know democrats say well none of the spending is going to affect the trust fund and they're technically right but that misses the bigger point which is that if you got dollars sloshing around everywhere at some point you're going to have to figure out how you pay for this stuff and then it becomes a question of priorities right and and medicare is just going to be one of those priorities if you're going to bail out medicare because a trust fund's out of money but she's committed to spend money on something else that's where the problem comes in yeah and it's that gets to a larger discussion of debt and uh the issue with that is you know we don't know when it's gonna hit us across the head um it's right no economist does when is there too much debt when is it completely unsustainable um but back to the the medicare solvency the the the other issue is too you're expanding benefits you're expanding benefits and you're saying okay we're going to pay for that expansion out of the and correct me if i'm getting this kind of wrong because it's confusing you're expanding those benefits funded out of the general fund which means we're just borrowing the money and the but the thing is is those are expanded benefits that will never go away the the money we're allocating to this is part of a 10-year budget but those benefits never go away so does it move up the uh the estimated date of medicare insolvency from the trust fund specifically yeah so the adding the so this is part of the argument democrats make is they say listen we're adding these benefits but because they're outpatient benefits they don't affect the trust fund remember we talked about the trust fund being just for hospitalization so technically they're not wrong about that right because the the hospitalization piece the trust fund piece is separate the trust fund as we've talked about already has its own problems um it's a question of how quickly that trust fund gets exhausted it's not if it's when the separate problem that we're talking about now is when you're borrowing money to pay out of the general fund for additional benefits and those benefits never go away you have just committed yourself to spending an indefinite amount of money over not just the next 10 years but into perpetuity basically so it feeds into the debt question in my mind which is how are you going to pay for all these benefits you're not going to pay for it out of the trust fund that's true the trust fund is for hospitalization but that trust fund has its own problems now you've created a second problem which is how you're going to pay for all these extra benefits you've just added and in my mind that is a challenge that nobody has answered the question i mean nobody has said how you're going to pay for this stuff they haven't they they don't have an answer for it right because their answer is well we'll just raise taxes and borrow more money and that's always the answer for these new benefits works out great uh you know one of the things they like to say too i mean if it's not medicare for all it's it's what mainstream democrats can get behind is lowering the age the eligibility age for medicare they want to lower it to 60 or 55 whatever and again it's a popular program so people are like well that seems fine right that seems like a a reasonable compromise now i'm not sure it's a reasonable compromise because i thought we should be increasing the age not decreasing it if if the entire point is to keep senior citizens out of poverty i would think that you know given that our our our um our life expectancy has gone up dramatically since these programs were instituted you would think we'd be raising it not lowering it same for social security um what other the other thing that strikes me is is interesting i think you wrote about this you write about everything so i'm sure you wrote about this um you know if we if we lowered the age to 60 i mean who are we helping and it turns out a very low percentage of that population is uninsured the other thing as a millennial that this that really gets to me is when we talk about these benefits is it's so clearly a transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich because what's the number one indicator of wealth in this country in any country it's your age i mean if you know nothing about a person and you want to know one defining factor about them and you know their age well then and if you guess that the older person is wealthier than the younger person you're normally going to be right and so it doesn't it doesn't make sense to me that we'd be giving that particular population more benefits and again make it really harming our solvency issue so so so that mere action would dramatically change our solvency issue and then the question is how do you pay for that yeah look i'm i'm for solving the problem right if if you said to me okay look if we lower the eligibility age now and say anybody who's 60 instead of 65 can get into medicare and we're going to be helping 30 million people i'd say well let's have that conversation that's not what's happening here we're talking about spending a massive amount of money expanding an entitlement program into perpetuity by the way crowding out coverage that's being provided already in the private sector in many cases shifting people from private coverage to government coverage and adding costs for people in your generation and mine to help three and a half million people basically and is there another way to help those three and a half million people absolutely there is let's figure out how to create competitive markets that lower the cost of health care expand the availability of benefits that's what we should be doing not expanding a government program to cover a few more people that's going to end up costing billions upon billions of dollars in the long run that's my issue with lowering the eligibility ages again it's the bazooka to kill an ant philosophy we should be figuring out how to target benefits and by the way a lot of people have advocated for these approaches basically let's help states expand coverage to more people let's give them more flexibility because the situation you face in texas is different than where i am in california in terms of the kinds of people who need help the nature of that help who is it that's uninsured we need to be much more targeted in our approach as opposed to saying well let's just expand the government program and and we'll figure it out later that that to me is totally the wrong approach uh let's let's move on to um your opinions on the affordable the affordable care act obamacare uh just maybe summarize for the audience what exactly it is but what exactly it changed i'm not even sure a lot of people really have a good grasp of how to describe that and um and what it really did to the market as a result yeah well look there's two thousand pages in the law so it it it could take us you know two thousand hours to figure out what's in it i'll i'll try and summarize it quickly basically what obamacare did was it tried to figure out how to make health insurance from one person to another look more similar all right so before obamacare we had a lot of different kinds of health insurance a lot of different kinds of benefits you could show up and say hey i'm young and relatively healthy i kind of want to buy a cheaper insurance plan and you know if i go snowboarding and i break my arm then there'll be coverage for that but otherwise the kind of what we might consider more nickel and dime stuff the plan wouldn't cover uh someone else might say hey look i want to buy the cadillac plan of cadillac plans i want to buy the plan that will cover everything from from the first dollar and you had that choice obamacare took that choice away and basically said everybody's got to have health insurance that has essentially the same suite of benefits and everybody's got to get charged the same amount with the exception of your age your gender and whether you smoke or not so it standardized the health insurance marketplace and limited the amount of competition in the marketplace that's the first thing that it did the second thing that it did is it basically created a set of rules around what health insurers could and couldn't do and that's related to the first point i made so for example you know health insurers couldn't kick you off coverage if you had a pre-existing condition they had to offer you coverage some of that stuff is very popular and for good reason and those rules work along with the rules i discussed earlier to basically transform the marketplace for health insurance the bigger part of what obamacare did is just to expand government coverage the single biggest source of new people getting health insurance through obamacare was through the expansion of a program called medicaid not medicare medicaid which is a program that is run jointly by the federal government and states and was originally created to help low-income single moms when the program was first created it was low-income single moms then it was low-income single moms and their kids then it was just low-income folks who were you know had particular conditions or situations then obamacare came along and said we're going to open up medicaid for anybody making less than 138 percent of the federal poverty line and that was as it turns out millions upon millions upon millions of people getting into government coverage when obamacare was first passed by the way they said every state remember i said it was jointly run by the feds and and the states they said every state has to expand medicaid uh there was a supreme court case that came along where the supreme court said not so fast you can't actually make states do that okay so so states have to have an option on whether they want to expand medicaid or not so some states did some states didn't but basically the core of obamacare really comes down to that a lot more people in government coverage a lot more regulation at the federal level and fewer choices in the marketplace um were there some things that did again that people like absolutely is obamacare ever going to get repealed probably not not where we sit today it's just been too long the program's been in effect for over 10 years can we change it to make it work better and to improve you know the cost situation the access situation can we renovate it can we figure out how to make the law actually work sure we can but the point is the core of obamacare the essence of obamacare really was how can we get the federal government more involved in health care yeah and it also it caused premiums to rise i mean the promise was that things that prices would drop as a result of obamacare that that promise was not realized uh we've seen consistent rises in premiums what's fundamentally what causes that well yeah i mean the reason why is is again there's there's two explanations one is healthcare is becoming more expensive so the input costs are rising but really the the bigger issue here is the reason why health insurance premiums on the obamacare marketplaces specifically you know obamacare obamacare created these marketplaces where people who didn't have job-based insurance could go by their coverage those costs have skyrocketed now why have they skyrocketed because there's no choice of plans anymore right you've basically said we've got to have the same kind of coverage and we're going to dictate how much these things are going to cost so what you're doing is i mean let's just be very clear about this you are increasing costs for people who are broadly healthier and broadly younger to pay for people who are broadly sicker and broadly older now as society we make decisions all the time to help people who are sicker and who are older to get coverage i i don't oppose that idea the problem is that obamacare is not transparent about it it basically says everybody's got to pay more and we got to pay more just because let's be clear about why we're paying more we're paying more because we basically said every single plan has got to look the same and it's got to have all these benefits by the way what obamacare said is you can't buy a plan without coverage for pregnancy now i'm all for that when you're talking about people who can actually get pregnant but does it make sense to add prenatal coverage all these other mandates to plans for people who don't need them my point is let's give a broader variety of choices and let people choose the coverage they want that suits them where they are in their lives and let's price it accordingly so it's just a different philosophy right obamacare is basically saying everything's gonna be the same and because everything's the same the costs have gone up yeah when you know with democrats let's call them more supposedly moderate democrats say they they're not for medicare for all they're just for all of these other programs whether it's the aca or whether it's lowering the eligibility age for medicare they're all there for all of these other options that put you on an inevitable path to where everyone is covered by either medicaid or medicare which kind of just looks like medicare for all so yeah i mean whether or not people talk i mean there's been talk about the so-called public option same problem right it's basically saying we want government to get in the business of competing against private plans and well what's going to happen if you subsidize something with taxpayer money of course it's gonna be cheaper right so then what's gonna happen is more more people get into government coverage ah well then they're already in government coverage it's a hop skip and a jump to medicare for all from there so all of these things are like gateway drugs for more federal involvement in the health care system and i think that's the challenge okay but what's wrong with medicare for all they say i mean what's wrong with me just going to a doctor and not worrying about the bill because they're just going to build the government because that seems kind of nice it does seem kind of nice it's very seductive actually and they point to other countries that have single-payer systems and they say hey people seem perfectly fine in the uk and canada and in countries around the world there there's a number of problems first of all fiscally it ends up being unsustainable right at some point because of health care costs going up and more and more people in government coverage it becomes so expensive that eventually the taxpayers got to pay for it and by the way not just rich people because that's the other thing that is used as a seductive part of this argument is progressives will say oh it's very easy you just tax the rich there are not enough rich people and there's not enough money there to pay for all the benefits they contemplate under medicare for all it is at some point going to mean that even middle-income taxpayers even lower middle-income taxpayers are going to have to pay more we've done the research we've shown that this is the case right so that that's the problem with it number one number two is you think there's really great innovation in health care in countries that have single-payer systems no there's not the reason the american healthcare system is creative and innovative and on the cutting edge is because we have a market-based system that's fundamental to why we have such an advanced healthcare system it doesn't mean that the care in canada or the uk is necessarily bad it just means they don't have innovation the other thing that they have that we don't have here is rationing they have the government because again if everybody gets their benefits to the government it's up to the government to decide who gets the benefits and who doesn't so what you have in the uk for example is if you want to get an advanced uh procedure done you got to wait in line or the government will say to you you know what you don't need that procedure yet and that's i think the most fatal flaw of the single-payer movement is this reality of direct rationing of care by the government in every single country that has a single-payer system bar none that is what happens and so uh you know it sounds great until you actually start to dig into it and realize what the implications of it are yeah i mean there's policy making is about trade-offs and people from canada come to the u.s because they can't get medical procedures done now look and they'll say americans go to canada because they can't get drugs at a reasonable price that's also true so um but i'd rather be in our situation uh where we're basically uh going on going on a healthcare tourism for for for the sake of lowering a price as opposed to healthcare tourism because my life depends on it because i just can't i can't get into that mri scan i mean the wait times the wait times are pretty significant and it's worth explaining to people why do wait times increase well it's because you have less doctors you have less facilities why do you have less of these things well because you're underpaying them because medicare for all i think put simply is just a series of price controls because now we control the entire market the government being being we and it's going to be a lower it's going to be a lower reimbursement rate than say that private insurance would pay um yeah one thing i want to ask you uh generally too is you say look one of the reasons these things aren't working as well is because price prices the price of health care generally just keeps increasing i think people have trouble understanding why that might be and the answer is of course complicated a lot of factors involved but maybe you could put it simply for us i mean is it are we getting more for at least a lot of those price increases or are we not um i think that's debatable as well yeah well i think the answer is sometimes we are um so part of the reason it's becoming more expensive is because technology is getting better and with technology and innovation comes invariably more costs now i think the bigger challenge we have in our health care system though is this i think this is why we're seeing costs go up as they are which is that we don't actually have a great sense for what we're paying for we don't have a lot of transparency into what things cost and what the benefits are and by the way the quality of care a lot of times we don't know what we're paying for you think about any marketplace right if you didn't have information about how good a particular tv was compared to another or how good a particular sandwich was compared to another they charge whatever they want for it right and i think that's what we have in our health care system is we don't have a great sense for what we're actually paying for and and some of that is built into our system because we have this system where we as the end consumers of health care don't actually know how much it costs because there's insurance the insurers are negotiating prices with the providers there's all these intermediaries who it's not necessarily bad my point is if everybody provided more transparency along the way and we had more control over the money we're spending then we would have perhaps a better pathway to lowering the cost of healthcare because you could have a competitive marketplace this is why for example i'm a big believer in health savings accounts which are basically um you know accounts that you keep and you save your own money for healthcare benefits and that money grows tax-free and you could use that effectively we're not using them as effectively as we can now because you don't actually have any way of comparing between different providers and prices and quality and so you are still spending somewhat blindly so over the last couple years there have been efforts to enhance transparency to make sure people understand a little bit better what their money is going toward those are very very important developments in our health care system and until and unless we get there it's going to be very hard to control costs yeah so it's a combination of a lack of choice of competition there's there's the great myth that we're in a free market health care system we're very clearly not uh it's maybe more so than other countries but it you know because at least there's profits involved but uh in a free market the way the way we might think about other industries uh and second of all there's just better stuff i mean which is which makes it more expensive i mean um which isn't a bad thing we do get more for our health care than other countries do it or more for our more for the price we're paying than other countries do we have to admit that uh we have access to far more new cutting-edge drugs than all of our other developed nations as well so people don't quite realize that um you mentioned health savings accounts so that's a good way to end the discussion because we got to tell people what we're four um it's and uh republicans have done a really bad job of this generally providing just a vision of like maybe not what next bill we want to pass but because i think it should be incrementally done like you said you're not going to just repeal obamacare what does that even mean at this point uh you you've got to change you got to change the system from within and change it slowly because it freaks people out when you start changing it radically about health healthcare and i think they made that pretty clear uh back in the you know i wasn't around thank god during those debates um for the repeal and replace debates people were really pissed off i mean they might not like obamacare but they're not sure why they don't like it but they also don't want massive change okay so what's our what's our vision and it and it kind of seems to me because we talked about this with reforming medicare for instance it's make it more like medicare advantage well medicare advantage fundamentally is you're subsidizing a patient uh you're empowering a patient to make choices on the market so the safety net's still there which is the whole point right that's that's the crux of the debate should there be a safety net and we could all agree there should be safety net's there but you also get that choice in competition along with it and uh which which maintains the level of quality that we don't want to lose which we would lose with medicare for all and so it seems to me like empowering the patient through health savings accounts um in a sort of medicare advantage kind of way maybe it's medicare advantage for all is really what we're looking for um we're not everybody is necessarily eligible for these subsidies but the people who truly need it might be and that could reply i mean and then at that point if that's the case then why do you need medicaid even you know are you even spending more money if you start to start to design a vision that way um and try to get there eventually what do you think of that general piece yeah well you know look i come back to a couple of core principles when i think about how to improve our health care system by the way my colleagues and i at the hoover institution we are developing now a comprehensive set of proposals that we can be for if we want better choice better competition lower costs more functioning markets we do need ideas and so we're we're going to put that out next year hopefully and and and get it into the bloodstream look i think there's a few things we got to do right one is we do have to empower the individual with information and choice and competition we need better information and then we've got to do our best to help people make smart decisions we've got to make sure that people can save and invest for their health care we've got to make sure that we bring the cost down and make it more affordable again through a healthier marketplace with more choice in competition we need to address constraints at the state level as well which is why i'm such a big fan of the federal government really giving states more freedom and flexibility all these decisions shouldn't be made in washington they really shouldn't because if you think about healthcare there's no national marketplace for healthcare it's all local so why are you regulating at the federal level for something that's so local so let's turn over to states more freedom and flexibility to use money to target the uninsured to get costs down let's give states incentives to create more supply of health care too right there's some places where we're seeing that costs are rising because of litigation health care litigation right doctors afraid of being sued and so they're practicing defensive medicine and their costs are going up we're seeing some places where we're not letting nurses practice to the top of their licenses that shouldn't be the case we need more supply not less so these are the kinds of things that can happen at the state level if the federal government just says you guys take the wheel we're going to give you maybe some guard rails but you go and you drive the combination of these policies i've just mentioned can do a lot not just to lower the cost of health care but as a result make sure more americans get access to quality coverage and that's what we want we should be a a party in a movement that says yes we want more people to have health insurance we want it to be better health insurance and we want that health insurance not just to be better and more accessible but also to have a better cost profile in the long run and we can do those things but we've got to start being in the ideas business again so so i am i'm actually very optimistic folks like you and others in the congress who are going to be able to hopefully start to set us on the right path when it comes to these things because for the last 10 years i just think we've gotten way too deep the federal government's gotten way too deep in the health care system and that to me is a recipe for unsustainability and and i think we all as we all being conservatives generally we agree with all of the policy measures that you just stated they would create a better system overall and and that should be a number one priority you know it's it's hard to tinker with the system if you don't if you don't deal with the foundational problems of it and everything you just mentioned does that but if i'm a liberal i'm going to have the question what about the people who are still too poor to pay for any premiums at all you know what do you do with them do you keep expanding medicaid because like 130 what was it aca is uh it makes 138 yeah yeah 138 of the poverty line that still ain't a lot of money so you know there's a sort of working poor class that that is in america and we have to acknowledge that as conservatives which which is kind of what brings me back okay what do we do about that because that's the it's that individual market right they don't have employer health plans uh they're too rich for medicaid and medicaid's a crappy program anyway so maybe maybe the people who are the working poor and the people of medicaid how can we better meet their needs and yeah it gets it gets me back to the sort of the medicare advantage design right it's if you if they what if they all had a health savings account and the government just injected depending on their income level depending on their situation it's means tested you inject money into that health savings health savings account with that they can they can purchase their direct primary care i'm a big fan of direct primary care yeah you know which which basically is a it's like a subscription service to a primary care doctor but you know we've talked about it a lot on this podcast i think but and then but in addition to that you can pay for your insurance as well uh so you're now in the driver's seat there insurance companies have to compete for you maybe there's a maybe there's a single point of a single website where you can actually more clearly uh shop for insurance you know but it just kind of exists right now in the aca in a way so i don't know this is that that's a little that's because that's the subject matter that that people are still concerned about that republicans haven't really answered yeah well we we have to be focused on the working poor there's no question about it and and what if we had a platform to your point uh where you got a lot of different plans competing for their business and you have the federal government kicking in some amount of money by the way state governments also can kick in as well to help make it more affordable uh you create a platform where they can have access to an affordable plan a choice of different plans right so it's not just a single plan like medicaid it's there's a bunch of different plans you can choose from and you are on the same marketplace as everybody else you know one of the things we have in this country we have way too much of is we we want to stick people into programs right why not just say hey look we got a great marketplace that we've got up and running and working well i don't care if you're making 125 of poverty or 500 of poverty you're going to be in the same marketplace and you get the exact same plan you don't get a plan that's earmarked for people on medicaid no you get the same plan the same benefits the same coverage as someone who's wealthier but we're going to give you a little bit more support because we know that you need a little more support to make it and and we should we should be willing to do that by the way we shouldn't be stingy about those things right i mean if people need help they've come on tough times they're working their way up they're trying to get to that next job that's going to pay them a little bit more to support their family we should be in a position to help them and we can be yeah yeah and i think that it also intuitively makes sense to people it's it's also very consistent with conservative principles it's how we see the housing market it's like do we want to stick people in this sort of section 8 program why not just give them a little bit of help with the rent and then put them in the same marketplace as everyone else instead of stigmatizing people in in the way that we do um and we might be on a better path and it seems to me that these it's difficult to get there it seems to me that this would require some incremental implementation over over many years so yeah to scare everybody off but i but i think it's important for republicans to actually provide a vision a you our idealist vision that we can describe to people in an elevator pitch because right now the democrats own that market really well medicare very simple to understand and it's a bit harder to explain um our yeah our position but i think we've done a pretty good job on this podcast i think we solved the world's problems no question we got there we did it we got there uh it's been almost an hour lonnie thanks so much for for being on that was very informative thank you and um and uh for those who stuck through it they're much they're much better much better posture to deal with the healthcare debate so thank you thank you where can people follow you um website or twitter or whatever it is yeah so my twitter is just at lon he chen l-a-n-h gotcha awesome ani thanks for your expertise on this appreciate it great to be with you

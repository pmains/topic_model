and with me on the phone now is Democratic senator Tim Kaine from Virginia senator your reaction to the President stated i'm andrea i think it was a very positive move by the president i have been urging it publicly and privately including in the conversation that the White House team had with senators on the Armed Services and Foreign Relations committees yesterday I don't think it's a weakening move I think it's a strengthening move obviously we'll have to see how the debate goes but but here here is my concern the decision about initiating military action is that is the most solemn decision that Congress or the president makes we cannot afford to send American men and women into military action unless they are confident that the political leadership of the country is behind them and so if we had sent into this very challenging situation all agree that the stakes are high if we had sent our young men and women into even a limited action that could have had following consequences at a presidential directive without being clear whether they had congressional support or with Congress trying to do what they often do which is evading accountability evading casting a vote on sensitive matters like this we would have been doing really harm significant harm to people that we want to defend us it's also critically important that they go into these military actions with the knowing that they have the support of the American public and one thing I can guarantee is that if we have this debate and we get a resolution passed the president presents it in Congress passes it an agreement upon a resolution I believe will also generate support from the American public but if it's ambiguous or equivocal about whether Congress and the president are on the same page we really are failing the men and women were asking to fight the battle should the president go ahead with military action which the White House tells us he will do if he loses the vote in Congress that's a hypothetical now and we'll get to that if we if we need to I do believe that the president secretary Kerry yesterday made a good case that there has to be a consequence for violating the long-standing international norm no use of chemical weapons especially against civilians that came out of a horrific use of chemical weapons in World War one has been in place for 90 years there's got to be a consequence to that hopefully the consequence would be an international and not just the US but the US has to make sure that people know they can't do that with impunity or we're going to see it in more countries in ways that will harm the United States and will harm our allies so my hope is in the debate in Congress you know we can articulate that principle and that the president can lay out a plan for the deterrence of future use of chemical weapons even degrading the ability of the regime to use them that's what we'll be working on this week I know the White House will be working with congressional leadership we're going to be getting classified briefings over the course of the week to prepare for the debate the week to follow but I think the president has done the right thing when we are united in military action we are very strong nor when we r divided we're not strong let me ask you a political question you were Democratic chair is it the right thing to do for the President and the Vice President go out right now and be playing golf well we've got all of our our forces who had been on alert out there in the Persian Gulf five warships now now we've got a lot of times in harm's way and I don't think look I everybody is entitled especially knowing what we are going to be doing over the course of the next few weeks people got to grab some R&R and and relaxation from stress where they can find it but I know what they've been up to the last few months because I've talked to the president and his team about Syria I know how seriously they've been taking this in this decision which you you know have reported was the subject of a great deal of thought that while there was precedent that presidents could act with impunity as you pointed out in in recent years it seems to have gotten to be more the case that presidents would act in bypass Congress and Congress has been willingly complicit in it the president his team gave us a lot of thought I think the president made the right call to get Congress engaged we're going to be working very hard together together over the weeks to come and I think we'll come up with the decision that the American public will support and ultimately that's what our fighting men women need senator Tim Kaine Democrat from Virginia thank you

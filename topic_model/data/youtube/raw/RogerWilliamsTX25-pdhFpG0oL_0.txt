is recognized for one and a half minutes thank you mr speaker soon we will vote to end funding for a government program that is at best unethical and at worst illegal the program known as operation chokepoint forces banks to discriminate against legitimate legal businesses today we know that banks are closing their customers accounts under a directive by the u.s department of justice there is no appeals process that's right the enforcer of the law of the land is backing this potentially unlawful program hard-working american businesses owners have their livelihoods ripped out from under them by a law established by this administration not by congress operation choke point is another example of how the obama administration has gone around congress to create laws rather than do their job to enforce the laws we already have on the books as a business owner myself operation choke point worries me greatly operation choke point is unamerican it's deceiving and simply wrong it is time this congress uses its power of the purse to rein in government overreach and restore government accountability i urge my colleagues to support this amendment to defund operation choke point in god we trust i yield back gentlemen

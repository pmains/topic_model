these talks they're extending through the weekend following the expiration of additional unemployment benefits for tens of millions of americans here to talk about it republican congressman from texas lance gooden he is a member of the house financial services committee congressman thank you so much for taking a few minutes out of your sunday night thanks for having me uh you know pretty important topic here these negotiations going on behind closed doors would you like to see that a little more out in the open you know where do you stand right now on the potential relief package well first of all i think i can speak for just about every member of congress when i say that we didn't run for office to sit at home while nancy pelosi the president and mitch mcconnell and the secretary treasurer and the chief of staff of the white house negotiate behind closed doors the american people hate this the american people are sick of congress waiting until the last second to finally get to talking about something and it's just so typical that the progress actually begins once members of congress have gone to the airport and flown home and that's where we find ourselves so this week what we're hearing is that progress is finally beginning to maybe happen staff members were meeting today tomorrow i believe mitch mcconnell is back in dc and he's going to visit with speaker pelosi i suspect they'll come up with something by the end of this week but the problem is is that the urgency that we had a few months ago where republicans conservatives like myself and conservatives in the senate like my senator ted cruz we were willing to swallow a bitter pill and perhaps vote for something we wouldn't normally vote for but as this thing drags on as nancy pelosi gets more of what she wants when these negotiations continue to progress i think you're going to see republicans eventually peel off and there's a less less of an appetite for republicans to vote for something that's terrible that has pork in it that has things like universal maryland ballet melon balloting an fbi building things that have nothing to do with coronavirus relief i think will ultimately derail this or at the very least ensure that it doesn't pass with the unanimous votes that it had in months and months prior when we were all together on the same page voting for a bill that we perhaps wouldn't have stomached in any other time yeah potentially a lot of controversial parts here but as you mentioned you know we're kind of all in the dark right now as we're waiting to see what actually comes out of these talks that are happening uh you brought up the house speaker nancy pelosi here's something she just talked about as far as the strategic plan take a listen we have a strategic plan for defeating the virus testing tracing treatment isolation mask sanitation and the rest and we just still haven't come to agreement if we can if we're going to open our economy and have our children be in schools we have to defeat the virus and that is one of the contentious issues that we have to deal with yet i mean what is contentious about defeating the virus where is it that republicans and democrats are so far apart well i don't think anyone disagrees that the virus needs to be defeated i think some of the comments you hear from speaker pelosi are just talk for the sunday morning shows but i'll tell you the strategic plan that always seems to work for speaker pelosi that my republican constituents those that are watching your network right now will agree with me when i say her strategy is to pass something that she knows will never become law send it over to the to the senate let it sit there and then she can go on tv and say that democrats stood up for the american people we're now waiting on the senate uh republicans to come together and nancy pelosi for the last 18 months that i've been in congress i've watched that work for her she passes things that i just can't imagine becoming law she has prevailed in negotiations uh throughout this and sends bills to the president's desk that i couldn't imagine uh being successful in years past so you got to give her credit that she knows how to work the system and if you recall the last negotiations everyone was in agreement and then nancy pelosi spoke up at the last minute and said nope this isn't good enough for me normally people would walk away from that but she got everything she wanted so i i hope that's not the case this time but i know that in this particular set of negotiations if nancy pelosi gets everything she wants she will not see republicans coming on board for this particular program americans are sick and tired of growing the deficit 1.3 trillion i think is what i last heard on the republican side democrats want 3 trillion as this thing continues to grow as democrats like nancy pelosi continue to get their demands met i can't imagine a scenario where where republicans are going to be enthusiastic about whatever they come up with in the next week or two weeks and that'll be the interesting part whenever whatever comes out of these behind closed doors meeting then we're going to have to look at the congressmen the senators and get you know the reaction to all all sorts of things so it'll be fascinating to see how it all i want to shift it a little closer to home there to texas uh texas has pretty big numbers as far as the coronavirus has been concerned it's among those states that are in the sun belt that have been hit so hard recently we have some of the numbers at least coming up on 450 000 cases in total as far as states with the largest single day case increases yesterday texas pretty high up there i do want to note texas big state a lot of people there in recent weeks there have been some positive data as well uh that uh confirmed cases have actually dropped statewide by 19 uh testing uh has been shown that um not as many not as much positivity and now the hope is this elite of course to fewer hospitalizations so just you are your thoughts and where texas is right now i think we're doing a little bit better i have decided after the last few months of uncertainty i'm going to get out of the prediction business and stop trying to predict the future but i will say my constituents want texas to be opened up they realize that this is a serious problem people i think are more serious about taking precautions that perhaps a few months ago they weren't serious about but we really want to stay open in texas we don't want to just accept a life where people don't go to work where people can't go out and have a meal and be back at work doing normal things we want kids to go to school we want it to be safe for kids to be at school and to do that we know that we need to get these numbers down and i think we're doing that in texas it seems to be trending well for the first time in the last month or so but we we still have a ways to go so many parents echoing some of those comments you just made a texas congressman lance gooden thank you so much i really appreciate you joining us thank you and we will be right back

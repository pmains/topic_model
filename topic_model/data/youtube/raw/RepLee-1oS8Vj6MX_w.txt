so many people in Washington DC Democrats Republicans they are plotting president transposition to launch those Tomahawk missiles I into Syria some lawmakers are calling it though in polson dangerous and even unlawful but is it an act of war that's how my next guest is characterizing last night's missile launched against the Syrian Air Base Democratic congresswoman barbara Lee is issuing this demand quote she says if President Trump wants to escalate US involvement in yet another war he should immediately send a new authorization for use of military force to Congress and speaker Ryan must bring it to the house floor for debate and vote without delay congresswoman Lee is with me now nice to see a congresswoman glad to be with you you tell me why you believe this is an act of war this is an act of war because any time a country bombed sovereign nation with no authority no legal authority that constitutes an act of war and here in the United States first of all we must insist that members of Congress do their job and if in fact we're going to engage in warfare we need an authorization and a vote an up-or-down vote because this is our job as members of Congress and let me grade goes out to the Syrian people the use of chemical weapons that's F barbaric we cannot tolerate that one clergy chol strike is not going to stop that and so minimally we need to get back into Washington DC we need to have a debate and we need to vote up or down on where we go once we know what's the president plan is there is one argument to be made that the president had to act quickly because of the atrocities that were committed there in it live I mean you look back to 2013 when President Obama decided to go before Congress as you're requesting you know before hitting Syria and he faced so much resistant he couldn't get a vote i mean no one no one then wanted to own what could be the potentially the next a rock how would you respond to that I mean how do you say no you are passionate for these young lives lost they have a very tough decision but that's why we're elected and that's why the American people should demand that speaker Ryan call for a debate and an authorization you know for many years many of us have called for an increase in our numbers in terms of refugees the president is putting a ban on refugees from Syria but so those contradictions are very apparent one surgical strike is not going to stop these barbaric acts and so we need to have a full plan it has to be international in scope we have to work with the United Nations and other international bodies to really come up with a political solution we need to address issues as it relates to Russia and its complicity with you know aside and how they are conducting this horrific damage and carnage in Syria and so the only way we can come up with a plan for a political settlement seven excuse me what the united states involved is through a debate in Congress and a vote the American people deserve that I understand and you know when you listen back to it final interviews at the time when he was still in the White House with President Obama and he talked about how it was Syria which was the main issue that really really haunted him and again this is the kind of this is a strike that has received praise from your John McCain's and Lindsey Graham's all the way you know on the other side of the spectrum at Hillary Clinton let me just play some sound from what she said speaking at the women of the world summit in New York when she was asked about Syria I really believe that we should have until should take out his ear to use and prevent him from being able to do the bomb innocent people and drop Terry gasps on them she said that before the world learned what the White House had done do you congresswoman Lee do you give President Trump any credit for for having the guts to do something that President Obama couldn't quite bring himself to do I don't think it's about having guts I think one surgical strike is not going to stop Assad from using chemical weapons nor is it going to stop him from wreaking havoc on the Syrian people what we need to do and I look play this again it come together with the international community and the United Nations and come up with a comprehensive strategy because it's only a political solution that going to address this most military and waiting finale and have said that there's no pardon we've been waiting for that I'm for people to come together well we have to insist yes we have to insist on that and that's why we're asking speaker Ryan to at least call us back into Washington DC put forth an authorization to you forth and vote up or down and that way the public will understand the costs and the consequences of what we are doing congresswoman barbara Lee thank you so much for the time I really appreciate it so

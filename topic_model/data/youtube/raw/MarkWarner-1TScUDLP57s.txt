President are we in a quorum we are I'd ask at the Proceedings of the Quorum be dispensed with without objection and president I asked to nana's a consent to speak for up to ten minutes as if in morning business without objection Madam President let me um I rise today disc about the conference report that it appears that will be voting on tomorrow regarding the issues of the payroll tax unemployment benefits and so-called doc fix and me first of all acknowledge mr. president that I know that many of my colleagues have worked long hours on the payroll tax deal that was apparently reached late last night I've been briefed on pieces of this deal and I've also seen many of the press reports that has described this this deal is a is a new sign of a bipartisanship and there's a new member of the Senate and I know like the presiding officer we believe that we do our best work here in Congress when we can have bipartisan solutions when we can find a way to reach common ground all these factors make it doubly difficult for me to now rise and say that I will be voting against the conference report when it comes before this body tomorrow now let me acknowledge on the front end that I think there are worthy reasons with this recovering economy they've got right now to maintain in some form the payroll so-called payroll tax holiday deduct I'm but I also think it's important that we bear this short term stimulative item in the context of series of other items I know I again presiding officer feel that one of the most important issues that our country confronts right now I would say the most important issue and the one that is a overhang on everything else we debate is our inability to come to grips with our debt and deficit I know as we try to nurture this growing recovery that one of the ways we take on that debt and deficit is by having a growing economy but I also believe that is in terribly important that we show progress on this issue our national debt now exceeds 15 trillion dollars every day that we fail to act we had four billion dollars to that total none of this becomes self correcting it will not correct itself until and unless we act and I for one believe that there is no action that this body could take that would be more stimulative to our economy that would be a better jobs program that would do more to restore the trust of the business community and the public than the show bipartisan collaboration and cooperation on a long-term debt and deficit deal so let me share with my colleagues the five reasons why I will be voting against the conference report tomorrow first and foremost the payroll tax cut has been proposed isn't being paid for it will add 100 billion dollars to the debt second the compromise that has been put together I think turns some of our traditional policies on their head by taking this action of saying tax cuts somehow don't have to be paid for we're advancing a policy that I believe will come back to haunt us later this year when the Bush tax cuts expire as a matter of fact and while i'm only a member of this body for three years i know it has been tradition that in moments of economic crisis that the congress will sometimes extend unemployment benefits particularly for those states that have been hardest hit and in those moments of crisis the unemployment benefits sometimes go unpaid for well in this compromise in this conference report we turn that policy on its head and that there is a requirement to pay for the extension of unemployment benefits but no requirement to pay for the hundred billion dollars of additional dep taking on by the payroll tax holiday you know I know in this body over them as we've had debates about debt and deficits and economics we've discussed the economic theories of a whole host of thinkers and economists John Maynard Keynes Frederick von Hayek Milton Friedman Paul Krugman I somehow feel like this conference report that will be voting on tomorrow may reflect the thinking of a more obscure individual but someone that I recall as a child growing up and that was wimpy who was a cartoon character popeyes hungry pal now Wimpy's theory was remember every cartoon I'll gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today well it seems on this economic policy we're taking today of deferring payment for this payroll tax policy that wimpy once again has worn out let me cite the third reason well I'll be voting against the conference report tomorrow as I acknowledge the beginning my comments I believe extension of the payroll tax holiday makes sense in this economic recovery but it just needs to be paid for so I could have very easily supported a number of the proposals put forward by my colleagues in the Democratic side including a one percent increase the taxes on those of us who make more than a million dollars a year a defined benefit with a defined pay for if we couldn't reach the gap on that I could have looked that means testing but payroll tax holiday if we're trying to make sure that these dollars get into the economy as quickly as possible over this coming year then clearly a payroll tax holiday for folks who make less than one hundred fifty thousand dollars a year or two hundred fifty thousand dollars you or five hundred thousand dollars a year or a million dollars or less a year maybe makes sense but to say that regardless of what your income is that this payroll tax holiday for going to folks like me or doing pretty well is going to be a stimulative effect I just don't think economic theory bureaus that out so if we'd paid for this or put some restraints on it I would have been happy to support this conference report the fourth reason why I can't support the conference report is because I am concerned that this payroll tax holiday which goes in to the Social Security trust fund which takes on an area where there has been common support Democrats Republicans alike that the fact that we say that this tax pro payroll tax holiday will end at the end of the year but we put no metrics on that scare me greatly that week will approach the end of the year and there'll be some other reason why it needs to be extended again if we put in place a requirement that would have said this payroll tax holiday would start to Ratchet back if we continue to see growth in the economy perhaps Ratchet back a third if we've seen GDP growth or next three months or employment growth for the next three months Ratchet back another third right back another so we don't have the cliff effect that is being proposed at the end of the year again effect that'll come at the same time as the end of the Bush tax cuts the imposition of the so-called 1.2 trillion dollar sequester cuts and the proverbial train wreck that's already being talked about so while I believe that this payroll tax holiday is important the price the fact that we weren't paying for it the fact that we put no restrictions or parameters around this and actually no guarantee that it will actually expire because we have no metrics of how much economic progress we need to have before it expires or reasons why I'll be voting though let me raise one other concern I have about the conference report this is one more example of particularly our colleagues in the house saying the first place they go for any pay for for any project seems to be our federal workers the same federal workers close to two million strong who keep our streets safe make sure we get those social security checks try to take out terrorist drug dealers you name it at the same federal workers who've had their pay frozen for the last two years who had to endure the prospects of what are we at two or three potential government shutdowns over the last year and a half to say that this group we're going to come back to the well on time and time again I don't think it's fair or right now I know as someone who's looked at the federal pay and benefits when we get to that issue of a comprehensive tax reform entitlement reform big deficit deal all these items will need to be reviewed but the notion that the first place to come back to for any pay for our is our federal employees to me doesn't seem fair nor does it seem right so for these five reasons I will reluctantly be voting against conference report tomorrow i believe it was begin context to the debt and deficit particularly it was Will Rogers who said when you find yourself in a hole and you want to get out stop digging well some small way by voting no tomorrow i hope i'll send the signal that I and hope others will join me in stop digging with that mr. president I yield the form

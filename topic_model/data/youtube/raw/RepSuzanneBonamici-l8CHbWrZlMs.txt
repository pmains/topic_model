hello I'm Suzanne Bonamici from Oregon I'm proud to be from a state that has no restrictions on the right of women to obtain reproductive health care services including abortion and I'm here today to say that I stand with the women in Texas and across the country there's a lot at stake at the Supreme Court with this case where they're looking at a state where laws and restrictions were put in place that block women's access all in the name of women's state and safety that's wrong women have the right and should have access as well to reproductive health care so use our hashtag my body my clinic to show your support for the women in Texas and across the country this is 2016 we need to work together to make sure all reproductive healthcare services are available to women across the country

thank you thank you mr rosendale appreciate the appreciate the yield so so let's let's go through mr soto some of the things that you brought up first of all i hate to get facts in the way of a good argument but uh there's not a single member on our side that's on the energy and commerce committee contrary to your your your comments a minute ago number two um i i was having a little trouble following your logic there but i assume you were maybe talking about our vote no on the federal trade commission bill that the that the democrats shoved through the house i want to remind you that they're members of your party that similarly objected to that legislation and here's why they did that because in in august of last year august of last year brian diese who's a senior white house official what is he the director of economic policy whatever for the white house he sent a letter to the federal trade commission saying hey i want you to investigate price gouging of oil and gas companies let me say that again that was it i think it was august of last year following in november of last year the president of the united states you know joe biden he sent a letter to the federal trade commission which is generally what the presidents do presidents write letters to their subordinates no you do that only for press purposes he sent a letter reiterating now if the federal trade commission actually needed authority to do the investigation why in the hell did the boss write a letter telling him to do it because here's why because all of this is a charade because y'all are out there saying hey look it's the federal trade commission they need to get involved it's price gouging by big oil oh no this is vladimir putin's fault it's bigfoot he did it i mean look all of this it just out there just chasing your tail just coming up with false narratives and as long as you all continue to do that we're going to continue to see this number go up it's going to keep happening because because until you acknowledge the problem then then this is going to keep happening now there was a comment that you made a minute ago saying that we sided with with vladimir putin and you said that a few of us a handful of us or dozens of us whoever voted against the ukraine aid package and and you know what i was one of those people and you damn right i did let me tell you why because in the ukraine aid package it provides funds for housing and transportation and medical care and clothing and all these things for folks in ukraine i've been to ukraine was there just a few months ago with steny hoyer visited with the refugees and everything else and you know what they deserve our help but you know who else deserves our help i don't know americans how about that we had one of the most powerful hurricanes in american history make landfall and hit my my state my constituents people we represent we try to do an amendment to divert a portion of those funds to actually help out people at home that are homeless that don't have a place to live they don't have food and you know what democrats rejected our amendment so you know what you're damn right i voted no and i'd do it all day long because it was the wrong vote i want to help the people in ukraine but i also want to make sure that we're helping people in louisiana i want to remind you that democrats control the white house the house and the senate you control the agenda you control the agenda you want to talk about gun control and gun rights you know what you know the two bills having to do with gun safety and protecting our kids that have become law in the last like 10 years or 15 years those would be republican bills the fixed knicks which has actually prevented people from getting guns that shouldn't have it has saved lives the the bill that we did to help improve safety and security of schools to make sure that our kids can go there as when i did and be safe when we didn't have fences gates locked doors or anything else so yeah you're right you're right we need to focus on those priorities but one of the most pervasive things happening that's affecting every single american that's making them unable to make their ends meet is gas prices and now what's coming is electricity prices and it's 100 percent unforced air last thing on this a few of y'all brought up renewable energy you know what i fully support it fully supported in fact just a week or so ago we had a hearing in this committee listening as to why we need to shut down the twin metals mine you know what that is it's cobalt nickel it's uh copper and platinum resources 75 to 90 percent of the resources in the united states that's needed for renewable energy this administration shuts it down no to everything no to all of the above is in an energy policy

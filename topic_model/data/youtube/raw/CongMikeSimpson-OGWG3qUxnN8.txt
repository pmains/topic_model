i rise in support of ranking member lewis's amendment the chairman said during his soliloquy that there's a considerable difference between the debt run up by the republicans and the debt run up by the democrats and he's absolutely right there is a there is a big difference the fact is is that the debt run up by the republicans was too large but it was decreasing the debt run up by the democrats has skyrocketed and is putting this nation's future in danger the chairman also mentioned the budget resolution that passed or the enforcement mechanism i said on the budget committee we didn't do diddly there was nothing that was passed by the budget committee relative to a budget resolution so see these are kind of made up numbers and i will tell you that we all ought to be concerned about the debt that we are incurring that we are putting on our children we can sit and point fingers at republicans and democrats it doesn't matter but every one of us had better be concerned about the debt that we are piling on our children's future and our grandchildren's future and our great grandchildren's future you all know that the public knows that every poll shows that the public is more concerned about the debt than they are any other single issue with 95 with 9.5 percent unemployment and the debate going on here about extending unemployment benefits they're still more concerned about the debt that we are running up than they are providing the unemployment benefits and i get tired of all the nonsense about republicans don't care about the unemployment extending the unemployment benefits we care about it every bit as much as anyone else in this room does we just think it ought to be paid for out of a budget the size we have don't you think we could find 33 billion dollars to pay for this republicans are in favor of it as long as we offset it with cuts in other areas now if you look at this since the president took office in 2009 two trillion in spending has been added to our base budget does anybody really understand what two trillion dollars is back when they made thousand dollar bills if you had a stack four inches high of brand new thousand dollar bills you'd be a millionaire to reach a trillion dollars it's a stack about 69 miles high and we are 14 trillion dollars in debt or will be we have one we mr chairman we can no longer afford to just spend our way into prosperity as mr rieberg said in one of the subcommittee markets it doesn't work it has never worked and we ought to realize that if you don't think we can reduce this budget by 30 billion dollars then we're not trying very hard and yeah there would be some programs that i would just assume not reduce but to suggest as the chairman did that republican members have said we're not spending enough in some areas and so we've got to spend all of this money there are always differences within a budget of how you allocate the resources you have priorities in some areas we have priorities in other areas but we ought to all agree that we need to reduce this spending which means we have to pull our belts in and if we can't do that then lord help us and lord help this country thank you mr chairman

now recognize himself for five minutes mr. Lightfoot I've heard that there might be some challenges at KSC due to a shortfall of funding for ground systems could you comment on that point please I think ground systems is okay from a perspective of what they're trying to do we have some of the money that normally would be in the ground systems budget is actually in this what they the construction budget and when you add them together it's the money they need to get the job done okay we both know that if everything is a priority then nothing is a priority and so I'm curious about a road map to Mars and our ability to stick to that road map subject to funding of course well I think we have a report due back I think to this committee in December first it's going to show the plan I believe we were asked to provide a plan of getting to Mars by 2033 and so we're working on that and I think you'll see why we think it's actually a sustainable plan based on the budget that we've got so I think if you look at the series of missions we're planning on doing in 2020 s with the SLS Orion combination the missions we're talking about doing with our commercial partners to actually you know provide the supplies for what we're trying to do I think you'll see that it is there's a it's a sustainable plan and it's actually doable if we to your point if we'll just stick with it okay if if you had one percent of our budget instead of just a half a percent or if you could have like four percent during Apollo or something um what what would you do well I think what it is so I think the way I would answer that question is that that you see what we do today with the budget that we get yeah right and I think you would just see more contributions to the to the scientific discovery that the exploration the fish and humans further into space but also recognize that that we're part of a bigger a bigger federal budget here and I think that balance has to be maintained and you know that's for us to me that's for you guys to decide where that balance is for us could we do more sure we could do more but within the other constraints we have as a nation you know that to me is is I think we have a good budget for what we need to go do okay could you comment on the administration's decision not to put crew in the first light yes or at as I said earlier I think that was that was as much our decision as it was theirs we worked with them directly on that we just felt that the the addition of the the technical risks the addition of the cost risk in addition the schedule risk actually showed that our plan was did we had to start with was actually probably the right one and the right way to go and I think to me it was it was a when we got that when the teams brought all the informations as excited as we were about possibly doing it and actually confirmed we should be doing what we're doing from an overall perspective yeah it hasn't been very clear in the press but you know China has been quite active on the moon and wonder if you comment on that well I think the Chinese have you know I know as much as you do from a press perspective but you can see they're they've they've got their first piece of what it would be their space station on orbit now they've gone to the moon the time I going again they've made some announcement this week about that in terms of a sample type return from the moon so they're very active you know I think you know for us we have to decide some at some point what's going to be our interaction with them from an overall perspective as a federal government how we're going to deal with them there the stuff we've worked with them on it's been mostly scientific in nature going forward and I think we just we just should keep paying attention to what they're doing and make sure we're not ceding leadership from that perspective is very important do you see any militarization of the moon by the Chinese I don't probably for somebody else to answer so I haven't none not in my world do you think we're still ahead of them on efforts to go to the moon again I think so I think that the systems that we're putting in place or I think I think we are but I don't have any insight into their systems as much as it's much as I do ours so I'm pretty confident in our ability to do what we want to go do and I think that's where we think we're okay from that standpoint okay thank you very much mr. life thank you

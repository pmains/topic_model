O MINUTES. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. MR. SMITH: THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER, RANKING MEMBER. I RISE TODAY IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. TO SUGGEST THIS BILL IS A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT IS SIMPLY INACCURATE. THERE COULD BE A NUMBER OF OTHER WAYS TO DESCRIBE THAT AS WELL. IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT WE ARE AT A PLACE WERE WE -- WHERE WE COULD HAVE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO ADVANCE GOOD LEGISLATION. I'M A SUPPORTER. HE E-15 BILL. I HAVE DONE A LOT OF WORK ON THIS. NOT JUST BECAUSE GAS PRICES ARE HIGH RIGHT NOW BUT BECAUSE I THINK E-15 AND ALLOWING CONSUMERS MORE CHOICES AT THE PUMP WOULD ACTUALLY ENGAGE CONSUMERS AS IT RELATES TO ENERGY POLICY AND ENERGY PRODUCTS. I DO HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS AS OTHERS HAVE MENTIONED ABOUT PROVISIONS THAT THE DEMOCRATS INSISTED BE INCLUDED IN THIS BILL LIKE THE NEW VERY DUPLICATIVE INVESTIGATIVE AUTHORITY AT USDA. EVEN MORE CONCERNING TO ME IS THAT DEMOCRATS CONTINUED STRATEGY OF SEEKING TO BLAME OTHERS ON THE SITUATION ON ENERGY AND VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING, THEY SEEK TO BLAME OTHERS RATHER THAN ACKNOWLEDGING THAT PRESIDENT BIDEN'S ECONOMIC POLICIES HAVE CREATED THIS MESS. BIDEN STIMULUS DOLLARS HAVE DRIVEN INFLATION. BIDEN'S STIMULUS DOLLARS PAID AMERICANS NOT TO RETURN TO WORK. THEREFORE WORSENING OUR SUPPLY CHAIN CRISIS. AND THE PRESIDENT'S EXECUTIVE ORDERS CANCELING NEW LEASE OPTIONS AND SHUTTING DOWN THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE HAVE CERTAINLY CONTRIBUTED TO INCREASED GAS PRICES. REAL INFLATION RELIEF LEGISLATION WOULD ACTUALLY RAIN -- REIN IN SPENDING, GET AMERICANS BACK TO WORK, PROVIDE BROAD REGULATORY RELIEF, AND INCREASE DOMESTIC ENERGY PRODUCTION. THIS BILL

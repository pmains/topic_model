Thank You mr. chairman I apologize for not being here for the entire hearing and then I apologize if I if I ask something it's already been asked and I would just say in reference to secretary Purdue and by the way thank you all for being here secretary Purdue's comment on retaliatory actions based office under lease question I would tell you that every AG group in the state of Montana without exception is unbelievably concerned about retaliatory action you are right secretary Purdue usually when retaliation comes it is focused on Ag Products and it's not a hit that family farmers can take right now my question that was about infrastructure and it deals with the infrastructure plan that was rolled out by the president and it's a question for secretary Ross the infrastructure plan is going to supply 20 percent federal dollars and 80 percent that will either come from the state County Municipal governments can you tell me in a state like Montana where we're required to have a balanced budget which is a very good thing and I think we ought to work for that at this level how Montana is going to come up with an 80% match well the suggestion here is that there are these set various different programs each of which has different economic characteristics to it but for example if there are assets that the state has that it chooses to divest of and apply those proceeds that certainly counts as a dodge so what you're saying is if they were to sell their state lands that would count as a match whatever assets they would sell could be eligible to be a match as Secretary Chow said we are not focusing on specific sources of revenue it's the quantity of revenue and having skin in the game both at the state and local and federal level well I would just say that secretary Chen and I you don't have to answer this but the current federal program on highways is 80 percent federal and 20 percent state and the state of Montana is having a tough time as many states are coming them for the 20% match I just don't see where the logic is and expecting these states to come up with 80% match and I can tell you that if it's to sell off their assets short of selling their roads for toll roads which don't work in a rural state any rural state Montana absolutely not or short of selling their public lands which by the way is could be argued the largest industry in Montana even larger than agriculture some seven true a seven billion dollars 74,000 jobs in our state I don't I don't understand how this plan is well thought-out at all to get things built go ahead secretary Chao you would I don't mean to cut you off for rural America you're right the region is different so in fact the infrastructure bill sets aside 25 percent for rural America it would be on a formula basis yep so it would be different so what you're saying of that of that there's a 200 billion that set out there 50 billion is set aside for rural America and you're saying that 50 billion what's the match for that 50 billion then well the pay-fors is that's what you're referring to is indeed something that we need to discuss actually I'm not talking about the pay-fors the federal level I'm talking about where the people are gonna come up with a match and I can that's all at the state and local Wondra billion dollars in direct federal funding right 25 papers of which we all need to discuss no question about that so 25 percent yeah and it'd be devoted to rural and there okay that's that's 80 percent of the 25 percent is formula based and the remainder is probably going to be targeted investments but we understand the rural America has different needs well it would be on a formula basis and it will be different and and I've got it and I understand but I'm gonna tell you this this infrastructure plan makes for a great press release it does cuz I've heard it's gonna invest a trillion and a half in infrastructure if we if the states come up with the match but I'm telling you the state of Montana right now is cutting programs because they don't have money they're cutting programs essential programs in our state they just had a special session a few months ago and cut programs so it's not like they're rolling in dough and I don't think Montana is any different than Wisconsin or Nevada or Colorado or West Virginia or any of these states last question because I've only got about 20 seconds left secretary Purdue your budget eliminates USDA Rural Development for rural water wastewater grant program this is a critical program for clean and safe water tell me how you justify cutting this infrastructure program and then putting forth another infrastructure program that's not going to build any infrastructure senator we do expect the infrastructure program to build infrastructure that's what the intention is but you understand how important our waterways and frankly what a good job role developments done with our water program so absolutely and that's why I don't understand why it why it was cut because we got cities and towns across this country rural and urban I believe that really depend on this and hopefully we can take another look at this I will say thank you all five for being here I appreciate the work you're doing I know you're all good people but dammit we got to do a little better than this thank you

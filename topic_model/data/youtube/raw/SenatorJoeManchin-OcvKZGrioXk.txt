We're here with US
Cellular, LT the CEO, he's kind enough to come
here and show us all the new technology that's
going on with 5g. And you see the towers in
the background there that basically have just
revolutionized this whole area and rural
West Virginia, rural America is going to
benefit from this. Senator, we appreciate
you being here. As the senator said, we're
taking signals from that cell tower you see in
the distance, and we're delivering high speed
broadband wirelessly to a TV that we had right
over here. And what we're doing is we have
50, 75, 100 simultaneous video streams come into
that TV over wireless. Imagine that being a
classroom and imagine that being a student at
home, it's bridging the digital divide. Rural Electrification
happened in the 30s. We always said if we can
wire every house up for electricity in the 30s,
1930s, surely in the 21st century we can get
them connected. That's what this is about. And
it's basically the state and federal have to be
working together, making sure that you all have a
clear picture of what you can do and how you
access this. That's all, that's gonna be the name
of the game. Well, the quality and the speed
were unbelievable and it's something we're all
looking forward to. I want to thank US
Cellular for showing us and demonstrating
basically the new technology that's coming
all over West Virginia. And with this new bill,
the BIF bill, the bipartisan
infrastructure bill, we now have the resources
to make it happen.

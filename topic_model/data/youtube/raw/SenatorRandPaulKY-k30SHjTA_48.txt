with us right now kentucky senator rand paul on what he thinks those maybe republican lawyers have to do to help out their client donald trump after all of this senator good to have you if you were advising those lawyers um what would what would you tell mr caster mr schoen what would you tell them to do i would capitalize on something extraordinary that the house impeachment managers admitted they admitted that president trump was not impeached for his words this is sort of extraordinary because i'm not sure how you incite someone to insurrection or to this violence they say he's alone responsible for if it's not through his words they finish up by saying well it's not through his words it's because he advocated that the election was stolen well so has nancy pelosi said that the election was hijacked so has hillary clinton in 2016. so has jamie raskin the lead house impeachment manager went to the floor in 2017 and said trump stole the election and i am objecting to seating to seating the certified electors from florida so both sides have done this and the fact that they're admitting that they're not impeaching him for his words because frankly they said that his words weren't much different than the words of democrats so really i think they've given up their case but they showed endless hours of the terrible violence in mayhem and those people should be punished and on both sides of the aisle we agreed to that but they never made their case that the president incited them through any kind of unusual language that democrats frankly haven't done much worse you know senator you're in a special case dealing with this sort of thing because you and your wife were stuck in the middle of a crowd right after the end of the republican convention happening at the white house and then protesters you know you know they're damn near harmed you um so you have a special vantage point on this so do you think that the president's provocative language and that might be a kind where saying it and to storm the capital and to join them and things like that well maybe not intentionally envisioning breaking into the capitol and getting into the well of the house that that that he he should have known better that his actions unleashed of this violence or might have provoked it maybe unintentionally and his response afterwards was so slow and tentative that it looked like he really didn't care so forget about whether it's worthy of conviction is it worthy of outrage and criticism that that type of president that that kind of man should never look for running for any office again i think we all bear responsibility for our words and i think he will be judged harshly by that final battle you know i voted against what the president called for not to seat the electors i disagreed with what jamie raskin did to trump in 2016. i disagreed to what barbara boxer did to george bush in 2004 but what i will say about the words is it is important that we have the same standard for both sides yes i think he will be judged harshly for that final riot and for all of that but if you want to say did he incite a riot we would have to ask did bernie sanders does he hold responsibility for the shooter that came to the ball field when i was there when people were shot 10 feet from me when steve scalise almost died and the guy is yelling this is for health care after democrats came forward and said the republican health care plan was you get sick and then you die i never once said bernie sanders was responsible for the near killing of steve scalise and yet every democrat has jumped on board and said the president is directly responsible for what these crazy people did when they invaded the capitol so no i think if we're going to hold politicians responsible for intemperate inflammatory language it has to be the same standard we can't have one standard for the for president trump and a different standard for bernie sanders or kamala harris or maxine i understand what you're saying senator what should we have at least a slightly different standard for the president he timed that january 6th rally on the very day they were going to confirm the electoral vote knowing well the tensions would be high and that'll march on the capital and i'll give the president of the doubt to your point sir that the intention was never to storm in the capital maybe just storm outside the capital but storm nonetheless and the timing was was curious to put it mildly that this was the type of thing that was akin to lighting a powder keg and seeing the results right the reason we have to be fair about this is that had this uh rally happened at that time it did happen at that time because he was protesting what we were doing had it been peaceful right everybody would have looked the other way but you wouldn't organize a rally when nothing's happening you organize a rally and like i say i disagreed with the president i voted to seat the electors because i think that we should not overturn state-certified elections even though i have problems with what happened in many of the states and i'm still trying to fix it i voted against that but the thing is is to say the president is responsible for what every crazy person in the country does what crazy people do it and this is the same thing look chuck schumer was in front of a mob that attacked the supreme court we're just lucky no one was killed over there had someone who had been killed chuck schumer would be in the same position that the president's in so the difference between the president and chuck schumer is chuck schumer got lucky that his crowd wasn't that big and wasn't as violent but they did bang on the doors of the supreme court they threw food at the supreme court justices scared him half to death as they chased him out of the building so yes both sides are guilty of this our cities have been burning for six months and not one democrat says a word i'm willing to condemn what happened at the capitol but i'm still waiting for the first democrat to condemn any of the violence that's happened in their cities kambala harris was busy bailing out the people committing crimes in minneapolis she helped bail out one guy three times who the last time he got bailed out by the minnesota freedom fund cracked some guy's head open again and caused a fracture and a brain bleed that's what the other side's doing no one's blaming them for that violence and it actually would be unfair to say it's their fault but let's have the same standard let's not have a double standard here all right um let me ask you finally senator uh i don't know in your closest than i am whether there are enough votes for 17 republicans to either follow their conscience as mitch o'connell says that uh you know what to convict the president but do you think that the house manager is here that wasn't their goal their goal was to show this video a lot of the new video leave such a searing impression in voters minds and millions of them watching in and out these hearings and that's good enough they will remember that and remember the donald j trump has no right even considering running for any elective office ever again i guess when i see the video my take is is that we should condemn violence and extremism on both sides for six months our cities have been on fire because of extreme left-wing anarchists and now we had right-wing people who can show that it can be just as crazy so anybody who commits violence should be you know kicked out of polite society should be punished should go to jail the people who perpetrated this should go to jail but i can tell you that the people creating mayhem and uh would have physically attacked my wife and i and were at the very least disorderly and not obeying commands not one of them even got a traffic ticket so you know this let's have the same standard and when the mobs are running through our cities burning throwing molotov cocktails that the police arrest every damn one of them the people who invaded the capitol on january 6 arrest them fine them put them in jail if they committed violence but it needs to be both sides it can't be this just oh this is all about republicans and violence and we look away from what's happened in our cities for the last six months senator rand paul i remember that very well with you and your wife glad you came out of that okay that was scary stuff thank you uh randall on capitol hill thank you sir very much

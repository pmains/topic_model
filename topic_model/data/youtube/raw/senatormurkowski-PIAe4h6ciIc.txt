thank you Mr chairman I will I'll be brief this afternoon we all recognize the the value and and and importance of of closing the digital divide in our native communities it's hard in certain areas and then it's super hard in others and certainly in in my my state of Alaska we fall into that super hard category in so many parts of the state um we have really been reminded of the significance and the importance of what it means to be well connected as a consequence of a pretty serious storm that we had over this past weekend the remnants of typhoon merbach coming out of Japan but this was a storm that impacted about a thousand miles of Coastline in Western Alaska is really pounding places like like gnome golevin pretty much underwater uh Hooper Bay Bethel uniliklate it's really really very very challenged this is something that I'm going to have an opportunity to to be up in the State this weekend and and go out and and get a better view of some of the damage that we have seen but our reality is is not only do you get hit by by a a storm with hurricane force winds uh Seas where you have waves up to 50 feet high storm surge that is unprecedented we haven't seen this in in like a 70-year time period but the additional threat coming is that as the waters are receding freeze up is coming so you got a couple weeks maybe three weeks at best before you get locked into winter we're watching what's happening in in Puerto Rico and the aftermath there and it is very real and it's tragic and it's very serious but at least the people in Puerto Rico will be able to have ships that that can come and deliver them materials to help them start that rebuild when they when they when the ice closes in you don't have any more ships up there we don't have any fuel tankers that will be going back up to make sure that people have fuel in in their tank uh we don't have the the wood to help with the Reconstruction so it's going to be a difficult and a challenging time and it's just a reminder to us that when we think about infrastructure and infrastructure gaps and in so many parts of of our um more remote areas and particularly in places like rural Alaska that that Broadband is just one of them that's what we're talking about here today but know that I'm looking at this at the storm and the consequences of all that I'm just reminded about the need for for coordination between State local tribal and federal governments and the need to to really focus on how we are partnering at all these levels so we we did good things I think with the with a Broadband infrastructure um that we have put in place not only through the infrastructure bill but prior to that with uh with cares um uh cares support but everything everything that we are doing the the broadband service that can be delivered through through Wireless spec Technologies using Spectrum so we can increase tribal access to Spectrum have to be part of the solution so uh again thank you for for pulling together a good panel a pretty broad panel and I'm looking forward to the conversation that we'll all have thank you

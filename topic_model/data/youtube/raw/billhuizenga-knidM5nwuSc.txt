the question that everybody is talking about as matter of fact I was just talking to a traitor about this right now is whether or not this latest round and a very significant round of quantitative easing is indeed the right move let's talk about that with representative bill Huizenga he is a Michigan Republican he is a member of the House Financial Services Committee and the subcommittee that oversees Monetary Affairs congressman welcome a pleasure to have you here hey sue thanks for having me out this is basically open-ended accommodation by the Fed that will continue they say even after the economic recovery gains a little bit of steam it is pretty much unprecedented what's your reaction to it well yeah absolutely when into mid-2015 for their for their target it just seems to me that having these artificially low i would argue interest rates really just is once again underscoring the bad economic policies that we've seen coming out of this administration and the uncertainty that's out there do you blue do you view it as a political move by the Federal Reserve or not you know I take them at their word that is that they're non-political but again I think the fact that they have to do this or feel that they have to do this is just again underscoring what is wrong with our economy and the problems that have been put in place the uncertainty in the business community really is what's causing this I believe in Rick Santelli is right you know it's really going to be those bond traders behind them that are going to determine whether this is going to work or not and I have my doubts what do you think the Fed should have done you know obviously as was pointed out in the Wall Street Journal a couple of days ago by Senator Graham and the economist from California as well there are ramifications that we aren't even really i believe baking into this and calculating into this and so i'm not sure that taking an interest rate on my backgrounds in real estate development and taking an interest rate from three and a half to three and a quarter percent or three and a quarter to three point one five percent is going to determine whether someone feels good about their situation in the economy and whether they're going to be able to go buy that house you know that's not the situation it's really about that that uncertainty that's out there do you feel better or or not as good about the fact that the feds decided to include mortgage mortgage backed securities in its program to me it really doesn't make a difference it's six and one-half dozen the other in many ways and it doesn't make me feel substantially better somehow i still have a lot of concerns about this quantitative easing at all levels and I think as was pointed out maybe the average voter doesn't know who Ben Bernanke is or what the Federal Reserve is doing but they do know what that means in the economy when it comes to the uncertainty and that feeling that their employers as well who we know are sitting on unprecedented amounts of cash on the sidelines because they feel frustrated with the tax and the regulatory policies that are coming out and the uncertainty that's being created that brings us to the fiscal cliff and the conversation is suddenly shifting down here on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange from the fact that now we know what the Fed is going to do we don't know what Congress is going to do and they're facing the fiscal cliff how close to that cliff is Congress going to take the country and the markets yeah well I think a lot of its dependent on whether the president is going to take us up to that cliff or not he's been very hard and strident on his language about absolutely wanting to have that tax increase I think we've seen some of the actions out of the Senate the impacts on small business owners on estate taxes and some of those things are just going to be huge and we need to solve this i happen to agree with Bill Clinton or at least the bill clinton from a couple of months ago when he said hey we shouldn't be raising taxes on anybody right now at this point in the economy I wholeheartedly agree okay congressman thank you for spending time with us great get back to work

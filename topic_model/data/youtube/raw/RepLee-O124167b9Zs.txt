Thank You mr. Speaker I rise today in strong opposition to HR 3762 the restoring Americans health care freedom reconciliation act of 2015 really does just the opposite not only does this bill represent Republican 67th attempt excuse me 60 second attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act but it is yet another ideological attack on women's health care it would defund Planned Parenthood for one year preventing millions of women from accessing critical health care services such as cancer and STI screenings and contraceptive care in 2000 in alone Planned Parenthood provided health care services to more than 800,000 Californians and provided more than 93,000 Pap tests and 97,000 breast screening exams although Planned Parenthood centers make up only ten percent of all publicly funded family planning centers they serve mind you thirty-six percent of clients who obtain care from the Family Planning Center Network denying access to healthcare providers such as planned parenthood will harm the communities that need these services the most including low-income women and women of color enough is enough mr. speaker this afternoon will mark the 100 extremely the 11th boat mind you the 11th vote to attack women's health care at this Congress it's past time for Republicans to end their attacks on Planned Parenthood and recognize that they are really harming women by denying them these badly needed health care services so I hope my colleagues will vote no on HR 3762 and really begin to look at what you're doing in terms of the freedom of women to make their own decisions and to really access the vital health care services that they need again this reconciliation act does nothing to reconcile health care services which men desperately need in our country

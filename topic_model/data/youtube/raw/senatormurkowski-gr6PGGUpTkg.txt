madam president i've come to the floor this afternoon to speak about a measure that i will be introducing this week with my colleague from california senator feinstein we have we've entitled this bill bruce's law in memory of a young alaskan robert bruce snodgrass who passed away in anchorage last october bruce is the son of sandy snodgrass sandy is is with us here today in the senate gallery uh bruce and sandy lived in california when bruce was younger before moving back to alaska sandy likes to describe alaska as bruce's true home bruce was a good kid he was a good kid but like many good kids he struggled with alcoholism he struggled with drug addiction and he and his family were far too familiar with this as his grandfather and his father died of the same addictions and despite all of this bruce started using drugs as a teenager really sent his life into a downward spiral but sandy was always there mom was always there providing a safe and a comfortable home and yet he was arrested repeatedly and ultimately wound up homeless but then last summer last summer things things turned around bruce made the choice to get clean he wanted to get his life on track and his and sandy was right there ready ready to help as any good mom would be she got bruce to a detox facility and then into a local inpatient program for treatment he graduated from it and and he moved back home he was able to spend his time at outpatient meetings he was in counseling he liked to ride his his mountain bike he received this after he had completed the treatment program but then one day last october bruce went out for a bike ride and sandy remembers telling him before he went she said be careful out there but bruce never came back he never came home october 20th bruce's body was found in a grocery store parking lot and just like that just just like that suddenly heart-wrenchingly and after after trying so hard to overcome his demons he was gone just gone forever and so we grieve with sandy who lost her only son that day no parent no parent should have to bear what she is going through but the details of bruce's death are especially tragic because bruce died from an accidental overdose of fentanyl fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that is 50 times more powerful than heroin a hundred times stronger than morphine and it's relatively cheap easy to make it makes it attractive for drug dealers but it's also just incredibly incredibly dangerous for those who come into contact with it just two milligrams which would fit on the end of a pencil can cause a fatal overdose this is how the justice department describes it they say fentanyl powder has the power to kill with the ingestion the inhalation or skin absorption of just two milligrams by comparison a sweetener packet found on a restaurant tabletop generally contains 000 milligrams per packet so just to give you an idea of how small a deadly amount can be a single pill with just trace amounts of fentanyl can be fatal to the average person which has prompted the drug enforcement administration to start a campaign that they call a one pill can kill this campaign is designed to raise public awareness here now there is a form of fentanyl that is carefully and precisely manufactured it's prescribed for medical patients that that may be in extreme pain like those who are suffering from late stage cancer and doctors know they know that they have to be exceedingly judicious with their prescription of this pharmaceutical fentanyl but it's this other form the illegal fentanyl that is being made in underground labs and sold on the streets illegal fentanyl is often laced into counterfeit pills that are made to look like oxycontin oxycodone or other frequently used and abused opioids the fake pills are difficult to distinguish from the real thing without specialized tests because they are deliberately made to look like them according to law enforcement authorities about 40 percent of those pills of these counterfeit pills contain a potentially lethal amount of fentanyl so you buy a pill you think you think it is is a frequently abused opioid that you've taken before but over 40 percent about 40 percent of these counterfeit pills can contain a potentially lethal amount of fentanyl some drug traffickers are also adding fentanyl into heroin and to meth into cocaine and it makes these drugs even more deadly since fentanyl is indistinguishable in its powder form if you look at a picture of heroin and fentanyl you cannot tell the difference but fentanyl's presence might be the difference between life and death there was an official from new hampshire who said a couple years ago he says you don't know what you're taking you're injecting yourself with a loaded gun now most people would avoid fentanyl if they knew what it was capable of doing to them but oftentimes they don't even know they don't know they've never heard of it or they don't know enough about it or again they think that they're buying a name brand prescription pill not some deadly knockoff it is now fueling a nationwide crisis with terrible terrible impacts in every state in the country a few weeks ago the wall street journal reported that drug overdose deaths likely reached more than 107 thousand in america last year an all-time high and an increase of 15 percent from just 2020. roughly two-thirds of those deaths were attributable attributable to synthetic opioids led by fentanyl with an increase of 23 percent year over year so we're just seeing this skyrocket an official with the cdc is quoted in that wall street journal story is saying quote we've never seen anything like this we've never seen anything like this and he's right we haven't nor are we ready to fight it fentanyl is flowing into america largely from china and mexico and it's coming in at an unprecedented rate so much so that it recently became the leading cause of death for americans aged 18 to 45 and this was in the midst of the pandemic when we were seeing deaths in other areas but it became the leading cause of death for young americans and no one no one has been spared by this growing epidemic i wish that i could say in alaska we're far enough away we're remote but no i've shared bruce's story with you but he is not the only one opioid related deaths in alaska mostly from fentanyl rose by 71 between 2020 and 2021. in my state of alaska rose by 71 it now accounts for about 60 percent of the drug overdose deaths in alaska our law enforcement authorities routinely are intercepting packages with fentanyl they're finding it in anchorage they're finding it in catch can in other places in the state in april the alaska high intensity drug trafficking area initiative this is what we call the haida initiative had its largest ever seizure worth an estimated 356 thousand dollars our governor's office has estimated that the 1244 grams of fentanyl seized in january february march of this year 2022 could kill 622 000 alaskans 622 000 alaskans that's that's about 84 percent of our state's population think about that in three months in three months the amount of fentanyl seized could kill 622 thousand alaskans or about 84 percent of our state's population this is this is awful this is a tragedy at every level this is also an epidemic of the young and i'm looking to the young people on this floor because i want you to hear how frightening how deadly fentanyl is according to the alaska department of health and human services drug overdose deaths rose by 25 among alaskans aged 15 to 24 last year so basically your age category and by a staggering 200 percent in young alaskans between the ages of 25 and 34. it just it's devastating because behind those numbers are real people like like sandy's son like bruce bruce snodgrass who who should have celebrated his 23rd birthday just last week we had beautiful beautiful weather in anchorage i saw sandy she reminded me of bruce's birthday and you look around and you think about that young man lost gone gone at least six individuals in the matsu valley who were killed by fentanyl laced heroin in march made news in the paper all all just in one story so so many others killed gone gone in the wake of bruce's death sandy has said that she was in shock for several months which is entirely understandable but since then since then she's decided to tell her story share her heartache in hopes that other moms won't lose their sons and so she is an advocate she's an advocate with every ounce of her being and it's thanks to her that we are introducing bruce's law bruce's law starts with education and awareness requiring the federal government to create a nationwide campaign against fentanyl for school-aged children young adults parents first responders and care providers the campaign will help illustrate the extreme dangers of pills and street drugs that could be laced with fentanyl help prevent drug abuse including through the safe disposal of prescription medications and help identify the early warnings signs of addiction bruce's law also authorizes the secretary of health and human services to form an interagency working group on fentanyl contamination of illegal drugs this group would consist of federal agencies state level haida directors parents who have lost loved ones to fentanyl overdose deaths and those with lived experience in recovery it would consult with experts at all levels to identify strategies resources and supports to address the incidence of drug overdoses with fentanyl contaminated drugs and it will review current federal strategies to seek improvements to them particularly when it comes to educating middle and high school students about the profound danger of these drugs the final part of bruce's law authorizes new community-based coalition enhancement grants to help educate young people about the risks of street drugs laced with fentanyl this would allow the drug free communities coalitions to access new funding focus specifically on fentanyl and to try to curb or eradicate its use so this is a starting point it's a starting point and we have to start because we have such a serious problem on our hands we know we have it in anchorage where bruce snodgrass likely never knew that he was taking a drug laced with fentanyl where the who who met sandy after bruce's body was found had just come he had just come from notifying another family of another death caused by another overdose we also know that we're not alone this is a national crisis and we know we must do more more to prevent fentanyl from coming across our borders more to prevent fentanyl-laced drugs from being sold on the street more to educate americans especially especially young adults especially youth about his acute danger and more to address addiction and to provide support for recovery so as i as i close i want to thank senator feinstein for being the lead democratic sponsor of bruce's law as well as senator sullivan and senator hassan for agreeing to co-sponsor with us i would encourage every every member of the senate to sign on to this legislation we we acknowledge in alaska this is a problem in our state and we have to acknowledge it in all of our 50 states i i urge others to join us in this effort send us your input on how we might be able to strengthen this legislation and again i want to thank sandy i want to thank sandy snodgrass who is with us today joining joining her our kim koval from the office of the governor as well as mike troster who is the state of alaska's haida director each of them each of them such important advocates we recognize that it is going to take all of us doing a lot more doing a lot more than we're doing now to raise awareness of fentanyl and turn back this deadly tide but we have to we have to for our communities for our kids and for bruce and with that madam president i yield the floor

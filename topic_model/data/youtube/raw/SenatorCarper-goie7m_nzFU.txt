I rise today in support of Judge Sonia Sotomayor is confirmation to the United States Supreme Court those of us who are privileged to serve here in the Senate cast literally thousands of votes during our years here we take many votes that are crucial and important but a handful of them are far more meaningful than others these votes have historic consequences once which will resonate for years in some cases for decades to come this is one of those votes Judge Sotomayor has a compelling life story a story that confirmed for work ethic and informs her judicial temperament Juna this year I had the pleasure of meeting personally but Judge Sotomayor we spoke at length about her experience her service and her life we talked about a respected childhoods our respective educational opportunities in our careers there was a revealing conversation and responses were forthright they were insightful they were sincere the nominee before us truly highlights the diversity of the country in which we live Judge Sotomayor brings more federal judicial experience to the Supreme Court than any justice confirmed in the last 100 years as a federal judge for nearly two decades Sonia Sotomayor has demonstrated a clear commitment to unbiased impartial justice and to the rule of law and unlike some nominees for this federal bench judge sotomayor we can see a long paper trail of her legal rulings for record reveals that she consistently takes each case on its own merits regardless of the ideological outcome and narrowly applies the law to the particular facts she may even be more of a strict constructionist when it comes to applying the law than made the justices my friends on the other side of the aisle admire the most like Franklin she is a model of judicial restraint the strength of Judge cinema yours record and reputation is perhaps why to some extent many critics are focused almost exclusively on one or two legal rulings and for a line if he gave from a speech years ago I do not find much to agree with in those criticisms but even if it did it does not seem fair to me that she should be judged on those few items alone these few quibbles need to be put in the context of a lifetime of work nothing else Judge Sotomayor is extensive record demonstrate that she sticks to the law and perhaps that's why in part the American Bar Association given this judge this nominee it's cooperating a well-qualified in assessing her record and evaluating her judicial temperament for all these reasons and more I invite my conservative colleagues on the other side of the aisle to take a leap of faith as I did a few years ago John Roberts much as I did four years ago and join me in casting their vote in favor of Judge Sotomayor denomination to serve on the US Supreme Court the question is on the confirmation of Sonia Sotomayor of New York to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States mr.

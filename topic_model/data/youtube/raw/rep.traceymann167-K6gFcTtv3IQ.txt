in preparation of the re-authorized re-authorizing the farm bill in 2023 i rise today to deliver the first installment of my farm bill impact series where i'll be highlighting various aspects of the farm bill that i think deserve congress's awareness and support if america is going to thrive the people who feed fuel and clothe america must thrive and the farm bill contains certain programs that have been critical to the success of agriculture producers in my district this week i want to speak about two of those programs that fall within the trade title of the farm bill each year 140 billion dollars worth of agriculture products are exported my state of kansas is known as the wheat state and 50 of all the wheat sold in the u.s is exported so congress must think critically and carefully about the international components of the trade title trade programs which have long-standing records of success in america represent the partnership between the public and the private sectors of this country these programs are essential because they spearhead innovative market access new market development and promote agriculture sales overseas through the market access program or map u.s agriculture trade associations cooperatives state regional trade groups and small businesses cooperate to share the cost of overseas marketing and promotional activities map reaches virtually every corner of the globe helping build markets for a wide variety of u.s farm and food products including the dairy wheat grain beef soybean and some flowers that come from my district the agriculture trade promotion program or atp which was created in 2018 to help u.s agriculture exporters develop new markets and mitigate the adverse effects of other countries tariff and non-tariff barriers the atp supports consumer advertising public relations point of sale demonstrations trade fairs and exhibits market research and technical assistance for farmers ranchers and our ag producers i support whatever directly benefits farmers ranchers and ag producers in this country because they're the lifeblood of america they keep us food secure and therefore free and self-determining as a nation that's why i support these trade programs within the farm bill and while i'm bringing awareness to them now to ensure that they remain intact for the 2023 farm bill i also support these programs as a fiscal conservative because they are a great return on investment for all americans i will be back on the floor soon to deliver another installment of my farm bill impact series and highlight more programs and titles within the bill that i believe congress must understand and support to ensure the aggregate to ensure that agriculture continues to thrive in kansas and in america

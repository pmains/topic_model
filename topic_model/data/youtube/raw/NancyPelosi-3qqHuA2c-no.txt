first lady is recognized for one minute thank you madam speaker i thank the gentleman for yielding and i thank him for his relentless persistent uh advocacy on behalf of a thriving middle class in our country and his work to ensure that we would have this payroll tax cut as well as the extension of employment unemployment insurance he fought so hard on that as well as on the making sure that our seniors are able to see their doctors under medicare congratulations and thank you mr levin i rise today madam speaker in support of this legislation of course i identify with the concerns expressed by our distinguishment mr hoyer and mr van hollen we get regarding our public employees before i talk directly about what is in the bill i do want to say uh that for our country to thrive and for us to do our very best we must have a great relationship between the public and the private sector the private sector is the driving engine of job creation in our country but it cannot succeed unless we also have an effective and thriving public sector it's about so many things that relate to our public safety the courts the implementation of laws passed in congress they don't exist unless the public sector then implement so this is a symbiotic relationship that has existed from the beginning of time in our country and there's not a zero-sum game we cannot say we're going to do this in the private sector at the expense of the public sector so i salute them for their persistent leadership uh and recognizing the important role that the public sector pays and that was not necessary for us to go down the path that has been taken in this bill and i'll get to that in a moment but first i want to say that this represents a victory middle class in our country and i salute president obama for going out there so strongly and taking this message to the american people that it was very important for us to have a payroll tax cut for the middle class it's important to those families because it puts forty dollars more into a paycheck to buy groceries to buy gasoline to make ends meet to make ends meet but it was in addition to being personally helpful to families it had a macro economic it has a macro economic effect because these families will immediately spend that money inject demand into the economy and that is a job creator and any economist will tell you that this is very important to continuing the economic recovery in our country to have rejected it as has been but had been in the mix earlier would have halted if not turn back our economic recovery so let us recognize that one of we had three pillars that we insisted be in this package we on the democratic side one that we would have a payroll tax cut for 160 million americans preferably unpaid for and that is the way it is in this bill what is unfortunate is that we did not use our choice of a pay for should it be paid for the surcharge to cover the unemployment insurance that would have been a preferable place to go the unemployment extension of unemployment insurance it could have also been used to pay for the uh sgr the ability for seniors to see their doctors instead of taking money out of the prevention piece of the affordable care act prevention is makes america healthier it saves money it expands opportunity for people to to get in the health care loop that's unfortunate and it could have been avoided as this as well as uh unfortunate provision relating to our our public employees and even on that score mr hoyer said as mr van hollen did there was a further compromise that could have been made that addressed some of the needs of the republicans to vote for this bill without doing more harm to the the as mr hoyer said the recruitment the retention of public employees the best the best public employees to help implement our laws and i want to salute all of them for their patriotic duty to our country to make keep us safe in every possible way to allow commerce to proceed in a very positive way but now let's get back to why this is important to this this victory for the middle class this was a fight why should have been a fight there's something out there in the public the ground truth the common sense coming up from the ground that this was an important thing to do and the american people overwhelmingly supported it there's a ground truth out there from the public common sense coming up from the ground that in order for us to do meet our needs and also reduce the deficit that we should have a surcharge on the wealthiest people in our country people making over one million dollars a year not having a million dollars making over one million dollars a year that was not contained in this bill but it will be part of the debate as we go forward so let's take a moment to say that we recognize here on this floor of the house the ins the the importance of a thriving middle class to our democracy to our democracy and that this action taken today is an important but we have much more work to do democrats are committed to reigniting the american dream to building ladders of of opportunity for all who want to work hard play by the rules take responsibility but we have work to do uh in this thriving this uh reigniting the american dream it's about recognizing the role of entrepreneurialism in our system of small businesses and what they do to grow our economy and how we have a public private relationship there to encourage small business and also again all of this relates to a thriving middle class so i urge my colleagues to be ever vigilant about every opportunity we can take to support the middle class today is a good day in that regard it's just one piece of it though we have much more work to do and any bill that comes up there are things you may not like in it and you say well i'm not going to vote for it for that reason on balance i come down in favor of supporting what the president asked us to do which we did do what the american people want us to do what but i don't want to go for it without registering the concern that we could have done better in this and one place we can start on our next legislation is to look at the surcharge for the wealthiest people in america instead of taking billions of dollars from preventive care uh so that we can offset the cost in here none of it needed to be offset the payroll tax cut has not been unemployment insurance has not traditionally been paid for and we didn't have to do it now in fact paying for it diminishes some of its stimulative effect because economists will tell you unemployment insurance benefits paid out are immediately spent spent back into the treasury payroll tax cut will be too and has stimulates the economy by injecting demand and creating creating more jobs sgr we should have gone all the way with it we should have done it permanently we could have paid for it with our war savings or with a surcharge at the high end the republicans said no having said all of that having said all of that the fact that we are here today is an admission and a uh that this is the right thing to do in terms of the payroll tax cut and unemployment compensation and our seniors and it a recognition that the american people are watching and they have little appetite for us to be fighting over what they know is the right thing to do which is to take every action we can to grow our economy focusing on the middle class small business entrepreneurial spirit and the rest and that again we have important work to do to reignite the american dream and even even bigger ways so with that madam speaker i urge our colleagues to support the legislation and to yield back the balance of my time thank you gentlemen from maryland

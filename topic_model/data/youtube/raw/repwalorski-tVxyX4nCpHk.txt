we're all here saying the same thing that what happened yesterday and this US Senate is absolutely disgusting it's just disgraceful this shows us what we're in for this fight and that this fight is worth fighting for I'm grateful to Ann Wagner I'm grateful to Steve Scalise are wept let me tell you really what happened last night for those of you that weren't here Senate last night stood against protecting children they stood in the way of even having an up or down vote they stood in favor of legalized infanticide that is not who we are as Americans the bills in the walls we've seen in New York and Virginia are in other states are horrifying that's why we're here today they're horrified allowing abortion up to and even after moments of birth and eliminating the safeguards to prevent infanticide when the governor of Virginia said if a baby is born alive after an abortion attempt quote the infant would be kept comfortable and then a decision would be made I think it's sickening I really think it is sickening that's why we need to be able to vote on HR nine six through the four and Ally of abortion survivor Protection Act this common-sense bill would would require the medical care be given to children who survived a failed abortion it's very simple we're going to offer them the same life-saving treatment that is afforded to every other American this should not be a partisan issue and they should not be controversial it's just doing what's right for the sake of right I vlogged why to defend the unborn I'm shocked that we are now defending the right to life of newborn infants and it's something that we have to stand together this is extreme this is inhumane and we must act to protect the rights of all infants sadly Democratic leadership in the house is standing in the way refusing to even allow vote the American people deserve to know that their elected officials will stand for life well this Congress stand for a culture of life will allow a radical anti life agenda to put children's lives in danger it's time to vote on the born alive abortion survivors Act I call that vote today I urge my colleagues to vote YES and I thank you so much for helping us spread the word this is a pro-life country thank you [Applause]

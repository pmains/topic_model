Thank You mr. speaker Mr Speaker I was trained as an as an engineer and in my engineering training we were taught that before you can solve a problem you have to identify and define the problem if you solve the wrong problem you accomplished very little I serve on the Budget Committee and on the Budget Committee we take an in-depth look at all of government and as we examine the programs and as we examine revenues and expenditures of the federal government we see many issues that are great concern to the future of our country we three see threats to our safety and our security we see overreach and hassles created by the very government that is here to serve but mr. speaker there is a Greeg an xuan issue facing our country that threatens all our futures our gross national debt fueled by out-of-control spending continues to grow and it's past 19 trillion dollars which exceeds our gross domestic product today while much of the country focuses on primary elections several of my colleagues from the Budget Committee including chairman price wish to have an open and honest conversation about this issue of debt and spending that you're probably not going to hear much about anywhere else we not only hope to bring attention to this issue by defining the problem we will propose real solutions to restore fiscal order so that Americans can thrive and Americans not the government or any one person but Americans can make America all that she can be if we delve into the major fiscal issues facing our country it becomes obvious that we have an enormous spending problem I have a chart here and this chart shows us where we've been where we were in 1965 it shows where we are today with the numbers through 2015 and it also predicts where we will be in the future in 2026 the spending represented by the red on these pie charts is what is called mandatory spending if you want to think of it this way this spending is on cruise control is spending on programs that were put in place by previous congresses really if we didn't even meet anymore the spinning in the rib would continue to go on the spinning in the blue is the discretionary spending that's the money that is spent by appropriations that are done in Congress every year the 12 appropriation bills that we hope to get back to regular order this year and pass each of those 12 bills out of the house and out of the Senate and put them on the President's desk those bills relate to the spinning that's highlighted in blue on these pie charts the omnibus bill from last year that affected what's in the blue it didn't affect what's in the red as you look at these charts you can see that in 50 years we've had a little bit of a flip flop in 1965 we were right at two-thirds of our spinning with discretionary which was controlled by the appropriation process and right around one third of our spending with mandatory but over that 50-year period we've seen tremendous growth in spending we've seen that now over two-thirds of our spending is mandatory and less than one-third of our spending is discretionary so when Congress meets and we debate these appropriation bills we're only debating about one-third of the spending that takes place by the federal government the real story is what's projected to happen in 2026 just 10 years from now over 50 years we saw 17-8 17.8 trillion dollars of increased spending in our gross debt that's three hundred fifty six billion dollars a year but in just 10 short years from today the congressional budget office projects that our gross debt will be twenty nine point three trillion dollars that'll be a growth of over eleven point two trillion dollars in a ten-year period that's over one trillion dollars per year that we will see in spending growth between now and 2020 six if we stay on the path that we're currently on Mr Speaker I hope to explain the day while we can't stay on this path and and there's a lot of issues to look at and my colleagues on the Budget Committee will look at the path that we're on they'll look at different areas of this spending and we will provide solutions to how to avoid the future financial crisis that's it's only getting worse we're already in a financial crisis when we look at what contributes to our national debt to our gross debt 645 billion dollars this year will go to debt all because of mandatory spending our national debt our gross debt will increase to 1.1 trillion dollars or 1.1 trillion dollars more tune about nineteen point three trillion dollars this fiscal year only part of that can be controlled through discretionary spending we have to start addressing the issues with mandatory spending if we truly want to address the fiscal condition of our country this next slide breaks it down in a little bit more detail remember red is mandatory spending and blue is discretionary spending we see that under the discretionary spending the part that we so vigorously in this chamber the part that makes all the headlines most of that are about half of that is in defense and then the rest of its non-defense discretionary spending there are five areas just five areas that over two thirds of everything spent in this country go to and as we saw in the previous chart by 2026 those five areas will make up over three-fourths will make up seventy eight percent of every dollar spent by the federal government those five area is our social security medicare medicaid interest on the debt and kind of a lump category of other mandatory spending right now Social Security is the largest expenditure of the federal government at 882 billion dollars per year if we look at Social Security and Medicare these are programs that working Americans have an invest have invested in that are very important but are headed to insolvency we have to fix them to preserve them for all of us who have contributed to them the people who project the numbers show that by 2030 on the course we're on Medicare will be insolvent by 2030 for social security will be insolvent mr. speaker the young people in our country should be alarmed at this by twenty thirty four and twenty thirty these programs that we've all contributed to if we don't change course they're projected to be insolvent if we look at Medicaid it grew by double-digit percentage points last year a lot of that because of the Affordable Care Act and if we look at other mandatory spending these are our social welfare programs these were programs that were put in place with good intentions we're getting poor results and finally the one that probably should concern us all the most is our interest on the debt the Congressional Budget Office tells us that by 2025 if we don't change course interest on the debt we'll be a larger expenditure than Social Security as our debt continues to balloon and grow the interest that we must pay on that debt will also balloon and grow and that's why I mandatory spending will become such a large part of all the spending and really make our discretionary spending somewhat minuscule compared to the gurganus size of mandatory spending I want to talk about just a couple of these areas and some of my colleagues will talk about other areas as we move forward but if we look at some of our social welfare programs and our Medicaid program there again these programs were put in place for people who were truly in need they were put in place for a hand up instead of a handout but oftentimes they've become just the opposite of that some of these programs instead of helping people out of poverty they trap people in poverty now Medicaid is a unique issue because it was put in place for for age people for disabled people for blind people people that we would all agree we need to help out and lend a helping hand but now there are a lot of able-bodied working age adults these are people 18 to 65 years old who are not disabled who are receiving Medicaid benefits and we're seeing a lot of increase in cost there we're seeing a lot of increase in cost in mandatory program or social welfare programs such as snap and one area where we can address our budget where we can address this looming fiscal crisis is in our social welfare programs let's look at what's happened just in the SNAP program since 2000 increase in enrollment in snap programs has grown 171 percent to say that another way for every new job added since 2000 and that's 4.3 million of them 30 point four million people have been added to food stamps that's seven people being added to the food stamp program for every new job that's been created in this country since 2000 again instead of lifting people out of poverty many of our welfare programs are actually trapping people in poverty if we look at some of the numbers on snap fifty-seven percent of able-bodied adult households have no earned income these are people receiving food stamp the food stamp benefits what's even maybe more alarming is 75 percent of the people receiving SNAP benefits seventy-five percent of childless adult households have no earned income that's 17.3 million people it's a two hundred fifty two percent increase since 2000 in this one demographic of childless adult households who have zero income who are receiving SNAP benefits only fifty percent of parent households have earned income so what happens what happens if we change the scenario what happens when you move people from welfare to work well Kansas try to program they try to program to restore work requirements for able-bodied childless adults in 2013 and they saw fantastic results from that they saw a 50-percent immediate decline in enrollment when they enacted work requirements for able-bodied working age adults on this program they saw 68% long-term decline in enrollment and they saw a one hundred and sixty-eight percent increase in work participation rates among the enrollees they saw a one hundred and thirty-three percent increase in average income of able-bodied childless adult enrollees they saw fifty-five percent increase in average income of able-bodied childless adult enrollees mr. speaker a number that we can't ever forget is it only two point nine percent of full-time workers live in poverty if we want to pull people out of poverty we need to create an environment where people can work where they can pull themselves out of poverty we've also found that in these social welfare programs like the SNAP program and like Medicaid where you've got able-bodied working-age adults on those programs that the populations overlap so if you are able to get people back into the workforce and help the SNAP program you're also going to cut costs out of the Medicaid program you get a double bang for your buck when you get people back in the workforce we need to train people we need to assist people to get back to work and that's what these programs were originally put in place for and we've got to get back to that it's been said many times before but I think it's worth reminding that the best social program is still a job again only two point nine percent of full-time workers live in poverty in this country if we implement work requirements for programs like snap for people who are receiving Medicaid benefits who are able-bodied working age adults we're not going to put this requirement on disabled people we're not going to put this requirement on elderly people in nursing homes here dependent on Medicaid we're not going to put it on on any children or bomb people this is for able-bodied working age adults we could save billions of dollars in the Medicaid program of doing this we can start to address these fiscal issues with one solution of requiring work for people who are receiving benefits that were put in place to help them get back to work it worked in Kansas it's worked in Maine it's worked in other states and it can work all across our country

joining me a man who has been pushing this credit since the beginning senator michael bennett uh senator thank you for joining me on this really important day you know very well that rising prices are a huge issue in this country and families have been receiving on average 430 bucks a month from this tax credit when it goes away how are they going to handle it inflation's an issue it's going to be really hard for families uh stephanie because we've lived in economy for 50 years that's worked really well for the top 10 percent hasn't worked for anybody else people are using this tax credit to pay for rent to pay for groceries to buy school clothes for their kids to pay for extracurricular activities for their children as well and if this goes away in january they're not going to be able to do any of that and on top of it inflation is cutting away at families purchasing power well right now it's not an if it goes away in january it's going to build back better is stuck in limbo your colleague joe manchin wants to narrow how many people are getting it before expanding the child tax credit would you be open to that he wants to revisit it saying some people don't need the money i think that it would be a huge mistake to stop the child tax credit 61 million kids are betting benefiting from it we've cut childhood poverty in this country almost in half as a result and as you just said we've cut hunger in the united states by 25 percent somehow this place where i work here doesn't have any problem extending tax cuts for rich people all the time but all of a sudden we've finally done something for working people and for lower income people and it's much harder to do so i obviously have to in part convince joe manchin who hates the child tax credit he said that we said look let's just do it for a year joe so we can have the opportunity to convince you that this is actually a pro-work strategy not an anti-work strategy which it is i talked to mom after mom after mom in colorado who's told me that they're using the money to pay for day care so they can actually work and that's what most the people aren't lazy in this country they just need a little bit of help then is the next move to make this an urgent standalone bill as i said build back better is kind of in limbo here and we both know for whatever reason joe biden's poll numbers are dropping and one of those reasons is because of inflation do you need to take this bill on on its own to not just help the country but also to help biden look i would much rather pass bill bill back better that's what we should be doing we've had months and months and months to negotiate that bill in the senate and the time the time has come for us to do it there are important things in there like capping drug prescription costs for seniors at two thousand dollars capping preschool costs for parents at seven percent but if we are going to delay it beyond when the next tax credit is supposed to come out which is in january we're going to have to consider other options so what's the likelihood buildback better gets passed i keep hearing you say should i keep hearing you say want but let's get real well look we should pass it we should and we should there's no reason to delay stephanie so i'm not going to stand here and say it's not going to happen i think we should get it done by christmas and i think we should give families the certainty that we're willing to give the folks in around this place that we've given tax credit tax cut after tax cut after tax cut stephanie you know these numbers better than anybody else but since 2001 we have cut taxes in this country by 8 trillion dollars almost all of that has gone to the wealthiest people in the united states and here we have an instance where finally we're doing something for working people we got to give them the certainty of making this tax credit extending it into the next year and i believe make it permanent i do know those numbers and i am forever confounded by the fact that we kept carried interest in our tax code you can write off a hundred percent of the value of a private corporate jet yet we can't seem to extend the child tax credit i don't get it senator but thank you for joining me this morning i sincerely appreciate it

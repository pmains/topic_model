there's no doubt that protecting privacy is critically important and how we should do so what government regulation should be in place concerning privacy is going to be a policy question that I suspect will be with us a very very long time at the same time that we want to protect privacy we also want to avoid a regulatory system that imposes unnecessary burdens and that threatens jobs and and I think there are lessons that we can draw based on the experience we've seen elsewhere there's been considerable discussion here about the European Union's general data protection regulation gdpr in November 2018 the National Bureau of Economic Research found that quote the negative effects of GDP are on technology investment appear particularly pervasive for nascent zero to three-year-old ventures which may have cost European startups as many as 39,000 text jobs even more alarming the report goes on to state quote the potential for job losses may well extend and intensify past our four months post GDP our data set period in which case the effects on on jobs is understated in the wake of GDP our California enacted its own law the California consumer Privacy Act of 2018 and according to the International Association of privacy professionals the California Privacy Act will affect more than 500,000 US companies the vast majority of which are small to medium sized enterprises what lessons should this committee or should Congress take from the experience with gdpr and the experience with the California Privacy Act so senator Cruz I'm Jim Steyer and I we basically wrote the California privacy law with the legislature there I would tell you the bottom line lesson is that privacy is good for business we wrote that law really with some of the most important tech companies in the United States Apple Microsoft's eles force but i run a small business right with several hundred employees we have to comply with the California law and gdpr and we think and so that I run a small business and know that the fact that it does matter but in the long run I think what you saw because you had unanimous bipartisan support in the California on all the Republican legislators as well as Democratic legislators to support it so I would just say well-crafted strong privacy protections are in the best interest of business and I think that I think that that the record speaks for itself in that regard and you should feel confident that a a smart Congress just like a smart California Legislature will find the right balance on that so let me focus for a second on the gdpr piece do the witnesses agree that the gdpr regulation is having or had a significant negative effect on jobs and and are there lessons that we should derive from that I think senator one easy lesson that we can take and improve on as we look at how to legislate in the GDP are the European Data Protection Board is issuing quickly but frankly it's a year in is issuing opinions on some of the core provisions of the GDP are there's an opinion out now that's not yet final on what can be in a contract and obviously that's a core thing lots of companies are doing their business based on contract and we won't have final guidance and it's a year out so the more we can do to give clarity here are the rules and yeah there's room for rulemaking in the areas that are complex and they haven't been figured out but I should be able to comply the day the law passes there's some there's a real overhang of uncertainty in a number of areas where the board has yet to issue opinions so people actually know what the rules are yeah and I don't think that they're it's necessary that a privacy law is gonna hurt small businesses I do think that a loss should reflect the realities of small businesses so for example penalties you might want to have different penalties based on the size of a business or the amount of data they hold and I do think that there are some some room myths around the extent to which GDP are harmed some businesses I'll give you a good example that's been reported you know following GDP our New York Times reportedly stopped doing targeted advertising in Europe and did contextual advertising they didn't find that their advertising dollars went down and they went up and so I do think that there are ways that businesses can respect privacy and make a profit and we're starting to see businesses that are innovating around that right dr. go who's trying to create an alternative to Google that respects privacy so this is also an industry tip I think promote privacy and create rights respecting products and senator Cruz I would tell you that we've been spending a fair amount of time talking about the incredible importance to your family my family and everybody in this room's family and ourselves about the protections and I having living in the the state where most of the big and small tech companies are based and working with them I think you'll see I think they have now come to the conclusion that while there may be some modifications that need to be made which is the normal legislative rulemaking process in the long run this is good for business and it's good for consumers it's good for everybody so I think I agree I agree with miss Giuliani that I think some of the statements about job losses etcetera been have been overstated and that the value of a quality privacy regime for the Cruz family the Steyr family and everybody else he's totally worth it senator equally at the Irish data protection commission were not aware of evidence that the GDP or is affecting jobs adversely I spoke earlier about the risk-based approach that the GDP or endorses and it does give a nod to smaller and micro enterprises and it provides for implementation only of the organizational and technical measures that are probe that are appropriate and proportionate to the risks of the personal data processing operations in question and to the scale of the organization so I think approached and implemented as it's intended is it should do the opposite of effect jobs it should engender better consumer trust and a more sustainable business model well I want to thank each of the witnesses for your testimony this testimonies helpful the hearing record it will remain open for two weeks during that time senators are asked to submit any questions for the record and upon receipt the witnesses are requested to submit their written answers to the committee as soon as possible but but no later than Wednesday May 15 2019 with that I thank each of the witnesses for testifying and the hearing is adjourned

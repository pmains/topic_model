welcome back to foxhole's black report your daily source for black news views and opinions joining us now to discuss the derrick chauvin trial and the george floyd justice and policing act of 2020 is the honorable congressmember karen bass welcome back to foxhole's black report congresswoman bass how are you i'm doing fine and thank you for having me back absolutely uh let's just jump right into it so the house passed the george floyd policing act this month can you tell our soul mates what the act plans to accomplish absolutely well the first and most important part of the act holds police officers like derek chavin accountable number one by allowing individual citizens to sue police officers and number two to reducing the standards in which they're prosecuted let me give you an example the whole world watched him uh derek chavin with his knee on george floyd's neck right now what the law says is that we have to prove that he intended to kill him what we say is whether he intended it or not putting your your knee on someone's neck for nine minutes results in death and you should know better so you are reckless we want to lower the standard which is why you see officers very very rarely prosecuted the other part of the bill really raises the standards for policing so for example there are no national standards so in one city or state stockholders might be legal and in another city or state they might not be we believe that police officers and police departments should be accredited so the person that does your hair or or repairs your roof has to be accredited and licensed you would think that a profession that has the ability to take your freedom and your life would have to have accreditation and then the final part of the bill provides grants to communities to re-envision policing and re-envision public safety okay so we're gonna i'm gonna ask you a question about qualified immunity in uh in a couple of minutes um but the bill currently sits in the senate what are the odds that it's going to pass well i think the uh first of all it is normal for a bill to pass one house go to the other house and undergo changes yeah so i do believe in order for the bill to pass that the senate will more than likely make changes to the bill and so we will see i am very optimistic that we will get a bill on president biden's desk because president biden is also calling for it right um there is obviously a lot of republican pushback um they have called this a defund the police bill what is your response to that well i think that's silly i think that my republican colleagues know that saying it defunds the police gets people frightened they used it in the elections and so i think they call anything that brings about changes uh in policing as defunding the police you know there has been a lot of rhetoric about the the name the phrase defund the police even obama jumped into the fray and he talked about word politics and that sort of thing um so what are your thoughts about defunding the police the phrase itself and the concept let me just tell you that what i say is refund the communities because i believe that what is at the heart of it is that we have divested we have defunded communities over the years especially the last 30 years we've cut back on social service supports we've cut back on drug treatment mental illness etc and then we leave police to pick up the pieces so for example if you review officer officer-involved shootings especially officer-involved shootings that result in death a significant percentage of those people that were killed were in the middle of a mental health crisis now the tragedy in our country is because we have not invested in the health of our people we essentially incarcerate and execute people who are mentally ill that is a tragedy so again i look at addressing the root causes and i absolutely believe that that is the most important thing that we can do is to refund the communities but at the same time i believe we also need to fundamentally transform policing i don't think the george floyd justice and policing act is the end-all i would view it as a significant step in the right direction it's interesting that you say that um it's the it's not the end-all that it's a significant step because my next question was going to be about black lives matter um they have said that the bill doesn't go far enough you've or have you worked with organizations like blm when it came to creating the bill well um absolutely and let me just tell you i agree with black lives matter it doesn't go far enough the question is where are we at this moment in history i would absolutely like to go further but i don't believe further is politically possible right this minute now in lieu of that i don't want to do nothing so i definitely want to move the ball forward but there's no way i would say that if the george floyd justice and policing act completely as it is right now as it passed the house if it's signed by president biden then we've done all we need to do on policing i would never ever say that much more needs to be done right um let's switch gears and go back to qualified immunity now critics of so new york just canceled qualified immunity which i which was major and one of the things that critics say about canceling qualified immunity is that it's going to be a lot more difficult to um to basically find people willing to put their lives on the line to be a part of the you know a part of law enforcement um what are your thoughts on qualified immunity and you know and how was it addressed in the bill specifically well uh first of all in the in in the bill that passed the house qualified immunity is removed from police officers now what that means is is that then a police officer can be sued for excessive force so what i feel about it is is that i feel that policing should be like any other profession and so let's just take the medical field because that's my background as a former medical professional if i committed malpractice the public would know about it and i could be sued now that's what malpractice insurance is for and so the policing is a profession again that can take away your freedom and take away your life a doctor frankly making egregious mistakes can also take away your life doctors can be sued so i don't see how you would make a fundamental difference with policing i agree with you wholeheartedly we spoke about qualified immunity um and you know about the story with that new york is the first state to or city to cancel it and that was one of the things that i had said um is the fact that where any other profession there is a consequence for malfeasance or malpractice there is consequences and policing is the only one where they have this you know overwhelming authority over our lives and whether or not we live or die once we interact with them and there is no penalty to pay so i wholeheartedly agree with you um it's obvious that you are extraordinarily passionate about this but i just want to ask you from your own words why was it so important for you to make this bill happen well for me personally yeah i've been involved in this issue for almost well for 47 years i mean in 1973 in los angeles i was in an organization called the coalition against police abuse i have personally undergone harassment i have seen los angeles police department it's it's better now i mean it still has a ton of issues but it's better than it was back in the day this is something that our people have been fighting for for over a hundred years at some point will people recognize that policing is different in communities of color now i represent a district in los angeles that there's neighborhoods that are very affluent and actually majority white and then i represent south central los angeles they're governed by the same police department on one side of town the police go in and they protect and they serve that community on the other side of town not all of the police officers but too many of them view like they're in a war zone and everybody that lives there is suspect those are two qualitative different types of policing one is a guardian mentality and the other one is a warrior mentality i think that police should protect and serve and be guardians regardless of where they are your career spans like you said it's you basically almost if not four decades and change seems to have changed seems to come at such a glacial pace and you know for me your constitution is admirable congresswoman i just had to say that to you um what can the community do at large to support the george floyd uh justice and policing act well you know we have this wonderful tool of social media and it would be great if people would be involved in social media but talking about the substance of the bill so it is wonderful to see people say you know say their names brianna taylor and ahmed aubry and obviously george floyd but how about tweeting and getting on social media and say ban chokeholds ban no knock warrants you know to to talk about the substance police officers should be prosecuted uh support the george floyd justice and policing bill those that social media involvement does have an impact we need the senate to know that this bill needs to pass here we are in the middle of the derek shoven trial and we need to show the general public that we can do something about policing otherwise people are left hopeless and it's my responsibility as a member of congress i have to address that hopelessness it's my responsibility to do everything i can to make sure that this bill passes okay so in addition to posting you know ban choke holds um ban no knock warrants do we as community members do we make it a point to reach out to our con members of congress to our senators senators senators okay okay yes regardless of where you come from because even if you come from a state where i know where they support the bill you know 100 percent they still need to hear from you because when they get attacked by people who are against the bill they need to be able to say well thousands of my constituents called and said they want to see me on this bill so don't think just because your senator supports the bill that you don't need to reach out to them you do okay all right i just i want to make the soul mates understand exactly what they need to do to continue to participate um in you know in in things that affect their daily lives you know we saw incredible results from the election which are now you know come kind of coming under fire with the georgia um you know voting suppression act that just happened so i want our soul mates to continuously understand how they can participate in you know in in community activism and i just one last question we talked we're talking a lot about derek shovin's trial um and this is a scary question to pose for you what do you think will happen if he's acquitted i worry i worry what will happen i worry what will happen in our cities i do too i really do too i honestly do too i was in los angeles in 1992 yeah i think that it will be 20 times worse yes all right well thank you so much for joining us today congresswoman i cannot thank you enough for your time i know how valuable it is and we are going to you know we're going to we're going to keep the charge going for you thank you very much okay take care

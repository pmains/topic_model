hi everyone I'm here with another update on my work for you early Saturday morning after House Republicans finally chose a speaker I was officially sworn into my third term in Congress representing California's 49th congressional district it's an honor to serve you and I remain deeply committed to delivering results for our district because house members swearing-in was delayed by Republicans initial inability to choose a speaker I wasn't able to introduce any legislation last week so this week I introduced my first bipartisan Bill the 118th congress with Republican Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania the nursing home disclosure act currently some nursing homes do not provide a full public report of who their medical directors are leaving families without critical information they need as they search for Quality nursing homes and care for their loved ones I introduced this bipartisan legislation to ensure families have the best information available when looking for a nursing home for their loved ones additionally I took several important votes this week including opposing House Republicans tax legislation that would protect the ultra wealthy and large corporations from paying their fair share of taxes also this week I voted against legislation that would hurt a woman's right to make their own reproductive Health Care decisions I've said it before and we'll say it again I will always support a woman's right to decide what to do with her own body lastly this Monday is Martin Luther King Jr Day time to honor The Life and Legacy of the important civil rights hero Dr Martin Luther King Jr and today I'm reminded of Dr King's inspiring words and I quote Darkness cannot drive out Darkness only light can do that hate cannot drive out hate only love can do that so as we Forge ahead in the next 118th Congress let us remember these words and take inspiration in them whenever we feel despair that's all for now have a great weekend everyone

madam Speaker on April the 2nd just a few days from now we'll observe equal pay day in the United States this commemoration represents the amount of time into this new year a woman must work to earn as much as a man earned in 2018 alone as long as this continues we are effectively telling our wives our daughters our mothers and every woman in our life that they are inherently worth less I don't believe this I don't believe my colleagues do either which is why I encourage everyone to support the Paycheck Fairness Act when it comes to a vote tomorrow this bill represents a major step toward closing the pay gap ensuring employers pay women what their due and the process will grow our economy by putting more money in Americans paychecks and helping families thrive I'm honored to support this legislation my daughter for the hard-working families in our district and for women across America who deserve a fair wage for honest work I yield back madam Speaker

the white house has said repeatedly that that this is a very popular law if that's the case why is it important to get out and sell it it's not selling it it's literally letting people know their rights right it's it's kind of like you um you buy a product you've already been sold on the product but you need some directions on the box well they go vice president harris promoting 1.9 trillion dollar stimulus bill senator bill hagerty republican tennessee joins us now sir there are a lot of people in tennessee millions who are going to get a check from the government as part of the package relief here it's very popular why did you oppose it well the reason i posed to steward is there's so many other things in this bill that have nothing to do with the pandemic and have everything to do with the democrats socialist wish list they're bailing out blue states i don't think tennesseans should be paying for the more poor mismanagement of these large cities and states that's what really is at the heart of this bill and the reason that they're out selling it uh you know that's sort of like nancy pelosi saying you've got to pass the bill before you find out what's in it people didn't know what's in it and if people did know i think they'd be appalled you know i think that vice president harris ought to be standing in front of a penitentiary because inmates are going to get these checks they clearly are letting people know across the border that they're going to illegal immigrants are going to be entitled to these checks i think it's sending all the wrong messages the wrong incentives i mean it's passed and the checks are already going out are you looking forward to 2022 because the bill is is popular now are you suggesting that it won't be popular in 2022 for the elections well stuart i think what's going to happen is the impact of pouring all of this economic stimulus into the economy is going to slow our economy down it's going to have a very negative impact in the long run and i think that it will be felt the negative implications this will be felt it's also putting more debt on the backs of our children and that's really something i think that many many people are troubled by okay you are on the senate foreign relations committee uh i want to ask you about the olympics in 2022 scheduled to be held in china uh should we boycott those olympics well china certainly wouldn't be my choice for the olympics the the the human rights violations there the genocide that's taking place is very disturbing i think we should use every bit of pressure in every lever that we can to get the chinese to change their behavior the chinese communist party are pressing their own people in incredibly incredibly negative ways we should use the olympics and every other lever that we have to get them to change their behavior i tell you what i am for though and that's for the olympics to take place this summer in japan that's a great opportunity something i want to see happen and as japan recovers from the pandemic i really hope that our athletes who had to wait for a year will have the opportunity to compete in japan this summer senator i'm just getting word of this but you've written a letter to the president warning about quote increasing aggression from iran what worries you most well the biggest concern i have about iran is that we're going to see the biden administration take steps to appease them that's only going to accelerate their malign behavior in the entire middle east region the administration seems to be very eager to partner up with europe to bring iran to the table but what does iran want to do they want to attack americans they want to attack our allies in the middle east and i think we ought to take that into account we need to take into account our allies in the middle east including israel saudi arabia and their concerns before we leap to the side of europe and do things that they want just because they want to be back in business with iran the president is suggesting changes in the filibuster rule which means you gotta talk talk talk are you prepared to stand up on the floor of the united states senate and talk against endlessly talking against the the infrastructure package with tax increases listen we've got a tremendous amount of economic stimulus that we've already poured into this economy most of it untargeted and undirected with respect to the infrastructure package i think we're going to have to see what is moving down the pike in our direction but again we've got to take into account our economy and our progress and i think we're very very concerned about what may be included in this bill so indeed i'm prepared to do whatever it takes to stand up and fight against wasteful spending at any turn senator first time on the program we really appreciate it come back thank you stuart it's great to be with you thank you so much thank you

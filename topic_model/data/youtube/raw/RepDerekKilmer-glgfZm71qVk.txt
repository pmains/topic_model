I rise today to recognize the life and service of Bishop Curtis Montgomery of Tacoma Washington he was a key leader who shepherded tacoma's hilltop neighborhood through civil rights struggles and troubled times his steadfast leadership and staunch belief in the power of community involvement will be remembered in the revitalization of this historically significant neighborhood his contributions to the hilltop include the establishment of christ temple church which later became greater christ temple church and the oasis of Hope Center a faith-based community outreach center that was the culmination of Bishop Montgomery's long-standing vision to provide a safe and stable place for the community scripture tells us that God loves a cheerful Giver and it's safe to say that God loves Curtis Montgomery and his parishioners who have given so much to so many on behalf of his congregation and the people of the hilltop neighborhood in Tacoma Washington I honor the lifetime achievements of Bishop Curtis Montgomery of Greater Christ Temple Church in the Congress of the United States and I yield back the balance of my time

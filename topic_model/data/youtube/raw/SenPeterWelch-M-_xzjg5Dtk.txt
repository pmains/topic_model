I mentioned I think the commissioners my concern that I want to address is decommissioning in Vermont Vermont Yankee located in southern Vermont right on the Massachusetts and New Hampshire border was one of the first I think the first merchant plant to be decommissioned so we're sort of at the tip of the spear addressing the combination of issues between the industry that has to shut that down and the local and state communities that want to have a say in the process and over the course of the last couple of years senator Sanders and Senator Leahy and I on behalf of Vermonters have been raising some questions that we want included in rulemaking one the lack of state and local stakeholder involvement in the decommissioning process is a concern to the questionable uses of the decommissioning trust fund such as for spent fuel management is a recurring issue at the Vernon plant 3 the reality that the use of safe store decommissioning procedure will effectively delay the cleanup in the redevelopment of the nuclear site for decades is a big issue for us we'd like to put that place back into operation sooner rather than later and then for the reduction of emergency planning functions during periods when spent fuel remains are and spent fuel pools that's an ongoing concern that's an issue for us in Vermont but as more and more plants are going offline that's going to be an issue for them as well and the questions that I wanted to start asking about were on the rulemaking process and in the initial phases of this it appeared that the NRC in fact was paying attention that many of those concerns that I just cited but there's been a tug-of-war in the process and the industry concerns appear to me and I think the senator leahy and senator Sanders to be paramount they want flexibility and some of the safety issues but they really are resistant to the four issues that I mentioned so that's a real concern to us and not just to us because this is I Inchon is gonna be relevant for all these other plants that are going to get decommissioned so I'll start man I'm sure with you if you would do you believe that state and local stakeholder concerns should be considered on equal footing with those of the industry and believe that a final decommissioning role that codifies regulatory and safety exemptions that industry has requested but don't address concerns over the use of the decommissioning trust fund the local input in the post shutdown rate rules I would be problematic we'd like both included congressman thank you for this question and you and the people you represent have been very very active in the rulemaking process the stage we are at right now is that the NRC staff has developed a regulatory basis and they will begin the process of developing a proposed rule to come before our Commission my approach is a member of the Commission is to look at the totality of the public comment record and I don't look at who sent the comment I look at the underlying matter that the comment is raising and I look to make sure that the agency is responsive to that comment so I I don't want to prejudge where I would be on a proposed rule that hasn't come before me yet but as part of my review I will certainly know it I understand you can't prejudge it but we'd really want some assurance that the local concerns will have a seat at the table that's really the bottom line of what we want and there's a tug-of-war because the industry concerns are sometimes different they want to get out sooner rather than later and the local community wants that property back in service and obviously concerned about the decommissioning fund mr. Barron can you tell me what opportunity state and local stakeholders will have over the coming year to weigh in on decommissioning rulemaking sure well the the main opportunity they've had there's been two periods of public comment to date and as the chairman mentioned we got a couple hundred comments I looked at them all and you're right the states and local governments are very engaged on this issue they want to be heard the next big opportunity would be when the proposed rule is prepared the Commission will vote on a proposed rule letter go out for public comment and that would be the first time that stakeholders that have an opportunity to look at what is it that the agency is proposing to do and what is their reaction to that all right thank you mr. burns thanks for your work over the years this basic request that our communities have to be at the table as a full and equal partner I'd agree with what when my colleagues have said I think as we as the proposed rulemaking comes before us one of the things I'm going to look at is though some of those process issues as well as the you know the substantive issues about you know what what does safety demand and assuring that we have clarity on things like you know the decommissioning Trust Fund trust funds you know it's interesting we had a good meeting I think about a year or two ago we had a rep one of the representatives from the Citizens Advisory Committee from Vermont was there and her heard her there some of these things I think will be regulatory solutions some of them are going to be the interactions with within the state to the state's themselves but I do think it's important that though the voices are all heard gentleman's time has expired mr. Johnson you recognized for five minutes Thank You mr. chairman I think

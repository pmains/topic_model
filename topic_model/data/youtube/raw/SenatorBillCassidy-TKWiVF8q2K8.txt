Mr President senator from Pennsylvania I yield to my colleague from Louisiana Mr President I regret that my senator from Louisiana I think I'm sorry Mr President I I regret that my colleague has objected to this bill um and I also but I reject the characterization that this would do anything to promote abortion it's probably not important that I think what I think I will quote the conference the U.S Conference of Catholic Bishops last night they said this is the Catholic Bishops we believe that this version of the bill read in light of existing religious liberty Productions helps Advance the U.S Conference of Catholic Bishop's goal of ensuring that no woman ever feels choice is forced to choose between our future and the life of her child while protecting the conscience rights and religious freedoms of employers this is the U.S Conference of Catholic Bishops last night and I think as a physician I can now speak as a physician I will say that there are times when a woman if she wishes to continue in the workforce needs an accommodation the Cincinnati police officer of the Louis Louisville police officer which which was quoted in the Cincinnati paper spoke about her need for light accommodation but those who are ultimately her boss would not give it to her because she was not quote injured so they had a policy in which if you needed to own a doctor's order you should unless it was a doctor's order because of pregnancy and she was told if she if she a sick sought to use that she would lose her insurance at five months pregnant she's going to lose her insurance Mr President I would argue the pro-life position is to make an accommodation for that woman who has those needs so that she can safely carry the baby to term now by the way it's also good for business others who are endorsing this from the business sector I'll just give one the U.S Chamber of Commerce they clearly see that this is something which is a reasonable accommodation not forced by unnamed bureaucrats in Washington DC upon people who are employing the employing others Across the Nation the U.S Chamber of Commerce has made this a top priority and as regards the pro-life issue let me also point out that the March of Dimes which is so vitally concerned about the health of children likewise support my colleague has mentioned that it passed out of the help committee 19-2 strongly bipartisan and then passed the house with 315 bipartisan results now we have experience with these laws Nationwide 30 states have laws such as this already but that leaves millions of American women uncovered and our goal was to address it with this bill now let me just go back once more because this apparently was a sticking point is it possible that this law would permit someone to impose their will upon a pastor Upon A Church Upon a synagogue if they have religious exemptions the answer is absolutely no and this is what the U.S Conference of Catholic Bishops was referring to the Title VII exemption which is in federal law remains in place it allows employers to make employment decisions based on firmly held religious beliefs this bill does not change this and there's an exemption in titles six related to Al pastors and ministers and and rabbis would conduct their business all that remains in place which is why the U.S United States Conference of Catholic Bishops last night once again endorsed the bill now I think even those who oppose would agree that we need to have a safe environment for pregnant women and their unborn children in the workplace they deserve our attention I would say that this bill is pro-family pro-mother pro-baby pro-employer and pro-economy I hope at a later point we can pass thank you and IU

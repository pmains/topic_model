good morning and welcome back into wake up america i'm rob finnerty over 3 million deaths worldwide and over 600 000 people have died here in the united states because of a virus that came from china but that's all we really know right now did the virus come from a wet market as we've heard before or maybe a lab as evidence is starting to suggest right now the true origins of this deadly plague have remained a mystery for over a year but that could finally change if one kansas lawmaker gets his way for more we want to welcome in kansas senator dr roger marshall senator nice to have you on the show rob it's great to be with you again this morning well senator you were one of the only elected officials in all of america that knew that this novel coronavirus from china was going to be really bad for the country you warned congress way back on january 28 2020 six full weeks before it really became a problem here in the u.s take a listen the coronavirus certainly has my attention but as the outbreak of the coronavirus strain originating in china continues i want to remind kansas that u.s health officials remain on high alert and are fully prepared for any situation i should say the chief's just about to play in the super bowl uh back at that time um but my question to you as a physician how did you know this was going to be such a big deal and why didn't people like dr fauci know well that that's a great question now we have something up here called the doc caucus a group of physicians uh that are now in the senate and when i found out that china and the world health organization was saying that this was not transmitted from person to person my radar just went off and then when i talked to the cdc that same week and said tell me about the research that we're doing in wuhan and they told me oh we don't have scientists in wuhan i knew the cover-up was going on and then even further research told me there's some really big concerns with the world health organization so i i think my uh you know my doctor instincts just went off that there's a cover-up going on this is going to be bad okay so there's this notion that's been out there for a long time now that is uh it's popular right now that if you are talking about the origins of the virus in china somehow you're you're xenophobic but to me shouldn't it be about finding out where this really came from to make sure it never happens again versus maybe hurting someone's feelings you know absolutely this is about the health and well-being of americans and every all the humans worldwide you know what what's the next pandemic going to look like and is there information is there lessons to be learned and there absolutely has to be and the problem is china is either destroyed or covered up a lot of information that would have helped us to figure out how to solve this riddle sooner as well as future riddles right so you look out there there's really three questions that have to be answered was this virus leaked from a lab in wuhan number two was this virus from nature or was it manufactured in a lab and and then then finally beyond beyond that is what are the what are the rules what are the guard rails around viral gain of function absolutely and maybe number four uh what was if anything dr fauci's involvement i'm curious about that as well i know you're creating a a committee right now to really investigate the origins of this virus a 12-person committee so what would your committee do who would be on it and what would your committee do that the world health organization failed to do a few months ago well there's a list of questions and certainly we just need all the people in the room we need all the papers surrounding our viral gain of function and we need people to really go into wuhan professionals that don't have some some type of conflict of interest and and bring all that data together into one room you know very simple we've done this before up here at the senate an equal number of republicans and democrats let us have a list of questions figure out who we want to come to the to the room and just have a lot of sunlight shine on all of this i want to ask you about the gain of function research in just a moment but first just a very simple question the the death toll in the united states right now is right around six hundred thousand why do you think more americans are talking about this why isn't this the biggest story in the country right now you know as as far as the origin of the virus you know i think there's just so many other crisis going on we've got inflation going on we can't get gas at the pumps we've got a southern border crisis going on there's just one crisis after another and then overall the economy is starting to recover uh so it's uh we're out there celebrating we got to take our mask off as well yeah so americans tend to move on and forget pretty quickly but we've got to find out the origin of this virus we certainly do uh senator the we have the proof i've seen it we've got grants there's clear evidence of funding to a group called the echo health alliance to perform that gain of function research that you mentioned on human cells from an organization that at that time was run by dr anthony fauci do you think that dr fauci has been complicit here do you think he's been lying to the american people do you think he knows maybe more about the origins of this virus than he's been letting on look look we don't want to make this a personal issue or a partisan issue as well dr fauci is well respected a man of science i'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt i absolutely believe that dr fauci and the nih were doing research in this area in hopes of developing vaccines certainly we were funding what looks like viral gain of function we were doing studies working uh with with laboratories in america working together with the lab and wuhan dr she in north carolina were collaborating working together we know that and certainly this was funds from the nih i think sometimes we're mincing words you know tomato to model what i'm describing is viral gain of function dr fauci disagrees with me dr pouching i've disagreed on a few issues before but i know his heart was right i think he was trying to develop vaccines we don't know what china did with this the way we don't know what they did with the research that we started did they take it to the next level did their military get involved that's why we need a hearing yeah that's the question that we need answered that that is as they say the million dollar question and other nations are trying to do the exact same thing is that accurate well i i don't know i think there's a big meeting in the world health organization here in the next week or so and we certainly need all those countries to come together and put the pressure on china to say we need you to open up your laps but what i'm afraid is they've destroyed all the evidence right and i'm afraid there's some people that are missing that maybe had some evidence as well but we got to get to the bottom of this uh we deserve the answers america the whole world deserves the answers all those people that lost loved ones deserve to know where this virus came from senator i couldn't agree with you more thank you so much for what you're doing please keep us posted on the progress of this committee and this investigation thank you that's kansas senator roger marshall joining us

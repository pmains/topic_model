THAT I JUMPED ON, YOU KNOW? I'VE ALWAYS HELD. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I'VE LEARNED AS I'VE BEEN IN THE DEPARTMENT. >> AND BINDING WITH THE ALLIES AS WELL? THANK YOU >> YES, AND OUR ALLIES AS WELL. >> SENATOR GORDON? >> GENERAL GARLAND, I'M SURE YOU WILL AGREE WITH ME THAT THE INDEPENDENTS OF THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY IS ONE OF THE CROWN JEWELS OF OUR FORM OF GOVERNMENT. HISTORICALLY, FELLOW JUDGES HAVE HAD A HARD TIME DEFENDING THEMSELVES AGAINST ATTACKS OF VARIOUS KINDS. AND I JUST WANT TO RAISE WITH YOU MY CONCERNS THAT WE ARE SEEING NOT ONLY ATTACKS LIKE THOSE FROM FORMER STAFFERS OF THIS COMMITTEE, WHO HAPPEN TO NOW BE ON THE OUTSIDE, SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS, SAYING THAT NOW WHEN REPORTERS COVER THE STORY OF CASES BEING DECIDED BY JUDGES, THEY OUGHT TO CITE A PARTISAN AFFILIATION OF THAT JUDGE. AND SAYING THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO SAY, FOR EXAMPLE, IT'S NOT JUST CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS, OR SAY HE'S A REPUBLICAN, NOT A CONSERVATIVE-LEANING JUSTICE. THIS IS HAPPENING IN THE PRESS, IT'S HAPPENING ON SOCIAL MEDIA. AS YOU'VE ALREADY DISCUSSED WITH SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES, THIS HAS LED TO POLITICAL PROTESTS AT JUSTICES HOMES. AND EVEN A THREATENED ASSASSINATION OF A MEMBER OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES. BUT UNFORTUNATELY, IT'S NOT JUST LIMITED TO THE OUTSIDE PARTISAN RABBLE ROUSERS. IT INCLUDES SPEECHES MADE BY UNITED STATES SENATORS ON THE FLOOR OF THE SENATE. MISTER CHAIRMAN, I WOULD ASK YOU TO -- COPY OF THE SPEECH DATED FEBRUARY 16TH BE MADE PART OF -- >> WITHOUT OBJECTION. >> THIS IS A SPEECH BY UNITED STATES SENATOR TRYING TO DISCREDIT A JUDGE.

CALLING HIM A LIFELONG RIGHT-WING ACTIVIST, A PARTISAN IDEALOGUE, AND ANTIABORTION ZEALOT. HE GOES FURTHER TO SAY THAT REGARDLESS OF HOW JUDGE HAS MERRICK MAY DECIDE THIS PARTICULAR CASE THAT IT WOULD INEVITABLY BE AFFIRMED BY THE ACT OF HIS FIFTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS AND THEN SURELY RUBBERSTAMP BY THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. I FIND THIS RHETORIC PARTICULARLY BY UNITED STATES SENATOR TO BE APPALLING. AND I WONDER IF YOU WILL JOIN ME IN CONDEMNING THAT SORT OF ATTACK ON THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE FELLOW JUDICIARY. >> WHEN I FIRST GOT ON THE JUDICIARY, I AND SEVERAL OF MY COLLEAGUES HOUNDED OUR HEADS AGAINST THE WALL TRYING TO GET THE REPORTERS TO STOP IN THIS IS MORE THAN 25 YEARS AGO, TO STOP REPORTING THE NAME OF THE PRESIDENT WHO APPOINTED US AND WHERE THE PARTY. UNFORTUNATELY, THIS IS A BATTLE THAT HAS NOT BEEN ONE AND I DON'T THINK GIVEN THE AUTHORITY THE FIRST AMENDMENT, IT'S IMPORTANCE, IT'S ONE THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO WIN. I COME FROM A KINDER AND GENTLER ERA. AND A KINDER AND GENTLER COURT. EVEN IN TERMS OF THE WAY THE MEMBERS OF THE CORE TREAT THEMSELVES. >> GENERAL GARLAND -- OFFICER OF THE UNITED STATES. WILL YOU CONDEMN IT? >> DON'T I AM AGAINST DIVISIVE RHETORIC OF ALL KINDS. BUT I DO NOT HAVE AUTHORITY IN THIS MANNER AS YOU KNOW. >> YOU HAVE MORAL AUTHORITY. >> MY

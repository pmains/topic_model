since beginning of this year the Russians have not allowed the u.s. to export to them any poultry products at all and on the Delmarva Peninsula along with another number of other places in the country that's a big deal you don't have to go back to that many years ago when mostly poultry that was raised in this country was consumed in this country today a one out of every five chickens that we raise we export we sell abroad Russia is a big stuff one market they buy a whole lot of dark meat and for the balance of this year since the beginning of this year the Russians have not allowed us to export any chickens so what it does is it harms the price of chickens it drives it down having to be a poultry lower that's not a good thing and it's a we really just closed closed off a big part of our market what happened now Russians have agreed since the beginning of from this point forward to allow us to start selling our chickens again there's some people in Russia including Putin who would like hers the Prime Minister now they want to be able to grow their own domestic poultry market and one of the ways to do that is to keep our chickens out and so they manufactured an excuse to keep our chickens out saying that they weren't sanitary and on and on not really true and but it worked in keeping our chickens out there is something that the Russians wanted they wanted us to support their admission into something called the World Trade Organization and we want to be able to sell a lot of chicken to Russia they I think are going to get what they want at least our support for their admission to the World Trade Organization we're going to get what we want and that's the Russians to buy a whole lot of chicken every year the leading nations in my the mightiest strongest economic gun nations in the world meet togethers meeting called g8 and there's a larger group color g20 that they they meet they're going to be meeting up in in canada this weekend they started having their pre meeting set today i was along with the number of my colleagues wrote a letter sent a letter to the president 25 of a signed it in order to encourage president obama when he met with the Russian president to make this a priority to beat down the Russian protectionism to it so that we can renew our exports of poultry to to to Russia I met then spoke this week with the u.s. agricultural secretary with the US Trade Representative with the CEO Secretary of Commerce is all part of the Obama administration saying when the president meets with his Russian counterpart but later this week that would be Thursday today make sure that this is a priority god bless him he made it a priority and we've gotten what we want around the country people have agriculture is important part of the economy some places cattle and important in some cases pigs are importance in cases cotton is important on the Delmarva Peninsula chickens are important and the lion's share of our agriculture industry is chickens and it sort of helps for the soybeans corn we raise them in order to feed the chickens we have the chicken processing plants poultry processing plant to put thousands of people who are a lot of jobs that float from the poultry industry and when moved twenty percent of your poultry these days are sold overseas and we get shut out of our biggest my overseas market valuing a good thing in today's news is very goodness you

George brockler back with you here on 710 knus earlier this week there was an event for a for a guy named Joe O'Day he'd like to be our next U.S senator and I think he's got a heck of a chance and someone that came out to try to help him make the rounds and to spread the word and talk about the importance of getting joe day in office was a former Army captain that matters to me of course as an army guy current U.S senator from the great state of I think it's pronounced Arkansas but I'm not sure Tom Cotton sir thanks for joining us hey George it's good to be on with you it's great to be out and I guess I don't know Colorado it's the way we pronounce it down in Arkansas that's right we end it in as well it's Colorado's if you look at it otherwise hey thanks for taking time out of your busy morning to chat with us um I wanted to ask from your perspective as someone who's not from Colorado you are aware of the national issues and maybe even how they might impact us but as somebody who's out there in the U.S Senate fighting the fight every day how important is it for us to get into a position to go from 50 50 to at least 51.49 on the Republican side of things uh oh I can't stress it uh how critical it is to gain that one marginal senate seat George I mean when we have 51 and we're in the majority that means that we control the agenda it doesn't necessarily mean we can pass every good piece of legislation that we would like to help stop inflation or control the Border um or crack down on vicious criminals across the country but we can control what the Democrats are bringing to the floor if we had had 51 seats these last two years I promise you they wouldn't have passed that two trillion dollar stimulus any kind of infrastructure bill would have looked very different they wouldn't have passed their latest 700 billion dollar boondoggle that's only going to contribute to inflation we would take steps to block their 400 billion dollar student loan bailout which is grossly unfair to anyone who didn't go to college or worked to pay their way through college or pay off their loans we would be able to block all of their radical nominees to the federal courts which view themselves as legislators and lawmakers not as jurists um so I cannot stress how important 51 versus 50 in the United States Senate is to the people of Colorado and they have a great opportunity to make the Senate once again a effective check and balance on The Runaway ideological agenda of the Bible Administration now the Senate is largely viewed by political scientists as sort of this debating Society the house is a mosh pit as you can imagine when you're in this environment where you're going to have the same colleague for six years right you're going to end up dealing with them and you've got a guy like Michael Bennett he's our incumbent United States Senator who's been there I think since Strom Thurmond was a teenager but he's been in there a long time when you get to the business of campaigning for a Joe O'Day does it make it at all uncomfortable or awkward or do you feel like listen I have an insight into what Michael Bennett has done for Colorado because I've been working with this guy this is why we need Joe day or what Michael Bennett has done for Colorado and for our entire nation is give us the 13 inflation we've had since Joe Biden took office spent trillions of dollars that we don't have that it contributed that inflation including insane boondoggles like providing stimulus checks to prisoners just think about that you have you have the United States government super max prison in Colorado and those prisoners and those Prisoners the worst of the worst got stimulus checks because Michael Bennett voted against my amendment that would prohibit felons from getting them why would he know because he is a rubber stamp for Joe Biden and Chuck Schumer and their left-wing ideological agenda he is not the kind of clear-eyed Common Sense leader that Joe O'Day will be for the people of Colorado Michael Bennett votes with Joe Biden 98 of the time so a vote for a vote for Michael Bennett is a vote for Joe Biden when you look at the Joe O'Day campaign and any of you had the opportunity to spend time with Joe look all of these seats that are competitive could go one way or the other but when you look at Colorado's what gives you that sense of optimism that I think despite the fact that Michael Bennett's been around forever he's got a truckload of cash underneath him to spend I think Joe's going to pull this off and I I think Joe is extremely well positioned to win but don't take my word for it look at what Chuck Schumer's done Chuck Schumer has spent more than 10 million dollars trying to stop Joe day if he thought this race was in the bag or that Michael Bennett could run on his own record and succeed he wouldn't be funding to the tune of more than 10 million dollars all of those vicious attack ads that you've seen against Joe O'Day this year I know from my time in Colorado over the years that the people of Colorado want clear-eyed common sense in Washington they've given Democrats a chance now at the time that they want a check and balance on The Runaway Biden agenda and I'm confident they're going to deliver that checking balance by electing Joe O'Day we're talking with Senator Tom Cotton from Arkansas a couple questions if you would not about the Joe Day part but give us your sense of what we're gonna see take place with Ukraine and Russia right now as we start to head into those dreaded winter months from the outsider's perspective from having looked at this and having done my best to keep up with understanding war.com it feels like Russia is in a very unique and weird position and is Putin in the throes of his last big move or is there more to come I mean is this going to be a protracted battle is it going to be a negotiated peace where are we well there's no doubt that we are saying you're crying on the front foot this month I've had a very successful offensive to seize back much of the territory that Russia had taken from them earlier this spring Russia meanwhile is on the back foot you have Vladimir Putin trying to mobilize 300 000 reservists but we saw how poorly his active duty troops perform there's no reason to think those reservists would perform any better now I think that the president has gotten this wrong coming and going on the one hand he's displayed typical Democratic weakness by refusing to give Ukraine the weapons they needed when it might have made a difference for instance providing the weapons late last year that might have deterred this Invasion or provided him the kind of long-range artillery in the spring that would have prevented Russia from making the gains that Ukraine is having now having to fight back against but at the same time he's made extremely full hearty statements that that kind of reflect the worst Tendencies of you know Wildlife liberal interventionists who think that we can remake the world at a stroke I mean remember in his Warsaw speech in March when he said Vladimir Putin had to leave power now we might all welcome that development but we should not call for regime change in the middle of the shooting war in Europe against a country with a massive nuclear Arsenal that's not Ukraine's Mission either Ukraine has a very simple objective they don't want Russian troops on their soil and it is a primordial primordial right of any people to fight and die and kill for their own territory they are asking us to support them in that mission that's a mission we should support them in but we shouldn't be trying to go further than that we should be providing the weapons they need to fight the war to defend their own soil and their own homes are we going to have a government shutdown only a couple days left continuing resolution allows us to move forward in a timely fashion today and tomorrow and doesn't exist on any left-wing amendments going on this spending bill or perhaps if he simply allows uh Republicans to have an amendment Vote or two on things like our border policies then no we won't but again this is why it's so important that we get to 51 seats because it allows us to set the terms of debates it allows us to control the Committees and to write the legislation so this is being done on our terms that we can responsibly fund the government especially critical functions like our military or our border patrol and not simply try to spend more and more money that's just going to contribute to more and more inflation I know you have to be a cheerleader for the Republican cause in the Senate and all that but realistically speaking when you look at the map as it is today what do you think the final breakdown of numbers are when we get past the election in November I I think these voices are going to be close but I think in the end the American people are going to Simply look at look at their pocketbooks at the end of October when they're struggling to pay the bills for electricity or the gas bill uh struggling to fill up their tank struggling to buy food uh in the last week of the month they're going to think about the quality of life in their communities and whether they can even take their kids to a park or go downtown with their with their spouse anymore and say that we have to put the brakes on the Biden agenda that we need people like Joe O'Day in Colorado Adam lack salt in Nevada Herschel Walker in Georgia to put an effective checking balance on the Democrats in Washington so I'm very confident we're going to win at the same time we can't have overconfidence or complacency so I encourage all of your listeners to do what they can to help Joe get across the Finish Line in November we're the state with the number one fentanyl overdose rate in America and I know that from our little get together this earlier week you can very very precisely paint a picture of how it is that we get so much fentanyl here and it's something that really does require Federal intervention Colorado can't fix what's wrong with the fentanyl crisis all by itself why are we seeing this air yeah so George excuse me I want to correct uh what you just asked you thought it was about fentanyl overdoses I have to insist there is no such thing as a fentanyl overdose because no one takes fentanyl outside very carefully controlled pain management circumstances under a licensed position people take heroin people take cocaine people take meth people smoke weed nobody goes out and buys fentanyl I just read a stack of tragic letters from parents whose children had died of fentanyl in every case they had gotten the pill that was counterfeit that they thought was percocet or Oxycontin because they were just experimenting or they had migraine pain or they had pain from wisdom tooth surgery and those parents found their children dead that is not an overdose that is the poisoning and poisoning is a form of murder and we should treat these Fentanyl traffickers and dealers exactly like we would treat murderers we also have to secure our border because that's where almost all of these drugs are coming from and finally we have to take the fight to the cartels 108 000 Americans died last Year from from drugs almost all of them are coming from the cartels what would you do if Isis and Al Qaeda had set up shop in Monterey and killed 108 000 Americans in one year that's exactly what we should do to these curtails uh final thing before I know you get to get back to your your hearing you are uncomfortably tall how tall are you what's your height I'm six foot five which is usually an advantage in life I have to say it is uncomfortable when you're sitting in an old-fashioned Humvee though that was the next place I was going to go you spent time in the Army and I know you don't talk about it that's just what veterans do but tell us where you were and when you were there sure so I was in for about five years I was in my last year of law school when the 911 Tax happened um I kind of wanted to rush out my my friends in the Army told me not to do so that you know the Army wasn't going anywhere for sure and unfortunately bad guys probably wouldn't be going anywhere and if I dropped out of Law School in my third year after taking out three years of loan expanded degree and I I lost School alone probably wouldn't go anywhere when I started making a few hundred bucks a month as a E4 specialist uh they were right about that so I worked for a little bit after law school and paid off my loans and then joined in 2004 and I spent a little bit about a year at Fort Benning you know Fort beginning is it sometimes that's right um getting my uh commission as a second Lieutenant learning my craft as an infantry officer and going to Ranger and Airborne school I uh pretty much immediately deployed from Fort Benning out of Fort Campbell to Iraq was I I was a platoon leader for uh 40 Screaming Eagles in Baghdad under the first Airborne there it is yep Curry stands alone and then I was uh in Afghanistan in 2008 and 2009 um on a reconstruction team I was an operations officer so kind of basically in charge of ground ground operations uh for a team that was led by an Air Force Colonel and in between those two tours I was a platoon leader again at Arlington National Cemetery where I performed military honors funerals for our fallen heroes and great veterans well first uh thanks for that I think that people that don't appreciate the what took place during the war may not appreciate that the two times you were there and I was in Iraq after this but you were there before each of the surges which really were game changers and sort of how the war progressed afterwards you were there before we did the surges so it was still the wild west when you were in Iraq and Afghanistan yeah yeah um I like to think that it was just a coincidence that I was there right before the Surge and not causation um but it was uh it was pretty bad in both places and particularly bad in Baghdad in 2006 you know it was clear to me almost from the beginning but especially after the end of my tour there that we simply didn't have enough troops uh to uh control the population and protect them from both Al Qaeda and various Insurgent groups um you know that was a mistake that President Bush made in the early days of the War uh fortunately he was able to correct that mistake uh with the surge in 2007. we stabilized the country and Iraq like most of the Middle East frankly was basically stable when Barack Obama took office in 2009 and you saw what happened from eight years of democratic governance when Barack Obama thought it was more important that we apologized to the ayatollahs and others than that we protect America's interests and stand with our allies you're starting to see the same world disorder in the Middle East in Ukraine and in East Asia under Joe Biden Barack Obama's understudy well I had been in U.S division North in Iraq and I saw the difference after we were pulled out you remember that right there in about 2010 2011 when he said all the green suitors are out of the desert by the end of December and within it feels like months we're seeing images of mosul which was pretty well locked down by us it just door-to-door fighting I mean it was craziness that was out there you did OCS is that right center um I did do officer candidate school yesterday listen I think I see a trend here and that is you do everything the hard way right like OCS is the hardest way to get a commission you pick the hardest branch and then you went to Ranger school and then you went to both Wars before things got a little more stable is this a trend I mean is this your lifestyle um it's on occasion I've been accused of being the hard Ranger not the smart Ranger those who try to have a little bit of both um I would say that you know OCS uh is considered by some the hard way but uh certainly uh young men and women who spent four years in ROTC and uh at our military academies um definitely put in a long time to train to learn our troops uh OCS three months gives you a crash course it was good for me but I have high respect for anyone who raises their hand and wants to serve in any capacity and we need more kids to do that unfortunately a lot of kids are discouraged from doing it right now by the Biden administration's failures whether it's Afghanistan or the foolish vaccine mandates or the left-wing indoctrination sessions we're subjecting our troops to well the aphorism is true that the best-looking officers come out of ROTC but I want to leave you with just a couple of moments if you wanted to say some last thing to Colorado voters out there before we cut you loose to go do your business what is it yeah the simple question is are you better off now than you were two years ago can you make ends meet are you struggling with 13 inflation I got to tell you when I was driving around Colorado gas was a lot higher than it is in Arkansas I had to run into a Walmart grocery prices look higher there as well I saw a lot of homelessness we know the problem you're having with fentanyl the problems you're having with car theft uh if we continue down the path that Joe Biden has led us those problems are only going to get worse if you want a check and balance on the Democrats radical ideological agenda the way to do that right now is to elect Joe day in Colorado and send a clear-eyed common sense leader to Washington to represent your views and your values Senator Tom Cotton from the great state of Arkansas sir thanks for joining us I really appreciate you taking time out of your busy day yeah thank you George thanks sir

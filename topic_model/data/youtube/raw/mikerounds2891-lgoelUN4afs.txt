joining me live from capitol hill south dakota republican senator mike rounds who's a member of the senate armed services committee the foreign relations committee and the banking committee senator thank you for being here you were in a classified intelligence update last night i'm not going to ask you to reveal what was said but what can you tell us about the state of the conflict all right now the ukrainians are putting up one heck of a fight they're defending their homeland and it is coming as what we believe a surprise to the the russians what could have been uh in best case scenario for russia uh mr putin's forces may very well have been able to get to kev within the first 48 hours but what we're finding right now it's day six and the ukrainian forces are defending it they're fighting tooth and nail and that's one thing that you can't uh count on when you start making the analysis of how quickly one army could overwhelm another army uh right now they are the ukrainians are fighting and they're getting some resupplies from our nato allies and so forth and that appears to be making quite a difference well again we do have these russian nuclear threats putin has been very clear that he has now put them on alert does that really mean senator that at some point no president and no chancellor and no leader can actually promise that their troops from nato countries will not enter the ukrainian battle right now what he has done is is say what he's doing is he's talking about it and what they're doing are exercises but that doesn't mean that we're not watching him very very carefully but that means that if you're talking about the possibility of a nuclear activity then that's an entirely different issue than uh having nato move into to ukraine and i think they while it doesn't sound like they're separate they are identified and they're maintained separately we look at any threat which is nuclear in nature as being very very serious but as the president indicated earlier he said you know we're not anticipating a nuclear conflict and but right now that we don't know exactly what mr putin is going to be doing he has been rather unusual lately in terms of what he has actually been doing compared to what he has in the past he made a very serious misjudgment in terms of what his capabilities were with regard to ukraine and i think there's a number of people wondering whether or not there's something there that just simply is amiss he is cold he is calculating he is a murderer he's a killer we've known that but we haven't seen him make these types of blunders in the past and so when we talk about this what do you what happens when you have an individual like that when they're not successful in doing what they had planned on doing and when their attacks fall behind and then what happens next what do they do if they get to that point where they don't know what they should be doing next and when they start making threats uh in an area to either draw attention away from the conventional war going on or perhaps looking to see whether or not it draws our attention away from what's going on in ukraine to the sanctions because president biden of course gives his first a state of the union address tonight of this year and we know that the sanctions at least are causing some financial pain russia's stock market for the second day straight unable to open cannot function and the ruble is absolutely tanking it is uh showing extreme weakness here the likes of what we've not seen in many many years it's worth less than a single penny to the u.s dollar mitch mcconnell is saying of course as a republican that he supports what president biden is doing as far as the sanctions are concerned could this actually mean that we will hopefully at least not eliminate the difference between republicans and democrats but narrow the aisle and bring everyone together with regard to the sanctions that have been imposed right now the impacts are going to be longer term but they are working in the same way that we had hoped that they would but there's more that could be done and that should be done right now and that has to why in the world are we still importing four percent of our petroleum products from russia why haven't we shut that off why is it that we're not producing enough petroleum and natural gas here to actually help our european neighbors to wean themselves away from russia number one let's get the keystone pipeline working again let's open up the leases again on uh the federal lands let's send a message in terms of the futures on oil prices that we're going to become the largest producer and absolutely we're going to be able to overtake and we'll make the price of oil and gas come down again which means mr putin won't have the money to fund his war efforts but it also means that it will impact his economy directly both of which should be done right now and besides that the silver lining in that is you actually start bringing inflation in this country under control yeah that has to happen yet and right now the administration is indicating that they're still going to worship at the altar of climate change and we think that's got to change yeah and the federal reserve needs to to jump in here and and actually even just a quarter of a point at least start to tamp down inflation senator rounds thank you very much for joining us thank you

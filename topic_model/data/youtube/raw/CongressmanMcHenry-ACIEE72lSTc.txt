H  A KEY LAWMAKER ON THE PANEL. KEVIN: WE ARE HERE WITH CONGRESSMAN PATRICK MCHENRY, SET TO BECOME THE RANKING MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE AND THE NEW CONGRESS. TALK TO ME ABOUT THE HEARING. IT SEEMS LIKE REPUBLICANS ARE SATISFIED WITH HOW THEY ARE CONDUCTING DEREGULATORY POLICIES THAT THE FED. >> I THINK THERE IS A GREAT INTEREST AMONG REPUBLICANS THAT THEY MOVE MORE QUICKLY, THAT THE REGULATORY AGENDA HAS SLOWED AND WE WANTED TO QUICKEN, SO I THINK WE ARE IN GREAT NEED OF THAT, ESPECIALLY WITH THE ECONOMY AND THE SITUATION IT IS IN, AND ANY FOR ACCESS CAPITAL FOR MY CONSTITUENTS TO KEEP ECONOMY GROWING. KEVIN: HAVE YOU ASKED ABOUT TECHNOLOGY? CONGRESSMAN MCHENRY: ABSOLUTELY. I THINK THERE IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE FORWARD IN THE NEXT REGULATION THAT UTILIZES TECHNOLOGY, INCLUDING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, TO HAVE BETTER REGULATION, OR TIMELY REGULATION FOR MARKETS, THANKS, INSTITUTIONS, AND THERE IS SORT OF A GREAT DEAL OF CONFLICT AND INFORMATION WE ARE HEARING FROM REGULARS ON THEIR INTEREST IN MOVING FORWARD ON THAT AGENDA. THAT IS WHAT I QUESTION THAT ASKED THEY MOVE MORE QUICKLY ON ON EMBRACING TECHNOLOGY. KEVIN: TECHNOLOGY HAS DEVELOPED MORE QUICKLY THAN IN THE PAST. THERE WAS A MOMENT IN THE HEARING WERE CONGRESSWOMAN MAXINE WATERS, SET TO BECOME THE CHAIRWOMAN OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES COMMITTEE AND THE NEW CONGRESS, SAID PUBLICLY SHE LIKES TO KEEP PEOPLE "CONFUSED." SHE WAS JOKING ABOUT HER RELATIONSHIP WITH THE OUTGOING CHAIRMAN. WHAT TYPE OF, SET TO BECOME THE CHAIRWOMAN OF RELATIONSHIP DO YU HOPE TO HAVE WITH CHAIRWOMAN ON THE FINANCIAL SERVICES COMMITTEE AS WE HEAD INTO THE NEW CONGRESS? CONGRESSMAN MCHENRY: WELL, IN MY TIME, I HAVE PASSED FOUR BILLS THAT ARE WATERS' BILLS. NOW, OVERALL, MY EYES ARE WIDE OPEN. I UNDERSTAND FROM WHICH SHE SAID PUBLICLY, THAT HER AGENDA IS MUCH MORE ABOUT RESISTANCE AND ABOUT OVERSIGHT AND INVESTIGATIONS. I THINK WE HAVE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO CONTINUE THE PATH WE ARE ON WITH BETTER REGULATIONS, SMARTER MOVEMENTS, MORE FOCUSED ATTENTION ON ACCESS CAPITAL, HOUSING CRISIS. KEVIN: THAT IS LIKE JOBS AT 4.0 LEGISLATION WE ARE HEARING. DO YOU THINK THERE MIGHT BE SOME BIPARTISAN LEGISLATION BECAUSE YOU MENTIONED YOU WORK WITH HER ON FOUR BILLS, BUT IN PARTICULAR ON HELPING RURAL AND URBAN COMMUNITIES INCREASING ACCESS TO CAPITAL, PARTICULARLY FOR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITY AND BUSINESSES. CONGRESSMAN MCHENRY: I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR A DECADE THAT WE NEED TO DO BETTER ON URBAN AND RURAL, AND IN THOSE TWO AREAS IN A COUNTRY ARE SIMILAR. I THINK THOSE ARE GREAT OPPORTUNITIES FOR THAT. I UNDERSTAND THAT BECOMING RANKING MEMBER, THE CHAIR WILL SET THE AGENDA. IT IS AN OPEN QUESTION WHETHER MAXINE WATERS WILL EMBRACE THAT OR WHETHER SHE WILL EMBRACE OR POLITICS OF MORE ATTENTION FROM THE MEDIA AND MORE INVESTIGATIONS RATHER THAN SUBSTANCE. I HOPE WE CAN BE OF SUBSTANCE. KEVIN: SHE ISSUED AN EIGHT PAGE MEMO, DETAILING THERE IS A HOST OF DIFFERENT REGULATORY ISSUES SHE WOULD LIKE TO RAISE, ONE INCLUDING THE CFPB. YOU DISAGREE WITH HER ON THE ISSUE, THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU, BUT HOW WILL YOU VIEW THE MINORITY POSITION IN TERMS OF ON THE COMMITTEE TO DISAGREE WITH HER? WHAT DO YOU SEE YOUR ROLE IS? CONGRESSMAN MCHENRY: I THINK IT IS TALK SUBSTANCE RATHER THAN POLITICS. MUCH OF THAT SHOWED THROUGHOUT THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. MUCH OF IT IS ABOUT POLITICS RATHER THAN THE SUBSTANCE OF WHAT REGULATORS ARE DOING, SO I WILL FOCUS ON THE SUBSTANCE, THE IMPACT ON FAMILIES AND INSTITUTIONS. KEVIN: WHAT IF IT COMES UP IN REGARDS THE PRESIDENT? CONGRESSMAN MCHENRY: ANYBODY CAN GET ON TELEVISION TALKING ABOUT THE PRESIDENT IS THIS OR THAT. MY INTEREST IS, WHAT ARE WE DOING TO ACTUALLY ENHANCE FINANCIAL INCLUSION IN THE UNITED STATES? NOT ABOUT MAKING SOME SHOW ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS FROM DECADES AGO. KEVIN: ANOTHER AREA OF COMMON GROUND, WELLS FARGO. CONGRESSMAN MCHENRY: SURE. I HAVE BEEN OUTSPOKEN OF HOW WELLS FARGO IS TAKING A LONG IN TREATING THEIR CUSTOMERS. IT IS OBVIOUSLY A NORTH CAROLINA -- A MAJOR FOOTPRINT IN NORTH CAROLINA, BUT I HAVE BEEN OUTSPOKEN AT THIS AND LAST -- THIS CONGRESS AND LAST CONGRESS ON HOW THE ACTIVE. KEVIN: WHAT YOU WANT TO SEE THEM DO? CONGRESSMAN MCHENRY: I WANT THEM TO ACT RESPONSIBLY. THERE IS A GREAT LEGACY HERE WITH FIRST UNION, WELLS, AND SOMETHING HAS CHANGED, AND SOMETHING IS AMISS. KEVIN: ONE OF THE AREAS THAT COULD BE POTENTIALLY BIPARTISAN IS HOUSING REFORM. MAYBE. THE CHAIRMAN HAS RELEASED PROPOSALS IN SEPTEMBER WITH REGARDS TO OUTLINING THE HOUSING POLICY. DO YOU AGREE OR WOULD YOU MAKE CHANGES? CONGRESSMAN MCHENRY: THERE IS NOTHING NEW AND HOUSING DEBATE. WHAT POLICY ALTERNATIVES WE HAVE HAVE ALL BEEN LAID OUT PUBLICLY FOR AT LEAST THE LAST SIX YEARS. IT IS A QUESTION OF THE POLITICAL WILL FROM THE HOUSE AND SENATE TO SEE THIS THROUGH. A DECADE AGO, THE FEDERAL  AGO, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NATIONALIZED FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC. A DECADE AGO. WE HAVE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE HOUSING FINANCE REFORM. THERE ARE NEEDS IN RURAL COMMUNITIES AND URBAN COMMUNITIES THAT ARE UNMET NOW BECAUSE OF THE COST OF HOUSING AND ACCESS TO HOUSING. WE HAVE TO DO BETTER. I THINK IT IS AN ESSENTIAL OPPORTUNITY FOR US TOWARD WORK WITH SIMPLE SOLUTIONS WHEN IT COMES TO HOUSING. KEVIN: THE SENATE BANKING COMMITTEE DID RELEASE A BIPARTISAN FRAMEWORK. WHAT I AM HEARING IS THAT YOU ARE CONFIDENT YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET THAT TO CHAIRMAN WHEN WATERS -- TO CHAIRWOMAN WATERS. CONGRESSMAN MCHENRY: THERE IS THAT OPPORTUNITY BUT YOU HAVE TO PUT THE PUZZLE PIECES TOGETHER, AND I DO NOT THINK THE ALTERNATIVES PRESENT MEET -- CURRENTLY PRESENTED WILL MUSTER MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE, NOR DO I THINK THE SENATE COMPROMISE BILL WOULD MUSTER THE VOTES NECESSARY IN THE HOUSE, SO WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH SOME NEW WAY ON THIS AREA I AM VERY OPEN -- ON THIS. I AM VERY OPEN TO THAT. KEVIN: YOU WERE GOING TO BE VOTING FOR CHAIRMAN MCCARTHY TO LEAD THE MINORITY PARTY IN THE HOUSE THIS AFTERNOON. WHY SEE A BETTER CHOICE THAN CONGRESSMAN JORDAN? CONGRESSMAN MCHENRY: I HAVE WORKED CLOSELY WITH KEVIN THE LAST FOUR YEARS. I THINK HE BETTER REPRESENTS WHERE MOST OF OUR CONFERENCE IS AMONG HOUSE REPUBLICANS. HE HAS DONE THE POLITICAL PARTY, THE POLICY PART. HE HAS THE INGREDIENTS TO BE A GREAT LEADER. KEVIN: CONGRESSMAN MCHENRY, YOU COVERED IT ALL. AND MAYB

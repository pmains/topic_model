well thank you I want to thank chairman Korn and ranking member Feinstein for holding this important hearing I want to thank all of you for your years of school and research and dedication to this extremely important topic I want to talk a little bit about medical marijuana although marijuana is legal in Nevada for both medicine and recreational purposes the research that you're doing is so important for my state's hospitals providers schools parents law enforcement agencies anybody that's concerned with the public health impact and there are approximately in Nevada about 17,000 medical marijuana patients so this research that you do really impacts their lives and their ability to seek treatment for their medical conditions and so with that in mind I really appreciate the bipartisan approach which has led to this hearing and I hope the conversation will continue to be research and science-based it's so important that we have these longitudinal studies epidemiological studies so on and so forth it makes a real difference as to how our communities can educate and legislate if we need to to do the right thing but I want to talk about the potential benefits of medical cannabis and treating our nation's veterans we have over 220,000 veterans in Nevada and let me tell you I don't have to tell you how much they do struggle they struggle with chronic pain they struggle with depression anxiety post-traumatic stress stress symptoms and in too many cases they're becoming addicted to medications prescribed to them opioids other things like that our veterans they have given so much to their country they just want to come back they want to claim their lives and continue to serve their communities in whatever way is good for them and their families and so VA providers are currently prohibited from recommending or prescribing cannabis use the VA won't reimburse veterans for medical marijuana prescriptions from any sort former VA secretary David Shulkin he stated last week he believes the VA should be involved in research on anything that could potentially help veterans and their well-being so to dr. Hennessy and then anyone else after you were a member of a committee that conducted rigorous overview of available research on the potential health benefits of cannabis or therapeutic benefits it also identifies barriers to research and made recommendations so I would really appreciate your thoughts of how we might use cannabis to help our veterans through anxiety and depression and in those ways and and find alternatives to treat the issues that they are suffering from when they come home so thank you for your question senator so of the uses that you mentioned there there's randomized trial data supporting the use of cannabis products for chronic pain and the cannabis products that were studied most often for chronic pain was an oral solution of 1 to 1 THC to CBD it wasn't either smoke or vape cannabis the other indications that that you mentioned anxiety depression PTSD there are not good data from randomized trials that support the efficacy of either a whole cannabis or cannabis derived products for those indications lack of evidence doesn't mean that the products aren't if that none of the constituents of cannabis aren't effective and in some cases it merely means that the studies haven't been conducted or not enough of them have been conducted to identify a beneficial effect if there is one you would support us funding or lifting the ban on some of the research just find out if we can use these products effectively dr. Gruber yes and thank you so much for focusing on this issue we have a program through the mind there mind program called serving those who have served and it's dedicated to our veterans because so many are already using cannabis or cannabinoids for treatment many are interested in using it but we have no real data so you know we come at this as a quasi clinical trial because we can't administer products that are in the marketplace given our current federal regulations and restrictions so we do the best that we can but we follow these folks over time longitudinally okay and we need more data like that to be able to really understand the impact as referred to by dr. Hennessey we don't have a ton of data but certainly lifting anything that would allow greater research efforts to be made would I would be in favor of well thank you I want to you spoke about chronic pain and I was fortunate enough to be able to start the comprehensive care caucus which is focusing on palliative care people living with a terminal illness or chronic disease and they need palliative care although they may not be getting curative care and so can you speak to the effects of you how we confuse cannabis in a palliative care spectrum for those I said living with chronic disease or living longer with terminal illness to relieve some of the symptoms that they may be having as a result of their disease sure so one of the symptoms that that patients and palliative care experience is chronic pain and as I mentioned there are clinical trials showing that oral solutions of cannabis extract are effective for chronic pain in terms of other other indications for use in the palliative care setting I think more research is needed to be able to recommend them as effective therapies we don't want to recommend therapies and offer false hope to people for therapies that end up not being effective that in addition have side effects on their own right thank you I think it's also important to just add of telling what dr. Hennessey is saying to be able to assess the actual products that patients are using as opposed to just sort of guessing and the one-to-one ratios of oral solutions things like sativex are not necessarily in the market place for our palliative care patients our ongoing longitudinal study at the mine program actually follows patients with chronic pain as a subgroup and they demonstrate improvements over time using lots of different products but this research is really in its infancy and this is as far as I know the only longitudinal study like this in the country we need a lot more well I applaud all of your work and I do think that particularly in the medical space trying to find the ways that we can use marijuana to weather make chronic pain and anxiety terminal disease PTSD depression if we can find ways that make people help them go better through better through their lives then it is definitely worth worth researching and I appreciate your hard work thank you

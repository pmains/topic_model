welcome back everybody another great episode for you today and uh yeah guess what we're gonna be talking about the environment and the epa and to help us with that conversation we have mandy goodness akara god did i get that right yeah that was good i did it uh you're the former chief of staff uh for the uh trump administration administrator to the epa andrew wheeler and um you know to put it lightly you know your stuff and so look there's um let's frame the conversation this way if if you read um your typical headline it'll sound like this biden needs the epa trump destroyed it trump made lying about the environment and art form you know things like that uh trump you know the trump administration throws out clean air rules so there's this there's this thought out there there's this sort of disposition that if one clean air regulation is good if if you just label anything green if you say it's good for the environment well then a hundred would be better and there's really no going back it only goes in one direction um and and i think people don't realize that the epa is not this neutral body they tend to be very formative they tend to be pushing an agenda in one direction in one direction only and so you've just got a lot of insight on that um but but give us your background before you were before you were chief of staff what were you doing and how did you gain such expertise on this so i i grew up my career essentially interning from college through law school and i ended up doing various roles in the house side and senate side and personal offices and committee offices and ultimately where i ended up was at the senate environment and public works committee starting in 2015. and when i was there i was in charge of committee oversight of air and climate regulations in 2015 and 2016. so this was the year after the climate action plan under then president obama came out it was the lead up to the paris climate accords and the final reveal and finalization of the clean power plan so you had some large shifting dynamics in terms of the extent of authority that epa assumed it had to effectuate certain regulatory outcomes and we performed extensive oversight in the senate and when the administration changed president trump won our staff director at that time was ryan jackson he became the first chief of staff and he brought those of us that were interested from epw over to the epa and we were part of the initial team there was a small group of us about 10 in the beginning i'm essentially handling a lot of the political responsibility at the agency and we hit the ground running and so i you know i had i spent time exploring the ins and outs of the clean air act as well as the conversation around international climate policies and studying the ins and outs of the administrative procedure act i'll tell you this from the outside looking in it's a little bit different from the inside looking out so the extent of my expertise and where with all of how everything actually works increased dramatically once i got in the agency but had a pretty good setting to uh to to work from to come into the agency and you know start trump's vision within the epa in a very successful manner so i mean you know trump was famous for promising um uh two cuts to getting rid of two regulations for every one put in i think uh i think the ratio ended up being maybe a one to eight and i would imagine that most of those ended up in the epa's hands um so how did we navigate that and then how do we navigate the narrative that i laid out previously where again if one regulation is good then 10 must be better and and with the environment this becomes very emotional for people nobody's actually thinking through you know it with the costs and the benefits here um because that you know like if you ask any reasonable person um you know what sort of parameters you must go through what kind of process you must go through to add another lane to a highway we would probably develop some consensus no reasonable person thinks that you should do an endangered species study for a you know for a simple off-ramp okay but but we do do things like this we do crazy things like this i mean how do you how do you navigate that what's the what's the overarching philosophy that we should be thinking about and what does the media get wrong when they're you know lambasting you guys as killers of the environment well um there's a lot there's a lot to discuss there one one of the overarching elements is that more regulation is not always good because you get to a point of diminishing returns you can understand this in the application of anything but certainly you get to a point where regulations become so onerous they generate unintended consequences on that can have negative impacts for people which epa's mission is to protect public health and the environment and you can have negative consequences to the environment so what we were very thoughtful and when we came into the trump administration was look the environmentalists and political uh motivations and groups had taken environmental laws that were put in place for good reason but distorted their application to become barriers to growth and barriers to economic development we threw that out from the get-go and basically said look you can have a clean environment but it also has to be balanced next to a growing and robust economy because wealthy countries have the cleanest environments it's not the inverse of that so we understood that and we applied that to the regulatory framework work and the other thing that we prioritized from the get-go was the extent and limitations of the rule of law the last administration showed a consistent tendency to take their authority and expand it well beyond what congress had ever thought so we came in and respected the four corners of the law so to speak and and didn't overstep our relative authority and at the end of the day what we achieved in the trump administration at the epa is um we had a five to one ratio so for every one regulatory action we had five deregulatory actions um at the by the time we walked out the door in january 2021 we completed around 77 deregulatory actions saving 99 billion dollars but most importantly at the same time positive environmental trends continued our air pollution continued to decline water quality improved and we cleaned up legacy pollution all over the country that had been holding communities back and so we proved out this concept that you can pull regulations off the book you can reduce the economic impact and um responsibility that falls to stakeholders while maintaining important standards and then those impacted stakeholders whether it's a factory or a power plant or refinery they can take money that would be spent complying with procedural expectations and put it towards investing in the latest and greatest technology more efficient processes and that proves much better for achieving better tangible environmental outcomes than growing the bureaucracy and just trying to curb and stymie economic growth so the one of the things the left likes to say is that the trump administration's epa was directly attacked scientists and you know and and and tried to engage in this sort of orwellian uh censorship of anything that had to do with climate change i mean what what do you say to that what's what's the truth behind it and maybe hit on the the science transparency rule which i think came at the end of the administration and tell us what that is and how the left reacted to it yeah that was a totally false false statement um there are a lot of misrepresentations that panned out in the media um for all manner of reasons which we don't necessarily have to get into but the truth is um we were we were very welcoming of all sorts of conversations that was another element that we prioritized when we walked in was listening to everyone who had um had had had a skin in the game or steak at the table what whatever you want to use but we brought in our engineers and our scientists and our economists and our epidemiologists all of these experts reside at epa so anytime we were making um regulatory decisions we brought them in to hear them out and they all speak a little bit different language um and all of that comes together and ultimately be presented as a policy decision that the administrator would make but we prioritize the advice coming from our science it's largely housed within our office of research and development at the epa and they provide advice on everything from air quality standards to water quality standards to the presence of different pollutants and what may or may not be working in particular areas across the country so not only did we listen to internal scientists but also external scientists because um science is better when there's more people involved that's why peer review is very important and it's actually an embedded part of epa's regulatory process and so one of the things too that that we had learned it was also interesting a lot of us coming from the senate and then working at the agency during the obama years we had heard from a number of outside folks who felt like they were impacted by regulations but they didn't understand either underlying justifications because there was a proverbial black box whether you're talking about the underlying scientific assessments or the underlying cost benefit analyses so when we came in having experienced that for multiple years we wanted to fix that within the epa and so on the science side we put out as you reference towards the end the science transparency rule which really is what it is it or what what's in the title is increasing public access to the scientific work that goes into epa's decision-making authority um this is something that has been fixed as controversial but it shouldn't be i mean this should be a bipartisan endeavor um and you know it's it's that is the nature of the scientific process you put something out there you test it and then you share it with your um equally expert like-minded or equal experience friends to cross-check and the name of the game in science is reproducibility and there's some variations within that especially if you're dealing with hard hard science versus social science um but nonetheless that's very important and allowing the public to have access one i think improves outcomes and then two improves the credibility that the public has in what's coming out of the agency that that they can in fact trust it because it's been it's been double checked when you guys took took over um what were some of the most shocking i guess pseudoscience examples you know you know trying trying to trying to justify an excessively costly regulation based on a set of supposed scientific facts that turn out to be pseudoscience well um it's hard to come up with that in the context of the science um i mean there there is there is an instance there's one study it's that basically underlies a lot of the standards under the national ambient air quality standards section so um the heart of the clean air act where we set the standards for criteria pollutants to protect public health and um there is an analysis or there's a study that was done decades ago it's called the the harvard six city studies and um that is something that hasn't been revisited in a really long time and me just mentioning this if anyone on the other side is listening their head is exploding right now it's very it's a very sensitive subject people are very protective of it and they come up with all sorts of reasons why we shouldn't go back in and re-analyze studies that were done decades ago um where there are some questionable metrics that were put into it so it is real science i wouldn't say it's pseudoscience so it doesn't necessarily fit well let's call it weak science and i mean and the point of the the transparency rule is to at least at least demonstrate that i mean look i would call it weak science if you're if for instance you're proposing a multi-trillion dollar plan to read you know to to completely destroy the us economy and for the for the purpose of reducing carbon emissions but what are you fighting and then you actually look at the un data and what you're fighting is a well if you know if we do nothing right now well then our our our gdp per per capita globally decreases by about four percent now that's according to the un data that i thought we all agreed on so you know it becomes a cost-benefit question and and you know to your point i guess it's not just about exposing the the the science being used but also exposing the cost-benefit analysis which is maybe even more important um in which it would you know again because it gets back to this premise that there are that the the left leg stop and then and the radical environmentalists like to operate off of which is which is no cost is too high right an additional regulation must be better as long as you say it's for clean air or clean water but it's like wait for this tiny marginal benefit if there isn't as a benefit but an enormous cost yeah well and bringing that up there is a very egregious um somewhat known example in the context of max the mercury and air toxic standard which was set in 2012 and in that instance you had epa load the cost benefit dice so the fact that there were billions dollar billions of dollars in costs um they could amplify the benefits by by doing something called co benefits so the mercury rule was aimed at reducing mercury when you calculated the benefits and that rule to reducing mercury you only had four to six million dollars in benefits generated well that doesn't that doesn't work out if you've got billions of dollars of cost so what epa did is they plus up the benefit side by adding co-benefit of reducing pm 2.5 if you're reducing mercury you're controlling for that then you're also reducing particulate matter pm 2.5 and the benefit calculation is much greater so they took millions of dollars and turned that into billions of dollars and then they could justify the rule so that was one of the purposes and motivations behind our cost benefit rule which was something we also did within the past year finalized was to ensure that when you're doing the analysis and setting standards you focus on the costs and benefits of the targeted pollutant first and that way you don't end up in this instance where epa set a standard that causes significant economic harm with very little actual benefit yeah um that's a real and and by the way i'd point out that um the bite administration found a federal judge to vacate this rule and that should infuriate people i mean this is this is this is just transparency just tell us just tell us how you came up with this because it's really easy especially in the political world to for me to get hit with a headline that says look billions of dollars in savings and benefits and everybody just sort of accepts it um even though i always find that funny like nobody trusts the media except when we're quoting them um but especially when it comes to environmental regulations uh you have to dig in like a a bunch of layers deep i mean it's uh because you guys you can you can manipulate the data and this and the stats and the cost-benefit analysis to an exceptional extent and um and it ends up with these really funny stories like you know it takes five years to put a telephone pole in you know or or 10 10 years to get approval for an off-ramp i mean what does what are so you know sorry i saw an expression on your face when i said that so so go down that path for me i mean what are some of the ridiculous things that we do in the name of environmentalism but in the end just make our lives miserable for no good reason and no environmental benefit well one of the things is um permitting reform so if you develop if you expand out a business create economic growth then you are likely going to be covered by some degree of environmental permit and in epa under the clean air act we have something called new source review um which is something that has caused the opposite effect what it essentially has done is a company that's looking to invest in newer technologies let's say that's a 10 million dollar proposition well if they trigger new source review and they have to go through that degree of epa permitting a 10 million dollar project turns into a couple billion dollar endeavor and so when you're talking about companies where they're either operating on thin margins or they have other cat-back expenditures or maybe they're trying to hire more people to grow their company you know millions of dollars to billions of dollars that totally cancels out the project and what it also cancels out is the environmental benefit that would have been generated from that um if you have a more efficient process you're doing more with less um so you're using less energy or you have um better scrubber technology and you're reducing the pollutants that are coming out of the relative stack and we have um under the new source review that was one of the most egregious examples of where you had such onerous regulations that it was deterring people from investing in more environmentally appropriate and environmentally friendly technologies to improve their operations it was actually so egregious that at the start of the administration you may recall the president executive order directing people to write in about uh their deregulatory goals and what would reduce barriers to economic growth and at the top of the list and department of commerce put this report together it's still out there for anyone who's interested but at the top of the list was epa permitting um an epa permitting reform and it's not just epa though like what you reference is that that we also made reforms under nepa um the national environment environmental protection act um and this was something that was headed by the white house um over at ceq but that was one of those instances where any federal project that triggered the application of nepa whether it was a road or a bridge um it basically made it impossible in this country to build roads and and roads today in certain areas um roads today are much better and made much more efficiently than even 10 years ago but we have environmental standards that get in the way of developing that out and it's it's detrimental to the um to the infrastructure of the country on the transportation side but also think about the infrastructure that's necessary to update the energy grid and and as we continue to evolve um in a more energy grid process so i mean it sounds just like you're beating your head against the wall i'm trying trying to uh trying to get these common sense regulations through or streamline these these things so that we can both protect the environment and live and do common sense things um how was that i mean how do you you know you're a political appointee and and underneath that there's there's thousands and thousands of of lifetime bureaucrats lifetime federal workers um let's assume many of which are just trying to do the right thing but there's always going to be institutional resistance and look nobody nobody joins the epa nobody becomes a a lifelong epa bureaucrat because they love big business or you know i mean like that's not why they joined um they they joined to to with with kind of one goal in mind and you know this is sort of an implicit bias and i think it's a reasonable thing to say that that the the their one goal is to protect the environment and so i think there's a bias most likely to protect the environment even if it comes at excessive cost to everything else so what was that like dealing with that and how much how much institutional inertia is there and how much worse is it going to get under biden where the political appointees he has are uh are not there to resist any of that yeah it um it was really interesting i would say going in i i had to shut off the media um especially coming in brand new to this and and one of the things in this administration so a lot of a lot of people who had previously worked at the administration in the bush administration we're not interested in coming back and working for president trump for a variety of reasons um so what it did is it made people like me who coming into the positions i took i would say that the people historically who have had them had 10 to 15 years more career experience before taking on these big initiatives now it gave us great opportunities and we did a lot but what we were missing was the institutional wherewithal of how to actually get the bureaucracy to work for us and that was one of the hardest things um luckily i had a really good support network and one of my support network ended up being my direct boss the assistant administrator for the office of air and radiation bill warren someone who had that institutional experience and knowledge but leading up to that point um you know things would just not not move or not be achieved or there were a lot of instances where i would have a meeting meeting with a group and within the air office alone there's five different sub offices and then each of those five different sub offices i was dealing with anywhere from 15 to 20 different issues at any given time so it's certainly the drinking from the fire hose mentality so i'd have a meeting make a decision and then the follow-up meeting wouldn't be for four to six weeks but during that four to six weeks the the people within that office they wouldn't be working to achieve the decision sometimes they would come back in and just do a total repeat of the brief hoping they think they can outlast you yeah totally is this the deep state i mean is this the deep state that everybody talks about i don't know he's like using that word i mean it's a little kooky but this is what people mean by it for sure it's true and it exists and it's not um it's sometimes it's subtle the deep state isn't always someone jumping out of a closet and stabbing you in the back well i would hope not because that'd be weird an odd day at the office but it's but it's it's it's the subtle slowdown of what you're trying to achieve now some of that is by the nature of the bureaucracy the bureaucracy is is a system designed to slow down decisions to ensure that they're thoughtful and balanced and methodical unfortunately that can be abused and there were a lot of people um within the agencies and there were some at epa that used that to their to their advantage to slow our progress down um and so you know we there's also something within there's a process within the process um it's called the adp process but essentially it's a series of checks to ensure when we have a major regulatory action all impacted offices are included everyone has an opportunity to have a say and then we have regular check-ins with the administrator so we streamlined some of that and ensured that you know we didn't fall into this process where the administrator or or whoever's the head of the office would make a decision and then no actual work would occur until the next check-in um for a variety of reasons but yeah i mean that like the deep state's real it's not everyone there's a lot of really good civil servants that i worked with that were extremely helpful um but you know here's the thing too that that a lot of people may not understand is there's politics within the bureaucracy and for every every civil servant that was being helpful to me there was probably someone taking notes that is now sharing those notes with the bind administration telling the biden people that this civil servant was really helpful to the trump administration you should either cut them out of the process or punish them for some reason because they helped us achieve our vision of environmental progress i mean that goes on too so it's uh there's there's lots of lots of internal politics um that that i think those aren't necessarily i bet and i mean it's and it's like the political leanings of federal workers are almost always on the left um and in the epa i'd imagine it's uh it's certainly not 50 50. uh so it's probably extremely challenging and those biases certainly manifest into actions um have you ever read state of fear by michael crichton yeah so great book i mean i read it when i was like i don't know like 12 maybe a long time ago um maybe a little older but uh yeah so you know it's it's a fictional story about um i actually don't even remember the plot but it's basically about environmentalists versus non-environmentalists but but it it but it uses and it's a bit about the climate change debate as well and um but mostly what it's exposing is the massive multi-billion maybe multi-trillion dollar business behind environmentalism and it is not all it's not all nice and and pretty in sunshine right there's it's it's a money-making industry um there's massive consultancies uh massive non-profits there's a lot of money to be made here and so you know how worried should we be that that some of our career bureaucrats are really trying to to please some of that industry um maybe look for a job out out there uh when they when they get out of this one and um you know does does that tend to affect some of uh some of these decisions as well yeah certainly i mean they want to stay in the good graces i'll say this too which becomes a surprise so republicans we always get charged that we're doing the bidding of corporations and industry but actually um a lot of the civil servants they either want to work at an ngo or they want to go work um within the regulatory department or compliance department of large corporations and so this this is uh most prevalent in um something called the heavy duty vehicle standards where you had major corporations that were working with the agency and at the at the bureaucracy before they had even put a proposed rule so kind of behind the scenes before the public knows what's going on setting up standards and coming to an agreement in principle and you have corporations in there wielding the regulatory process in a way that they can afford but they know that smaller businesses or disruptive technologies they're not going to be able to comply and they can squash their competition through the regulatory process and they have great relationships with career bureaucrats that want to keep that good relationship because whenever they leave they want to go and they they want to be a part of the corporate world so there is a revolving door um i'm not i i you know i think being in an industry and coming into an agency whether it's legal or whether it's at a company or whatnot is is good right it informs the process when you're coming in as a regulator but there's a hypocrisy to it because if you're republicans coming in and you worked on one side of the equation well then you've got a corrupt heart or you've got corrupt morality but the other side because they worked at ngos or they worked for um you know morally superior corporations that do a lot of greenwashing well that's okay um and that's actually encouraged so there are those dynamics where um the bureaucracy will happily work with corporations for a variety of reasons and they don't care that the standards they ultimately set puts out those corporations business helps them grow or or protect market share and then suppresses the ability of disruptor technologies that may be better from a variety of perspectives from ever actually taking off yeah that's exactly right i mean another example of that would be big oil companies support a carbon tax and um you know they know very well that that might result in them gaining market share because well one they already have a huge international footprint but two they might swallow up some of those mid-sized producers and smaller producers that can't possibly uh work in those margins and um you know i don't like it we can talk about carbon tax we might as well why not um you know i don't i don't like it because it's unless it's international it's useless um and i would make the argument and tell me if this is a stretch but you might actually increase global emissions because demand doesn't go away but if you tax if you tax our production excessively what will happen is you might see um production shift to countries like russia saudi arabia and uh more likely that you get an increase in emissions accordingly just because they're they're dirtier producers they're more harmful to the environment um another example i would say is you know why do you think amazon wants a 15 minimum wage because they can afford it because they're big and uh because they get most of their profits from amazon web services anyway so they can afford it they can virtue signal and they can gain market share by putting all the smaller ones out of business so um you can respond to any of that i ramble it's very timely actually um there's a wall street journal article about an association discussing this point yesterday but i i think yeah if you make energy more expensive here um demand is not going to go down you're exactly right and it will will go abroad it'll go abroad to russia and to china and china has proven very dishonest in the environmental discussion what uh shut the front door i know breaking news here um they they the last time they updated their emissions this is just one example the last time they updated their emissions inventory which is essentially every country is supposed to calculate the emissions that come from various industries they measure all that and they submit it to the u.n we actually do this um in the precursor treaty to paris called the united nations um uh convention on climate change unf triple c um none framework convention on climate change sorry um china last submitted emissions data to that inventory in 2014 and their emissions calculation this has been proven um is off by an amount that is more than all the emissions of germany and a few other european countries it's something like 20 percent and so they're not only dishonest in the data that they're submitting in the context of environmental discussion but they continue to talk about being leaders in climate change and building out renewables meanwhile though they are building more coal plants than any other country and they're building them um in ways that don't even comply to standards that our coal plants have been meeting for decades they don't use the latest and greatest pollution control technologies that reduce things like nitrous oxide um and particulate matter from coming out which is why if you ever go to china and i haven't been since the 1990s 1994 actually but my husband's been fairly recently um he he was wearing face masks when he was there before covid just because the air pollution and air quality is so bad when you walk outside if you don't have a face mask on you literally cannot breathe they are suffocating their own people um but the international community and the biden administration has shown a propensity to turn a blind eye to that because china will say the right things in the climate change discussion and it's just it's it's so dishonest well they don't just turn a blind eye they like openly applaud china there's a really weird thing going on i i can't tell if it's purposeful or if it's stupid like are the chinese really that good at propagandizing us um but yeah i mean you you hear that a lot um from from not stupid people uh i just saw an interview that drove me crazy and i can't remember who it was with but i know you'd recognize the name and i was like well i just want to like jump into that and be like what are you talking about like people are people are hailing china as this sort of this climate and environmental leader is it just because they produce a lot of solar panels and ship them here i mean is that why like i don't know what people's what people's thoughts are on this it's weird you know i won't pretend to be like a broader china expert but i think it's some approach to like soft diplomacy but um i do know enough that um they're enough of a threat on the economic side as well as other sides that we shouldn't be treating them with kid gloves and we certainly if you if you call yourself an environmentalist just stepping aside from all of that if you call yourself an environmentalist then you need to call out good behavior and call out bad behavior and not give anyone a free pass because of some larger soft diplomacy effort that's i mean that's what i think um but but china is certainly a problem and then you know back to back to your carbon tax um it certainly makes things more expensive but it also doesn't work i mean we've seen areas where they have embraced carbon taxes costs go up as do emissions as you mentioned and so it's ineffective i mean the effective way to to reduce emissions if that's really what you want to do and not create whole new bureaucratic institutions or raise a lot of money to pay for entitlements um then you invest money in technology or you encourage the marketplace to produce technology because we have proved it epa we know how to reduce emissions um it's by encouraging technology it's not by just applying a strict fee um because ultimately the end of the day that just that just makes larger companies grow larger but doesn't necessarily reduce emissions or reduce other environmental impacts yeah and you know environmentalism aside the point you've made over and over again it's really important and worth repeating regulatory capture is a real thing in big business big corporations tend to love more regulations you know so it's just important for people to realize that it always seems counterintuitive but it's always true um and yeah you know when it comes to the carbon tax yeah you can tax it more but you don't have the technology to replace it now that now they would say but you need to incentivize them to invest in the technology to replace it and you know and so so fair enough i mean i understand it in theory um for sure and it works on a you know on a graph and in some in the classroom um but but like you said it's not it's not obvious that it works in real life um and for that reason just because you don't have the technology to replace it with that it's actually a baseload power source um and so what are some countries that have tried it i mean do you have those examples off off off the top of your head where it doesn't work that well certainly australia did um they they imposed one and then they backed away from it um at the end of the day their electricity costs increased substantially and they saw that they weren't getting the environmental bang for the taxpayer buck um and that also has it also has major political implications i mean you saw some pretty shifting dynamics in australia over the last few years um you also saw in germany um now i'm saying this i i know that they had some degree of a carbon tax they certainly had a significant investment in renewable energy sources and i think that was mostly funded by um relative taxes but nonetheless um energy prices skyrocketed the term energy poverty um became commonplace where you had people who just could no longer afford their energy utility bills they had to do without energy and they had to do it in some extreme weather conditions that cause severe negative health consequences um most people can understand that i'll say i was uh i'm in mississippi right now and we had an ice storm come through it's the same one that went through texas and it shut down a couple of days in a place like mississippi where it was um you know 20 degrees outside with substantial humidity that makes it feel even colder and um it's hard i mean there were there were a lot of people our church actually opened up the doors to to let people come in who were susceptible to being exposed to the extreme weather conditions um to ensure that nobody lost their life or got sick because losing power has real tangible immediate consequences especially to vulnerable citizens so we experienced that in in a very small form here but in germany and places in europe where they've been um they've been embracing either carbon tax policies or green new deal type initiatives or over reliance on building grids that can't withstand disruptions and and changes that are naturally going to occur um people are having to do without energy and typically they're having to do without it at times where they're exposed to extreme conditions and so not only does it not work but it has significant health impacts um that that people need to understand right you need the power to be on when you need it to be on and um you know that was the big lesson i won't beat that dead horse too much because the last podcast we did was was on that last couple really and um it's a big lesson coming out of the the issues we had in texas um with the power outages says is you need power that works all the time and you have to have that base load and so there's a natural ceiling to how much renewables you can have on the grid before it's just there's diminishing returns there's just no point to it because there's definitely a floor on on how much base load you can get rid of now you can still make it cleaner and um you know and promote things like nuclear and i do want to i want to get to that actually here in a minute but i want to pull on another thread that we we were talking about was sort of the again the the deep state the the interest groups of um the the radical side of environmentalism and uh groups like sierra club greenpeace um who who lead the charge on this but talk to us about some of their strategies particularly weaponizing the court system and and i wonder if there's a way for us to to fight back along those grounds as well it doesn't doesn't seem so because it seems so easy to do what they do and it almost seems like some of these regulations especially that my colleagues like to propose are almost designed for trial lawyers to take advantage of and and stop things whether it's a pipeline or whether it's a new development or whatever it is just to stop any kind of human development and sue and then settle and sue and then settle um you know i've talked to um um others in the administration about this about this um this tendency on permitting for for bureaucrats in washington with good intentions takes so long to permit something just because they don't want to get sued right so it when you should just be approving something like that because it's so simple they might write a thousand pages they might do years and years of work just to avoid these frivolous lawsuits yeah and there's ample opportunities for groups looking to slow down the process for them to weigh in and allege things that um they may be meritorious or not but the effect will be delaying uh the receipt of a permit and then whatever it is the permit is for to build something out or to grow something and create additional economic productivity um sue and settle uh was a major problem and it was something that we from the start also sought to address by not totally doing away with the ability to settle with groups because sometimes there are instances where it makes sense and it's more efficient just from a pure good governance perspective knowing that at the end of the day we do have resource limitations whether it's personnel or money monetarily but nonetheless this was something that the environmentalists figured out how to do quite effectively where they would sue the agency sometimes to sue the agency for not doing something and then that forces the agency to get on a court-mandated time frame to actually do something um and there's all sorts of problems with that if you're in a court mandated time frame the agency like people also procrastinate so at some point um the agency runs up to a court deadline and they have to regulate in haste um and and that can cut short the consideration of public input that can cut short the consideration of technicalities um like nuanced differentiations between regulatory standards so it can it can cut out pieces of that process that are really important to ensure that regulations issued at the end of the day are balanced achievable and move the ball forward in terms of environmental progress the other issue too with with the environmental groups i mean it's a revenue source for them they can sue and settle with the agency on certain aspects um and they can get they regularly get forty thousand dollars in attorneys fees just here and there um and they'll sue on all manner of things so there's there's taxpayer dollars funding environmentalist organizations um to to sue the agency in perpetuity it's just that it's it's it's continual so we tried we tried to slow it down to slow it down to limit its application because there's also there's a there's a public component to it as well um if the agency enters into a consent agreement with one party um it's a legally binding agreement that enjoys protections um but limits the ability of the public to know what's going on limits transparency in those conversations and those are typically attorney-client protections and so those are good things but in this context when they're abused you're cutting the public out of something that by its very design is supposed to be very inclusive of the public and so we slowed that process down we set in place an internal mechanism to assess whether or not we should ultimately settle um and invite uh other parties to to have a say in that process as well but at the end of the day you know it's something congress could weigh in on um i i certainly think that uh now politically you you know you know better than me right now that that would be a a tall hill to climb but it's going to take something like that to better define and limit those practices otherwise it's up to whoever the political leadership is at that time and what we've seen with democrats is they they have a strong propensity to um sue to engage in sue and settlement practices um and it ends up giving revenue a revenue source to organizations that sue the agency to you know force certain environmental goals but then also those same organizations fund uh political parties and then political candidates and so there's there's it gets it gets somewhat dirty pretty quick yeah yeah it does and it's not just on the environmental side obviously the the um the you know i say that about why were democrats against covet liability right this is a big priority pretty should be pretty bipartisan you ask your average american should their should their local restaurant be sued if somebody gets covered there everybody's like no of course not that that would be bad um but we can't get democrats to agree with that they like their trial lawyers trial lawyers um you're out there spending money on like spending money on politics um so maybe um what can we expect from the byte administration uh how radical is it going to be obviously the democrat party as a whole has moved as lurch to the left as you as you probably have an ear to the ground and see who's starting to staff to all the political appointments at epa on a scale of one to ten you know ten being aoc green new deal and and one being um well geez i don't know you or you know like what what's it gonna be yeah um i think well it it's it's interesting it depends on who you're talking about so um the the epa administrator michael regan um who comes from north carolina is a safe based regulator i mean as far as i understand i think he's in like the six to seven category like he certainly leans democrat um is pro regulation he's laid out and certainly bought into and repeated the climate change environmental justice talking points that are going to be used as a justification to ramp up the regulatory actions from epa um but you who i believe will really be calling the environmental shots is going to be gina mccarthy um and former secretary of state kerry who are at the white house and you have a climate domestic climate czar and international climates are and and they're going to be the ones calling the shots um and as far as that range i mean they're in the i would say the like nine category i hate to say 10 because aoc kind of stays out on her own but um they they're they're pretty extreme and the thing you have to understand about gina mccarthy is she's been running the nrdc um which is an activist organization that has really been laying out a lot of these extreme environmental policies where they're finding ways to implement the green new deal through regulatory fiat um and i believe that she's going to be the one ultimately calling the shots which is also totally different than the last administration um the thing about president trump is he would essentially deputize his cabinet um his cabinet leaders he had the the full trust in their cape their ability to achieve his vision but he just let them go off and beat and and if anything came up administrator wheeler called the president now it's going to be a situation where you have these climate czars calling the shots and it'll be interesting to see um if if epa soon to be confirmed i presume uh epa administrator michael regan something comes up is he gonna have to go through the equivalent of white house staff to talk to the president even though he's the cabinet member it's going to create a lot of interesting dynamics and at the end of the day he may have a propensity to be more moderate and considerate because he has state-based experience where they take epi deals and implement them um but he's going to be taking orders from someone who is just the head of one of the more extreme environmental groups that engages in sue and settle um engages in you know these notions of carbon free by 2035 and putting it into the internal combustion system and really being dishonest and disingenuous about all the progress that was made from the environmental side under the under the trump administration you know what's interesting about about this topic is again i think most normal thinking smart people want some balance in their environmental regulation okay and i think that's what our site stands for we just want balance and i think that's rational environmentalism and nobody wants a bunch of sludge going into the rivers and nobody wants plastic in the ocean like obviously nobody wants this we want you know sustainable forest management with all of these things um we don't think there should be too many we don't want to look like china with with air pollution and we don't by the way um it's kind of a whole other we could probably talk about for another hour on you know on on particulates in the air and what's harmful and what isn't and you know maybe assessing some of the democrats claims that everybody you know actually i do want to ask you this one because i i i have heard some throw out a statistic that's like one out of five people die from from air pollution i've i don't i don't know where they're getting this from it seems excessive how do you even assess whether somebody died from air pollution you know like in america of all places well this goes into this goes into uh what i referenced earlier about when you're talking about social sciences where human beings are involved in the equation um it's hard to have a scientific analyses that's analysis that is reproducible and therefore withstand scrutiny within the scientific process um it's most likely they're referencing one of those quick fire analyses where someone looks at let's say in a given day that ozone levels triggered and then someone will just take that one statistic and then they will see how many people went to the hospital with either like asthma attacks or heart attacks and then they will associate it yeah both of them and it's like okay maybe that's one factor but life is pretty complex and being out in the world is pretty complex and so the heart attack may have been triggered by someone's lifelong um maybe they ate mcdonald's every day or something like that they were unhealthy or maybe there was a stressful event that that triggered a response but those sorts of analyses they don't account for um everything else everything life yeah another example yeah another example of that i mean earlier in my early podcasts was with the was this no it wasn't oren cass was it who did that analysis anyway there's analysis on you know you always hear this giant number like you know this is this is the cost of climate change or this you know the social cost of carbon and usually what they're doing is is is adding in there the human cost so the human life lost to climate change and then you look at how they actually analyze this and come up with this with these numbers it's pretty shocking and very easy to debunk i mean basically what they're the premise of their argument is basically okay if philadelphia is cold now it's going to be warmer in a hundred years and it's going to look like mississippi or houston and so we assume that you're going to have 150 times more poor more heat-related deaths in philadelphia as a result like 150 times more than houston so so on its face this doesn't make any sense and and they and they have some tricky math they come up with this but but if you just take a quick step back and you're like wait a second because that's the that's the implication of this analysis and it it completely falls on its face it's just not true yeah it's um it's if you were a lawyer and you were trying to argue before a court and you brought scientific information it would be thrown out yeah um it's just total junk and you know it's super problematic because i feel like if we in mississippi have figured out how to survive uh in hotter weather with humidity uh people in philadelphia will be able to figure it out figure it out when there's less humidity i mean that's that's the reality is as the climate has changes as it has for forever um human beings have shown a ingenious ability to adapt in all sorts of ways you mentioned orrin cast a little bit ago he had a really i think it was oren cass he he had a a really good point saying like yeah human beings have been living in um in situations that would be otherwise uninhabitable but we invented things like buildings and jackets so that we we could survive extreme cold or extreme hot and it gets to that point about balance i mean you know we're going we're going to adapt to an extent to climate change that you know we have to be realistic about the cost that it imposes uh i don't think anybody wants it to spin out of control which is fair which again gets to innovative solutions that we can reduce emissions um i've done a ton of podcasts on that already though so i don't want to really go down that track maybe i want to i want to end it with this and just add on a positive note you know what are maybe better solutions to to clean air clean water cleaner oceans um is there anything on the horizon or or is there a better better regulatory philosophy or framework that we can explain to your average person and say like this is what we're for because we do as republicans we do get painted with this notion that we that we truly just don't care about the environment and conservation and that's that's really not true at all no that's not true at all and we we just as much as democrats i think we all agree that we want we want a better planet for the future what we disagree is how do we ultimately get there and even those disagreements setting aside the political rhetoric that rhetoric that has evolved from that discussion we're not that far apart but but the biggest thing for us is it it's what you said it's balance um we believed in balance regulations where you continue to establish um you address tangible environmental issues with practical solutions um and you do it in a manner that balances the natural impact of regulatory actions on the surrounding economy and the surrounding communities so it's um the hard part for us is it's it's a nuanced position but i believe it's the right position and the best news is that we had four years where we proved this out in an unprecedented fashion um air pollution went down seven percent the clean water standards um back in 1970 when epa started measuring clean water clean drinking water standards only about 40 percent of water districts met low health based standards today 90 of water districts meet the highest level of um of drinking water standards and then you also have the matter of greenhouse gases we lead the world in greenhouse gas emissions reductions and we've actually done it by the nature of the litigation what not without a all-encompassing greenhouse gas emission standard on the utility sector um that's pretty complex but we don't have to necessarily get into that but the good news is we in the united states have figured out how to do environmentalism right i think we should continue to embrace that and the core principles are balance and innovation and um we can continue to be leaders in this area and we don't have to as conservatives we don't have to forego anything we would otherwise want to do um as freedom-loving americans if you want to drive your car you can drive your car if you want to go on a plane or you want to eat a hamburger you can do those things and we can do those and continue to improve environmental outcomes we just may have to deal with four years of regulatory uptick but the the the thing about all of us that worked in the trump administration is that when we have the chance to go back now we really know what we're doing we know how to shape the bureaucracy to achieve the outcomes that we ultimately want um and we're going to be primed and ready to go okay is that a future future epa administer administrator right there talking all right andy thanks so much for being on and um and helping us this is a complex subject and uh appreciate the audience for for for sticking with us on on this one because uh it's important it's important and uh un unburying the the layers um behind a lot of these headlines is difficult to do so appreciate the help with that mandy thanks for being on thank you

and president I want to talk a little bit about the border and not the important need to secure the border which for but I want to talk about the humanitarian crisis that we have seen occurring at the border and frankly and president the Senate and the House the Congress have been watching that occur for too long it's been several weeks now since the administration has notified the Congress that the money that was allocated for what would have been a traditional set of challenges at the border is about to be spent that there are no money left on some of these issues that we have to deal with at the border in a particular way we've seen they're really the flood of people approaching the border to be not only incredibly different in numbers but incredibly different in context probably 20 years ago ninety percent of the people that came across the border were coming directly from Mexico and by the way when that happened the law was changed so that if they came across from Mexico you could send them right back to net Mexico and hopefully our neighbors in Mexico are working with us to still have some potential to do that with people who come across the border and come through Mexico not necessarily Mexican in in their nationality but come through Mexico to the border to go back and go and and wait for what needs to happen for their case to be heard in Mexico rather than here most of the people coming today are coming from Central America Guatemala El Salvador Honduras the principal place that has people coming I think right in the last year over 1% of the population of all three of those countries has come from those countries collectively to our southern border and clearly it's a problem but it's especially troubling to look at the numbers of children that are coming into the border unaccompanied just last month about a hundred and thirty thousand people came to the border you can multiply that by twelve pretty quickly and see that you know a million people are more coming to our border to come in without the right kind of documents another million by the way Madam President come in to our country through the normal process we have about a million immigrants a year that legally immigrated to the United States we are not a country that it does not want people from other countries to come here we just want them to come here based on the law and the requirements that everybody else that would like to come the United States is coming with but of that hundred and thirty thousand people that came in May eleven thousand five hundred and seven of them were children without families really important for us to understand as we discuss this we're not talking about children who came with their families and were separated from their families once they got here there are plenty of those children coming right now with families because it's pretty clear that saying you want to siloam and saying you have children with you and your family is one of the things that checks a couple of boxes that more likely we're going to have you in the United States waiting for your case to be heard sooner rather than later but Madam President this is eleven thousand five hundred and seven children that came by themselves about thirty percent of them are under twelve and about seventy percent of them are between 12 and 18 so you've got eleven thousand children coming a month we think in the calendar year that'll be about eighty eight thousand children not in the calendar year but in the in the fiscal year the spending year the year that started October 1 we already believe that that number is going to approach eighty eight thousand usually within 72 hours of those children showing up at the border by themselves the Department of Homeland Security transfers them to the Department of Health and services much better position to take care of them than they otherwise would be the Health Department Health and Human Services enters into agreements with lutheran charities and Catholic Charities and other groups almost always not-for-profit that will provide shelter on a clearly understood basis this is this is something that HHS knows the kind of housing that these children are going in provides shelter provides medical care other services like education provided by these these groups that contract with us and they also make an effort part of their their goal is to find a safe and appropriate place for these kids to be as soon as possible with relatives or already in the country or with an alternative that would be appropriate and so of the 14,000 are so spaces beds is one way to look at this places to sleep to 14,000 spaces that we have people are going into those and out as soon as we can find somewhere safe for them to go so ideally children would stay a very short time in one of these facilities while the Department of Health and Human Services working with that security provider security for the children finds a sponsor and again usually a family member but other people will stay a long time you know the older teenagers tend to be harder to place frankly and and for some of the Central American countries they don't have the family connections that immigrants that the border have had in the past so no family to put them with some of these older teenagers wind up staying longer than they'd want to or than we would we would hope they would have to but it's just the way it is you might be and of those eleven thousand five hundred and seven kids that came to the border what in the month of May a few of them may have been in the facility for less than a day some of them may still be in the facility they went to because there's nowhere safer for them to go right now than that the problem is that Health and Human Services is running out of space and they're also running out of money in April secretary azar the head of Health and Human Services came to the Congress and says I just want to give you a warning we are going to be out of money on this current pace by sometime in June and by the way Madam President we're now in June and the Congress has not stepped up and done what's necessary to take care of these kids now let's think about all the alternatives that could happen here one of the alternatives is that you just provide less assistance may be the education goes first and the recreation time goes second and you wait longer to get in the transitional space that you would we would want you to be in and you're waiting more than 72 hours the other alternative that's totally unacceptable would be what you do with people who are over 18 and you say okay if you're 18 or 28 or 38 we'll hear your case at some future time we're going to release you into the United States and you come back at a future time and we'll hear whether there's merit we'll decide your case at that time Oh Madam President you can't release a 12 or 13 or 14 year old boy or girl into the United States and hope that that's going to be a good thing for them to have happen to them with the inadequate funding they stay in facilities that with the Border Patrol longer than anybody would want them to as I said the administration estimates that by the end of September that would be the end of our spending year the one we've allocated money for there will be about 88,000 kids that have come across the border by themselves and American people would want you to take care of them until you can find a safe place for them to be no thinking American would say well just what let them go back across the border by themselves let them out in the United States and see what happens to them nobody would think that so 88,000 the previous high was 59 thousand in 2016 and it looks like we've already probably just about to get to that number right now with the time between now and September 30th left in the spending year we've already had more kids come than we had in the previous high year and Congress which appropriated money for what we thought would probably be no more than fifty nine thousand kids during the course of the year didn't appropriate enough money so we knew we weren't we might not appropriate enough money so we had a transfer Authority where you could take some money up to a certain amount from other accounts and you could transfer that into the account to take care of more kids and we would have thought that money is gone too the department's being forced to cut back on some of the things that they have tried to provide for children that have come into our care through certainly no fault of ours and maybe not much fault of theirs redirecting money from programs like refugee programs that are designed to help people who come truly as refugees that money is now being used for unaccompanied children remember Health and Human Services legally required to take care of these children but also legally required not to spend money that they don't have if the Congress doesn't act quickly and we intend to act on this bill within a week if the Congress doesn't act quickly HHS the Department of Health and Human Services we'll have to tell the grantees these not normally non-for-profit organizations that well if you just keep paying these kids at some point we will give you the money that we'd agreed to give you to take care of these kids but between now and then you spend the money and hope you'll be reimbursed it's sort of like a government shutdown except just for this one group of people unaccompanied children it's a government shutdown there's gonna be no money available and in these critical services you go to the outside groups that have been willing to step forward and provide shelter and say just keep providing the shelter and we'll pay you if we can now some of these groups may have all kinds of money and be able to afford to do that I guess there's not so much so and not many of them will have and so we need to step up we need to adapt to this change in circumstances that we didn't anticipate we anticipate as many people might come as ever came before we didn't anticipate that maybe thirty percent more people would come in this category than ever came before in the disaster bill that we just passed it took over eight months for the Congress and by the way this is a shameful thing to have to say eight months to cover the disasters that normally the Congress has discussed because as covered right away so Health and Human Services has asked for merging money in an emergency funding situation to take care of this Congress should take this request seriously and pass this funding before there's no money from any source to take care of even the basic needs that unaccompanied kids in our country need to be taken care of the new york times no advocate by the way for the trump administration the new york times over the weekend and two weeks before basically said give the administration the money this is a legitimate crisis and needs to be treated like that in the editorial their last editorial they said quote unequipped to deal with the crush border facilities and migrant shelters are dangerously overcrowded and the staff is overburdened they went on to say dysfunction disease and even death are a future problem New York The Washington Post said the same thing let's deal with this immediate humanitarian crisis let's deal with it like the people we expect that we work for expect us to deal with us and let's get this humanik humanitarian crisis taken care of before we see a human catastrophe occur and I hope we can do it and I hope we can do it quickly

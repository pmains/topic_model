coming from Ohio is recognized for two minutes thank you thank you to the gentleman from Michigan and I want to thank the gentleman from Virginia and mr. Sensenbrenner for all their good work on this this is really one of the great days great weeks I think on this house floor because of what we're doing here to address the heroin and opiate crisis in America and it's it's sad to watch someone from Virginia and someone from Wisconsin and someone from Michigan and someone from Ohio and someone from Texas all get up and really kind of embody and express how deep this problem is in our country today and I know we've all been the calling hours and we've all been to funerals and seeing up close and personal how devastating this epidemic is here in the United States and like many of my colleagues unfortunately Ohio has now seen accidental deaths by overdose surpass even car accidents and so we all need to come together Democrats and Republicans to try to solve this problem and I think this week is a major step in that direction and I'm supporting the comprehensive opioid reduction act and many other bills that are coming to the floor this week in trumbull county alone my biggest County one of my biggest counties a few months back we had 22 overdoses and of that seven deaths in that one County and this is pervasive in Cuyahoga County which is Cleveland we have almost one a day that we're dealing with in Ohio so this comprehensive opioid abuse reduction act program creates at the Department of Justice a real opportunity for us to fix this program focuses on how we can tackle substance abuse through preventive programs expansion of the prescription drug monitoring programs and resources for veteran treatment court programs and that's one of the key elements of this is how we're going to make sure that our veterans can get diverted through veterans courts in Ohio we've seen first responders use naloxone and 2013 can I get in can I get an additional minute I yield the gentleman an additional minute thank goodness recognized for an additional in Ohio alone we've seen first responders use naloxone in 2013 over 12,000 doses were administered this is this is a huge problem we've seen the men and women we've seen the families that have been destroyed because of this and I hope that as we get the Senate bill out of conference we make sure that it is comprehensive that its addiction treatment and recovery and as we move through the budget process through the appropriations make sure that there's the appropriate revenue the appropriate amount of money going to these programs that will ultimately hit the ground and help us get our arms around this program and with that I yield back

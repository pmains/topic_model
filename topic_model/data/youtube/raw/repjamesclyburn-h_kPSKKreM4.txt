I thank my friend for yielding me this time and I thank him and our colleague Eddie Bernice Johnson for joining me at the Center for african-american studies at the University of Texas at Arlington last Thursday evening the wonderful experience for me and president Vil's VISTA kobbari dr. Jason Skelton and my longtime friend dr. Marvin Delaney were perfect hopes mr. speaker earlier this month sazhin la David T Johnson died a hero's death in the distant land on a mission few Americans know about or understand this weekend his grieving family including his pregnant wife took him to his final resting place in Florida sergeant Johnson's tragic death leaves this young family fatherless mr. speaker in his second inaugural address President Abraham Lincoln called on our nation to endeavor to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his often unfortunately rather than confront comfort sergeant Johnson's reven family the current occupant of the White House is chosen to use them as his latest prop in the constant effort to sow discord and division in this country the President and one-ounce chief of staff John Kelly who happens to be a four-star general have insulted and smeared an honorable public servant who happens to be a five-star congresswoman and in effect called her and the grieving widow but her constituent liars congresswoman Frederica s Wilson has been a champion for the people of South Florida for decades it is no mystery mystery and it not political that she was a competent mrs. Johnson and her family to receive her husband's remains she admitted sergeant Johnson throughout his childhood I have participated in several of congresswoman Wilson's five for the role models events and have spoken for one of their graduations are often where this red tie to this floor helping her highlight their efforts and her passionate work on behalf of those kidnapped girls of Boko Haram is unmatched as a husband of a five-star african-american woman for more than 56 years and the father of three African American daughters who are working hard to earn their stars every day I feel compelled to respond to general Micheli and completely disregard his concocted misrepresentations Mr Speaker we can have 4 little differences here in Washington that comes with the territory but people need to have the common decency and basic humanity to refrain from exacerbating the pain of those already suffering so much I was taught from childhood their silence gives consent I want the White House to know this I and the members of the Congressional Black Caucus will be salad and we will not be silenced

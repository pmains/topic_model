i am proud to introduce a friend and the next united states senator from pennsylvania pat toomey i think we're unified by a set of ideas we're unified by the idea that out of control spending whether it's happening in harrisburg or washington it's got to stop and we're going to stop it we're unified by the idea that we can create jobs and we can revive our economy but we're not going to do it by raising taxes and growing government we're going to do it by creating opportunity in the private sector the only source of sustainable jobs that we've ever had and we can do that i believe this race is going to provide probably the clearest contrast the clearest choice of any race in america because it not only does joe sestak take a very liberal position opposite mind on virtually every major policy issue but joe is uh adopts positions that are so extreme so far to the left that they're well beyond the consensus even of the democratic party i mean think about the agenda that they're pursuing in washington now serial bailouts of failing companies nationalizing whole industries spending on a staggering scale unprecedented deficits and debts cap and trade card check and government run health care joe sesdaks for all of that i'm opposed to that joe is a fine and honorable and a decent man but his very very liberal views are way outside of the mainstream of pennsylvania they're even outside the mainstream of the democratic party and so i'm going to offer an alternative an alternative vision for pennsylvania and for america and let me share with you some of the highlights for instance instead of serial bailouts i want to encourage entrepreneurs with lower taxes on capital gains and fewer regulatory burdens now in instead of a multi-trillion dollar government-run health plan i think we should make a different set of reforms i want to make the kind of reforms that'll keep patients in control and make health care more affordable and more accessible i think individuals ought to get the same tax deduction when they buy health insurance that employers get that makes health care more affordable for everyone who has to buy it on their own you know we ought to force insurance companies to compete for our business pennsylvania families and individuals we ought to have hundreds of competing plans to choose from and we could get there if we tear down the barriers that prevents competition across state lines and we ought to do that see joe sestak and i have clearly very different approaches to our view on public policy we just we just view this differently joe has a great faith in the power of a hugely expanded federal government he wants much more government spending much higher taxes he wants the government to have greater control of our economy and greater control of many portions of our lives i have a different view i'm a believer in limited government and personal freedom and individual responsibility and a free enterprise system because our free enterprise system has lifted more people out of poverty and created more opportunity than any other system in the history of the world and we'll do well to remember that i i will go to washington and i'll be working for you the hard-working tax-paying citizens of pennsylvania thank you very much for all your support thank you for being here tonight let's hang in there together and win a big one in november thank you very much

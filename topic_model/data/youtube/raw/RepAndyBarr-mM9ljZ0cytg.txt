let's go straight to congressman andy barr he's the ranking member of the oversight and investigation subcommittee congressman i saw this as a lot of grandstanding and nothing frankly of substance am i right i think you're right david and i think there are three basic takeaways from the hearing yesterday one is that the system generally worked and that the markets functioned fairly well obviously there were losers in the story melvin capital professional wall street hedge fund lost on the short squeeze some of the retail investors who got in late in the rally on gamestop they lost on the on the downside because the stock got away from basic fundamentals and valuation but market discipline is setting in and the the second thing the second takeaway was that the democrats were unable to persuade anyone uh that restrictions or banning uh payment for order flow is a good idea in fact what we learned was that payment for order flow actually results in best execution better pricing and zero or zero commission zero commission trading or or commission free trading and that has increased investor participation in the capital markets that's a good thing the final thing that i think we we learned was that mr tenev was able to debunk this conspiracy theory that somehow robin hood conspired with hedge funds like citadel to halt trading what uh your report just revealed and what his testimony revealed was that in fact it was the clearing house margin requirements that forced uh robin hood to um halt trading well so we want to look at in the future not more regulation and certainly the hearing didn't justify more regulation but how can we continue to innovate in the markets uh to get to uh uh better uh shorter timetables in terms of uh we're not gonna be able to innovate if we have more regulations and more taxes and frankly that was the the undertone of of of the whole discussion from the democrat side was how can we figure out a way to regulate more and frankly there was an ulterior motive i think of how can we find a way of taxing more the markets yeah there was some discussion about a financial tax which is a terrible idea which would also penalize retail investors but yes the democrats failed to justify any additional regulation or overreaction by the securities and exchange commission here in fact if there was any um culprit in the halting of trades it was regulation now i would say that the solution um to the robin hood situation where they had to shut down trading would be you know real-time settlement and moving at least towards a shorter time frame in settlement and there was a very productive uh back and forth between some of them some of the more thoughtful members on the committee and some of the witnesses on a blockchain or distributed ledger technology as a way to shorten the time of of settlements of some of these trades congressman you're getting into the minutia here i i like to look at the bigger picture i mean you look at who the chairman of the committee is and you see this sort of distrust of capitalism i'm wondering how many more of these hearings we're going to have where capitalism itself and the so-called heartlessness of capitalism is going to be on trial quickly i think chair waters will do that more but i think what happened in yesterday's hearing is a vindication of capitalism and i like the fact that we have so many new millennial day traders they say millennials are socialists i think we learned yesterday that many millennials like mr gill are in fact capitalists that's a good thing well i hope you're right on that congressman andy barr great to see you congressman thank you very much appreciate it good to see you david

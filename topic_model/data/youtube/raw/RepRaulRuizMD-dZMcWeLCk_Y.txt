thank you thank you all for being here today i am cautiously optimistic after hearing the progress you all are making in your efforts to develop an effective and safe vaccine and while the numbers of the vaccines that you anticipate having in the next year seem promising i'm very concerned about the lack of a health equity plan in the distribution of those vaccine the number one step is the science of developing an effective and safe vaccine number two step is to produce that vaccine number three is to distribute the vaccine and then four is to administer the vaccine in the front lines and we should be able to foresee what's coming and develop a distribution plan that's based on public health principles with the objectives to slow the trend of transmission and to save as many lives as possible when we ask those questions then we need to ask the questions where is the highest risk and the highest rate of transmission of coronavirus and which communities and demographics are dying at a higher disproportionate rate of coronavirus and it is not too difficult to find the answers to those questions we know that seniors and seniors in nursing homes are are at highest risk of dying those with underlying conditions we know that african americans latinos native americans are at the highest risk of getting infected and also dying from coronavirus we need public health principles based on public health equity not politics not for profit going to those who are the highest bidders or one or a objectives that favor the powerful the prosperous or the healthy or large corporations who can afford and offer the highest bidding amount in order to keep their healthy workers safe to affect their bottom line and their profit we cannot repeat what has happened already in the distribution of testing in the outreach and in the treatments of the coronavirus i was just called by a previous employee yesterday who told me or texted who told me that his sister who works in the front lines as a nurse in covin 19 units who was recently exposed couldn't get testing herself she it wasn't offered it couldn't it wasn't offered in the hospitals she had to go to an urgent care and pay for it for herself it was difficult to get testing yet he has a cousin who's in training for the washington nats the professional baseball team and they get tested every two days so my office is hearing the same thing from nurses across my district this is unconscionable and we cannot repeat this mistake with a distribution of vaccine so having millions of vaccines is a good first step we also need to be planning now how we get the vaccines into the hands of the people that need this most and i don't want to look back and then have health equity be an afterthought it has to be prioritized so i want to ask dr uh gerberting from merck what is your company doing to ensure that the distribution of these vaccines are getting to the populations that need them the most with the highest transmission and the highest death rate from cover 19. i think that the best way to answer your question is to think through what already works and doesn't work in this regard it is the cdc's responsibility the acip that makes decisions about allocation but in this very special case we i have personally and i think many of us have called for the national academy medicine to create a mechanism to look at health equity and make sure that the allocation is fake thank you very much you know i've heard a lot of well that's the government's that's the government but not all of you are going to give a hundred percent of your vaccines to the government there's going to be a percentage that you will hold back for the private market as well and that market should also follow a public health principle so that we can save as many lives and we can stop the surge in order to improve the public's health dr young from pfizer can you answer that question for me please um so a very important question and i want to you know support what my colleague dr gerber ding has just said you know we believe that actually the cdc has laid out very clear uh criteria uh for a pandemic situation as to which patients should actually be prioritized and we look forward to working with the federal government and its agencies in order to ensure the distribution of our vaccine if successful it's the patient i ask every single one of you if you can please mail my office and this committee uh your distribution priorities not only that go towards the government but also that you have within your own private market sales and distribution uh and what your objectives are during this pandemic uh can you can you do that please yes we will yes thank you uh dr pangalos dr hogue and dr gerberty can you do that yes okay i'll take it as a yes from all of you and i'll follow up with you as well and i i believe i heard from johnson johnson dr uh dugoy as well thank you

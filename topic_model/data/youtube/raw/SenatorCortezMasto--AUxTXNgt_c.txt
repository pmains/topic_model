[Applause] first of all let me say thank you to my colleagues Chris Murphy dick Blumenthal dick Durbin Dianne Feinstein so appreciate their advocacy on this issue and then to the families thank you for using your voices being an advocate and to all of the incredible organizations that are here because it's something that we all know it is not time it is past time to reduce gun violence in this country this is common sense it's common sense you know I was the Attorney General like dick I was a federal prosecutor Attorney General in the state of Nevada and I will guarantee you law enforcement and there are so many people that I know that I've worked with that support reducing gun violence that support common-sense measures that protect our loved ones that protect our friends you know I I'm sad to say and that Las Vegas now unfortunately has the moniker of being the deadliest site for a massacre with fifty-eight who lost their lives over five hundred who were injured and twenty-two thousand innocent concert goers who were terrorized by one madman who had access to guns and didn't care how he utilized them and I hear people say all the time even if we had this or even if we passed that that wouldn't have stopped what happened in Las Vegas but I can guarantee you if we have universal background checks we are going to save a life and that's what this is about it is saving the lives in the future and ensuring we are reducing that vampires you know that's why Nevada actually when I was elected there was a ballot initiative question one to pass the universal background checks in the state of Nevada and it passed with the majority of Nevada supporting it and I will tell you it is just common sense I come I come from a Nevada a family of hunters my husband is a retired Secret Service agent we owned guns this isn't about taking away somebody's Second Amendment rights are taking away somebody's guns it is about passing common-sense measures for gun safety to save lives now who could be against saving lives universal background checks to ensure that those individuals that shouldn't have guns do not get them to close the private gun show loopholes to make sure somebody cannot buy a gun on the internet without raising a red flag somewhere somebody ensuring that we are checking to make sure they're safe to have those guns that's what this is about that's what passed in Nevada and that's why this bill is so important because now we need to make it pass across this country across this country it's time to fight and now more than ever I see the the advocacy in the wave of people that understand that this is just common sense this is gun safety this is reducing violence in our communities it is about protecting our family it is about protecting our loved ones is ensuring that no one whether you're seriously mentally ill you're a terrorist that you should not have access to weapons that can harm others and that's why I am proud to stand here with my colleagues and co-sponsor this bill it is time to get something done and let's start with universal background checks in this country thank you all so much [Applause]

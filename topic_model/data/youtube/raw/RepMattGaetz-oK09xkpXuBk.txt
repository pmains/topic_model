good morning and just so everyone knows you know I've already spoken with some of our colleges like University of Florida they got a great football stadium the swamp that's not used on Sunday so the nan FL team needs a place to land we could work that out too what about where I went my freshman and sophomore year Florida State I look I haven't spoken to them yet but it's a great it's an iconic Stadium and and I think we would want to want to be very helpful if we could so I think that things like that getting sports back getting some of the things back that we're used to is really important from a psychological perspective a confidence perspective and so I'm a big proponent of that I think it's great that these leagues want to move forward and I think there's no question we can do this safely so governor you know the stats you haven't had the full credit yet but the Florida strategy like South Carolina and Georgia the numbers are pretty strong especially when it comes to helping seniors stay safe and stay alive give me the five the four principles of successfully opening in this pandemic environment well the first is you still are in the fight against the virus in terms of safety and you're focusing those efforts where the threat really exists which is in our senior population so we did very early with the nursing homes we restricted visitation and we prevented hospitals from discharging kovat positive patients back into nursing homes that's like a tinderbox if you let that happen we've distributed 10 million masks and other types of pee-pee just to long-term care facilities we've got National Guard going in and testing 50 different teams and then I got a mobile lab that goes around to different communities and tests and long-term care facilities and then of course we're continuing the message to our senior citizens who aren't in those facilities you're 65 and over you're at increased risk avoid crowds and make sure you're being careful about your contacts but in Florida and I think throughout the country I mean we're seeing 80 85 percent of the fatalities are ages 65 and over and so as we reopen business as we do things safely you know we need to stay in the fight and protect those who are the most vulnerable to this virus which is advice we've heard from the experts isolate the vulnerable and then social distance and things can happen like down there in Florida I saw an Axios new cases are down 14% from the previous week and governor I don't have to tell you it's already hot in Florida and you know over the last couple of months we've been wondering we wonder if it's seasonal like the warmer it gets the more likely the virus is to get tamp down we know that the sunlight kills it almost immediately have you found or do your experts talk a little bit about how Florida's unique almost subtropical climate has helped you in this well I think we I think what we know is that this is a virus that is highly transmissible and when you're in close repeated contact inside and closed environments now the flipside with Florida is we got a lot of air conditioning so if you're in those types of environments you know that's more risky we've always believed I certainly always believed that the open air is just simply a less transmissible environment I think the studies have borne that out around the country there just aren't massive outbreaks that have been linked to a lot of outdoor activity and so that's why I got a lot of flak from the Acela media because I didn't want to close every beach in Florida well the communities that kept beach is open they did social distancing as they as they were required to do you know they have some of the lowest rates places like Brevard County very low death rate and so I believe outdoor activity is low risk I think people should be doing it we kept golf courses open we had fishing going on the whole time people could vote we really wanted to have people be able to do activities in ways that we're safe and clearly you know for you to be out in an open field or doing things like this that is safe it's less risky for the virus so I think it's less about necessarily the weather per se but just when you're have the opportunity to be in good weather you're going to be less likely to be in those in closed environments which is really I think where we've seen this virus really spread like wildfire governor and concen the governor there decided to do stay-at-home orders and a lot of people were complaining and protesting there the Supreme Court of Wisconsin just struck that down do you think some of these governor's that are just doing a one-size-fits-all for the entire state you think they're being too strict and going too far well I don't think any governor has the authority to restrict anyone unless there's a direct relationship to combating this virus and if you look around the country clearly there have been examples of really draconian arbitrary restrictions that have nothing to do with public health but you can't plant a seed in your front yard and your garden can't walk around the neighborhood with your daughter or something like that so some of this stuff I think is devolved into social control I think absolutely it's not netting and here's the thing it's less effective to do that in Florida we did not do that we were reasonable we trusted the people to act appropriately and and we've had a better results in some of the states you know that you've seen so I think that yes there has absolutely been over steps and and I think Legislature should really look at this as we go forward you need to be able to act there's certain things that need to be done but you're not a dictator you don't have unlimited authority and people do have rights I was shocked at the Cal State System made it announcement in May for September they're not the guns it's gonna be almost no in classroom learning all gonna be remote in may not even trying to open up in the fall governors of Santas have you committed to opening up universities when you can which you in control of and schools in the fall yes so I've I've spoken to some of our universities already why would you give up now why would you do that you of course you've got a plan to come back I think we'll have people on campus I think that's the way it should be and we have an opportunity to because those folks those students are low risk so you're able to do this in ways that can be safe and I trust our our universities will be able to do that but yeah to have more distance learning it's not the same at a university level and we to get the kids back on campus for sure governor Florida is one of America's number-one tourist destinations a lot of people have destination weddings my daughter was going to have one on May 1st it obviously didn't happen now she's thinking about August what do big events in family's lives that might involve fifty a hundred a hundred and fifty people look like in August in the state of Florida well Steve I can't give any guarantees but we obviously want to get there where people are able to live life I mean that's the goal here I think the first mission for the country including in Florida has been accomplished of flattening the curve our hospitals weren't overwhelmed we know we were able to handle this with our medical capacity so now we want to go to the next stage start having more economic activity and so I'd like to get there the president's guidelines I think for Phase three you're able to have some of those group activities again so we absolutely want to get there but we're gonna focus yeah we're doing a very safe smart step-by-step approach based on the data based on what we're seeing and and I think that's what folks want to see but I do want to get there because when you think about what's happened with this mitigation all these little things in life that we don't necessarily talk about in terms of infections or not weddings graduations all these things that are really important moments in people's lives that have had to be put aside and you'll live life to be able to do things like that so we need to get that back that's so true I know a young girl that's out here in my neighborhood and she they announced that no graduation she said her mom said she hasn't come out of her room all day she's so upset and the parents are affected too because we raise our kids we want to experience those those events with our kids as well so it's affecting a big group of people and Steve I do hope she gets to have that wedding in August because we would all love to go to Florida too I know okay governor let me uh play this sound byte for you the president was on with Maria yesterday talking about vaccines listen to this I think we're gonna have a vaccine by the end of the year we're doing very well with a vaccine we're mobilizing our military on the basis that we do have a vaccine you know it's a massive job to give this vaccine our military is now being mobilized so at the end of the year we're going to be able to give it to a lot of people very very rapidly we'll focus on elderly we're gonna focus on nursing home and then you know senior citizen centers because that's really if you look at it that is so that is a very vulnerable group it's a terrible thing but so we're going to be focused on that she recorded it yesterday governor and the full thing will run today this morning what's your reaction to that well look I think they're putting all all hands on deck for it I applaud the president I think that's the right approach obviously hope we get a vaccine soon I don't know that that's a hundred percent but but let's hope we do it but they're putting the plate pieces in place so that they do have an effective one it can be distributed so they're putting their money where their mouth is and I think that's really good and potentially could benefit a lot of Americans and keep your eye on Shanghai Disney because if they were able to pull it off in China maybe you guys can pull it off in a Lando and that would really bring and Universal and that would really bring a lot of people back it's an affordable vacation for so many Americans governor just said this congratulations you took a risk you're out of the limb and it's paying off and the people afford I'm sure grateful for it

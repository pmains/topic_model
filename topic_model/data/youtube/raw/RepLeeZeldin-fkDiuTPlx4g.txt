and it's been said during this debate the recreational fishermen aren't being disadvantaged under the current system our fishermen both commercial and recreation are absolutely being disadvantaged and that's exactly why we must pass this bill I'll give you one example if you're a commercial fisherman in New York you could catch 50 pounds of fluke once per day for seven days you have to go out you could catch 50 pounds that's 350 pounds for the week now make more sense if we were able to have a system in place where they were catching 350 pounds maybe in one day like maybe New Jersey where you can do 500 pounds for three days or if we want to talk about the science where you have black sea bass 240 percent over the target biomass yet we're seeing a quota reduction compared to other states in New York our fishermen are getting disadvantaged under the current system or under the no observer program where you have a fisherman who is taking someone out to go to an area where they know there's not gonna be any fish and they kind of collecting flawed data that's they're gonna send a shelf and not even end up getting used the reality right now is that we have fishermen in my district who are desperate to survive 365 days of the year from early in the morning to late at night barely making ends meet on a boat that barely works with overhead where they're having trouble being able to pay their own bills to get by and they're looking for people to fight for them in this chamber to fight for that business owner to fight for them so that they can make ends meet it's about protecting the fishery as those very fishermen care so much about but they know the system could get better and that's why we're here fighting for them and that's why I thank Don Young for his leadership because they're those they're watching right now on c-span in my district those fishermen are watching on an Internet they're watching on TV and they're looking for people to fight for them because they've been struggling for years and decades and they're desperate to get this passed so they could afford to pay their bills so that when they're going out at 3 a.m. tomorrow in order to come back late at night that they know that things are going in the right direction that their government's going to start working for them at the federal level the state level to reach a level we're doing our environment I encourage my colleagues to vote for this bill you

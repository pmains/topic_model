PRESIDENT. MR. PRESIDENT, TODAY I'M PROUD TO CELEBRATE TWO DISTRICT JUDGES JOINING THE FEDERAL BENCH FOR THE STATES OF CALIFORNIA. WE'RE SCHEDULED TO VOTE SHORTLY ON THE CONFIRMATION OF JUDGE ANA DE ALBA WHO IS NOMINATED TO BECOME A JUDGE FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA. JUDGE ALBA BRINGS A LIFELONG COMMITMENT TO ADVANCING JUSTICE IN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRAL VALLEY. THE DAUGHTER OF IMMIGRANTS FROM MEXICO, SHE WAS BORN IN MERCED, CALIFORNIA AND GREW UP IN A FAMILY OF FARM WORKERS. JUDGE ALBA WATCHED HER MOTHER AND HER GRANDMOTHER STRUGGLE WITH UNFAIR TREATMENT AS THEY WORKED TOGETHER IN SOME OF THE HARDEST JOBS IN THE WORLD. SHE DECIDED AT A YOUNG AGE THAT ONE DAY, ONE DAY SHE WOULD BECOME A LAWYER TO HELP FAMILIES LIKE HER OWN. JUDGE ALBA IS A FIRST GENERATION HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATE. SHE WENT ON TO EARN HER BACHELOR'S DEGREE AND HER J.D. FROM U.C. BERKLEY. AND AFTER GRADUATING, SHE BUILT A SUCCESSFUL CAREER IN PRIVATE PRACTICE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AND SHE REALIZED HER CHILDHOOD DREAM OF SERVICE BY ESTABLISHING A WORKERS RIGHTS CLINIC FOR LOW-WAGE WORKERS TO LEARN THEIR RIGHTS AND TO SEEK LEGAL ADVICE. IN 2018 BASED ON HER EXTENSIVE LEGAL EXPERIENCE AND PROVEN COMMITMENT TO THE PUBLIC GOOD, JUDGE DE ALBA WAS APPOINTED BY THEN-GOVERNOR BROWN TO SERVE AT THE -- AS THE SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE FOR FRESNO COUNTY. JUDGE DE ALBA IS A DEDICATED, FAIR, AND UNIVERSALLY RESPECTED PUBLIC SERVANT, RESPECTED BY HER COLLEAGUES. I ALSO WANT TO NOTE THAT IF CONFIRMED, JUDGE DE ALBA WILL BE THE FIRST LATINA TO SIT ON THE EASTERN DISTRICT BENCH. SHE WILL BRING A DEEP KNOWLEDGE OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND A PASSION FOR EQUAL JUSTICE, INFORMED AND INSPIRED BY HER OWN FAMILY'S STORY. SO I URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO JOIN ME IN SUPPORTING JUDGE DE ALBA'S CONFIRMATION TODAY. I ALSO LIKE TO TAKE THIS MOMENT TO CELEBRATE THE CONFIRMATION LAST MONTH OF JUDGE ROBERT HUIE NOW SERVING ON THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA. JUDGE HUIE IS A RESIDENT OF SAN DIEGO WHERE HE WAS LIVED AND WORKED FOR NEARLY 20 YEARS. BUT HIS ROOTS IN CALIFORNIA IN FACT BEGAN GENERATIONS AGO. HIS GRANDFATHER IMMIGRATED TO SAN FRANCISCO FROM CHINA IN THE 1930'S MAKING HIS HOME THERE UNTIL JOINING THE U.S. ARMY. JUDGE HUIE IS A TALENTED LAWYER WHO HAS CONTINUALLY -- OPPORTUNITIES TO PROMOTE JUSTICE. HE EARNED HIS UNDER GRADUATE DEGREE FROM CALVIN COLLEGE AND HIS J.D. FROM YALE LAW SCHOOL. HIS CAREER INCLUDES 12 YEARS OF SERVICE AS AN ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA. DURING THAT TIME HE INVESTIGATED AND PROSECUTED MORE THAN 600 DISTRICT COURT CASES AND TWO DOZEN APPEALS ON MATTERS RAPING FROM PUBLIC CORRUPTION TO SECURITIES FRAUD TO BANK ROBBERIES. AND AT THE OUTSET OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, JUDGE HUIE TOOK THE INITIATIVE TO GREAT A DISTRICT WIDE WORKING GROUP THAT COMBATED PANDEMIC-RELATED FRAUD. HIS COMMITMENT TO SERVICE, HIS STRONG WORK ETHIC, AND HIS INSIGHTFUL LEGAL THINKING WILL BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY OF THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT. MR. PRESIDENT, AS A MEMBER OF THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, I'M PROUD OF THE WORK THAT WE CONTINUE TO DO TO CONFIRM OUTSTANDING, EFFECTIVE, AND DIVERSE JUDGES ACROSS THE FEDERAL COURT SYSTEM. THAT'S ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT IN PLACES LIKE THE SOVEREIGN DISTRICT AND EASTERN -- SOUTHERN DISTRICT AND EASTERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA, TWO OF THE BUSSEST FEDERAL JUDICIAL DISTRICTS IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY K AS WE CONFIRM MORE NOMINEES LIKE JUDGE DE ALBA AND JUDGE HUIE, WE ARE BUILDING A FEDERAL COURT SYSTEM THAT CAN BETTER DELIVER ON THE PROMISE OF EQUAL JUSTICE FOR ALL. THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDE

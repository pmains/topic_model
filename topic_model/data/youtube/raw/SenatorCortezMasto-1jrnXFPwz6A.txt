thank you welcome great to see you here look forward to working with you let me start with an issue that is of concern to many of us in Nevada and this is opening of oil and gas drilling in our Ruby mountains and I know you're relatively new but I've a few questions and if you can not answer them would love some follow-up on it I am concerned about the prospect of opening 54,000 acres of you of u.s. forest land in Nevada's Ruby Mountains for oil and gasoline leasing the Ruby mountains are located in Elko County within the Humboldt IOB National Forest and are known for the rugged terrain and mule deer bighorn sheep and Greater sage-grouse habitat likewise I'm also concerned that expansive oil and gas drilling will threaten this pristine and sensitive area which welcomes thousands of annual visitors to utilize its public spaces for hunting fishing and outdoor recreation the comment period closed yesterday and I know that you've already heard from hundreds of local constituents if not more so the first question I have is does does the Forest Service believe the Ruby mountains are suitable for oil and gas leasing Thank You senator Cortes Masto we certainly take our responsibilities of multiple use management very seriously and for public engagement and really hearing from the public about the process I'm aware of this issue I know that we we will be working with the BLM they will make the final decision but we have more will be doing an environmental review and I can assure you through that environmental review process we will be including the public and so a couple of things how long is the environmental review process how long will that take senator I don't have that specific timeline I'd be glad to get back to you and so can you ensure that numerous individual stakeholders and businesses will have their voices counted during this review process absolutely thank you I appreciate that the Forest Service's budget eliminates the legacy roads and rales line-item and counties in Nevada would not have the funds to make these repairs if this is zeroed out why has the program been zeroed out and how can you address the needs of local communities from this funding senator this this budget request as I I said in my opening statement really does have some tough choices and trade-offs we do understand the importance of these roads and trails to local communities and we'd be glad to work with you through the the process of of Congress on this budget so can I ask you have enough resources and staff to manage the upkeep of these trails or are you gonna be relying more on local resources which quite frankly are not enough no we will we will have to prioritize and we will not have enough resources for all a hundred and seventy eight million miles of trails that we have on the national forces and I think that's all of our concerns so I would like to work with you certain well and then let me jump back to Senator Wyden's comments and what I've heard as you well know Nevada's just as concerned about the fire services fire suppression and management we've had wildfires and Nevada can continue that's unfortunately the norm now and as you well know one of the math systems is in Reno with our National Guard the 5150 second Wing you stated in your comments that 3.4 million acres Forest Service land is subject to the removal of hazardous fuels and Stan treatments is that correct what I stated is that is our goal for accomplishment we will affect three point four we will treat three point four million acres in all of our activities in this 2019 fiscal year and have you identified those 3.4 million acres where they're located geographically we certainly have hazard maps and where we need to keep the supply for local infrastructure and mills and our our units do work planning two and three years out so we certainly have our prioritized list yes and geographically are they Moloch ated in the western states that 3.4 million acres I guess my concern is I would like to see like the senator and everyone else specifics if you're talking about 3.4 million acres you've obviously identified where those acres are going to be located across the country of 80% of the land that you manage is in the western states that's where the fire services I'm assuming that's where that 3.4 million is going to be located in western states where the fires are occurring yes senator is it is it is spread out through all of our units and we'd be glad to get get back to you of course the majority of the lands are in the West so that would be the majority of the activity but we can get back to you with more specifics thank you and I know my time is running out thank you very much the board to working with you

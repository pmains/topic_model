and joining me now congresswoman karen bass of california and congresswoman madeline dean of pennsylvania both serve on the house judiciary committee and took part in today's hearing and thank you both for being here and congresswoman bass i want to start with you i want to play a moment that i thought was one of the most searing moments it was early in the in the hearing this was congressman your colleague cedric richmond invoking the name of john lewis and uh invading against uh william barr having done the same thing the one thing that you have in common with your two predecessors both attorney general sessions and attorney general whitaker is that when you all came here and brought your top staff you brought no black people that sir is systematic racism that is exactly what john lewis spent his life uh fighting and so i would just suggest uh that actions speak louder than words and you should really should keep the name of the honorable john lewis out of the department of justice's uh mouth ouch um congresswoman bass you know it says the honorable it's an honorific that uh each of these people testifying receives when they come and testify did you find uh william barr's testimony to be honorable today no i didn't and especially his opening testimony and i know that that fun of these fights because i think we're having a little bit of trouble a congresswoman hold on one second i think we're having a little problem with your audio so we're going to try to fix that audio problem because i definitely want to hear what you uh we're going to say i'm going to let we're going to try to fix that audio and i'm going to throw it over to congresswoman dean for the same answer did you did you find what you heard today to be honorable testimony from the attorney general of the united states no i did not but joy let me start by saying congratulations to you and i'm going to wish you what my my uncle my dear friend wished me every morning when i went out to work he was a priest i said walter give me a blessing today he said may god grant success to the work of your hands i wish that for you in your work in this new important assignment the attorney general was not honorable today uh what he did was dissemble distort deflect and work on behalf of a president and a political campaign i was super mindful that we sat there today with john lewis lying in state not more than a thousand feet or so away from us and what do we honor john lewis for his embodiment of peaceful protest his embodiment of stand up when you see something wrong when you see injustice when you see inequity you must say something keep your eye on the prize and get into good trouble imagine that he was bloodied on the bridge and i had the privilege with my brother and my husband to travel with him to the edmund pettus bridge two years ago and again last this year he was bloodied and beaten and knocked out and didn't know if he would make it he was also beaten in the bus station by government forces does the attorney general not see the grotesque parallels 55 years later here we are with these same problems history will record the attorney's role her attorney general's role and the grotesqueness of his action you know and to that very point and you talk about your uncle uh being a priest and i think it's it's fitting then to talk about or to show your questioning uh of the attorney general about the clearing of lafayette park which i think is one of the darkest moments i think for a lot of people um so that donald trump could walk and do a photo op in front of st john's church here you are questioning william barr let's play that back is it your opinion mr barr that clearing protesters from lafayette square which local officials were told to hurry up moments before the president's photo op with a borrowed bible in front of a church was coincidence is this timing coincidence i believe it is yes as i said i use the analogy of macarthur at leyte gulf we heard okay okay so mr mr attorney general we'll assume that that was all coincidence in relation i've already explained that it had been planned all day attorney general the time is mine we've waited a long time for you to come here the time is mine you waited to talk to me like this you didn't need to wait when asked you know you had a member of the national guard who testified that incendiary incident chemicals were used on including an episcopal priest who was part of those who were gassed and pepper sprayed there do you believe that william barr lied to you under oath about what happened in lafayette park he not only lied he doubled back he he did a back flip uh i quoted him where he said it was not chemical that the pepper bowls used against peaceful protesters and we've spoken to many of them this was a peaceful protest if there was any kind of rioting of course this is not the way you would deal with rioting this was peaceful protest that's what everybody has said what the attorney general did was he said yes it was not chemical no it was chemical i didn't mean that he did a double backflip uh he used pepper ball agents against peaceful protesters and what i showed him was that the beauty of pepper balls is not only the chemical irritant but the blunt force trauma that's what he directed when he stood in that square at 6 10 and said get it done and there's no coincidence between the president finishing a law and order statement in the rose garden and walking across what i compare him to the the attorney general worked as an advanced man on the campaign can you imagine the secret service would have thought there's some disturbance in lafayette square the last thing we want is for the president to walk out the front door of the white house and across the square this was an advanced man for a political campaign for a photo op with as i said a borrowed bible which the episcopal bishop uh condemned uh the catholic bishop condemned and apparently he didn't have permission to borrow the bible it just goes on and on i think we do have congresswoman karen bass uh so i believe we have you again uh and i want to play for you congresswoman this was your questioning of william barr on one of the more extraordinary things that he did he tried to refute the core thing that these protests around the country are about and that's the idea of police abuse and deaths in police custody of black people here he is and here's your questioning of him the number of unarmed black men killed by police so far this year is eight the number of unarmed white men killed by police over the same period of time as 11. the fact of the matter is 2.3 million people in the united states are incarcerated we incarcerate 24 percent of the world's prisoners 34 are black while african-americans are just 13 of the of the u.s population so justice is still not equal nor are our laws and i think when we look at how many people are incarcerated or how many people are killed it is not the numbers it is the percentage you know congresswoman i i guess i'll ask you the same question i mean one presumes that the attorney general of the united states has access to the stats and the data and that the stats and data he attempted to present to the this afternoon don't reflect what most people could find looking up on google do you believe that when he came before the judiciary committee william barr lied to the democrats who questioned him oh i think he absolutely lied and i think he is just trying to push a racial narrative in saying you know it follows what the president said remember a week ago he was saying that well more white people are killed than black people to minimize the fact that there is police abuse the other thing that i was asking him about is the death of elijah mcclain who was injected with ketamine and i asked him did he know anything about that and i asked him if he would make a commitment to investigate it but back to his insulting african americans in his opening presentation and he focused on us for some reason and he basically was saying that the period of enslavement was bad jim crow was bad but ever since then everything is fine and the laws are equal and we really don't have a problem here and there is no systemic racism because you know that the trump administration is countering that to say that things are not that bad he also did the the typical thing of saying that african americans essentially have been killed more by each other than police abuse and you know that that is a standard old tired line that says black people only care about each other when we're killed by police and not not what is going on in the community which is a complete denial of the fact that people in the community where you do have high homicide rates work day in and day out one to stop the gun guns and also to address the underlying community issues which is what leads to the violence in the first place this is just a replay of george wallace's presidential campaign from the 1960s and that's what uh trump has adopted and his wingman or as madeleine said his advanced man that's what he was pushing today they're using the protest in portland essentially as a prop for their commercials but one thing i do want to point out because this concerns me i love seeing allies i love seeing white allies talking about black lives matter i think that's wonderful but when you see the violence that does happen my concern is is that it distracts from an agenda of racial equity and i am worried that the black people in portland will be the ones that take the brunt of the police repression because of the protests and the violence that it is not the black residents doing yeah indeed um congresswoman karen bass if do you have any news that you want to share with us i know that there's going to be an announcement from the biden campaign next week feel free it's just you and me here if you want to and uh congresswoman dean any news to share i have three news but i know in a minute you're gonna have the brilliant attorney general from the state of california on kamala harris yeah and can i can i just uh take a moment of personal privilege and say to you congresswoman bass uh your response to people trying to pit you and kamala harris against each other uh the sisterhood that you showed to her was uh it was a stand-up moment and i i was very proud of both of you the two of you i think have have dealt with this in a very very big way we appreciate it congressman karen karen bass congressman madeline dean you guys are great thank you very much

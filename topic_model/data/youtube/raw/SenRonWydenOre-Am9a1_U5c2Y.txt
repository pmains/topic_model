I'm mighty side sleeper 10 on the Umatilla School District I've been a part of the Emoto school district since 2000 and superintendent since 2007 we've been very fortunate senator Wyden has been especially supportive of Umatilla schools he has helped us when we needed additional funding or the fight for funding with the 21st century Community Learning Center program which is part of title 4b and also when he visits he takes the time to really listen to the kids as was evident in the Town Hall today and is very engaging with educators when they have questions as well so a couple of years ago the senator sent an email out to high school students asking them about their ideas for high school graduation and so our High School Robotics team took that challenge very seriously and decided to see what they could do to impact graduation in their local school and one of the things that they decided to do was to really just hold one another accountable and to not accept excuses for failure and to really try to build a culture of success within themselves than within their team and then their hope was that that would spread to the entire school graduation and we actually got some legislation passed to help your school out for the state average on every measure with respect to this folks this is goal when it comes to education quality you are the real deal there was a lot of other district and school initiatives underway as well but the combination of all of those efforts is that this year until high school exceeded the state graduation rate and every single student group and so our students are very proud of feeling like they did something to positively impact graduation and that came directly from senator wyden reaching out to students directly I think he understands the importance of student voice and helping students feel engaged and that that feeling of engagement young can hopefully lead to engagement in adulthood and like mr. Swindell said seniors more on track to have the highest graduation rate our schools ever seen and that's something we should each be proud of because it's something that we work for every day of our high school careers

when you're talking about nikki Haley California congressman brad sherman it's great to see you a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee ranking Democrat on the Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific and I would say probably a friend on the former congressman Yoho who we just saw moments ago you guys sit on that same subcommittee together nikki Haley her departure today your reaction well she was an effective diplomat she'll be missed I don't think the president will find anybody better to fill the spot it seems very peculiar that the announcement was made before the midterm elections and they'll certainly talk that she might be appointed to become senator from South Carolina if for Lindsey Graham ends up in the administration so time will tell wow that's a lot of tea leaf reading I usually drink my tea but let me ask you this you talk about her being an effective diplomat what credit do you give nikki Haley from across the political aisle for so many of the things that we're seeing unfold on a global stage now well I certainly disagree with most of the commentary that this has been an effective foreign policy it hasn't been but nikki has put a good face on it she's had to defend some outrageous positions and keep in mind we have far more nuclear weapons in North Korea now than we had at the beginning of the Trump administration we have less support in Europe than we had at the beginning of the Trump administration I don't blame nikki Haley for that she's been an effective spokesperson what has been a very flawed foreign policy congressman Sherman would you say that the summit with Kim jong-un would you say that the reports yesterday of access to the missile sites and even some nuclear sites moving forward in North Korea you would not say that those things are progress in terms of open communication that did not exist prior we've had communication with the North Koreans they have taken a few steps we'll see what happens but they've also created enough fissile material during the Trump administration and as we speak to create 10 more nuclear weapons they have stopped testing those weapons because they already know what they're doing and our sanctions have been fairly ineffective their economies is strong now as it was two years ago and Ted Yoho and I pushed the administration to sanction major Chinese banks we signed a letter demanding action and it was ignored and for that reason the North Korean economy is not in shambles they are not dealing from a position of weakness they are getting closer to the Chinese and we can talk about neat denuclearization but I don't think we're going to see how you see it so differently on that subcommittee it is amazing that you can get together and move forward I mean that that must be is right now they're about to I mean they're hurting we've seen the sanctions you've seen the tariffs I mean it's interesting because that relationship with North Korea you're correct on and so if China's hurting it's going to affect North Korea is there anything positive you you you called nikki Haley and effective diplomat I want to make this about her departure anything positive you'll bring to the table as we move forward the nation awaits to see whom the president will choose next in that position well given an erratic foreign policy that has been a louder but not necessarily effective I think she put the best possible face on it I don't think she can be replaced by someone near as good we'll have to see how things develop even somebody that you would choose oh well I the president has not asked me for advice on who to select Wow and if I wanted to prevent somebody from being selected I would endorse them right now okay congressman Sherman thank you very much thank you new Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh took the bench for the first time today president Trump Apollo

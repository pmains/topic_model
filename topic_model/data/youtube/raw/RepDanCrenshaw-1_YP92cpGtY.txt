so the big news last week was this facebook whistleblower i have some thoughts first things first i think it's important to point out i'm not exactly sure what whistle was being blown in this case um the teenage body image problem the teenage depression problem the teenage problem of comparing yourself to others and feeling bad that has been with humanity for as long as humanity has ever existed it is indeed part of the human condition and before facebook it was teen vogue it was glossy magazines it was tv um it was everything it is a problem it's not a problem that should be ignored parents should have the tools they need and the transparency they need to be able to prevent it and deal with their kids but i kept seeing headlines over and over again from the media that said something along the lines of you can't even tell the difference between democrats and republicans on this issue it's like everybody's mad at big tech and they're all on the same page no we're not we're not on the same page it's important to distinguish how republicans think about this and how democrats think about this and to the extent that republicans have been messaging this the same way democrats have they should stop because you're giving democrats the opening they need to open pandora's box to censorship and stop social media as we know it which by the way is what gives conservatives such a big advantage against the mainstream media so here's how we think about it differently the left thinks facebook is a threat ever since 2016 ever since trump won in 2016 facebook is a threat to the left why because it allows us to talk to each other allows us to make our points heard um they want more control and they're using this whistleblower as a way to justify that control to justify that censorship because they're like what do conservatives care about conservatives care about kids being bullied so let's try and make them agree with us on this but here's the thing it's a pretty short step from saying look we need to protect your kids from bullying we need to protect your kids from seeing things that they shouldn't see it's a pretty short step from that too we need to protect you the citizens rece the citizenry from misinformation we need to protect you from things that are untrue for misinformation we need to help you get fact checked uh we need to help you know what is correct see it's a pretty short step here's how else you know that this facebook whistleblower is disingenuous first of all big democrat donor okay first of all associated with a lot of the democrat operatives the mainstream ones that you would know including um jen sackey's previous firm um the other thing about it was which was interesting was when asked what we should do about this she never offered up some kind of change to regulation regulation that would be applied neutrally not dependent on what kind of uh politics you're from she basically said that she should be in charge i mean her words exactly what you you need a a department in the executive branch a regulation oversight body that looks directly over these social media companies and so and then she said so someone like me could be in charge of it and basically tell them what to do that's not neutrally applied law okay that's just giving the democrats what they want to be able to make social media companies do what they want and we cannot fall for it this was a big trick played on everybody and i think we need to recognize and recognize it as such see when conservatives complain about social media yeah there's bipartisan outrage but for totally different reasons conservatives want less censorship and even the conservatives that have i i think been messaging this wrong we still fall on the same place when it comes to policy and that policy is taking a scalpel to section 230 and making sure that liability protections are removed when social media companies are deliberately biased against someone for say their political beliefs or other things that's the kind of reforms we need it's less censorship not more

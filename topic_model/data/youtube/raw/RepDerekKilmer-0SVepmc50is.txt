consume the gentleman from Washington is recognized Thank You mr. chair before I speak to this amendment I actually want to start by expressing my appreciation to the chairman for his work on this important legislation I grew up in Port Angeles Washington I saw firsthand how downturn in the timber industry impacted our region's economy and the livelihoods of families who live there and those experiences were major influence in my decision to pursue a career in economic development and and now in public service it's a big reason I've been working on harvest issues that impact the region that I represent on the olympic national forest I've been proud to help stand up a collaborative bringing together a group of stakeholders from all across the spectrum to figure out how we can make real progress to rebuild the trust that we need to restore our forests and to promote harvest levels and to support our local communities and we begun to see some successes come out of that and I'm sure committed to working to help take actions that lead to better outcomes for our force and for the local economies that rely on them as an important asset I think the build is before us today is an honest effort to address the real challenges that are facing our federal forests and importantly the underlying bill includes language that would make real progress toward ending the harmful practice of four of fire borrowing now I've got some concerns about this bill that are going to keep me from supporting it today but I am very hopeful that this is just a first step in a process that leads to compromise legislation that we can send on to the present and get signed into law and help our forests and to help our communities I would welcome the opportunity to be a part of that process now mr. chairman the amendment that I've offered today is focused on initiative that would support innovative wood products including cross laminated timber now CLT products offer increased use of responsibly harvested wood that could be more jobs in rural areas of Washington State and all and all other states these are renewable resources rather than steel or concrete that would make our buildings greener these new wood products are strong and fire resistant and may actually be safer in an earthquake than non-wood alternatives so we can change the way our nation constructs buildings by utilizing these new sturdy wood products more importantly we can lead the way on a global timber revolution that can bring lower-cost environmentally friendly building materials to market providing more job job opportunities in rural America so my amendment is pretty simple it would direct the Secretary of Agriculture to develop a significant forest restoration project with the goal of generating the kind of material we can use for these advanced wood products and I would urge my colleagues to support this amendment and I reserve the balance of my time

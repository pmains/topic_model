big oils profiteering has hit a new high as they exploit the tragic situation in ukraine to reel in profits as americans pay for that at the pumps a recent analysis by accountable us found that oil and gas company giants shell chevron bp and exxon posted record profits last year of 75 billion dollars while american consumers struggled to pay their heating bills and to fill up their gas tanks to put money back in the hands of americans who are struggling to make ends meet in the face of high gas prices i'm proposing a two-step solution first a direct cash rebate to consumers to lessen the pain that american families feel at the pump without raising taxes because second we're going to repeal at least some of the 650 billion dollars in direct and indirect subsidies to oil and gas companies as a pay for for that rebate to raise approximately 60 billion dollars of revenue without raising your taxes now you heard that right the united states government today uses your tax dollars to subsidize the fossil fuel industry to the tune of 650 billion dollars every year now you might assume that that's to prevent the industry from imploding but data from the last 15 years actually shows that 2021 was the highest year on record for dividend payouts for those integrated oil companies that are based here in the united states companies like exxon and chevron averaged payouts of around 12 and a half billion dollars now the ability of those companies to pay out those dividends last year is evidence of how well they're doing with the help of those subsidies so fly little bird be free let's go out and compete in the market combined those four companies i mentioned they raked in 24.4 billion dollars in the fourth quarter of 2021 bringing their total profits last year at over 75 and a half billion dollars chevron shell bp and exxon use those profits to shower billions of dollars on their shareholders including their wealthy executives whose salaries are heavily paid with those stocks now the record profits that are enjoyed by those oil companies are proof that the oil and gas producers can in fact effectively operate in a free market without government assistance if we only let them the money that we spend on those unnecessary subsidies could be far better spent on efforts to shield the american people from the economic consequences of putin's war against the ukrainian people that's why earlier this year i introduced the end oil and gas tax subsidies act to eliminate nearly a dozen of the most egregious tax breaks that are lining the pocketbooks of fossil fuel executives causing the climate catastrophe and coming out of your pocketbook fossil fuel companies may complain that those subsidies are needed to keep their prices down but oil and gas markets are global and a direct rebate to you would provide a far more significant relief to you and to all of our struggling american citizens

Thank You mr. Speaker I rise today to pay tribute to the memory of Nicholas Lafon a young man from Miller Place in New York's 1st congressional district who just a couple weeks back was taken from us far too soon due to the disease of addiction a bright intelligent and talented young man Nick was loved by all who knew him he was an honor student who was accepted to Stony Brook University with the intention of pursuing a career in education however from a young age Nick struggled with anxiety which sadly led him down the path of heroin addiction as a teenager he fought this addiction tirelessly with the love and support of his family and friends and sought several forms of treatment tragically just last month Nick lost his battle with addiction at the age of 25 on August 31st I attended a press conference and recognition of international overdose Awareness Day where I met Nick's parents francine and leonard and discussed their son who had been laid to rest only two days prior the courage of these heartbroken parents to come to this event and talk about nick so soon after his passing is absolutely incredible as a father the thought of losing a child is unbearable through my discussion with mr. and mrs. Lafontant feel their commitment to fighting this terrible epidemic so that no other parent would have to go through their experience shortly after our discussion I received a letter from the levonne's detailing next story now lining so many of the steps we can take as a community to make drug addiction a thing of the past from their words you can feel their passion for this cause though it is too late to save their son Francine and Leonard have dedicated themselves easing the grip of addiction upon our society their selflessness and bravery and face of unthinkable tragedy is truly beyond compare mr. speaker I'm honored to stand here and share Nick's story with you and the American people and to discuss this critical priority every single day Americans like this young man faul to Joy addiction is one of the absolute greatest threats we face as a nation and it will not subside unless we continue to act here in my home county of Suffolk heroin and opioid abuse is an especially deadly and destructive scourge there's no one solution to ending the drug epidemic this is a complex issue involving all levels of government and our community leaders law enforcement schools churches and everyday Americans we must form a collaborative effort to discuss and develop localized community-based solutions to tackle this crisis by increasing treatment recovery services and education simple incarceration is not and will never be the lone answer to this crisis in the last Congress I was proud to have co-sponsored to help pass into law the comprehensive addiction and Recovery Act or Cara which provides a total of eight point three billion in funding over five years to help combat the heroin opioid abuse epidemic and funds many initiatives on a local level well this is a step in the right direction it is not enough to truly end this plague upon our nation this Francine wrote to me in her letter quote to make headway against this awful epidemic the approach must be multifocal Swift and forceful we not only need dollars to be put toward law enforcement and treatment both of which we know have limited effect we also need to concentrate on addressing the underlining psychological issues that lead to opioid abuse these are not drugs one uses to party they are extremely strong and effective painkillers one uses to escape life the world is a harsh place for kids today so much different than when I or even you were young end quote the complexity of this issue is unrivaled and we cannot turn a blind eye to any potential effort this needs to be a highest priority to resolve we cannot rest until tragic incidents like what happened to Nick lafon become a thing of the past I like to read a poll on Nick wrote while in rehab only weeks before his passing which describes his tried struggle anxiety is life to me mixed with some sobriety throwing notoriety this is my anxiety always looking over my shoulder will this get better as I get older carrying it around like a boulder this is my anxiety dark holes and deep depression popping pill after pill and rapid succession how did I not see the progression this is my anxiety days to weeks weeks to months and months to years why is my head constantly filled with tears keep a straight face don't shed any tears this is my anxiety waking up to go to sleep climbing this mountain seems so steep close to the edge I'll surely leap this is my anxiety Thank You mr. Speaker I yield back

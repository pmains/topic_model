the southwestern Montana vets home has been a huge issue and an important one for veterans in Southwest Montana we've been fighting hard both the community of beaut silver bow and back here in Washington DC to find funding for that facility your legislators and beaut silver bowl have also been fighting in the state legislature to find funding for that facility finally after years of hard work and after persistence from the Butte community we've been able to get the Southwest Montana veterans home funded this is a big deal for veterans across the country but mostly for those folks that live in southwestern Montana it would not have happened without the work that the community of beaut silver ball put in would not have happen without the state legislative worked at the state level and we certainly did our part trying to get the VA to understand how important this vets home was for the veterans in Montana it's a great day in Montana as it always is but especially great in Butte

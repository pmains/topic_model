one of the big points of the State of the Union address last night from that emotional plea to act on gun control to raising the minimum wage President Obama urged Congress to act on several major issues facing the nation in the state of the union address so what did Democrats and Republican leaders think about his speech this morning we are joined by Democrat congressman jim moran from virginia Andrew congressman bill Huizenga from Michigan gentlemen thank you both for joining us this morning let me begin with congressman hi ginza and specifically that plea about gun control that we saw there what did you think of that and is there any common ground can there be some movement on that issue well I think there's always coming around that we need to search out and my question is a vote on what specifically and obviously you're seeing the Senate starting to take some leads and things they've got some real issues over there whether they're going to be able to pass a bill at all much less what all is going to be in it and I want to make sure it's not just window dressing and it's not just about the mechanics and that we need to get at some of those deeper rooted issues in society that caused these things even last night the president admitted you know we can't stop these things from happening the question is is what are we doing on the front end in my in my mind what are we doing on the front end with mental health and with this culture really it doesn't honor or value life and that that is a main component of what I think we need to be looking at as well congressman Moran let's turn to some of the economic issues the president unveiled his plan to raise the minimum wage to nine dollars an hour by the end of 2015 your thoughts on that and what kind of impact do you think that might have Tony I strongly support that as you probably know you could have a husband and wife working every day of the year at the minimum wage and still not be able to afford a two bedroom apartment in many parts of the Washington Metropolitan Area I think it's time that we rewarded work so that people can have a decent life and can have a family the fact is that the minimum wage hasn't moved up for many years and at this point the minimum wage keeps you in poverty and many of these people working at the minimum wage working a lot harder than I'd be able to work at a week I think it's the right and the fair thing to do and I and all of the money that the urine is going to go right back into the economy they still won't have any money to save but i think it's the fair and decent thing to do to me congressman Huizenga your thoughts on that particular issue well I we dealt with that actually when i served in the Michigan Legislature as well and at that time they were talking about this was a number of years ago about four or five years ago they were talking about ten dollars an hour being a living wage and so I'm trying to figure out exactly who should be setting that and what that is because in the metro DC area that nine dollars or ten dollars an hour is very different than a more of a rural part of michigan or down in Mississippi and here's the thing when you have the federal government coming in and dictating that as opposed to leaving it up to the states or as opposed to ideally leaving it up to the marketplace that is where you're going to see actually people responding they don't have a minimum wage issue in North Dakota and South Dakota because of an active robust economy that is what we need to get back to not just having government coming in and mandating a particular hourly wage what was your chief concern or criticism of the speech last night for me I think my biggest concern overall is our spending we're not serious yet we've heard this from the president a number of times we're going to get serious now but we don't want to talk about having a more efficient effective government we're not talking about any kind of real reform on long-term entitlement programs and those kinds of things for me that's a key element there were some good things you know the immigration discussion that we had education discussion but the overarching concern I have is what we're doing with our spending and our lack of fiscal restraint and this massive mountain of debt that's getting piled on our kids and our grandkids Moran your reaction to that well I i think that the I'm not frankly I'm not critical to president speech I thought it was a good speech I'm glad Joni that he addressed sequester and why we should not let it happen we was to adversely affected in the Washington area particularly a district like mine I'm glad that he emphasized the importance of investing in research and education particularly in the earliest years of a child's life I he did take agreed to take on the entitlement programs in fact he has done that in negotiations throughout 2011 and 2012 even with resistance from the Democratic Party I think he's willing to make a big deal but it's going to take two sides to do that where we're going to find out whether it's possible is with the budget resolution and I'm hopeful that we can agree upon a budget resolution and avoid this constant government by crisis the sequester is the biggest thing threatening the Washington area right now I know the president doesn't want it to happen it certainly shouldn't happen and I'm glad he addressed it right up front in his speech congressman I think if you pardon me give me just a moment to ask a representative Moran one other thing about the pin that you're wearing because there were many people in the crowd last night wearing those pins a no label pin can you tell me about that that's right there's a group of us called problem solvers many of us have very different points of view on issues we come from different congressional districts but we're determined to find some common ground to agree to disagree on many things but to figure out where we can agree and to try to move forward on those areas where we can't agree it's we've got to figure out how to come together as a Congress and not stay in our respective corners just yelling at each other and so this is a group called no labels problem solvers I I hope that we can advance at least some and and we're going to make the effort because we the American people are certainly deserving of that kind of effort on the partisan well congressman we certainly thank both of you for spending some time with us together and with us this morning to share your thoughts in the state of the union Congressman Jim Moran and congressman bill Huizenga thank you both we appreciate it thanks maybe Allison

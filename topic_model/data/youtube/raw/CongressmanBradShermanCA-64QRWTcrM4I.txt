alright everyone welcome back to our coverage live reserves of President and Joint Base Andrews and Marilyn arrived being back at least close to DC tonight getting off of Air Force One one of the last times by the way I mean you know he's still got five for a month you know I remember the first time he got off the plane when he took it from Chicago to DC and I happened to be anchoring and I just stopped and said you know what there he is on Air Force One so one of the last times but anyways it was a very emotional night for many Democrats are very emotional night for America the president arriving back in Washington delivering a rousing speech here tonight Philadelphia the democratic national convention going on back with me now congressman brad Sherman of California and my political dream team so a lot of people took on Donald Trump tonight congressman including Michael boom Bloomberg the man Tim Kaine who is running for president of the United States and on and on and on lets us into Mike Bloomberg and I'll get you react we must unite around the candidate who can defeat a dangerous demagogue I believe it's the duty of all American citizens to make our voices heard by voting in this election and if you're not yet registered to vote go online and do it now this is just too important to sit out now we've heard a lot of talk in this campaign about needing a leader who understands business I couldn't agree more I built the business and I didn't start it with a million-dollar check from my father because of my success in the private sector I had the chance to run America's largest city for 12 years governing and the wake of its greatest tragedy today as an independent and an entrepreneur and a former mayor I believe we need a president who is a problem solver not a bomb thrower someone who can bring members of Congress together to get big things done and I know Hilary can do that because I saw it firsthand so clearly part of the strategy tonight was to paint Donald Trump as someone who could cross he was erratic he didn't want his hands you know on the nuclear codes and on and on and on what do you make it down well I think Donald Trump helped us tremendously in that I mean obviously it's part of our convention but for him to declare that once Putin to hack American emails and interfere in the American political system is just mind-boggling I mean Mike Pence was so desperate he came out and said if Putin were to involve himself in our political race he threatened Putin with consequences so you've got Trump inviting him to do something and pence the same one saying of course we would take umbrage about the foreign hostile power trying to end if you interfere with our election through burglary cyber burglary yeah I think it was a ticket was Newt Gingrich of someone that correct me if I'm wrong who came out said I think Donald Trump was joking about this and then Donald Trump double down and said you know if you have Hillary Clinton's 30,000 emails or whatever hack them in and bring it to us that was is that concern I'm just i do want to point out one other thing when richard nixon wanted to rifle through the files of the DNC I good American burger outsourcing Trump is about outsourcing the public and burglary job Kaylee Russian hacker well first of all I'm not sure how you can engage in espionage of deleted emails at a server that's been wiped entirely clean by the former Secretary of State what Donald Trump was saying is that if Russia has the animo in fact they should hand them over to the FBI which I think we could all agree would be a good thing and and where you're saying that he's encouraging espionage the only person who's enabled espionage is the former Secretary of State who put American secrets and possibly American CIA lives and desperate condition she was irresponsible the national security information and it's for it anyway I mean I i I've done this before too i've actually sometimes put myself in a pretzel trying to defend a position but what Donald Trump just did was look into the camera and invite Russia to hack the top diplomat of the United States of America I mean that's that treasonous at best but even more importantly what you saw tonight to relate this to this but but congressman actually thought more concerning than that was saying he when he said today we're going to get rid of the Geneva Convention because it was outdated I mean just some of the things that he says it'll just take you a back but what you saw tonight is what what Democrats are making it plain to see for Americans look building Trump Tower and determining the intensity of the lights smelled in your name is a lot different from sitting in the command center in saying we're going to take out Osama bin Laden so whatever you want to say about Barack Obama's foreign policy Hillary Clinton's foreign policy they've made real decisions they just haven't bankrupt Atlantic City those are vastly different things that they've done in their lifetimes record speak congressman thank you so much for joining us in reality congressman brad Sherman who is from California a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee giving us some very vital information thank you so much everyone my dream team is going to stick around the congressman is going to step out stick with me we're going to have a lot more live from the CNN grill here in Philadelphia we're just getting started

special minutes from California barbara Lee representative thanks for being here and I'm glad I was just getting a report from Katie Boeck our correspondent out of Los Angeles and she had the opportunity to speak with a pro Trump rally ER at Los Angeles Airport and his statement was this he told Katie he said you know I went through a process of becoming a US citizen and I would hope that everybody else has to go through that same process and I'm also concerned about safety in America that's what that one proton marcher said to her what would you say to that California first I would say we all are concerned about safety in America but this is a ban against Muslims entering our country it provides for a religious test and in fact that's one American and I really applaud the the judge's decision because it is unconstitutional this was a judge appointed by George Bush and I think people need to really continue the protest and continue to speak out because this this ban is wrong and it's morally wrong and it's unconstitutional you've seen the historic marches across the country and Beth Louie and I were talking about how it's been three weekends in a row three weekends where we have a new president at the same time our Democrats ready to take advantage of this energy and if they are how are they doing it we're here in baltimore now progressives talking about our strategy for fighting and i think already you have seen democrats within the House of Representatives and the Senate provide that wall of resistance but it's important to recognize the Democrats are marching with the public in protest many of us were with of women's march many of us have been protesting the band the Wold the threat to cut off federal funding for sanctuary cities some of us protested the certification of the electoral college some of us did not attend the inauguration we're fighting on the inside the Republicans and the trust administration to take away health care for 30 million people so this resistance movement is part of the movement that we're working with one with Democrats on the inside and Democrat well and people on the outside not necessarily Democrats but a people's movement that has developed its democratic movement representative as you gather there what are some of the ideas that you're coming up with your fellow Democrats that you think will work to take advantage of what we're seeing in the streets here across the country one of the strategies we've been talking about is the whole notion of intersectionality and how we come together I think the young women who organized the women's March really got it right because you saw all around the country people from all aspects of life from all backgrounds come together because there were common issues that we all care about and so we have to continue to work to form these coalition's people who can agree on several issues but may not agree on all issues to come together and then we've got to get organized and mobilized registered to vote and of course for me and many of us we have to take back the house and the Senate in two years as you know so well being from California this idea of intersectionality you live it being from California and when we look at those we've been disaffected the gap and wealth that has been reported on that is very well seen there in Baltimore where you're meeting many are saying the Democrats also didn't address that in recent years how would you answer that criticism well Democrats in the last few years of course in the House of Representatives we've had a very strong agenda addressing criminal justice reform addressing health care addressing affordable housing you know addressing systemic racism but what has happened is unfortunately our economic message our message with regard to job creation and economic security didn't seem to break through when in fact it's been Democrats and President Obama who thought like you would not believe after the almost depression that President Bush put us in how we helped turn the economy around but that message has not broken through yet so we are working on a strong economic message so we can talk to the entire country with regard to why we must create good-paying union jobs with benefits for all Americans here's a sixty four dollar question who is that voice that will carry that message for the democratic party I think the voices of people who are protesting who are organizing the voices of young people I think it's the power of the people as we say in Northern California that will really resonate in this next election and people have got to recognize that this is still a democracy and we have to really use the mechanisms of our democratic processes to make sure that in two years we take back the house in the Senate and four years we do not have a trump administration to take to continue to take us back well more specifically and quickly here representative who do you want to lead to DNT well let me just say I have of course endorsed keith ellison use them i'm a member of the DNC there many fine candidates running and I think the next month we're going to see a an election that's really going to be exciting and it's going to be an election that's going to take the Democratic Party forward all right fellow California and congresswoman barbara Lee thank you so much representative

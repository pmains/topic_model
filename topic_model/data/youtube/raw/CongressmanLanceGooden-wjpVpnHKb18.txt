are you happy right now with the final version of the stopgap spending measure I'm content yes it should have been done a week ago there were hangups along the way there's lots of blame to go around and I won't place anything for today because at this point I'm just happy that we're getting this bill across the finish line we've got funding for the PPP adding funding to that we've got funding for testing funding for hospitals yes it could have been done a week ago but it will be done today we've got a vote coming up in the next hour on a commission that speaker Pelosi wants to investigate the response and then after that vote will vote on the extra funding for the PPP and then we'll be done probably around 5 p.m. today congressman Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is trying to put the brakes potentially on a fourth stimulus package here this is a secretary or Treasury secretary Stephen each and has said that we need to continue to keep the government and the people of the country funded what is your perspective on this do you believe we should have a fourth stimulus measure done through Congress or do you believe that Mitch McConnell is correct that we should hit the pause button on this the answer to your question is yes we should have another one and yes we should hit the pause button as well there's no reason to rush into this we've just passed almost four trillion dollars I believe after today of funding for a response to coronavirus we need to see where the problems are what is lacking what needs to be done how this money is trickling into the economy before we start passing it yet another face for if you want to call it that package however I do believe that negotiations will start next week and we'll start working on that next phase so I think yes we need to pass something else but we also need to make sure we're doing it the right way and make sure we see just how the current passage the current monies trickle trickle out throughout the economy I also wanted to get your take on what Mitch McConnell had said yesterday that he would rather see states explore bankruptcy than doling out more federal aid dollars I'm curious congressman what you make of that and should state and local governments be supported in future spending bills you know it probably wasn't the best choice of wording by the senator but I think what he meant and what I certainly agree with is that it's not the federal government's job to bail out high spending states look at New Jersey they had huge problems with their budget long before coronavirus hit now they're expecting the federal government to bail them out and I suspect they'd like us to help them with the problems that existed before this virus hit so we are going to have situations around the country where states are seeking help from the federal government some of that help may be justified that if you go to places like California where they're spending money State dollars on things that my former colleagues in the Texas State House would never spend State dollars on it's going to be hard for me to convince my constituents back home and that their US taxpayer dollars need to go to California to fund programs that have grown out of control over the years and that now state legislators in California are saying send those federal dollars and help us make up for this big loss I agree we've got some serious issues with respect to monies loss from coronavirus but you've got so many instances where state budgets that were already out of control to begin with and now they're coming to the federal trough asking for a bailout and I think that's what Senator McConnell is saying that we need to be careful about saying yes states we're gonna bail you out whatever your problem is we're also going to get your take on the stay at home protests that we're seeing pop up around the country some of them seemingly being encouraged by the president back to to go and partake in those what is your take on those on that and would you also encourage your constituents to stay at home and listen to their governor or for them to partake in a lot of these protests you know you know I would tell my constituents to listen to my governor but if my governor was the Michigan governor I probably wouldn't tell them that so it kind of depends on the state I understand the frustration I have constituents that are saying hey we're not seeing the sicknesses that we're seeing in places like New York we're staying home like they're staying in New York why are we not sick here there's all kinds of explanations for why that is but I think that the frustration level is simmering to a boil in Texas people are fed up they want to get back open governor Abbott knows that and he also has done such a great job handling the crisis in Texas that I think will be in a better position to potentially open up but then you go to other states where big mandates are coming out from the states from the governor they're just making people uncomfortable you go to liberal cities in states that have conservative governor's such as the city of Atlanta they have a Democrat mayor Republican governor they've clashed a bit in Texas we have Democrat leading liberal City of Austin where they're mandating mass to be warm we don't have that mandate across all of Texas and I think people freedom-loving conservatives that I represent are just a little uncomfortable with the government telling them to do things like you cannot leave your house they understand closing establishments to keep people from crowding but being told you cannot leave your house being told you have to cover your face is just a bit uncomfortable for some of us in conservative states that appreciate our freedom all right congressman we have a bad time for one last question you've been a vocal critic of China as well you've even gotten so far as to introduce a bill essentially that would force the Department of Justice to investigate that country explain why you introduced that bill and are you could that effort be put in work directly to the virus instead of going after China well the answer to that question is is we're not pulling any resources supporting this from the virus response to answer your last question but as respects to why we need this bill China is absolutely responsible for a great deal of the pain and suffering we're experiencing right now we just don't know to what extent it is unquestionable and just undisputed that the Chinese lied about the origins they lied about how serious it was the United States response was not what it could have been had we known all the facts from the get-go the world health organization has been towing the Chinese Communist Party line from day one what my bill does is it amends the foreign Sovereign Immunities Act that was passed in the 1970s that says you cannot sue another nation that allows the Department of Justice to open up an investigation and figure out just where the origins of this virus came from we don't know anything except what the Chinese are telling us anyone that contradicts what they say over in China turns up dead or missing I think that the federal government that the Justice Department needs to investigate the origins of this I I think it's time well-spent and money well-spent and I hope that it was just an accident but if it's not or even if it was the Chinese of light since day one they need to be held responsible to what degree is something that we would determine after we have learned all the facts the Chinese aren't going to help us learn those facts that we need to take it upon ourselves to investigate all right congressman Lance Gooden of Texas good to have you here sir thank you so much for joining us

i'm lori terhan and i'm here with caroline and grace and we wanted to welcome you to our very first children's town hall um i i guess i'll start just by describing what i do i'm your representative i represent the 3rd congressional district which is 37 cities and towns in in this part of massachusetts down in washington and uh we've been doing a lot of town halls with your parents and with adults talking about talking with health experts and with small business uh experts around the coronavirus and covid19 but you know through it all uh grace and caroline have been asking me questions non-stop for the last three weeks and so we thought it would be a good idea that's exactly why we're doing this because you all have questions you've submitted some fantastic questions uh and um we're going to do our best to answer them uh so there's no question that life has changed pretty dramatically for all of us these last few weeks and you know some of those changes won we haven't been to our school in uh in close to three weeks now many of us are working from home i know my husband and i are working from home that we haven't had play dates with our friends we haven't been able to see our loved ones or our teachers and uh and those are big uh those are big changes uh so we thought we would um you know sort of talk about that uh so that um you know if you have questions along the way we can we can answer them so just to give you a little bit of background the federal government has three branches there's the legislative branch which i work in along with 434 other representatives across the country there's the executive branch which is which is the president and everyone that works for him and then there's the judicial branch which is our supreme court in our entire court system members of congress like me are elected every two years and we enact our laws and we also represent you and your family down in washington um so like i said we've been doing town halls with experts and with adults but we wanted to do one uh with children because i'll tell you what sort of spawned this last week i had to go to washington uh congress hasn't really figured out how to work remotely we're kind of doing it in real time just like you all are doing learning at home rather than in your classrooms so i get in my car and i drove down to washington dc and i think grace was you you know you were nervous you wanted you were worried that i was going to get sick you were worried i had lots of questions and and that kind of uh prompted us us to do this we figure a lot of kids out there probably have questions so once again these are my great co-hosts i've been spending a lot of time with them we typically don't look like this but we got dressed up for you all uh this is caroline caroline do you want to say anything how old are you i'm six just turned six and what grade are you in kindergarten yes and this is uh chris what do you want to say how old are you i'm nine and when will you be ten five days on sunday uh and what grade are you in four all right well uh grace has agreed to read uh the questions that you have all uh submitted um one thing i will say is uh we like to make everything discussable in this house and the last few weeks have been hard and it's okay for you to feel that way grace was really looking forward to lacrosse season and grace and caroline both had a dance recital that they were supposed to perform in and you know not being able to do those things it uh it's hard and um in addition to that you know we miss uh we miss our nana and papa we miss our ama we used to get to see them almost on a daily basis and we don't get to see them and i think it's really important that if you're you know if you're struggling with that sometimes you don't even know if you're having a hard time with that you just know you don't feel the same way go talk to go talk to your parents and and make sure you say hey look i'm having a hard time because this is uncharted territory for all of us and it's really important that um we're there for each other and that we're patient and understanding all right let's get to the question okay right the first question is from jacob l in sudbury and he asks did the coronavirus come before this or is this the first time well uh covid19 which is what we call uh the coronavirus is brand new uh we've never seen it in humans before um and it's not like a typical cold it's not like when you get the sniffles uh so that's why we're treating it with um you know so much uh care and urgency it spreads very quickly that much we do know and you've probably all heard the term uh social distancing um that's you know us staying apart from each other so that we can slow the spread of that virus right we don't want more people to get it we want to try to contain it if we can so you know the other day we saw our neighbors they were walking their brand new puppy which was so hard for us to not run and go pet um but you know the girls stayed six to eight feet away from you know their dear friends and uh and it's really important that we do that because we don't want to get them sick uh we don't want them to get us sick you know if we uh one of the reasons why we don't see our our grandparents is because um people who are especially vulnerable are our seniors and people who have immune or immune compromise our our papa uh has multiple sclerosis and so he hasn't left the house in three weeks and we don't if we're dropping food off or something we just drop it off at the door we make sure we don't touch because we don't want um we don't want it to spread so um one thing that i will say is that uh we're all in it together i think we realize and you probably hear me say it a lot is that we all have a role to play and by washing our hands and doing the social distancing thing and disinfecting our surfaces and sneezing and coughing into our sleeve now wearing masks when we're out that helps prevent the spread of the virus all right did i answer that okay yeah okay carolyn are you going to come back and rejoin us you can bring the magnet tiles right over honey yeah you just if you want to carry the gorilla and you can build a a big huge tower if you like okay what do we got next the next question i think that is should be a better plan for future pandemics our lack of planning has resulted resulted in many people getting this disease we did not act soon enough and we did not do the right thing at first so how would you help plan for the future pandemics well it doesn't sound like andrew's in kindergarten does it no he's definitely either been reading the newspaper or watching the news uh you know andrew you're 100 right you know part of the federal government's role is to protect the public health uh when we talk about the entire country's health um that's what public health is we want to make sure that collectively we're not sick and we're not we're to prevent the spread of the virus and we've been here before throughout history we've had uh viruses that have spread before we've had uh illnesses where you know great leadership has mobilized resources so that we can find vaccines real quickly and find treatment i think the most important thing right now is that we keep our eye on the ball and we remember the three uh t's and that's testing treating and tracking um the best thing that we can do is make sure that uh everybody that we're testing as many people as we can that we're treating those people appropriately and that we're tracking where these hot spots are in our country um the other thing one other thing i'll say it's really important that we always fund and give resources to the centers for disease control or to the national institute of health because they are set up to try to prevent pandemic scientists uh and they're also set up to um uh you know make sure scientists are are ready to go with all the planning that something uh like a a virus like this would uh spread i'm so sorry i just got distracted gracie just gave me the hurry up uh signal underneath her clipboard so all right i will take my signals for my nine-year-old smarter than uh your average fourth grader okay so the next question is from nancy adam and jacob and she says what will i not have to say six feet away my mana all right the question the question was just in case you didn't hear it how long until i can give my nana a hug we ask that question uh all the time i mean we miss that we cry i cry about that i miss my mom uh gracie and caroline certainly miss uh their nanny and their puppy and like so many their cousins are you know my sisters their aunts and this is the hardest part um you know i think that we don't know uh we don't know science guide us in jeopardy but we're hoping it's soon the most important thing that we do is stay connected right i mean i know we're using uh we're using facetime we're making a lot more phone calls than we used to uh you know we're even drawing pictures and writing little notes uh and we'll continue to do that so that all the people that we love know how special and know how much they yeah [Music] um led is that your cousin led yeah and she says how long will school be canceled okay uh did you hear that how long will school be canceled um we you know right now we know that we're not going to school before may 4th uh grace and caroline are in uh public school public elementary school and uh and right now the order is may 4th would be the earliest um and we'll see we'll see where we're at when may 4th comes around if we are in a good spot we will uh we will be boarding that bus and going back to school but i think what's most important is that scientists um and our medical community they guide that decision uh and they'll tell us when it's safe for us to go back to school i will say it's been fun to have uh christian gracie and caroline's older brother uh is home from college and he's doing remote learning uh and it's been kind of cool to have him home we've never seen him this much before all right what do you got next to the [Music] oh um so amanda that's so sweet to think of your furry friends certainly there is no evidence to suggest that the virus is spread from our pets to us however i will say we've talked to plenty of health care experts on our town halls and their suggestion would be that if you're sick with kovid 19 that um that you don't snuggle uh your you know your dog or your cat or your bunny uh just for safe measures so um but you know there's no there's no uh there's no evidence of that um so if you're not uh if you're not um sick keep playing with uh keep playing with your bunnies i'm sure they really uh enjoy the fact that you're home from school i know we have a dog cookie and she's gotten more attention in the last three weeks than she has since the day she was born and she's loving the fact that we're uh we're here at home with her all right you got another question yeah the next question is from sam lee in hudson and he asks i have a question about global19 in the schools what are you doing about supporting this school close well um that's a great question i actually sit on the committee of education and labor and so this is all our committee talks about right now is how are we going to take care of our schools our students and our teachers right uh and all the people who work in our schools uh you know last week was it last week that i drove down to washington yeah um precisely what we were doing was passing um legislation so that we funded uh remote learning you know there are a lot of uh students and there's a lot of a lot of families who either don't have ipads or laptops or they don't even have access to wi-fi so we needed to fund and make sure that we were giving hot spots to students we're making sure that people just had access to keep learning uh through the school year even though they weren't in their classroom the other thing we have to do is make sure like look there are a lot of kids us included we need school lunch right some people need that lunch you know in order to stay healthy and have a nutritious meal and so we made sure that we kept that funding uh in fact a couple of weeks ago i was i went to my hometown of lowell and i passed out uh school lunches and i passed out food from the food bank um so that people ever all these families have what they need uh while they're at home um on this on um you know staying safely at home so everything that we do in that committee is to make sure that students and teachers have what they need to continue uh learning you have a question yeah so how do you spend your day now that you're not in washington oh you have no idea what's happening behind that closed door well um so normal life was i would leave on maybe a monday and come back on thursday night i'd go to washington i'd vote and debate and sit in committee hearings right now what we're trying to do is have all those meetings on conference calls so i sit on committee conference calls i said on the armed services committee in the committee education labor so i'm on the on calls we're trying to figure out what the next package uh the next legislative package is going to include uh to make sure that families are safe and they have what they need to get through this uh tough period uh also our small businesses so um you know i spend a lot of time on the phone equally as important of you know getting on the phone with all my colleagues in congress is talking to businesses right i talk to the superintendents of schools and all the communities uh that i represent i talk to first responders i talk to mayors and the state reps and and our hospitals making sure that they have what they need are you coming over here come on over come sit with me no do you want to take a drink out of gracie's mug come join us all right well you can bring it over no no uh so yeah we're still working really hard making sure that one we keep in touch with all the folks here in massachusetts to see what they need because that informs what i what i fight for uh down in washington yeah and i have another question is if you go shopping or leave the house will you wear a mask absolutely absolutely we have a couple of masks um but i also noticed that there are a lot of people out there who are making masks um so we would be well i would be i don't know if you're gonna need one um you all haven't really left the house in quite some time um but if we go out in public i will absolutely wear a mask and uh and maybe we can ask nanny if she could uh nanny or auntie if she can make us one yeah i mean i'm not a very good baker what makes you think i'm a good sewer oh you mean just tying it around yes i could definitely do that but i feel like nanny could maybe make us one we'll ask her but she's really good like that yeah and then we have our last question from oliver g and groton and he says what do you do this question is for all of us to stay busy and have fun most days caroline come tell us what you do to have fun what have we been doing these last three weeks i played outside in me and grace sometimes we paint and sometimes because our family what game have you learned how to play what card game me and grace learn how to play sky yep and uh and hey camille what else did you what else have you been doing when you go outside you've been doing it more than ever before i normally swing and ride my bike yes yeah we've been doing a lot of bike riding how about you um i usually play basketball yes a lot of basketball a lot of lacrosse um great and when we're inside we usually have moving marathons in place yeah yes i will say that you have um you're you're an extraordinary baker you have basically been the reason why we have breakfast every morning um and uh and we've had a couple of dance contests yeah yeah we had a pink take off with dad yeah yes and we've done a fair amount of painting and crafts right that's what i said yeah uh right now we're trying to get organized and stay ahead of um of our classes right we've been making an adjustment uh on uh learning and when we meet our teachers and you know the apps that we use to upload our assignments um so yeah we're we're doing all right thank goodness for the nice weather right yeah well any other questions um not from no no all right well i will say um i want to thank everyone uh this is a first for us and uh but i don't think it's gonna be the last we'll probably keep uh we'll we'll stay in touch um just by virtue of how great your questions are i could see that we could do these um again but i just i the one thing i wanted to just remind everyone is that um it's really important that we all do our part and uh we all do what we can to make sure that we prevent the spread of uh of the coronavirus and that means absolutely washing our hands absolutely making sure that we're staying even when we're outside and we're hiking on a trail or walking in our neighborhood that we're six feet away from our neighbors um and making sure that we we all do do our part and then certainly from a mental health perspective this has been a tough adjustment uh i think everybody is you know kind of going through their own uh process of of um kind of getting acclimated to the new normal and so make sure you raise your hand and tell your you know your mom and dad uh or your brother or your sister you know you want to talk um make sure you're getting outside and you're getting some exercise and make sure you're being creative keeping yourself busy and be kind be kind to your parents be kind to your siblings and if you have the opportunity to thank a doctor or a nurse or someone who works at the grocery store delivers mail or a package for your house say thank you because they are our new front line they're providing us all the things that we need to stay healthy and to stay fed and we owe them a huge debt of gratitude all right well until next time carolyn you want to come and say goodbye thank you so much for sending us your questions and uh we'll talk again soon bye bye

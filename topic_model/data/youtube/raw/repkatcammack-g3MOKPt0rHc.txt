joining me now for reaction Florida congresswoman Kat camek congresswoman great to have you back on good to see you this morning hey good to see you as well happy Friday happy Friday to you too we made it um so the New York Times wrote about this yesterday it's an old Democratic strategy Bill Clinton used it in 96 basically scare voters tell them Republicans are coming for your Medicare and your Social Security does it work for Biden in 2024 no absolutely not you know and I thought it was curious he still University of Tampa when he could have just easily driven the 30 minutes to The Villages where you ironically have the largest Trump Club in America and he could have tested that line out there but listen I know he doesn't remember what he said in the 90s and he certainly doesn't remember what he said in 1975 when he first proposed sun setting Social Security and Medicare because quite frankly he doesn't remember what he had for breakfast this morning so uh we're gonna have to keep reminding him that he is the original architect of cutting Social Security and Medicare that in fact it is not Republicans who wanted to do that and I think it's important that the American people see that Republicans are interested in actually solving problems instead of playing the fear mongering game like biting this yeah in Florida I'll tell you what with with a republican Governor two Republican Senators State Legislature and Republican hands Florida is a red State I don't know if that message resonates there like it may have uh when Joe Biden was in the Senate making the comments we played earlier from 1995. uh you're on the select subcommittee on the weaponization of the doj in the FBI first hearings were held this week really interesting stuff uh basically talking about what the FBI did hand in glove with the Democratic party before not just the 2020 election but the 2022 election to try and swing elections across the country in Democratic candidates favor how important are these hearings oh these are extraordinary hearings uh some of the most consequential work that we will be doing in terms of oversight this Congress and the thing that I found curious is that this really shouldn't be a partisan issue Republicans and democrats should operate As Americans concerned about the fact that the administration is colluding with big Tech and that you have a weaponized doj and FBI that is seeking to consolidate power away from field offices in order to enact a political agenda and outcome I think people should be deeply concerned about this because at the end of the day we should all be striving for truth rather than a political outcome but instead what we saw yesterday in our first hearing was Democrats trying to rehash the January 6th uh committee uh going after Trump continually pointing fingers and they were trying to discredit uh FBI agents uh whistleblowers who have come forward it was truly uh eye-opening I know certainly for for folks back home and my district watching but there's a whole heck of a lot more to come and Americans should be deeply concerned about their civil liberties being infringed upon by these weaponized agencies yeah and I just want everyone at home to know that these are not one-off hearings which we typically see in Washington by the way and we are committed to covering these as they continue throughout the year congresswoman two weeks ago almost to the day DirecTV drops Newsmax uh from their lineup they did it to oan 12 months ago so there's a clear pattern here of censorship if you're a conservative not if you're not if you're liberal Progressive a Democrat how shocked are you that this is still happening in America you know given everything that we have found uh particularly under the Twitter files and as somebody who's been Shadow banned I can totally understand that this is not a surprise at all really to any of us who have been experiencing the suppression of free speech so I think that as conservatives we have to stand up we have to push back we're getting it in all forms through Academia through Hollywood uh through news uh corporate media you name it we're we are constantly under attack we have to be more Vigilant than ever and making sure that Americans uh have options when it comes to uh their news and certainly making sure that we're protecting that most sacred First Amendment I've said that so many times if the same thing happened to CNN I might chuckle about it but I would not support it in any way shape or form America should have options congresswoman have a great weekend enjoy the game on Sunday good seeing you hey so much

folks look the other evening a good friend of mine and a member of the United States Senate Senator Bill Cassidy a Louisiana join me and one of my telet√≥n hall meetings he's a doctor he has a gastroenterologist and he is also as he calls himself a Cajun you've got a great job of answering questions he's joined me here for just a few minutes a lot of the questions that came in we didn't get a chance to answer it so what I've done is I've had my team put together a list of these questions and we're gonna do a quick run through just one throw right after another here and Doc's gonna try to get these out of the ballpark with a real quick answer just to try to get to a few more of the answers to some of the questions that folks in South Dakota had the other evening a doc do you want to say anything before we jump right in no Mike thanks for having me I really enjoyed the call the other night was fantastic and and so I'm looking forward to this kind of interview if you will okay here we go first one is social distancing gonna have an impact and what will happen when we go back to normal will the virus just flare up again a couple things it is absolutely at an impact New Orleans the New Orleans region Louisiana's had a big outbreak with social distancing we've gone from every person infecting infected infecting two to three other people to now every person infected only affects about 1.3 people that's a huge difference so it does have an impact whether it comes back probably so that's why hopefully as Tony Fauci says the NIH fellow that we need to have a new normal if you are at risk of being infected you'll wear a mask you'll wipe down the cart and the parking lot at Walmart with a Lysol wipe you'll use hand sanitizer as you go around if you touch your face you'll grab your hand sanitizer and then you'll quickly wipe your fingers so absolutely it can come back we need to live with the new normal time as we get the right kind of testing the right kind of therapeutics and the right kind of vaccines right absolutely senator rounds you nailed it okay hey I'm joined here once again for those of you that might just be joining here was Senator Bill Cassidy he's a gastroenterologist he's from Louisiana a good friend of mine in the United States Senate and he's one of these guys we can ask some tough questions too and he's got some good answers another one can my pet dog or cat get infected and and should I take any extra precautions to protect that well it does appear that for example there was a tiger in the Bronx Zoo that got infected there was a report out in China of a dog getting infected was not known is can the animal infect humans and make it up from humans to animals but it doesn't necessarily mean it can come back the other way so the Centers for Disease Control is kind of recommended if you are sheltering in place just keep your animals with you but as a rule you don't have to have special any special precautions just kind of good sense precautions since your social distancing anyway shelfing in place keep your animals with you and by the time you're clear of the virus they'll be clear - okay what about herd mentality what is it and how will it affect us in this fight against Kovan 19 I think you talked about herd immunity yes I'm sorry excuse me we deal with herd immunity means that when there's enough people who are immune to virus it protects those who aren't so right now when one person is infected it infects two to three more and those two to three more infect two to three more who then infect two to three more but if the one person infected it comes in contact with somebody who's already immune it stops there when you have enough people immune there's no one else to infect now herd immunity begins roughly 40 percent of the population is immune it really is most effective when you have over 80 but it begins when you have about 40 and so a herd immunity is real we've probably got a ways to go before it kicks into our society but that's the ultimate goal yeah thanks I think when I was thinking of herd mentality I was thinking about how we talked about the House of Representatives in Washington hey when should we wear masks and when is it safe to not wear them again if you're in a confined environment wear a mask if you're with other people and you cannot avoid being closer than six feet so think of the bus drivers in New York and Philadelphia getting so upset people would come right by them all the time they're in a bus that air is just kind of circulating around they should wear masks but I have an assistant across the room he's 12 feet away there's plenty of good ventilation where we are I'm not wearing a mask when I walk with my wife I don't wear a mask but I want to give plasma yesterday surrounded by people kind of videoing as I gave plasma I wore a mask because they were close to me in a small room kind of use your judgment great what about is there anything that we should do to strengthen our immune system during this time anything in particular that stands out there's a good advice of rest and a good diet but risk factors for getting a severe case of kovat 19 or being obese having high blood pressure and diabetes those are all related this might be the time to start your diet in which you lose a pound a week if you have social distancing for 12 weeks you've lost 12 pounds simple diet if it's white don't eat it no white sugar or brown sugar no white potatoes no corn no grits down here in the south assault don't take salt don't take white flour you can eat sweet potatoes whole-grain bread brown rice but no sugar of any kind if you cut out all that which is white then you're gonna lose at least a pound a week and by the way no cold drinks with sugar in them you know become a label reader no cereal with a lot of sugar but if you do that you'll lose a pound a week at the end of this you'll have lost 8 to 12 pounds and be on your way to improving yours otherwise and decreasing your risk for severe Kove at 19 I'm sure glad you didn't say anything about beer being white beer has white in it by the way for some folks then okay what about what about zinc there's a rumor out there that says that zinc can be effective in combating co19 well I can't say that it's not there's just no strong data so what you want to do is give zinc to a half the group and zinc not to half the group and see which group does better so there's no data out there but a zinc supplements not going to hurt you and it may benefit you so wouldn't just so why not hydroxychloroquine it's used for malaria there's the discussion out there a matter of fact we're doing clinical trials here in South Dakota involving over two thousand volunteers three different Hospital organizations what's the current thought process with regard to that particular product it may it may benefit it's not yet proven it can have side effects particularly with heart arrhythmias and so discuss it with your physician and let your physician help you work through that decision there's some people who just shouldn't take it but there is some evidence that if you that that if you are on it that it protects you from being infected so let me just go back to discuss it with your physician if there's a clinical trial enroll in the clinical trial that's a good way to advance medical science and to get some of the benefits that you kind of want if you're gonna if you're going to take it and and let others know as well whether there has been a bit I would note that the FAA has put out notice to pilot saying if you do participate or use that product you should not fly for 48 hours after you use that that just came out recently there is a heart arrhythmia aspect to it and you don't want your pilot you know something going into a heart arrhythmia so I got it okay what about the vaccines how close are we I know that you know Steve Daines another one of our members on the Senate really good guy really sharp guy had promoted and a lot of us bought into the idea that we try to promote kind of a to pass at the same time trying to develop clinically the the different vaccines but at the same time start producing the vaccines in large quantities at the same time just in case one of them is effective to be able to have those vaccines available perhaps five six months earlier or what do you think about that yeah I think it's a great idea I'm glad Steve suggested it but we're still 12 to 18 months from that vaccine being available you have to first know that it's safe some vaccines cause problems then you have to know that it's effective which means that you give the vaccine to a lot of people you give a sham fake vaccine to another group and you see whether those with the vaccine are actually protected against the second wave of coronavirus now you're really talking through the next season that's why it's important to have a knowledge of our immunity now it may be that some have already been exposed and are already immune they've already been vaccinated if you will so the vaccine is 12 to 18 months off but it would help for all of us to know our immunity status now and and follow that over time to see if we become immune over time okay doc I know you've got a number of other items going on I'm not gonna keep you much longer there's one here that I think is important what about going to your doctor for non-urgent nan Colvin nineteen related visits and how should we really handle that with regard to those other issues that normally we call a doctor or we go we'd stop on in what's really the protocol now for the next couple of months anyway with regard to how we should make contact with our doctor and the precautions we should be taking and when should we make that contact if it's not really Kogan nineteen related several things about that Mike and the cares Act that you and I just voted for we expanded the use of telehealth meaning that you can call your physician she could look at your a smartphone and get a sense of that rash I can tell you what that ratio is just from looking at it with the smartphone let me call in the prescription so some of what we formerly saw our physicians for can now be done through telehealth the physician can also order home health to come see you so you don't need to come in so you they can bring a blood pressure monitoring equipment or something to put on your finger to monitor your pulse and the amount of oxygen in your blood that sort of distance analysis if you will on the other hand in the instructions the president gave yesterday the president said that if you have elective surgeries they're going to open that back up I like that physicians dentists we're used to practicing universal precautions you'll walk into the doctor's office everybody be wearing a mask they'll be hand sanitizer at the waiting room when people walk in they'll wipe off the chairs as they get up to go into the back all the physicians and dentists nurses text will be wearing gowns we're used to those universal precautions I think that's a good way to begin opening the economy back up great look we've been speaking with dr. bill Cassidy a United States Senator from Louisiana a good friend he is a gastroenterologist professionally but he's been a real asset in the United States Senate and become a very good friend bill I want to thank you for taking a few minutes to speak once again with the folks here in South Dakota we just thought it'd be good to have a professional come in and answer some of these questions that we didn't get to at our teletype all the other evening thank you very much for helping us put this together today hey Mike we're all in this together if you won't have another one of these I really enjoyed it and let me compliment the people of South Dakota who called in y'all had great questions in fact what I'm going to do Mike if you don't mind is kind of linked from my Facebook page to wherever you post this so that folks in my state can have the advantage of the questions asked by the folks in South Dakota sounds good hey thank you very much like you say we're all in it together we're gonna win this battle we're gonna come out stronger as a nation than we were before thank you

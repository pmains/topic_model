it's the right to national pay leave so you don't have to choose between a paycheck and providing for your family and being home with a loved one when I first became a parent I was a lawyer at a law firm that didn't even have a maternity leave policy but I was also a mother who didn't know much about being a mother I didn't really know how to nurse I had to get a lot of help from the nurses in the hospital I really didn't know how to swaddle a baby properly didn't know how to change diaper so I was one of those first-time parents that needed help guidance and support I think all parents need support and I think it's important that we recognize that every parent wants the best for their children and if we can make it just a little easier to provide what's best for their children regardless of your resources regardless of what block you'll crop on we're gonna go a long way to strengthen our country

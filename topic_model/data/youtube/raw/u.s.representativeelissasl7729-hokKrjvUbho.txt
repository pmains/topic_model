congresswoman scott welcome back to meet the press thanks for having me look you're one of uh i think let me get my numbers right here seven house democrats of just seven shows how polarized we are representing a district that trump won in 2020 uh i want to put together i want to show you some numbers from independents that we saw on on president biden that is he on the issue of compromise has he been too willing too unwilling right balance among independents a large majority 55 percent believe the president's been too unwilling to compromise does that you're a district that obviously has an independent mind you won trump won is this what you're hearing i do i mean i think that people in general are kind of questioning whether government still works for them and so we should be doing a couple of things really really well and then talking about it over and over and over again so people know we did it as opposed to saying we're going to do everything promising the world and then not getting all of that done people leave feeling like well look my government isn't doing anything for me so i think we're in a crisis when it comes to people believing in government and the best thing we can do is govern effectively all right so what do you want the president to do in the next six weeks because you could argue that because if it's an even numbered year you know this maybe you only have until the uh until april 1 to truly get some legislation done what should the focus be yeah i mean i think for me the issues are that are always going to resonate the cost of prescription drugs right just allow medicare to negotiate for drug prices it was in different versions of bills like it's a common sense thing and that unites progressives that's something you just heard senator sanders about this actually unites the democratic coalition it's not a democratic coalition by the way like it just doesn't make any sense that medicare can't negotiate drug president trump wanted it right so let's do that yeah um i think universal pre-kindergarten for through for three-year-olds and four-year-olds like right now you're worried about the economy we don't have enough people working you unleash a huge amount of people into the economy if we can get reliable child care so do discreet things well don't try and promise the moon and i i just come from the school i'm you know a cia officer and a pentagon official like under promise and over deliver and we haven't been doing that um there seems to be a lot of public highlighting of democratic division yeah you we were talking earlier you weren't crazy about having to air some of this dirty laundry but it's happening what's happening to center cinema is is this healthy for the party having a state party her own state party censure her like i said most people will look at what they're censoring or over is over a disagreement on tactics not on the issue yeah i i don't i just just don't come from a school where you're constantly airing dirty laundry like there are really big divisions in washington right now period democrat republican within each party um but i just don't believe that the way that you get back at other people is by putting that on air airing that publicly so i i don't love that um i also don't think that you know if we if we disagree with someone that's a normal part of governing people just want people to be responsible so i i don't love it uh but i also that's not what people in my district are worrying about you question the motives of senators mansion in cinema for their disagreements no i i don't i think um uh someone once told me when i started congress you know you can question someone's policy choices don't question their motives because we're all here i hope to do the right thing or we should be you have a district that actually has got a lot of parts of what i would say is the biden coalition that got him the primary union folks he was ended up being uh working class folks african-americans what are you hearing let's start with union members uh and african-americans what are you hearing from them on what they're saying about uh either at the democratic party these days well look people don't wake up in my district like real political people they're not you know here in washington they're probably you know not watching this show right now they're waking up and they're talking about the price of groceries the price of gas they're talking about crime right and and concerns about security they're talking about whether their kids are going to be able to stay in school those are the things that are the people are talking about and i think that's in my mind what the white house should be laser focused on and and i get it there's a there's a big coalition we got a lot of people that are interested in a lot of different things but in my mind like where's the war room on the cost of living right where's the task force on inflation where the where's the energy around that because that's what everyone is talking about when i sit down with them and when it comes to covet covet we know for everybody it's the wet blanket for different reasons it's the wet blanket is there anything the administration can do more proactively on covet or is is the fact that there looks like they're taking a little bit of a step back the right call as far as uh the politics of copenhagen you know if if if we had if we could i would say let's let's kind of enter a new phase on kovid and keep our kids in school keep our businesses open focus on keeping our world open um but our hospitals are like war zones right now right we don't have enough subs when our teachers get coveted so that we can't forget about it we can't change and sort of say that's not our business when the institutions that hold our communities up should that be what congress focus on right now a little more is covert relief going to be necessary what's happening i mean school bus drivers but it's it's not just that it's an across the board here is should congress step in here with more relief i don't i mean honestly the coveted relief at least in my state that we passed back in march is sitting in the bank account of the state of michigan the state of michigan has like literally four billion people using this for substantial teachers yes hello hello michigan state senate and state senate it's like move get off your duff you know get that money out so that we can pay more for subs in our schools so that we can get more folks nurses and doctors um that i don't know that we need another package because the money we've spent hasn't been used already on the ground all right alyssa slotkin a democrat from michigan thanks for coming out sharing your perspective with us

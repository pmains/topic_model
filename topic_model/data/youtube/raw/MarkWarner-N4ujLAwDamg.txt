news channel 3's investigation into mold and military housing is keeping pressure on the navy and lincoln military housing today senator mark warner came back into town to make sure families are getting results newschannel 3's lori simmons has the story only on three i've been fighting for four years to have somebody come out here and fix my house but now sue corbin is happy that fight is finally over for her family she's shown off her brand new kitchen new carpets and new bathrooms to senator mark warner and congressman bobby scott all repairs she has been waiting years for and only got completed after newschannel 3 started reporting on mold and maintenance issues in lincoln military housing a lot of maintenance that needed to be done and it wasn't being done routinely oh we'll get to it we'll get to it we'll get to it that's their answer for everything but the group that we have now has been amazing warner also toured the former home of angela johnson the navy and lincoln say they moved her because of the large amount of work needed in her sandpiper crescent home combined with her kids history of asthma and breathing problems i'm happy that they moved me and got me to where i am but i still think about the people that were behind me having the same issues angela is also concerned about her mold test results which showed two types of molds in her air conditioning system that experts call moisture indicators and when you got this what was the reaction from the college of the navy and from lincoln well they told me that black mold does not affect children i have allergy testing done on my son that states that he's allergic to mold and different many different types of mold which several of them are on there so to be told by somebody that that's not the issue that's not the case it's fine i was serious to say the least the navy tells news channel 3 they have seen no patterns of illness among residents in lincoln housing and that this is more of a maintenance problem not a public health concern do you believe those statements knowing would be coaching the families all i know is i've got a daughter with asthma she's if she's in a home that's got worse than any traces of mold that asthma gets inflamed respectfully and you have some navy doc saying it's not a problem as a parent i'm gonna still think it's a problem congressman scott ridgel asked senior medical leadership last week to look into a possible link between health concerns and living in lincoln housing and today the senator also threw his weight behind the request there are no federal standards around mold to kind of take that leap but to my mind there needs to be those standards lori simmons newschannel 3.

you but in a new op-ed today congressman adam schiff warns that donald trump's legacy is hardly a mere black mark on u.s history instead it's a road map for aspiring autocrats like trump or worse shift vowing today to along with his colleagues in congress use his legislative authority to stop the slow march toward autocracy in its tracks he writes this for nbc think quote it turns out the norms that made our system of checks and balances work so well could be violated with near impunity providing one condition was present that one of america's two great parties put the interests of a president above all other considerations the last time a president engaged in such abuses of office during richard nixon's tenure the forces of factionalism were less potent and the devotion to our institutions was far stronger that devotion was strong enough in fact to force nixon from office even so in the wake of watergate congress passed a host of reforms to ensure that such abuses did not occur again they served us well for almost half a century but it's time for us to add to them joining us now congressman adam schiff of california chairman of the house intelligence committee a member of the house select committee investigating the deadly attack of the united states capitol on january 6 congressman thank you so much for making some time with us today um i i remember when bob corker saw some things that seemed to go right to the heart of donald trump's fitness as commander-in-chief and he sought unsuccessfully to limit a president's nuclear authority this feels like the next effort in that category tell me about it and whether or not you have any bipartisan support well it addresses a litany of weaknesses in our democracy that we discovered over the last four years so it would protect inspector generals and whistleblowers it would strengthen the independence of the justice department so it can't be utilized as the president's personal law firm or to go after the president's enemies it would provide a mechanism to enforce the emoluments clause so a president can't simply enrich themselves rent out hotel rooms to gulf nations who don't even occupy the hotel rooms as a means of carrying favor it would strengthen penalties for the hatch act so we don't have top administration officials recommended for firing for violating the law whose response is blah blah blah what are you going to do about it it would also try to address these temporary appointments to cabinet positions to get around senate confirmation and probably a dozen other really critical inform reforms uh probably most importantly it would expedite enforcement of congressional subpoenas so that you can't have administration simply stonewall them all well if you look at the two impeachments in in total and you look at the mueller investigation the three most public attempts to hold the ex-president accountable they all came up short for different reasons but it sounds like the legislation tries to address all of them is there anything that you looked at that could change what is currently governed by a a legal memo a guiding principle memo the justice department that says the current president can't be impeached is that something congress can change well we address it to this degree uh that olc opinion that says the president can't be indicted we would told the statute of limitations so that you don't have a situation where the justice department can take the position a sitting president can't be indicted uh and when they leave office as long as they stay in office long enough they can allow the statute to run and they can't be indicted then either that would really put the president above the law that olc opinion that you mentioned i think is really seriously flawed uh and in particular the the justice department never really addressed whether you could uh indict a president while in office even if you had to defer the prosecution until they left that was only given very glancing attention so i think it's a flawed opinion constitutionally can the congress somehow override the justice department's interpretation it would probably be difficult uh although not impossible but this does provide a mechanism for holding presidents accountable by saying we're going to tell the statute that undoubtedly we can do in congress so that at least the president can be prosecuted when they leave office it feels like adam kinzinger is saying something when he calls this memo that woodward and costa report on a blueprint for a coup is the select committee investigating a conspiracy to commit a coup yes and i think adam is exactly right the predominant worry that i have about our democracy is not that it's going to be uh overthrown by a violent revolution uh notwithstanding that we endured a violent attempt at its erection but rather that there will be quasi-legal means that so undermine our democracy uh that it creates a crisis and it falls apart uh this is what the republicans tried to do that the trump campaign and administration tried to do with this memo but it's also what gop party leaders are trying to do around the country by stripping independent elections officials of their powers and handing them to partisan boards so that they can succeed where they failed with this attempted coup that is if they can't disenfranchise enough people and they still lose this gives them a chance through the patina of legality to overturn the results and that to me is the most desperate risk that our democracy faces can you protect the country from the threat of domestic violent extremists without the help of the other political party can the democratic party protect the country alone it's a very good question because you mentioned that the the two impeachments and uh efforts uh by bob mueller all fell short for different reasons certainly the efforts in congress fell short but for the same reason and that is you have one of the major parties uh that would not put the interests of its own institution or the con or the constitution ahead of their their interest in maintaining power in the power of the presidency um can one party do it alone some of the reforms in this package would attempt to empower one party acting alone if they control one of the houses to provide these guard rails so for example one party uh that's in opposition to the white house can bring in action under the emoluments clause to stop the violation of that so there are some provisions uh the expedition of congressional subpoenas could be done even without the participation of the other party uh if there's at least control of one house but at the end of the day uh no matter what genius our founders had no matter how good uh we might uh pass laws in congress if one of the major parties uh gives itself up to autocracy then the whole republic is at risk and we really need the republican party to return to being a party of ideas and a party that supports democracy yeah we were talking to bob woodward about how the parallels to watergate fall apart because unlike that republican party the smoking gun evidence that the two impeachments uh presented to the jurors the senators had no effect congressman adam schiff thank you so much for making some time to talk to us today we're really grateful thank you

Thank You mr. chairman and I said well I want to touch on the training aspect of pilots in general of aircraft certified by the FAA and then also about the specific max eight aircraft would it be a true statement to say that US pilots properly trained would know how to respond to an uncommanded nose-down pitched raid on an aircraft with an automated stabilator system I'll give you an example I flew the Blackhawk yes ma'am I went through this real prop and it went through a real problem the beginning of its of its development and to this day I know the procedure for uncommanded nose down right right so I know it by heart I will always know until the day I die is that something that most pilots would be able to basically say what those steps are those memory items if they're properly trained under US system yes senator Duckworth they are American US trained pilots on large commercial aircraft know that procedure and if I might yes I'm well I wanted to to amplify what we were doing prior to the grounding on Wednesday one of the things we were doing I was doing is talking to the heads of all of the pilot groups that flew the Macs and asking did they have reservations about the max this is an addition to data we got from fifty-seven over 50,000 max flights in North America Canada in the US and in those data reports and those are data reports that coming right off the airplane there was not a single case in North America of an EM cast malfunction or what what we what we found happen in line error but that wasn't enough I called and talked to the presidents of Swap of the Southwest Airline Pilots organization ALPA over 53,000 pilots and APA the American pilots group and asked them what is your experience with flying the max what are your pilots saying and they said to a to a person to a group we absolutely confident in the safety of this aircraft and our pilots level of training in flying it if I hadn't had that information the data and the affidavits from those unions are from those pilot groups I have been able that's part of the data package I had to wait for the data from the accidents to justify a grounding let me then ask you about so we talked a bit about just responding to an uncommanded and nose-down attitude that aside there's another procedure this ripe experience of Blackhawk pilot we have the staple later that would slow down killed a bunch of pilots heard bunch of people but the automated control system the basic procedure is reset if it doesn't reset turn it off manual control flew to zero of you're above 40 knots indicated air speed full down you're below I know nothing you ever flew everywhere as slow as 40 knots indicated here as we decided slow and low pilots the question I have for you is um while the MCATs is not specifically a reference in the aircraft manual for the max eight the procedure to shut off stabilizer trim switches are in the met are in the manual as a response to this is that correct and this is something that American pilots would be trained on yes ma'am is this something that FAA through ICAO would ensure that other pilots and other countries would also be trained on when when we interact that I care it is usually not to the specificity of a fleet type but we do use our influence at ICAO and our influence at the International Civil Aviation Organization is substantial and we use it at any opportunity we get to raise the safety level around the world in fact we don't have the the final reports on either these accidents but I have already set in motion at the FAA activities to go to the assembly and as you know I'm sure i km it's every three years and we're already examining what we bring to the assembly this year our country our pilots to help raise the safety bar which is as you know we're responsible for aviation safety in the United States but we are it's a globe there are no boundaries there's no borders it's a global endeavor we care deeply how other countries that and we have over a hundred technical assistant agreements around the world we have 20 bilateral aviation safety agreements with 47 countries we're very very passionate not just about safety in the US but that every country raises their safety bar so are you saying that we need to look at strengthening the international aviation safety assessment program and do you plan on doing that and then i KO meeting the international aviation safety assessment program I think is sound it's very good the IATA that we do with countries around the world because what we do is we evaluate the Civil Aviation Authority and and a healthy Civil Aviation Authority tells you that that country has a good culture for everything airports pilots Airlines but by working to help raise the standards overall then when we do an eye ASSA in an in a country and we do a rating will be rating against higher standards and I think that that that that's appropriate it's well worth our attention thank you a lot of times the Chairman thank you

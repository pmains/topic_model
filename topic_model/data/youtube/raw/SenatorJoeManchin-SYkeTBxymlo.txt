yeah good morning everyone thank you for coming my name is leslie reynolds i'm the acting superintendent of new river gorge national park and preserve the 63rd and newest park in our system i'd like to welcome secretary of interior holland senator manchin community members the friends of new river park staff local community and of course the media it continues to be a very exciting time for the park we're looking forward to a very busy season and of course continued collaboration with the local communities partners and stakeholders and with that i would like to introduce senator manchin thank you [Applause] well thank you acting superintendent to have reynolds for the kind introduction let me just say all of you what a great visit we've had to have secretary holland and also we had secretary grant home yesterday and then we also have brian diese from the from the president's white house and basically he's our policy as far as financial policy advisor to the president to have everybody here at one time with all their staffs means means a great deal for all of us in west virginia to be able to showcase what we have and what we have to offer um i i for for secretary hall to take a couple of days to spend with us has been really special we became friends basically through her process of becoming our secretary of interior and bringing her staff together and we have rachel her chief of staff right back there who's a west virginia lady a a young lady who we're so proud of from wood county and if anyone knows west virginia it'll be rachel and she's able to to whisper in and and the secretary's ear every now and then tell her the special things about us but we're sitting in a place right now which is the newest national park in the system i don't know if any national park has ever taken off the way this one has we've increased the amount of visits by 60 percent weren't sure what to anticipate we knew it's usually a 20 to 25 percent hit and we were anticipating that but to have a 60 hit with something that we didn't anticipate so with that it's a challenge it's a good problem to have parking where secretary holland's here she's seeing that the demand and what we have we have a lot of different concerns about water qualities things we're working on here it's going to make things a lot better because of the attention and basically the demand from the from the people the citizens of america want something and somewhere to go and something to do and they're finding right here in their backyard this is the best and we're probably closer to a population base than any other park to have this many people within a two to three or four hour drive is unbelievable so that has and then covered but never putting everybody into hibernation for over a year and the pent-up demand is to get out and do something made everything a pro we call perfect storm so let me just say as chairman of the senate energy natural resource committee we worked hard to designate this area along with my co uh my colleagues shelly moore capital center capito it was a joint effort by all our teams and and uh our energy group and our interior group david brooks and his team and we got brian petit and that whole group here that really made this happen they had to put the language to it they had to make sure it fit in the confines and within the code and they did a great job we've made tremendous investments just in the park and preserve in the last year the bipartisan infrastructure bill that we passed that you all know about 1.2 trillion dollars we allocated 3.3 million for repairs and improvements here we had another on appropriations committee we fought for 1.5 million to the new river gorge regional development authority which they were able to do with the trail connectivity to the new river gorge national park and preserve and then on top of that we had the great american outdoors act which would authorize 280 000 to address the deferred maintenance and there's much more coming because we have to be ready to take care of the citizens that will come here i just uh i'm just proud to be part of seeing this come to fruition it's something when you know sometimes it takes years and years and years to get these parks into the system this one was ready to go we kept it preserved basically to continue the tradition and the heritage we have here in west virginia and the people that use this land forever for hunting and hiking we didn't want to disturb that whatsoever and working that into a national park now for the entire nation 330 million people was pretty special so i'm very very pleased and at this time i'm even more pleased to introduce our secretary of interior than the former congresswoman from new mexico uh who's been a dear friend and a dear friend to all of us and definitely to the lands of america secretary deb holland [Applause] thank you all so much it's very nice to be here this morning and first i just um senator manchin i want to acknowledge how wonderful your staff has been the whole the whole trip and it's wonderful that all of you came usually you have one or two staff but they all they're all here and um and so um so i just appreciate all the hard work that all of you do because i know that you serve the public as much as your boss does and and i'm so so grateful to have had the opportunity to spend time with all of you um good morning everyone uh it's such a treat to find ourselves in the outdoors just as springtime is coming into view i can't wait to come back when the trees are green and and i can or in the fall when they're turning again um really happy to spend a second day with chairman manchin thank you so much for the day we had yesterday it seemed like it was a whole week and a day or something because we did so much um but very happy to be hosted again by you and of course chairman we're so grateful to have your leadership on the senate energy and appropriations committees to support the department's efforts to preserve wild and wonderful spaces like the new river gorge right here in west virginia and of course other parks and public lands across the country i often say that i have one of the best jobs in the world and finding myself in new river gorge national park and preserve certainly helps to underscore that as we stand here among one of the oldest rivers on the continent you can feel the rich culture and natural history the 70 000 acres of land really are and actually how they enhance the people of west virginia's lives but as the chairman knows and our amazing national park service staff know with a bounty of a great national park comes a significant set of challenges and work to do aging infrastructure heavily trafficked trails and increased visitation are among some of the issues that our park system are constantly facing new river gorge is expecting even more visitation going forward and that's really wonderful because we want more people out in the outdoors but we absolutely need to be ready so thankfully the department of the interior is hard at work to ensure that this park receives the infrastructure investments it needs so that people can continue to access the parks rugged white water river and its deep spectacular canyons for many years to come as part of this long-term commitment to supporting new river gorge's new statuses national park we're proud that the department is making an estimated 9.2 million dollar investment in the new river gorge and nearby units just this year that is thanks to the bipartisan omnibus bill that the president signed into law early this week that bill also includes an important 1.5 million dollar project that chairman manchin helps secure to connect the national park service trails here with the local trails in the community which will benefit both local residents and visitors alike we're also moving forward on an additional 1.8 million dollar investment to replace the outdated visitor center exhibits at the canyon rim visitor center which when completed will help ensure we're delivering a world-class experience for those who come to this park not just to be in nature but to learn from nature president biden's bipartisan infrastructure law will also help make critical infrastructure investments in the park in addition to historic funding for climate resiliency initiatives a legacy pollution cleanup the law provides for a five-year authorized reauthorization of the federal lands transportation program west virginia is set to receive important funding from this program over the next five years which will help fund planned roads and trails work including 3.3 million dollars to repair canard road here at the river gorge over the next year and thanks to several other funding sources including the national park service's annual budget and the great american outdoors act which i was very proud to support as a member of congress we're set to make major investments in new river gorge that will enhance the visitor experience and protect this gorgeous landscape in partnership with local businesses community groups in the state and local governments we're taking a holistic approach to approaching the investments in new river gorge as we seek to preserve some of the oldest and most diverse ecosystems in the world we're also focused on supporting a robust outdoor recreation economy which creates jobs connects people to nature and helps cultivate the next generation of stewards of this earth i'm so pleased to be here and so appreciative of all the hard work that goes into maintaining a place of unmatched beauty and wonder and so thank you all so much um before i close i just want to acknowledge that our dear friend and colleague don young the long time dean of the house the longest-serving member of the house u.s house of representatives passed away last night and i know that chairman manchin and i both acknowledge that he left a tremendous legacy for the people not only of alaska but of this country if anyone loved the outdoors it definitely was mr young and so i just wanted to acknowledge that that we'll miss our our dear friend thank you if you've ever had heard stories about the yukon don was mayor of fort yukon uh 50 more probably 55 years ago and he moved up there as a young person uh the adventure and the thrill of moving into a wild frontier of alaska and then he became the mayor and then he became one of our first congress people over 50 years he was something he was a force to be dealt with but he was such a kind gentle person big person stature too but just when when secretary holland was going through her nomination process and her confirmation process which goes before the committee that i was chairing so we were so happy and i heard don was going to come and here's don a staunch republican and the country's been separated because politics have gotten so toxic and crazy we're trying to bring people together and showing that we can work together now we didn't know that much about secretary holland at that time we we had much time to to interact before and then i'm thinking she's got to be good if don if don young's coming over she's got to be something special and boy don called that one right he really did and i think that we think so highly of don but basically i know that secretary hall and i both remember that period of time when don gave his gave his testimony of why this lady should be the newest secretary of the interior and for that i'm very very grateful in our thoughts for don right now and his family let me just say we've had a great visit for two days i know that secretary hall is going to spend a little bit more time hopefully in seeing some of the unbelievable sites that we have here but the need that we have she understands and her staff rachel they all understand what we're working with and what we have challenges ahead people are coming they're not slowing down they're going to be coming more and more because it's easy it's accessible it's easy to get here and it's a really good weekend uh usually go to some of the parts you have to plan a big vacation to get out west or do whatever the bigger parks so superintendent acting superintendent reynolds we appreciate you i appreciate your entire staff uh let me say to all the staff of the park you are the window to our state you're the first impression people are going to receive when they come here the greetings that you give them the generosity that you show and basically the west virginia hospitality that we show everybody it stays with them and they'll want to come back they'll go tell their friends and family members and everybody where to come you have to go to west virginia and the more came here they come here the better we're all going to be so i'm just very appreciative for the dedicated staff and all of my staff i appreciate all of you all you know more than you know and i uh i don't tell you enough but i think you hopefully you feel it and anyway uh just a great visit secretary hall and you're welcome back anytime we are going to make you an honorary west virginian and i'll make sure i'll make sure i get that to rachel and rachel make sure that you become have a certificate in good standing thank you all thank you [Applause] all the microphones aren't oh my one's up here okay any questions secretary i'm happy to take some questions if you all have them or if you have enough we're happy for that too sure sure um can you talk about your um if you have had some conversations about um abandoned land mines um repurposing and reclaiming those yeah we sure have and that's secretary that's yesterday was was pretty much all about abandoned mine lines we talk about it all the time we are moving that issue forward billions of dollars um through the bipartisan infrastructure law to make sure that we can reclaim um those lands um i've traveled in appalachia for the last couple months uh we've seen what those reclamation dollars can do turning big coal you know waste heaps into recreational areas folks have replanted native tree grows of native trees in areas that used to be uh cold waste so i am very very proud of the of being able to implement those funds chairman manchin was a staunch staunch supporter of the bipartisan infrastructure law together we're going to get this done uh abandoned mine lands capping those orphan gas wells so that methane doesn't leak into the air anymore it will change the lives of our children thank you let me just say that to to add to that west virginia has done the heavy lifting for over a century and basically we have this country we have now because the energy we produced here but as we transition into another energy cycle if you will and how we're going to provide energy for our our country you can't leave this state behind or any other state that did the heavy lifting so with that we had an awful lot of lands that were basically used for the mining that we extracted for the for the steel that we made and the ships and the guns and and and the factories that we built west virginia has done a heavy lifting there and we appreciate that but now president biden has basically dedicated uh the whole coal field revitalization and we've had a lot of people talk about it for a long time but this is the first time we've ever had money put to revitalizing coal communities because of what they've done he and i've had conversations many of them and when he first got elected i said mr president the problem with many administrations they forget how we got to where we are today as a country he said joe we're not going to leave anybody behind and now we're coming through with that and the secretary's here 11 billion dollars was put in for aml abandoned mine lands those lands need to be put back into productivity and that's what we're trying to do and recreation is a big big economic driver if you will another six billion dollars was put in just to cap orphan well so we prevent the methane from leaking into the atmosphere and causing this greenhouse gas so we're doing everything we can in a bipartisan way to fix uh the things that we know we can thank you everybody okay well i want to thank the secretary too because for her showing the attention she has and knowing how special this is to us west virginia is a special place and uh we have a lot of history here you know we became we were birthed out of the civil war so that was a tremendous division in our country that we had to heal and we have done that and west virginia provided the energy that this country's needed we provided a lot of the hardwood timber that built most of the east coast people don't know that either after 1865 when people were fighting this is one of the major war areas uh of the civil war they saw the tremendous resources we had and so with the natural gas that we had the coal that we had but also the unbelievable hardwood timber force that we had was just unbelievable and to the growth and the birth of america so i'm proud of who we are i hope you are too and i'm proud of those who come here for the first time to see what we have to offer with secretary's help with all of you working together we're going to make it a much more better opportunity bigger parking better places to stay more development and that's what it's all about thank you all god bless

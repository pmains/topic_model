senator stabenow thank you for uh for your new member of the uh environment public works committee former member of the environmental public works recommend it's a workhorse committee it's not a show host committee we work and uh as it turns out we work together and uh one of the witnesses before our committee a couple years ago said these words he said bipartisan solutions are lasting solutions bipartisan solutions are lasting solutions and we need them and this is a great example of of that long before i was a senator i was a sailor actually i was a naval flight officer for many years and in the navy we have a term all hands on deck all hands on deck and this is an all hands on deck moment and we're hearing just a few minutes ago uh of our committee environment public works committee we heard from senator kelly i asked him to give us an update on what's going on in arizona i don't know if you've been following it temperatures 115 degrees not just for one day not just for a week but for week after week fires huge fires that are raging in that it's like a tender box we heard at our committee hearing today about land being lost to uh to the sea in louisiana every day every 100 minutes in louisiana they lose a piece of land the size of a football field to the sea every 100 minutes sea level rise size of football field this is an all hands on deck moment and uh we are working hard as senator sabano i said the legislation we passed out of our committee that's really the foundation that's been used by this bipartisan group to to build on but our part of our legislation provides money for uh for fueling stations hydrogen for hydrogen-powered vehicles that are coming on the markets these days and also for electric private vehicles and a lot of them are coming on the market these days i happen to be a recent purchaser of of of one of those so this is near and dear to my heart but uh that is not the the highest greatest source of carbon emissions in our country these days is our mobile sources our cars trucks and vans and we need to make progress and thanks to the leadership of the auto industry and the two people behind me actually great progress is being made and more will be made with the legislation that's coming together built on our foundation from our committee uh the uh second greatest source of carbon emissions in in our in our country is uh power plants apartments where we places that are developing our electricity and uh we're making progress here we need to make a whole lot more third greatest source of carbon emissions in in our country is uh manufacturing think cement plants and and others but those are the three ones add them all together that's about 75 percent of the carbon emissions in our in our in our uh in our country we need to do more we need to do more in each of those three sectors but we do more than just those three sectors and this is a great example my state we raise a lot of chickens for every person who lives in delaware there's 400 chickens we raise a lot of corn and soybeans most people don't think of delaware as a farm state but we are we also say we have i think more five-star beaches in any state in in america and there's a over development development over development going on on our coast crowning out some of our agriculture we want the farmers to stay on the land we want them to stay on the land continue to farm and one of the great ways to make sure that happens is to develop an economic model we'll now enable the farm and the ag community and the forestry community to improve their economic standing to create greater earn earnings and income for themselves by and stay on the farm stay on the land as and this the great thing about this is this legislation creates that economic model to help incentivize farmers to stay on the land it's like encouraging them to do well by doing good at the same time this is great legislation and it's not the full picture but it's an important part of the picture it isn't all hands on deck uh moment our farmers are foresters they can be a big part of this and with this legislation they'll be incentivized to do just that so i commend you both and thank you and the navy when people do extraordinary things and do them well we say bravo zulu so bravo all right thank you

napolitano of california for five minutes thank you mr chairman and thank you for uh to all our witnesses uh for being here today and i'm very pleased that this hearing includes my h740 hr 745 uh authorizing uh reauthorizing the desalination act of 1996. uh and that program was established as part of public law 104-298 which provided reclamation with the authority to leverage leverage limited federal dollars through partnerships excuse me uh through partnerships with non-federal entities to develop more cost-effective technologically efficient ways to decelerate water truly uh in i would say a decade ago it was prohibitive now it's getting closer to the imported water rates to other uh ways of being able to provide water whether it's not only reused water but tertiary or forced treated water as of last week nearly 40 percent of the nation is experiencing moderate to exceptional drought conditions our demands exceed our supply and they will continue to in the future but as stewards of this resource we must balance the needs of the system whichever way we can even though at this time it may seem out of reach or more expensive in the end we may not have anything else to purchase to meet those needs water recycling conservation efficiencies groundwater management storage where appropriate and desalination are key to developing local water uh to be reclaimed the ability to sustain the west and i mean the west and even some of the other areas is developing of these is really essential they are the key to water abundance desalination is critical for the future of reliable sustainable water supply in western states and as i said sometimes now when mother nature is throwing balls at us and it might be even in the central and eastern states that we're beginning to see this happening some question the role of federal government funding research efforts commissioner connor said it best by investing in alternative water treatment technology research we are working to find ways to stretch the nation's current water supply useless energy through innovative new technology and reduce impacts to our environment the research we are funding has the potential to unlock efficiencies that ensure future water supplies strengthen our economy and create jobs truly if it is public research it might be a different story if it is private research that might not want to share the new technology with fledgling companies that might be able to create the jobs we so desperately need this is no different from reclamation's historic mission of constructing water facilities in the west to create jobs when reclamation was created in the early 1900s the census found there were 15 million people in 17 reclamation states today there are nearly a hundred and five people million people in the west and we need to continue to look at ways to be able to ensure that those areas that are getting uh drought cycles are going to experience more drought cycles are able to learn how to handle uh the ability to survive and to be able to take care of their their manufacturing their ag and their local needs appointments for the legislation will also argue that desalination is expensive technology very true but in reality every other option to create more water is more expensive yet when compared to other options such as traditional water storage built in the real world of today desalination will pencil out as a better alternative mr chairman i'd like to submit for the record letters we've received in support to this legislation and it is for the national reese water resources association the associate california water agencies multi-state salinity coalition water reuse association uh resolute marine energy atlas water systems university of toledo sons of river north carolina state university university the new jersey institute of technology water replenishment district of southern california carollo engineers incorporated in the metropolitan water district of southern california we must continue to provide federal funding to enhance technologies for producing new water for our brackish water the oceans the base in order to combat drought population growth and climate change increasing our desalination efforts will drive down costs and be a powerful engine for economic growth and i urge my colleagues to support this critical program mr chairman i know long beach has done magnificent work they've created new technology so that other people don't have to struggle and they're sharing it and that's what public dollars will do thank you chair now recognizing mr chaffetz for five minutes

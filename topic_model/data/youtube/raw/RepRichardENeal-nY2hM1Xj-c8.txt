Thank You mr. speaker Thank You mr. Laurel so the majority leader said a couple of moments ago that 15 billion dollars was spare change so let me tell you what he apparently means by spare change cutting food assistance for working families and now taking 7 billion dollars from the Children's Health Insurance Program I guess that is spare change the previous speaker just said he was alarmed at the prospect that on the precipice of borrowing that we were now going to cut back on our borrowing capacity as it relates to savings after the same political party borrowed 2.3 trillion dollars over 10 years to pay for a tax cut for people at the top the strongest in America those are the priorities the priority is let's cut taxes for the strongest and the wealthiest and let's pay for it by taking money from people who need it the most in America we've seen time and again they're more focused on the needs of the wealthiest and the well-connected we should be addressing the challenges of the middle class in this session and making sure that they have ample assistance now they're after health care for children now they want to propose seven billion dollars so the health care plan let's be clear their priority as long as I've been in this Congress has been taking care of the strongest and the most powerful at the very top in 2001 January 19th Bill Clinton said goodbye to the country there was a five point six trillion dollar surplus they cut taxes by 1.3 trillion dollars in 201 they cut taxes again by another trillion dollars in 203 so there was 2.3 trillion dollars worth of tax cuts to Wars a million and a half new veterans and the answer to that of course was let's have more tax cuts and that's precisely what they did with their tax cut plan 2.3 trillion dollars borrowed to provide for a tax cut for people at the very top they call themselves conservatives they pronounce that they are disciples of balanced budgets it has been reckless spending that we've watched them embrace time and again and this is but another example of that endeavor

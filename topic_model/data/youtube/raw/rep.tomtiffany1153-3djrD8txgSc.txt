well american foreign policy is in tatters and i think when you look at the past 14 months which it seems like in dog years seven years um joe biden uh was characterized as robert by robert gates who was both bush ii and president obama's secretary of state he said in his book and in all seriousness he said joe biden has never gotten a major foreign policy decision correct in his 40 plus years that he served in the united states congress and that's what we're seeing happen here in america you know i've just been in the congress for a little short of two years vicki and if there's one thing that i found out that you have to pay attention to foreign policy because first of all it's part of our job but even if you don't want to spend a lot of time on foreign policy you have to because it's so important and it's part of what the congress has to deal with and it is simply in tatters here when you look at the withdrawal disastrous withdrawal in afghanistan you look at us weakening ourselves on the world stage by saying we're no longer going to be energy independent the signals were loud and clear to the bad guys around the world that we can take advantage of the united states and that's exactly what's happening what people when i go around and talk to people there's a one question they ask can we survive this for four years it's a damn good question it is because it's not clear that we can so if you look at everything foreign policy wise it all connects to china if you look at afghanistan our failure in afghanistan our failure to secure our own people let alone our own equipment and do that in an orderly fashion resulted in the equipment left behind being sent to sold to china china's very happy by the way to have the the tens and tens of billions of dollars in high-end and high-tech us military equipment if you take a look at the iran deal that joe biden who hates vladimir putin he says so but needs vladimir putin to negotiate so that iran can have nuclear weapons if you look at that that is ticking off saudi arabia what is saudi arabia doing in response they're suggesting to china that maybe we'll take chinese currency in exchange for oil if you look at constantly poking the russian bear in in the form of vladimir putin what is vladimir putin doing he's looking over to china which announced in an alliance with russia on how china can help russia or how russia can help china so you've got all china china china coveted china iran china saudi arabia china afghanistan china russia china our supply chain china our economy china our military security china our inability to handle uh incoming hypersonic weapons it's all related to china fentanyl killing americans china china is it certainly seeks to be the dominant superpower in the world they want to displace us in the 21st century and we're making those decisions right now whether that's going to happen let me give you one more small example of how we're handing it the uh keys the keys to the safe in america to china with all this push towards wind and solar power including these um uh solar and wind farms that are being built including down in the madison area that are going to take away uh take all kinds of productive agricultural farmland out of production which by the way i've introduced a bill to stop that to stop giving them subsidies rich subsidies so that they can pay enormous rent to take farmland out of production remember where those solar panels and wind turbines come from they come from china so what are we trading we're trading intermittent power electrical generation here in america and what are they doing over in china they're building coal plants so their electricity grid is working 24 hours a day that's the kind of trade-offs that are being made with public policy by joe biden here in america and it is really harmful for the long-term health of america

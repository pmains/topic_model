Thank God for dead soldiers. In 2006, protesters from the Westboro Baptist Church traveled the country targeting the funerals of fallen soldiers. That threat triggered lawmakers in Washington State to pass the measure called the Rest in Peace bill in the House That would ban protests within 500 feet of a military funeral In the Senate Mike Hewitt said it was urgent to get that bill passed it kept the protestors at least 500 feet from where the funeral was being held I just don't believe that anybody I don't care who you are Democrat, Republican, liberal, conservative. I don't think people like to see protests that Funerals let alone veteran funerals When those soldiers are blown up when the symbol of America is blown to smithereens. That is God avenging himself Members of the Kansas City Church used angry rhetoric to gain attention for political gain. In the legislature, it came down to the last day of the session Senate Majority Leader Lisa brown and the Democrats made a deal with Republicans to bring the bill to the floor for a vote She and I literally signed a cut-off resolution went to the floor and got it passed on the floor That's what you have to do. Both Mike Hewitt and Senate Majority Leader Lisa brown signed their names to the agreement promising to bring that bill to the floor but instead of passing the bill to protect the funerals of servicemen and women Senator Brown broke that promise once her bill passed she ordered the Senate to adjourn I was not happy about it, obviously. I mean not happy because it was a veterans bill for one thing But when you have a deal with someone you should keep the deal I mean, how could you how can you work with people when you don't trust them? So it was very difficult to work with her You know after that period of time I mean over the years I just learned not to trust Lisa And I when she told me something I didn't know whether I could believe it or not

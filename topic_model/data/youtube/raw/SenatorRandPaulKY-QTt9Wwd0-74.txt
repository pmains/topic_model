mr president the senator for kentucky i ask unanimous consent that the senate proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business with the senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each is there objection without objection president i rise to ask expedited passage of h.r 35 the emmett till anti-lynching act as amended i seek to amend this legislation not because i take it or i take lynching lightly but because i take it seriously and this legislation does not lynching is a tool of terror that claimed the lives of nearly 5 000 americans between 1881 and 1968 but this bill would cheapen the meaning of letching by defining it so broadly as to include a minor bruise or abrasion our nation's history of racial terrorism demands more seriousness from us than that w e b du bois wrote in his autobiography about the 1899 lynching of sam hose in georgia du bois wrote that after the lynching hose's knuckles were viewed on display at a store in mitchell street in atlanta his liver and heart were even presented to the governor of georgia as a souvenir sickening grotesque the images of lynching in 1931 raymond gunn was lynched in maryville missouri the spectacle group drew a crowd of almost 4 000 people including if you can believe it women and their children in the tragedy of lynching the author writes that one woman even held her little girl up so high so she could better see the victim who was quote blazing on the roof sickening and grotesque these images in the summer of 1955 fourteen-year-old emmett till was visiting family in money mississippi when he went to a country store and bought some candy while in there he was accused of flirting with a white woman and for that offense emmett till was kidnapped in the middle of the night and bludgeoned so badly that afterwards his body was unrecognizable he could only be identified by the ring he was wearing after seeing her son's remains his mother insisted on an open casket funeral so the whole world could see what the killers had done to her son we must remember the murders of emmett till raymond gunn sam hose and the thousands of others whose lives were destroyed by the barbarity of the lynch mob but this bill will not do that this bill would expand the meaning of lynching to include any bodily injury including a cut an abrasion or a bruise physical pain illness or any other injury to the body no matter how temporary mr president words have meaning it would be a disgrace for the congress of the united states to declare that a bruise is lynching that an abrasion is lynching that any injury to the body no matter how temporary is on par with the atrocities done to people like emmett till raymond gunn and sam hose who were killed for no reason but because they were black to do that would demean their memory and cheapen the historic and horrific legacy of lynching in our country as congressman amash stated to be clear the bill does not make lynching a new federal hate crime murdering someone on account of their race or conspiring to do so is now illegal under federal law it's already a federal crime and it's already a hate crime he's right we have had federal hate crime statutes for over 50 years and it has been a federal hate crime to murder someone because of their race for over a decade additionally murder is already a crime in 50 states in fact rather than consider a good intentioned but symbolic bill the senate could immediately consider addressing qualified immunity and ending police militarization we can and must do better that is why no one in the senate has been more involved in criminal justice reform than i have no one has introduced more criminal justice reform bills in my time in the senate i have authored or co-sponsored at least 22 unique criminal justice reform bills i am acutely aware of the injustices perpetrated year in and year out in our cities but reform needs to be more than window dressing that is why i'm on the floor today to offer expedited passage pass it today the emmett till anti-lynching bill as amended lynching is a particularly vicious kind of murder and a federal law should treat it as such for these reasons the emmett till anti-lynching act should be adopted with my amendment which would apply the criminal penalties for lynching only and not for other crimes thank you mr president i i have to i mr president i ask unanimous consent that the senate proceed to the immediate consideration of h.r 35 which was received by the house i ask unanimous consent that my amendment at the desk be agreed to the bill as amended be considered read a third time in past and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table

chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas mr. Williams for five minutes which speaker on Monday our commander in chief admitted that in the fight against the Islamic state the u.s. does not have quote a complete strategy it's hard to believe that it has been one year since the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria Isis ISIL or whatever you want to call him began making headlines in American newspapers it's hard to believe that it has been nearly one and a half years since the director of Defense Intelligence Agency told members of the Senate Armed Services Committee that it was quote likely ISIL will attempt to take territory in Iraq and Syria but it goes back even farther in january 2014 the US ambassador to iraq stood the Islamic state is quote capable of taking and holding ground and causing a lot of trouble in November 2013 a State Department official testified before a House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee and specifically cited the ineffectiveness of Iraq's military then Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Iraq and Iran said quote ISIL has benefited from a permissive operating environment due to inherent weaknesses of Iraqi security forces mr. speaker all of these warnings occurred after Iraq's Prime Minister made an appeal to President Obama to help defeat the growing threat to his country now that was two years ago so here we are in jun 2015 the leader of the free world tells an international conference in austria that the United States does not have a complete strategy to defeat an enemy he once called a JV squad well that JV squad is responsible for the horrific murders of American citizens that JV squad has overtaken territory fought so hard for by american troops territory that nearly 4,500 american servicemen and women died to protect in the most violent battles witnessed by u.s. troops since the Vietnam War that JV squad ways black flags while driving stolen military equipment to streets where Americans made the ultimate sacrifice from overlooked red lines to bypass deadlines the Obama administration will serve as a case study in how not to conduct foreign policy for future world leaders today the president wants us to believe that his administration negotiations with Iran and in our Israel in or in Israel's best interests ironically Israel's Prime Minister made a direct appeal the American people expressing the contrary this pad mark past March Prime Minister Netanyahu but to the podium right behind me because he likes so many has lost faith in the abilities of our commander-in-chief and he is right he's right to be skeptical about the State Department's trust above all else policy with Iran whose leaders have publicly proclaimed their desire for Israel to be wiped off the map mr. Netanyahu has rightly question America's once unwavering commitment to his homeland Israel our partner our ally but most important our friend as I've said before for those who do not believe in the United States moral obligation to protect Israel I remind them about the United States Strategic obligation Israel benefits from a secure America just as America benefits and having a secure stable and trustworthy ally in a very volatile and dangerous region of the world the Obama administration's inability to realize this twofold bond between the United States and Israel illustrates their lack of understanding so I suggest to the president and his advisors that if they really want to salvage enough and any remaining trace of foreign policy competence for their history books that they walk away from this deal I urge our present to pause and reflect on America's role in the world Mr Speaker I urge him to reassess our courses of action abroad the President must start by determining what is important for America only then will he be capable of developing a strategy let alone The Right One In God We Trust I yield back the gentleman yields back

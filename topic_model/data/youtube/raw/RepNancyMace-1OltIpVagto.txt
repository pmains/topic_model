i want to bring in south carolina congresswoman and transportation and infrastructure committee member nancy uh mace uh good morning to you and first off your reaction to the news maybe you already knew it before it was released this morning that we looks like we might have an actual bipartisan deal on infrastructure well it'd be great if we did have a bipartisan deal the last time that i checked when the white house said we did have one they backtracked on it for several days after i think that if we're going to have one you'll see it in the next few weeks would i would love nothing more than that but the big question is for me this morning is how are we going to pay for it because some of the reports out there say that this proposal uh would pay for itself and that's just not the case right now so i will be doing a little more research and seeing where they are with how it will be paid for um that's the biggest concern because we want we don't want to see tax hikes paying for art or sculptures or landscaping and infrastructure deal i can i can tell you that much but but at least we're we're back off of two and three trillion dollar talk at least we're down to under a trillion i can't believe i'm saying that but true it's still huge i mean right even at just under a trillion it's still one of the the largest infrastructure packages in our nation's history and it's important that we recognize the senate has done a really good job and i want to recognize senator shelly capote from west virginia and her work to get us to where we are today and it's great to see that there are republican and democrat voices that are coming together infrastructures was the number one committee i wanted to be on i knew that hey if we could work together certainly we could work together for roads and bridges it's taken a long time i i think it's promising but my biggest question is how are we going to pay for it and as long as the money goes to roads and bridges and that's been the biggest problem i want to bring in patrice on woocon to this go ahead patrice oh absolutely well i know congresswoman mace uh you recently had an incident at your home where you know potentially some pro-union pro uh pro-act thugs really try to vandalize your home and i covered it for our sister organization iwv and i just want to find out you know what is the status of you know your your ability to carry a weapon in washington dc i know some of the the local leadership you know oppose that idea you know how are you protecting yourself and what message are you sending to women out there who they themselves whether from political foes or whatever face that same kind of uh personal security threat well i can say this much at the end of 2020 i i got my concealed carry permit for south carolina based on the threats that i was receiving on my life and it wasn't until this vandalism incident in my home where i decided okay now is the time for me to actually use my concealed carry permit and so for me wherever i go in south carolina and i'm allowed to carry i have a firearm on my on my person always carrying and i have to tell you as a mom as a single mom it's one of the most empowering things i have done i've also had an opportunity to teach my kids about gun safety i think that's really important so they're not afraid they know how to handle a firearm if they ever are near one i think those things are really extremely important i am in the process of getting my concealed carry permit for dc i want to make sure i follow all the laws but i'm not going to be put in a position where i can't defend myself and we've seen political violence increasing over the last year to year and a half and i want to make sure that i can defend myself my family and my values and the things that i believe in are you getting pushback though in from some of your colleagues as far as concealed carry because i know that that's been a big topic of discussion on the floor of the house you know that some of these congress people yourself included are saying i want to protect myself after what we saw on january 6th i mean how how what kind of reactions are you getting from your colleagues right well it's interesting the one place where we might have needed a firearm on january 6 was actually in the chamber the one place where we're not allowed to carry when we're on capitol hill i want for me personally i'm going to follow the laws of the district and the capital in washington d.c i want to make sure that number one i'm following all the laws i do believe it's important particularly for public figures and political officials it doesn't matter if you're republican or democrat many of us who are strong voices and outspoken on the things that we believe in we get a lot of death threats and we ought to be able to defend ourselves and protect ourselves wherever we go and i think that's a really important distinction and it's important that one if you're going to have a firearm you're trained on it and you know how to use it but also that we follow the laws and we should be able to carry wherever we go quite frankly okay so what was your reaction last week when the president came out and said that basically all the crime surge that we've seen across the country was about guns i mean i'm just reminding myself here that somebody has to be holding the gun like a criminal but what did you what did you make when the president said that here's the thing in the biden administration because of the increase in violence i believe you're going to see a big push for gun control in this country but let's face it law abiding citizens don't break the law criminals do and so we're going to be creating we're going to be doing these gun control measures for people who are already following the law over the last year and a half we've seen with mental health cases have increased dramatically in our youth and in people that didn't have jobs i mean we've had an enormous enormous uh pressures put us on us and individuals across the country because of cobit 19 the last year and a half and we've got to make sure that whatever laws we are pursuing they make they make sense for so for example congressman tom rice and i sponsored legislation earlier this year did you know that when you have a background check and you're flagged for it the fbi when they're doing additional research they're only allowed to use a fax machine between the federal and local uh and state agencies when they're doing that additional background work like i don't own a fax machine i don't know anybody that does so just some common sense reforms might go a long way here that's unbelievable i'm really sorry about your house by the way and i'm sorry that you've been threatened so much and i know that's part of the job but it's a sad part of the job that you have to do congresswoman nancy mays thank you very much for being here

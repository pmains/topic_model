well joining us tonight Congressman Matt Gaetz a member of the House Judiciary and Armed Services committee's congressman great to have you with us and if I may I'd like to start again with what seems to me to be the absolute essential question to be answered now raised by Lisa Paige in a text to Peter struck and that is POTUS wants to know all that we are doing the talking points for Comey Lisa pate says yes because POTUS wants to know everything we are doing your thoughts on the implications and whether we will get to the bottom of what POTUS did learn what he knew and when he knew it well and of course you're speaking of POTUS Obama Lew what we do know is that there was no collusion no obstruction of justice no wrongdoing by the president that would warrant an impeachment or a removal of any kind but we have not applied that same level of scrutiny to the people who began this utterly ridiculous witch-hunt to begin with and we all know why this began it began because we allowed political dirt opposition research written by someone who the FBI knew to be a liar to masquerade as an intelligence document to function as the basis to fuel an investigation dividing the country for 22 months so we've spent 675 days tens of millions of dollars investigating the president let's now apply that same level of rigor to investigating a process that was broken and by the way Lew this will happen again if we don't fix it if we don't fix the underlying problems with the secret courts and and the surveillance and allowing politics to interfere with investigators then it'll it'll happen again and that would be a terrible thing for our country I think this has been a terrible two years for this president shackled as he was by these false charges this conspiracy against him and I don't think anyone should make any mistake whatsoever about what it was this was an operation by the radical Dems to take down this President to overthrow this president to over the possible - yeah and possibly also to cover up for the real collusion that was happening through the Clinton Foundation where untold sums of money were paid in exchange for influence with the State Department that a lot of bad people hoped would continue in in their world where Hillary Clinton would have been elected president that was the real collusion the DNC the Hillary Clinton campaign now Democrats in Washington today are just going nuts Lou they're going through the stages of grief first you saw denial I mean I think Adam Schiff is still trying to maintain that the Russia collusion story is true when we all know now what you and I have known for quite some time and that it's bogus we see the angry Democrats like Maxine Waters who are still pursuing impeachment and then you just reported on the bargaining process trying to act as though this is still legitimate by making demands on attorney general Barr to produce on a timeline consistent with the Democrats give me a break this entire investigation was in nothing burger and now the American people know who's been telling him the truth and who's been lying to them and the radical Dems the Democratic Party owns this absolutely scurrilous plot against the president 100% and should be held accountable how high do you believe that these treasonous actions by the the radical left in this country the Democratic Party how high do you think they go do they go to President Obama for example well when you look at the text messages between Peter struck and Lisa page they continue to reference the White House so I don't know who in the White House was driving this but I'm sure that it was very senior levels of our government it was people who did not want to see Donald Trump elected president we cannot allow outgoing and administration's to launch investigations into their political enemies because then they're doing what they're they accused Russia of doing they're actually undermining confidence in our democracy by creating this this huge dust storm of suspicion around a president who did not collude with Russia and you know so now you're gonna see the Democrats go to 81 different investigations and probe every element of the president's life same witch-hunt diff broomstick Lu same group of people and the American people shouldn't trust them III have to ask you is this president is his government his administration going to put up with the nonsense that your Democratic colleagues in the house are attempting very quickly at a time they should not do anything that distracts them from the important work they're doing to renegotiate trade deals and Wars cut taxes reduce regulations and reinvigorate an American spirit that is absolutely on the rise that's what I want my president focused on he's focused enough on this bogus Russia witch-hunt yeah and the president just think of everything that he's done I mean he's you ticked off a list that basically he's already accomplished in the first two years and now it looks like health care becomes a priority for the President and for the nation congressman great to have you with us as all thank you

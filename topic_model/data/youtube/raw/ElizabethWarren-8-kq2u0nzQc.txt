when I was 22 years old I had an experience that a lot of women will recognize I had been promised a job for the next year all hired consept ago and then when they realized that I was pregnant the job was given to someone else now this was a long time ago but we know this kind of stuff still happens today sometimes subtly and frankly sometimes not so subtly so I get out and on the campaign trail I tell my story and I've asked other people to tell their stories as well I think that's a good way to fight back and here are some of the stories I've heard hell I'm young and I personally know two women who faced workplace discrimination because they were pregnant I can't imagine 30 years ago it happens believe women when they tell you you're right CeCe and here's one from Amelia I was fired the day after notifying of my pregnancy and I was told it was because quote I wasn't likeable enough I got a lawyer and a settlement good for you interviewing in the third trimester is an experience I wouldn't recommend albeit necessary for many here's one from Kathy my mother hid her pregnancy with me in 1964 for as long as she could until it was too obvious and then they fired pretty standard practice and here's one from JC BC in the early 2000s I was non-tenured faculty was offered a contract for a year after pregnancy as for a reduced workload in order to care for infant and was told no asked for a year of unpaid leave instead and was granted them but was not offered a contract for the following year yeah from EJ this happened to me in 2016 when I was four and a half months and very openly pregnant if you don't believe it could happen to a first-time teacher in 1971 seven years before the Pregnancy Discrimination Act then I have a bridge to sell you yep and here's another this one from Sarah my mom was demoted and then fired from her job when she was pregnant with my sis imme or twins shiri told us that story recently and let me tell you 30 plus years later the pain and anger from that experience was still very raw and real women don't share this stuff willy-nilly so true Sarah here's another one from lady T thank you my mom had to quote quit clothes go at her teaching position each time she became visibly pregnant because it was officially policy official policy back then the 1974 Supreme Court ruling said these policies were an undue burden on women teachers oh here's one from summer my dudes women are still fired or not hired at all basically for just looking like they might one day soon want to become pregnant someone if the UN once told me to my face this was why I didn't get a job I was then single and ten years later I still have no kids I got it summer when I got pregnant for the first time I was excited and told everyone at work in a few weeks later I got a surprise for scible lateral transfer to a less prominent department I'd miscarried that week and in the trauma I didn't make the connection it dawned on me later my mother had to threaten to sue to keep her job when she was pregnant with me her colleagues made a big stink about her asking for maternity leave a second time I was her second kid that was 1989 things haven't improved much for pregnancy discrimination since nadine says 1997 - I was pregnant they knew they couldn't fire me but my boss a woman made every day in living hell to try to make me quit there was not a day she didn't give Milly ate me undermine my position at work so sorry Nadine oh we got so much more but for now I'm gonna quit but please keep sending your stories in it's important to tell these stories this is how we make real change we do it together

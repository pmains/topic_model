bring out al I believe you are designated lawyer for this panel I'm curious when you saw the president's tweet on on Jeff Sessions here this is a terrible situation and Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this rigged witch-hunt right now before continued sustained our country any further Bob Muller is totally conflicted and has 17 angry Democrats that are doing his dirty work our disgrace to us a first of all did you think he was tiptoeing to obstruction of justice here when I when I read that tweet I went back and looked back at the article so impeachment for Richard Nixon and they were all based none of what none of it was based on breaking into a DNC headquarters was all about obstruction of justice a lying or misleading - lying or misleading to investigators it had to do with trying to intimidate those into Justice Department of the FBI CIA from participating in this trying to get those into position so Authority in the justice system to support his point of view and that that was the crux of the Klint of the Nixon impeachment now you look at these tweets there's no doubt in my mind that Mueller has one prosecutor doing nothing but looking at these weeds looking where that red line is and see how many times they may have stepped over the obstruction boundary

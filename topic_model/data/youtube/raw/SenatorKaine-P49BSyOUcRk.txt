a normal first speech for a senator is usually a proactive forward-looking speech we're not in normal times and the effects that this sequester will have on the country and the effects that it will have on my Commonwealth are so significant and severe that I do feel compelled to speak a little earlier than I otherwise might have well that was the new senator from Virginia Tim Kaine giving his first floor speech and he did it this week and he focused on how the sequester will hurt Virginia sign of the times breaking from the traditional upbeat speech that most new senators want to make when they're first time on the floor so joining me now is Senator Tim Kaine good morning to you sir morning Chuck I'm why shouldn't I we look at the actions of everybody in Washington this week more so than the words while the words of all the lawmakers and the president said sequester bad this is horrible no good thing that should happen the actions when you observe there was no serious negotiations no serious attempt at stopping this no serious back door shuttle diplomacy actions seem to indicate that the parties are quietly okay with this going in I don't get it well I think people Chuck I think people should look at the actions and that and they should condemn the actions or frankly the inaction I don't think the parties are okay going into it there are some members and maybe members of both parties in both houses were okay but but largely that's not the case it's it's the the gridlock that we have here the unwillingness to compromise people staying in their corners that has become a real hallmark of Congress the last few years and so now real people are starting to feel the effects i did a tour around virginia last week and went you know face-to-face with all kinds of people who are feeling effects in their own communities and so we've got to stay at the table and try to find a solution in the in the in the days ahead when it's sequester so bad in your mind that you would be willing to replace it with cuts only basically break from the president and say you know what I this sequester has done so poorly if we can't get mitch mcconnell john cornyn because of their own political reasons to support any deal that includes taxes fine here's a replacement cuts only version well well chuck a cuts only plan I think hurts the economy and hurts hurts defense and hurts other key priorities take a look at what other countries are experiencing who are going with the cuts only approach and you will see that there is a strong likelihood that that would make our economy worse so I really believe you know use the Virginia example that was embraced successfully by Governor Bob McDonnell less than a week ago if you want to do something positive for the economy in this case it was on transportation embrace a balanced approach that deals that that helps the economy in this case by using new revenue and finding savings and I do think that that is the right step forward to protect core priorities like defense in the economy while also credibly reducing the deficit so all right what's going to happen going forward so are we going to have an attempt to do cuts only to just turn off the sequester for this year and then negotiate tax reform and see if there's new revenues out of that so Chuck as you know being new I I'm still kind of trying to discern what's what's kabuki and what's actual up here but let me tell you what I think is going to happen I started to see this week with the pending votes yesterday an awful lot of bipartisan discussion beginning in the Senate and in a funny way I really agree with Speaker Boehner you know he used colorful language but the only way we'll get a bipartisan deal to replace sequester with a more comprehensive approach to deal with our deficit and grow our economy is it's got to start in the Senate and so this week whether it was in committee hearings or behind closed door sessions there started to be a lot of ferment and discussion between bipartisan groups of senators about what we can do to basically replace the gimmickry of sequester and continuing resolutions and get back on the ramp of the river annual budgeting and you know we're writing our fy2014 budget and we've even put our paychecks on the line if we don't have it off the floor by the 15th to September so we got to kind of build a bridge between where we are today and this normal budgeting process and that discussion is hot and heavy right now I want to ask you about a little Virginia politics bill Bolling and sent out an email the republican lieutenant governor basically looking for to see if there's public support out there for an independent bid do you think he would be a serious challenge to defeat both Ken Cuccinelli and terri mcculloch and the governor shut Chuck as you know I mean I'm a terry mcauliffe friend and supporter but I will say this bill Bolling is a good guy and he'd be formidable he was elected to the Hanover County Board of Supervisors which is near Richmond the year before i got elected a Richmond City Council he got elected in 93 and I got elected 94 and we sort of come up through local and then state politics working together you know he was he was my lieutenant governor when I was governor he would be a formidable candidate you know he has to decide you have to fit through a kind of a narrow keyhole to run an independent race that's successful he's going to have to make that decision I'm a strong supporter of Terry McAuliffe but you know bill has an interesting path ahead as he tries to make that decision all right Tim Kaine new democratic senator from Virginia the former governor of course of the state of Virginia thanks for coming on sir that

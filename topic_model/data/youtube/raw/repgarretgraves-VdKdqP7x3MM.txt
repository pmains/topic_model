mr chairman i've heard from a lot of constituents over the the past several weeks about aviation and i've heard a lot of concerns about congestion at the airports the inability to get through security i've heard a lot about higher energy prices and how those are influencing higher ticket costs which puts aviation travel out of reach for many of the constituents that we represent the impact of the labor shortage that is resulting in cancelled routes or cancelled flights and the the adverse impact that that's having on families and of course things like new entrants into the aviation space like advanced air mobility or drones and how those might be able to help improve convenience mr chairman today we're here to talk about aviation sectors efforts to reduce emissions or to address address climate change and some of the efforts that have been undertaken by both airports and by airport stakeholders and airport operators the aviation industry new technologies and and it's interesting because not too long ago the committee had a hearing on noise pollution and in that discussion we talked about how uh in in recent years we have seen extraordinary reductions or great strides in in reducing noise pollution as a result of aircraft as a result of new engine technology and as a result of quieter aviation systems in fact we talked then about advanced air mobility and and drones and how those are going to transform our skies both from an emissions perspective as well as continuing to move in a direction of lower noise or noise pollution however despite the fact that everyone was pretty excited about the rewrite of part 23 the faa uh inexplicably has come in and decided that instead of using that much celebrated rewrite as using it for the uh the the the process by which we will be uh certifying advanced air mobility or drones um instead they've they've come in and totally reversed course that they've opted instead to do everything in their power to get in their way and instead to certify aircraft these am vehicles as special class aircraft baffling to me there's no safety justification for the certification it's just bureaucracy getting in the way of results there are plenty of safety items uh with aam that need to be worked through things that we need to be addressing um thinking things like operations pilot training fire suppression aircraft security integration into airspace and much more but the faa and industry now have to spend their time on paperwork exercises and trying to cut through bureaucracy as they push schedules or timelines to the right i'd love to be talking about new technologies and how we're going to be able to use innovation and advanced technologies to reduce both pollution as well as noise but unfortunately i think we're going to be continuing to talk about the bureaucracy that the faa has created and in this drone situation and i think likely in many other situations moving forward returning to the topic today of emissions and mitigation and reduction at u.s airports i want to build off the notion already laid on the table that progress is often achieved is most often achieved when government gets out of the way and fosters collaboration with industry and itself aircraft engines are a great example of the collaboration by working with industry each successive generation of passenger aircraft and turbine engine has grown more and more efficient as more americans affordably and safety take to the skies total emissions in the aviation industry have remained relatively static and we're going to hear today from airports like pittsburgh airport that's designed their own micro grid um the first one in the world as a matter of fact reducing emissions improving resiliency and taking advantage of local resources looking at numbers aircraft accounted for nine percent aircraft accounted for nine percent of u.s transportation sectors carbon emissions and approximately three percent of all emissions overall in 2018. airport operations are estimated to account for less than two percent of the aviation sector's total carbon emissions and internationally the civil aviation sector accounts for approximately 1.3 percent of global uh carbon emissions and it's estimated the secretary can sector's contribution will increase in the coming decades it's a great news story but it shouldn't be lost on anyone that the united states is the global leader in reducing emissions and in improving efficiency but it's important to note mr chair that for every one ton of emissions we've reduced in the united states that china has increased by four even under their commitments in the paris accords what right now is emitting greater than the united states european union japan south korea and whichever other countries they're going to increase another 50 percent between now and 2030. that's a move in the wrong direction and i want to remind you mr chair that with as we're seeing with ukaine right now countries like russia china and others do not care about international norms international commitments they're differing opinions in the room on this issue but i think we can agree that making smart and targeted investments in resiliency and aligning our policies accordingly or no regrets moves we should be doubling and tripling down the successful policies that are helping to improve the resilience of airports and resilience of our environment i look forward to hearing from our witnesses on how congress can help airports do just that

the Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committee Democratic senator Tim Kaine of Virginia senator Kaine always good to have you on we just had your colleagues got Senator Tom cotton on a few minutes ago he has very serious concerns about these so-called side deals between Iran and the IAEA do share those concerns Willy that's why we have this review process I co-authored the bill with Senator corker actually senator cotton voted against it but this gives Congress 60 days to review we're going to have this hearing with the secretaries today we're going to get access to those particular provisions and then we're going to have a separate hearing next week on the inspections regime itself not with administration witnesses but with experts will have the ability to dig into it that's what the 60-day review period is for it's not unusual there's a there's a hundred and eighty nations that are signatories to the NPT the non-proliferation treaty and the IAEA has agreements with virtually all of them and some of the components of the agreements with member nations the IAEA holds in confidence but they have high credibility remember the IAEA was right about Iraq and the status of their WMD program in the United States was wrong in the early 2000 so they have high credibility but we'll dig into the deals and and that's all part of the question to determine whether the inspection regime is sufficient senator what was the bill that you and Senator sponsored that Senator cotton voted against what was that bill senator corker and I wrote and introduced with two other co-authors the bill that has given Congress the 60-day review period remember the statute that existed before we passed it in April gave the president the unilateral ability to suspend congressional sanctions to waive or suspend them and so we said hold on a second we don't think that's the right thing to do so we wrote the bill that gives Congress both houses this 60-day review period and the ability to weigh in before the president takes any action with respect to the congressional sanctions that passed the Senate 98 to one senator cotton was the only senator who voted against it we we did that in a bipartisan way we're now in this review period his what was the son of the Cotton's reasoning I'm not exactly sure I think he he might have felt that the review process wasn't sufficient or that it should be a treaty that would take a two-thirds vote in the Senate but the reason we didn't do that is because first this is not a deal that rises to the international level of a treaty and second if you said it was a treaty you would cut out the house and remember the congressional sanctions that are at the core of this deal they weren't just put in place by the Senate they were put in place by the house as well so this is a deal that now gets reviewed for 60 days and both houses have to weigh in on it get to weigh in on it before there is going to be relief given under the congressional sanctions statute senator Kaine good morning Harold Ford according to steer press reports secretary Kerry has indicated that regardless of what Congress decides that the economic and military sanctions against the Iranians will collapse do you believe that if these side deals is there quoted in the paper or turn out to be true that that indeed that might help resurrect the economic and military sanctions from the international community if the Congress decides that vote down this deal in the next 60 days Harold that's it that's a good question think once the international community has signaled that they they accept this deal and I want to talk about why the deal is a positive for the first 15 years but then questions that I have but once they signaled an acceptance of it if Congress is but no we don't like the deal and we start to part ways with the international community I think virtually everybody believes the sanction the effectiveness of the sanctions the ability to hold all the community together starts to erode it may not collapse but I think it will be very difficult to hold the international community together on this once they've signaled that they think this deal is sufficient if Congress votes no because again the side deals with the IAEA are what the IAEA does with all member nations that are part of the NPT they negotiate how they're going to inspect and some of that they hold in confidence but the good news is Congress is going to get to dig into it that's what the 60-day review it is for senator Tim Kaine thank you very much good to have you on the show love you Jen and Bill Kristol thank you both as well I think we might have agreed on something we did dance it was a good show me

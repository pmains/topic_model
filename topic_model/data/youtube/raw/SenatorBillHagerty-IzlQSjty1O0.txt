i helped write and pass the affordable care act i fought to strengthen and modernize medicare you voted against a ban on partial birth abortion why we may not always agree on where to go but i think we can find some common ground president biden's pick for health secretary facing an uphill battle as conservatives oppose his confirmation critics say javier becerra is an extremist with a far-left agenda who isn't qualified for the health department tennessee senator bill hagerty one of many lawmakers asking biden to withdraw the nomination he joins us now senator thanks for being here before we get into this let's go over becerra's some of his far left decisions supports medicare for all sued president trump at least 107 times as california ag has controversial opinions on abortion said illegal immigration should be decriminalized and visited fidel castro in the 1990s oh and by the way he has no health care experience senator why did biden think he's the best person for the job you know a time when we're facing a pandemic here in america when americans have serious personal health care needs and biden is calling for unity in his inaugural address this is absolutely the wrong direction to go he's taken an abject partisan someone with zero healthcare experience someone that does not have the ability to mount the type of pandemic response we need right now and a person who has beliefs that are contrary to so many americans he would take away the private health care of 160 americans 160 million americans i'm sorry and push us into a medicare for all type of system he sued the little sisters of the poor this person is an abject partisan and not fit to run hhs okay so critics will say though that some of you don't necessarily like or agree with his stances on certain issues so that's why you're coming out citing lack of experience in health care what do you say to that argument well i think it's completely legitimate when we don't agree with his positions as well as his lack of experience it just makes it even worse and all the more damning he's taking positions that are contrary certainly to the citizens of tennessee whom i represent and we're at a point in time where we really need to be focused on this pandemic getting shots in people's arms getting our kids back to school getting our parents back to work not harping on radical partisan politics at a time like this yeah the retort often is well alex azar wasn't a doctor well the resort to that is he was a pretty big wig pretty big big wig in the pharmaceutical industry which as you know is so much of medicine i want to get your thoughts on this you are pressing joe biden on the remain in mexico roll back warning it will endanger communities we know this is going to really stretch border communities and their resources to the max but you say it's also going to really hurt towns let's say in the middle of the country middle america why well you think about it my my home state of tennessee we've got 30 000 migrants at the border right now that's more than the population of bristol tennessee it's going to be easier now to get across the border from mexico and the united states than it is to get a beer at a honky tonk in downtown nashville they're inviting these immigrants to come in we're going to see a tremendous increase in drug trafficking we're going to see an increase in human trafficking and we're going to see these people caught and released into our communities here in the united states how are they going to ensure that these people get to their hearings how are they going to test them are they going to inoculate them are they going to give them work permits there's so many unanswered questions all right so let's talk about part of president biden's immigration plan is uh to spend money to give money to central america we can go ahead and pull up on the screen here the 4 billion plan to address migration from central america this includes increasing assistance to el salvador guatemala and honduras establishing processing centers to register for refugee resettlement reinstitutes the central american miners program to reunite children with u.s relatives creates a program to unite families with approved family sponsorship petitions what is your reaction to this my reaction to that is that he's created this enormous invitation to come to america at a time when he's sending money to these countries that probably will very well misuse it they've not done a good job in the past with those funds i doubt those funds will get to the intended sources instead that will just enrich governments there at the same time he's got an open border policy here that's going to be a gross invitation to come into our country at a time when we're trying to fight a pandemic we've got over 10 million americans out of work right now these people are going to come across the border make it harder for them to get back into the economy well his administration says they're planning to spend this money to reduce endemic corruption violence and poverty in the region there number one do you think that's going to happen number two how is that going to then benefit us well the first point they raise is endemic corruption you're going to give them money how are you going to go to make sure that that money is well spent how are you going to make certain that corruption doesn't invade and divert those funds right away i think the best policy would be to maintain the diplomatic success that we had with the migrant protection protocols from the point that we implemented them in may of 2019 until today we've reduced illegal immigration by 75 percent that's made our nation safer it stopped drug trafficking it stopped the import of of humans that are being abused and it's allowed us to have a much more rational policy when these people get in only 1.5 percent of them actually qualify for asylum who are claiming it that means over 95 98 of the people that arrive here are going to ultimately fail how are we going to ensure that they're deported the biden administration hasn't answered me on that are we going to ensure that they're tested for coronavirus are we going to vaccinate them before our own citizens and are we going to give them work permits to commit to to compete against americans right here in america at a time we're trying to work our way through one of the deepest recessions we've encountered a lot of questions there certainly senator bill hagerty come back and visit us again we really appreciate your insight this morning

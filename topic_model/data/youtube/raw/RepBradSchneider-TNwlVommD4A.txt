excited to work with the offices of congressman brad schneider congresswoman jan Schakowsky and senator tammy duckworth I'm also really relieved that there's a lot even people here today because our revert is starting to get kind of swollen so anything goes wrong I expect you all to rush out there and ethics in place thank you let's get started with the program today and if there's anything you need from us please let us know or we're happy to help thank you all for being here today good morning those are really bright lights welcome thank you for coming here humming first start with a couple brighter thank yous I want to thank the library for opening a facility to us and this is just one of many occasions where they have graciously and wonderfully open up the library or what we're doing so I want to thank them throw anything thank you very much I want to thank my colleagues the team from Senator Ford's office colleague Genachowski and her team and my team who worked on putting this all together and really putting a lot of work on it I am sure they're out there I would recognize if I could see you but I know as I've been around the district all week and I thought you folks are coming and so I'm glad we can we can do this the federal grants are a important part of how we fund many of the things that people around our district around our country rely on and I'm proud to be able to help my team and our team aid will help facilitate that week before last to have a chance to go out to the Round Lake fire department and got to see like the data might burn and receive the grant do a couple of things one of the more significant you might not realize how about how significant is the exhaust removal systems basically sort of a hose that you see hanging down fire departments in the base that when a truck comes in they've even put it on to the exhaust system and when a truck leaves it drives out and trying to leave the building it automatically releases but that's significant because it substantially reduces the amount of fumes of exhaust that are our firefighters and first responders are taking in and you think over the course of a week a year career that's significant they're already fighting enough issues taking care of us we need to help them because they don't have to deal with an emergency reduce that we mitigate impact very fascinating system work but this is just example one of many examples where we were able to help getting the grant award in fact with a billion dollars awarded his term just in the 10th district I leaped into target about that just some other examples as we you know 2.3 million for a homeless assistant program across the district also the Lake County Housing Authority was awarded two hundred twenty three thousand and Waukegan Housing Authority fifty one thousand the Hellfire service coordinators working with the Chicago Botanic Gardens we've secured a number of events over the years there's a wide variety but it is in these partnerships that make a difference this is today you didn't tell me to release me so I'm just going to get to say thank you for joining us thanks to the library thanks to my colleagues for working and turn over to ginger I'm really excited about this turnout especially pretty crummy weather or maybe people are going to still be coming in but this is so important some of you may be very familiar with with federal grants but some of you may not and so we're going to have a lot of different agencies that are talking about how we can bring more money to your mystic ality to whatever your local government agency is and we absolutely want to help do that I'd so welcome everybody it's a great pleasure for me to be able to partner with Fred Schneider my colleague that's not the district I represent the knight medical district i'm jan Schakowsky and then also we have Tamid of course represents the whole state of Illinois and so I wanted to tell you some of the things that we can do to help obviously we can write letters of support if you find something that you want to apply for but that's not the only thing that we can do if you apply there federal grants and let's say you don't receive it this year we can talk to the agency and have them walk you through your application application so that you know exactly how you fell short so that you can improve on that if you're having a hard time dealing with an agency we can make phone calls and clear things up if you want to talk about potential funding sources we're happy to try and find the additional eight the agencies that might be there to help you Angemon spouse Keith who helped to put this event together I like to call my buddy man he's willing to scour the available grants that are appropriate for your area of government and we're so happy to to do that and so you know let's it's time to get started and I want to begin by introducing the Regional Administrator for for FEMA and that is for region 5 administrator for the Federal Emergency Management Agency is James Joseph mr. Joseph was appointed to this role in November of 2017 he has over 15 years of Emergency Management leadership experience some of you may know him because prior to serving in this role he was the director of the Illinois Emergency Management Agency and deputy state Homeland Security Advisor since 2015 so I want to welcome where oh there you are I want to welcome James Joseph Regional Administrator for FEMA thank you so much this is just one of the many services we provided people well good morning Thank You congressman should ask you for that wonderful introduction I want to thank Senator Duckworth team congressman Schneider Schakowsky and the team for having me here today we were talking a little bit about homecoming if you will because going back to my days as a County emergency management director I had the opportunity to work with Senator Duckworth of her team when she was in the 8th congressional on a number of homeland security and emergency management issues and page down me also with the state working with congresswoman Schakowsky congressman Schneider on a variety of issues kind of Schakowsky was very gracious to me when I was out in DC a couple of years ago and congressman Schneider and I became very close friends during the major flooding in Lake County just last year so thank you for having me it's also a homecoming for another reason because as I strolled through Northbrook I drove by my old junior high school field mill school right there it was great to be back up in the northern suburbs and in this area you're going to hear from a lot of our feeblest a for a couple of our FEMA staff throughout the day today talking about a variety of grants that we have assistance to firefighters ransom for mitigation grants and if there's any state Homeland Security grant questions we have our state partners here from Illinois Emergency Management Agency to talk to about that but on a daily basis more than just being out in the field on a disaster where at one point more than I think 60 70 percent of my regional team here in Chicago were the point the disasters around this country more than that were here in the community always talking in events like this with our state with our County and with our municipal partners about a variety of grant programs that we have that can help make you and your departments more responsive more more able to be used to respond to situation but as well most importantly to help your citizens recover from a disaster whether it's man-made or natural it occurs and the the three key elements of our FEMA strategic plan that was just rolled out by our administrator just a few months ago that's going to carry us into the next four to five years is there's three key elements that you'll hear our staff talk about throughout the entire day today and one of the key elements is is building a culture of preparedness not just within our within our government entities but also throughout the entire community building a culture of preparedness for our citizens number two we want to really prepare this nation for catastrophic disasters of events we saw any one of the hurricanes that happened in 2017 hurricane Harvey ernamaria on their own they could have been a catastrophic event let alone a chain of events within several weeks as well as the wildfires on top of that so truly reading this nation for catastrophic disasters and the third thing that we want to focus on the Gila Gator we'll talk about is reducing the complexity of FEMA and I know a lot of you guys are saying FEMA's not complex there's no complexity within your grant programs but absolutely there is whatever we can do to reduce that whether it's policies that we can change if there's legislation that we need to reduce we'll work with our weather legislators our congressional delegation to make that happen but it's very important that we're here to talk to you to engage with you and just let the congresswoman said if you're not sure how to be successful in your application well we can't write that for you with absolutely no problem sitting down with you the time and how what bold application could have been more successful and provide that technical assistance to you as well so thank you all for having here my team is here they'll be with you throughout the day [Applause] all right Thank You administrator Joseph good morning everybody my name is Dan the Commandant's I'm the grant specialist and senior outreach coordinator for senator tammy duckworth no thanks for coming out here this way and take part in this workshop we're really excited to have partners from federal state and local levels to you know talk about the resources that are available to communities I know the senator wishes she could be here but with her arrival of her psychic daughter she's not a bit of a bridge returning to leave right now look wanted me to pass along her best to everybody we're gonna have here for out your route this summer and broke the set up meetings a lot of Mayors and managers here hopefully we'll have some new grant projects to update around at that time also a thank you to representative Schneider Schakowsky for being here in person to put on this wonderful event your staff really great to work with in getting this together there's public programming notes and we'll get started our first batch of presenters on your agenda from the US Army Corps of Engineers all the way through the Lake County storm water management commission they're all gonna be talking about flooding we're going to hold questions and answers for it until after those presentations are done with it after that each presenter will do a short Q&A all the trying to moderate keep us on pace because we need to turn this room back over to the next workshop it's taking place this afternoon but with that other way I'm excited to introduce our first panelist Jeff Zurcher is the assistant chief programs and project management for the US Army Corps based out of the Chicago office I'll let you take over thank you thanks Dan good morning everyone so I get the pleasure of starting off as the only agency that doesn't actually do grants we do cost shares but we do have some programs that are available to you to partake in and you want to get you aware of all those programs that are available so just a quick introduction of the Chicago district we served at nine nine different counties six in Northeast - in Northwest Indiana a little bit of another portion there in the port we have over 5,000 square miles that we cover and we serve 9.1 million people our Civil Works mission areas include flood risk management coastal Risk Management navigation ecosystem restoration our regulatory branch we have a technical and planning assistance we also work in emergency management and we have people that are in our overseas contingency operations and international and interagency and international services program as well so we have some authorities that we can access they can help you out specifically we have congressionally authorized authorities and these are actual studies or projects that are authorized by Congress these include general investigation and a general investigation typically turns into what we consider a construction general project through congressional authorization Congress has also seen fit to give us some delegated authorities and these are authorities that we have that they said go ahead and go out and do these projects when you find it they're worth investing in these are called are continuing authorities for our foot kind of program and we'll get a little bit more into that later on in my presentation this also includes the Great Lakes fishery and ecosystem restoration program hi my name is sample of that as well but to go along with that we also have a technical assistance programs and these are really great for people that don't know exactly what they need we can come in and give you actual technical assistance one of them is our flood pain management studies and in others our planning assistance the states we come in and the floodplain management studies give you give you money straight up in terms of we will come in and do all the work and our cost planning assistance to the state is more of a program we car share 5050 we look at some of these problems that could be going on in communities and hopefully come up with some future actions that we can go into so our delegated authorities here's a summary of all the kaepa Thora's that we actually have available to us that you can come to us and i'll get into exactly the process you go through to come to us deep to access these but these really include a wide range of actions that we can take yeah emergency streambank of short protection and coastal storm damage reduction small navigation projects mitigation of damages caused by federal structures than a dis reduce of drezz material flood damage reduction which a lot of you probably interested in it also probably some interest in our aquatic ecosystem restoration clearing and snagging and then modifications for improvement of the environment all of these have a local cost share with them so how do you get into these programs how do you get started with us and basically well all we ask of you is that you send us a letter of intent you contact us our contact information at the end of this presentation it says of letter in texting that you're interested in this program you'd like to see us come out and work with you on doing one of these types of projects then we will go into what's considered a federal interest determination we determine whether there's an interest on the federal government to participate with you and that gets our approval at our division level once we are approved to have a federal interest in your project we will assign a feasibility cost-sharing agreement with you this is where you bring money to the table at 35 percent or 25 percent whatever the cost share is the public government kicks into the rest then we get into our feasibility study and our environmental assessment this is where we actually do the study we actually figure out what the solution to your issue could be and and what we would propose to build out of that then we sign after that after we have concluded that study you sign a project partner agreement again this is a cost-sharing agreement between you and the federal government and this defines what the federal non-federal contribution will be one of the great things with our contributions is it doesn't all have to be cash it can be work in common so you don't have to bring cash to the table automatically you can do work that will assist us in our studies and that can count towards your 35 percent or 25 percent contribution so we define our long term operation meanness responsibilities as well at this time there's basically at the end of all of our products we turn them over to you to operate and maintain then we go into our design and construction we have a great team of engineers and our office that work really hard to design a project you work with you as part of the team we invite you to all of our team meetings and you and you come in and you help us design the solutions of the project your input then as I mentioned before operation maintenance all that is turned over to you as a local entity to operate and maintain for the future so some of our projects that we've worked on this is a small flood damage reduction project is capped section 205 it's for Steve Levy we discovered this levy back in 2013 in the April flood this lovely was previously at not known to have been there but it was in in a fourth preserved land it had been severely degraded over many years and it flooded out this entire area that you can see on the map over there basically because there was some low points in life but we've gone and we've done a study and we're partnering with Metropolitan Recreation District to look at this and we're going to rebuild the entire levy to protect that community I'm sure and you can see the federal process about 3.8 million dollars in a non-pro to process of just over two million dollars technical assistance program that I mentioned this earlier is 100% federal to the state there's a limited funding nationwide so if you want to get in on this if you have to get your applications in and really push for the funding to get to you but we do general technical service we help develop interpret site-specific data obstructions to flood flows flood formation timing what depths and stages flood water velocities extent duration we do general planning assistance as well 120 delineation flood warning studies etc then are planning to the decisions of the states that I mentioned earlier as well this is a 50-50 posture with working kind or cash we're working with some partners in Lake County right now to get one of these picked off I'm having part and basically we take a look at comprehensive plans with element use and conservation of water and created land resources a typical pas study can include flood damage reduction assessments flood inundation mapping the EM safety water supply water quality and several other areas we also have one final program that like to highlight this is our environmental infrastructure program this is our authorized by section 219 in Florida 1992 right now this is only authorized for Cook County Illinois and Calumet region in Indiana but this is a 7525 cost share with federal and non-federal it allows us to provide technical planning designing instructions and not federal interests but environment that are for infrastructure needs this includes your water treatment water storage sewer pipes blood blood removal pipes and storage and distribution facilities this is a great program it is not it's not have a lot of funding to it but we can come in and we can help you out with small projects around a million dollars or less and really gets you working on researcher these are some examples of some of the stuff that we've worked on in Indiana and the just show you some of the projects that they do they do on the streets and all the water infrastructure they were able to do so there's a federal natural response to provide the land by capture it working coming pull this harmless as usual and you accept ownership with the very I know that this is time is short but here's my contact information and passes on thanks very much Joe our next presenter is Morgan of olive edge the mitigation grant specialist from my name is Morgan Holloway I am a government officer and I work closely with the state of Illinois I knew my hazard mitigation grants so we have three different venation grants at FEMA show of America free disaster and one of them is post disaster the two pre-disaster ones are pre-disaster mitigation and flood mitigation assistance so PDF and FMA the flood mitigation assistance grant is solely based on blood projects but on the destination grants are all hazards that we do so same with the HIV GP which is your post disaster grant program that you do once you get a decoration it's open statewide so even if southern Illinois extech for cutting or whatever mitigation is open to the whole state based on the state's priorities are willing to do that in the state of Illinois I think that always done that they had more than enough funds to share statewide so that's wonderful and all of our grants pretty much have the same eligibility we you just have to make the case that it's mitigation and will pretty much consider funding it it does have to be possible official because a FEMA benefit cost analysis that you have to run and it does have to meet 1.04 hires which prove that we are spending our money wisely and we'll work with you either me or the state cuts of mitigation officer Sam although should I feel he'll work with you on your grant application as well and it's similar to pretty much any grant program you'll see there is a cost share 75 percent of it is funded by FEMA and 25 percent has to be a kind of the real cost share I have seen everywhere the community provides either cash or in-kind as their crusher to a resident will take 25 percent less of asking price with our home in order to participate in the connect program to the DNR has provided in non-federal National Archives so there are options out there if you're concerned that your community does not have the funds to provide sequester builders need to work with either me or Sam all the shy of the Statehouse mitigation officer in order to see what's available to you the most projects that we see for flooding in the state of Illinois are acquisitions or elevations above the base flood elevation we have seen some floodwalls detention basins color upgrades things like that but we do also mitigate all hazards so we'll do you know tornado safe rooms or seismic retrofit but like I said it does have to be a mitigation so I would not coming in for a grant to build a new library for your community but if you do want to build earth you are building a library and you want to retrofit a portion of the library to be a tornado safe room then that would be an eligible project for but I resent the main focus of this is for flooding so we do a lot of our next presenter is harmony Illinois Emergency Management Agency she's the general general counsel native Jennifer Johnson [Applause] good morning the bad news is I even doesn't have any money of its own to administer for blood projects but the good news for you is that we administer on behalf of the state the Fela and so my team uh serves as really the pass-through entity and then I eva is the entity that for the paperwork standpoint actually has a contractual relationship with the sub recipients in the grant agreement so who they're really the go-between for local governments and felix so all your questions really come through the state we're the ones ultimately that get you reimbursed so work it went over the rank programs and again the state administers all three types of grant programs both the hazard mitigation grant program which is the post disaster program and that one is a little bit different than PDM and the FMA progress and a really critical piece of information to be eligible for PD M and F of a grades you need to have a FEMA approved hazard mitigation plan in place so if you don't if your jurisdiction does not have a plan or if you're not include if you're a municipality and you're not included in the county plan the first step would be to make sure to get a plan and if your jurisdiction is not up of funding for a plan luckily the PDM program not only provides funding for minute flood mitigation projects it also provides funding for a planning grant so again that would really be a prerequisite before you eligible to apply for a project grant so this slide gives you snapshot and I know it's it's difficult to see it again 102 counties in Illinois labeled on dairy but the green indicates of those counties that have an approved plan in place right now and after it's approved it is good for five years and then the other colors indicate various stages that those counties are in in having plans and some counties have decided against having an approved plan again the northeast part of the state which I assume most of you are from is good shape with with the greens that with lemons are covered by an active of mitigation plan that you would be eligible to apply for mitigation projects so far and away the most common type of project that Illinois has administered my funds are acquisition contracts and those projects really involve residents businesses that flood frequently they're in a floodplain and it's worth it just to buy out those properties and turn it into green space and perpetuity and again the grant agreement is with ìiím us to make that happen now to apply for any of these grants the PMMA grants and perhaps administrator joseph can tell us when the application period will open this year I know last year it was all time period and those applications gets that'd chew any musk and ievo compiles all the projects and submits one big application of all proposed Illinois projects and it is a competitive grant process so there are a lot of meritorious projects that there just simply isn't enough funding you can try again but since 1993 Illinois has provided master's funding to acquire approximately 4,000 properties throughout the state there are deed restrictions then that are put on the property so they stay of green space in perpetuity and that way there's no more blood considerations for the next disaster not only to those individual residents but also to local governments and the burden of response recovery efforts you know for those for those structures that continue to play these programs acquisition burns are completely voluntary also so if there is a street or subdivision neighborhood that the local government would like to include an application and then there is a hold out against those neighbors then the project can continue and you know there would just be one structure that remains so this isn't like eminent domain it doesn't force anyone out but it does provide the pre-flood appraised value to the homeowner who chooses to participate just recently through the PDF program FEMA awarded grants for flood walls along the stretch of the Illinois north central Illinois and this is really exciting and a new project that item is just on the front end of administering and these floodwalls will serve to protect really critical infrastructure that's along the Illinois River including I think a water treatment plant there's a sanitary system along the river I mean it's been it will alleviate a lot of the need for sandbagging that is taking place time and time again as the Illinois River floods this time of year so if we are literally in the process of issuing the sub grant agreements to the recipients this week in Miami so we're excited to get started on this there's some contact information against Sam as Morgan mention is the state present medication officer on IV West team and there's some too Sam or me anytime and we're happy to assist you [Applause] Thank You Jennifer so now we've heard from the state and we're gonna bring up the county so from the Cook County Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management we've got Jean Ryan G planning for everybody like I said my name's Jean right kind of homeland security emergency management occurred I don't push ahead I'm the chief of planning for the part that's come out today talk about what mitigation talk about that's what here to talk about is our esmad mitigation by nightfall college the school the prior baby seats just before me gave some good examples and updates what the plans are they talk about the fellow is stable kind of touchy today and how we're trying to help our mr. feller but talk about our heads mitigation plan our plans a little bit different back that made a multi-jurisdictional I think that's a big point of your world and it will help us all in fact if you look at the size of the footprint that we're responsible to do I have one or two counties where the largest population about 5.2 490 we have forty percent or as mentioned at the northeast part of the state is pretty much represented in this room today 70 percent of the state population is in our borders seventy percent that 40 percent of the seventy percent is in the forests of account so that basically means that in the ninth out the nine hundred forty six square miles we have that forty percent of population represents we have more individuals the boards of cook kind in 28 of the states between the United States so you can see that's what I wanted to think about going with a multi-jurisdictional type of plan vacation plans for those that are familiar very effective that we better become more resilient helping to recognize what your risk is understand the impacts the type of change you can make long for in short the Lord will every fall the most important thing is all to get together so over 114 of the disabilities have gotten together we represent the unincorporated area 231 townships and put this plan together that's the key to all this well you won one our can only be the fighter you want to talk about what's the best way for us to recognize impacted intact cause so when you look at the situation you look at the community above you below you Animal Sciences you actually do take that ripple effect on them and so on and so more importantly we should extend on that stand if I take this action how's it going back to discuss this we also talked about what kind of funding sources can we share what kind of resources a lot of team in this room a lot of talent as a talent on this state we should be working to go with with these plans together fair that's the best way to protect our communities moving forward and doing that so I'll sit back you look at where the Ganges it whilst concerned about to help us meet that challenge most people identify the really that would be floods and again this is all along your natural disaster type of situations you flood tornado severe weather including too little mother as well as damage Lubbock fellers we were in a perfect example which I was involved with the mitigation that were just took place we never cry here we appreciate your guys definitely awkward homes with their port view project those folks were the first time is if we responded there explain to us it looked like this phenomena they weren't even aware the fact that I'm able to flood point almost where the live people described it in that gave away they saw a small little lake home towards it these people want up I'm talking about 268 homes are in fact about seven feet of water the ones that are homes for the first time so feminist information sharing work with the different agency come together is all one big irony while we were able to rescue them we turn to the back a little bit to the back of the space or figure out how to protect them going from the federal level to water reclamation is one of your clinic partners coming together as a county yes we got a Discover credit because it was processed that's where I'll make sure that its agents they complete their challenge for us as we will bind as we talked about the edges were identified again tornado all the ones report every seems to focus on playable she's the most prominent one always worry one it kind of makes sense especially before new statistics the theme of manage feels at 70 square miles commuters within ago County 100-year floodplain about nine square miles is within a 500-foot point which makes sense that we have 172 water courses that are going through our planning area through the indiscernible so you look at all of that basically it says well he percent economy located at 100 point every understand been impacted again I've been this business six years worth of Kolkata Homeland Security I've been to five major floods within those six years just getting to do more and more proper back of River reading flooding is one thing you also have to be thinking about urban play but it takes places while these agencies to come together everybody come into a room talk to one another state one of your challenges with these different teams that 80% just to give you perspective seems like it's such a small number when you look at that that means that about 70 square miles beneath that so the population that's in that footprint all by itself thousand people can in fact on a regular basis so it's a huge challenge all kind of faces trying to partner together make a difference we have great assistance coming from the carla agencies as well as the state agencies a couple examples yes it's necessary to have an agency as was mentioned like many other people prior to the 2000s aster mitigation act very much stated through staff amendment in order to get access to these different grant funds that are being shared with us and being provided for us that were mentioned you can't have it unless you have Hazard Mitigation plan and again we're recommending they get a multi-jurisdictional identification because basic let's just be honest more and more we're seeing more and more disasters taking place and the funding sources much as Congress and everybody tries to get that for us there are challenges in a piece of the pie is getting smaller regular basis so soon you recognize it the suti start to really together so as you start working together as a team the better your chances are going to be trying to achieve it see if you guys mitigation plan they get multi-jurisdictional you're bringing teams to go reason being basically it's competitive you've got to be able to show there are the biggest targets at the point you got to show that you're gonna have a regional impact it's going to help lord of one community but then it makes it easier for FEMA naivet everybody else doesn't make your particular grant what's been most impact for everybody region where she needed that as far as the pre-disaster mitigation grants and the plug mitigation grant we've been very fortunate we've had a couple success I'll share with you real quick the actual development of the current multi-jurisdictional plan came from the hesitation that granthia without their affordable provide offender will help us work with 114 disabilities along with the 30-month township and putting their plan together what a recommendation is also part of our planning team as well they have an annex under they represent as well again I'm going to put up a link for you to share you could view our planning one time you can see the pros and cons you can see all the different projects positive that are happening there's probably I think it's about eighteen hundreds lot of success as far as us doing our homeland security management we use the first grant to get there funny to get a better belt and back in 2014 that's where we've been forever acknowledged about exploding aging aircraft goals we are one more agency it's working for especially an incorporated area we represented in their plan we've had a number of homes have been it typically would cut its rate well it gives those people so relieved as well as deaf community get one point six million dollars in order to do so credit right now there's about eight homes or the process about 30 days to being blown out which has been agree to help the situation instead of having a one-time pick we're buying sandbags we're bringing flood palms over material to deal with particularly that they buy through this buyout process making their open space we reduced the issue of the problem going on for yours a little bit for basically also I want to show they all sense with their particular plan the work the gutter between FEMA ie maha's water reclamation some of the other kind of agency the Department of the original under grants being mentioned being the hub grant was referred to as a community black tank grant is just a resilience so with darkman we're able to do 7525 a seminar we're able to justify because of some oversight so now to hope these communities at Marino we're able to park up with our local county agencies got together with their funding it's legal to allow the use that funding they have just this particular community same turn into it economic development which has much more funding it's kinda the same ones bridge the weeks another regionally just hoping that's what a success that these grants the advice we've got a few my mean with help us go through this process to achieve this so if you're not move you contact us from County says they as far as we're going forward the previous litigation grant we have to put in for FEMA's ask the more clarification the justification being submitted tables language they're from because we vote this in 2014 no required every five years by September 2019 we have to rewrite an update again so we asked what that funding to be able to hire again better to help through that process again with follow these different agencies so please go back shortly energizing again so again my contact information link web server available to just a couple things we're doing why it's important to make sure you're where the edification planning funds available to help you support reduce the risk your activities removes nation more resilient eliminates the impact of future events provide long term solutions going to be talked about they can provide sandbags a big there's a shortage of the process but keep your mind on keep continuing on there's always cascading effects almost sandbags once the news turning verses you get me to doing elevating the Saudis are changing ordinances you got to make sure that their cost-effectiveness been explained already damaged Gino's really informative really excited to use our next presenter from the Bekaa calls and Water Reclamation District Afrikaner the an engineering journalist morning and very thrilled participate in this event just a handful size [Music] it's really terrible surprise I started this leg I like to thank senator dr. Cosby planning this the first line just shows all the storm water projects we have in the works throughout the county so there's a little bit of a plug in there there's bats outside if anybody's interested in looking at what's going on throughout the county what our information district look at independent government agency formed in 1889 to deal with wastewater from primarily in 2004 what a Reclamation District was given in stormwater management Authority and that was interpreted to be over bank flooding and stream next equalization so since 2004 that were good for the projects that whatever information district worked on and in 2014 seeing the misery seeing the intensified storms we went back to the state legislature and was given authority to work on locals flooding I think that project that effort has been very successful we worked very closely with the county with the state so the phase one projects were the only projects we had Authority until 2014 to work out there are currently 27 what we consider phase one overbank loving street makes people that they shouldn't I project the Phase two shelter ready projects I'll discuss it in more detail phase two preliminary engineering I have the number of projects the number structures protected or both liquor rule from the floodplain the cost construction cost and the leveraged funds how much NW are deeper so we have a phase two program for shovel-ready projects preliminary engineering projects green infrastructure and it's been mentioned a few times today of flexeril property acquisition one one project specifically in River Site lon the cost of the flood wall and the other mitigation without the order of thirty three million dollars to protect thirteen million dollars worth of homes that were repetitive damage so moving forward property acquisition and hopefully that will have a great effect on the general area that's in perpetuity not to be developed so our program right now I hope many of you are familiar with it we want to in the second quarter go out with a request for what are your green infrastructure projects fifty applications were received in 2017 in the third quarter what fled from property acquisitions would you like us to consider and Phase two local stormwater projects there the call and 24th in 2017 the request went out I think in December of 2017 and the applications were due in February and we're going to our board of commissioners this Thursday May 17 requesting that we move forward quite a few of the shovel-ready projects and social ready projects are projects that have been designed or are nearly fully designed by the municipality or the local government and we enter into an intergovernmental agreement for cost share hopefully in June we'll go with the what people just report flooding then we if we see how many the projects are all prioritized and we hire the engineering consultant to design to do preliminary engineering to see what the engineer solution is that and have a preliminary cost us today so for the phase two shovel-ready that we are going to our board for authority to after intergovernmental agreements I just want to highlight that one I don't mean to the village of Lincoln what it's requesting new storm sewers and out falls into the North Shore channel stormwater outfalls and that project is to protect 551 structures and the cost is estimated right now at three point seven five million dollars that's a tremendous program project and we like to see that at the model for selected separation and working with a lot of Reclamation District water information district chose to build the deep tunnel in Lewis separation so convened and our staff and internal debate well we can't separate so where's we can't pay for that we paid we've got all those federal dollars and we built the deep toe and the reservoirs and that's our solution and know I think our weather is getting so much more severe and so much more intense we have to be open minded and realize that people that are right near the waterway we need to selectively separate and protect unknown thousands of homes that are along the system so working with the communities I think together we have a much better chance at taking the edge off of this flooding misery so whatever I already went through this I think we really want to get into the discussion we were also asking the board to take out two engineering consulting firms and one's going to focus on their combined sewer area and the other is going to focus on the separate sewer area and these program managers are going to help us prioritize better prioritize we had when in 2014 our annual budget or stormwater management projects was twenty million dollars a year for all of Cook County working with our elected officials were covered by nine elected officials presidents parabolas they have taken the political will and more ramping up the program to 100 million dollars a year and we really want to leverage those funds and make sure we build more projects and become a resilient economy and alleviate flooding all together that's that's our goal and I just I include Joe Kratz my name's Katherine Connor in the director of engineering Joan cran sir is the managing civil engineer in charge of stormwater management and we're all here to help and we're thrilled to work with the county with the Army Corps of Engineers and with you Thank You Katherine our last flooding presenter is from the Lake County storm water management commission and then broke through uh questions for all of the plugins under that so let me introduce Mike Warner that director we got a little nervous river rising outside and we walked down the stairs you know auditorium it was mentioned last few presenters ago in July of 2017 the college of Lake County auditorium looks very similar to this and I've got a picture of the water that's about this high so we got a bad in July but move on slides great also with me is Sharon after me she's our grant program manager so I watched it management board is number one item is our small grant program for projects typically less than a hundred thousand dollars our cert program stormwater infrastructure we consider a medium project program between 100 and a million dollars one hundred thousand million our watershed excuse me our wetland restoration plan is a fee in the program for flatland impacts and number four is all the grants many of the grant projects or programs that we heard of this morning it's for our medium to large projects and SMC staff typically does not seek federal or state grant programs for small projects great so what do we use our running for mitigate flooding number one usually I'm a multiple parcel or neighborhood level as a most of main step projects unlike MWR be in I would ask or just it might end up the $100,000,000 love to work with you typically all of our stormwater does get to Cook County in some form so I did attend the Buffalo Creek Reservoir expansion robbery last week so that's exciting water quality improvements are embedded in all the project work we do and many times are the driver of the projects as far as funding goes with a flood mitigation is a secondary kind of it and I can't underestimate public education it was mentioned about urban flooding the homeowners need to be able to address their own water problems and be aware of how they did the service water issues I can't solve you know somebody's downspout problem when it drains into their basement so people need to get educated on how to do some of those things themselves for the SFC managed projects we really unfortunately never been funded to build self-sufficiently it's a curse at times and blessing in some ways how necessity became good at building partnerships to achieve success with our projects so we hear a lot about shared services but it's a current buzzword right I would have to say that we've always operated and shared service environment I see another key area of our business growth so to speak if you will is working with HOAs we've heard it in two ways or kind of like new small government units that are creating you know around the county Lake County is over 1300 ad and a funding source to fix dozens of drainage problems the last item and this is it's project management is essential to develop skill and we thrust this at all times in our interview process and training in so back up to the watershed management board projects in 2018 we funded 22 projects for 1.6 million in total costs and which used approximately $200,000 in SMC planning just to comment on this if you are familiar with the watershed management board and keep the process very transparent and it's discussed at length with the applicants we want a project to be successful so reflexes as more of us as as anyone and we start early and work with an applicant from the submitted process to the end of construction so as I spoke before in almost every application of SMC program planning we use a 50/50 cost shared relationship no offers of mantre turndown cash in kind word any funding source that's all good as we're not double counting SMC money our stormwater infrastructure fund this program is added as a new funding source in 2008 it's funded 29 projects with the total costs of 720 million and using a hundred and twenty thousand in SMC money originally is creatively resolved ranked three tile failures across the common but it's evolved into a small strong letter capital improvement plan so we had all kinds of drink tile failures that would just pop up in here and a lot of times the flooding would be a half mile away and people would know the source until we check utility installation this age of the and we had to go in and find just through Emergency Management essentially for small area yeah eventually we created our wetland restoration fund each of our four major watersheds as its own mitigation fee sort of got Lake Michigan Northbridge desplaines and box there feed the difference in fees reflects land prices and localized construction costs in those watersheds for example in Lake Michigan the fee is 145 thousand per acre and this is for isolated wetland impacts so Army Corps uses their programs to creative education requirements for waters in us would probably isolated wetlands we do this ourselves we currently have about 250 thousand dollars in our lake anyhow for Lake Michigan for the level one we don't know participate 11 think coming online and Lake Michigan water shift so building location ourselves so I'm writing a grant application whatever grant source we apply for matching our project scope funding criteria is a number one goal adjusting a project scope to match what the grant criteria is a skill so we done this many times we redeem what medication benefits from a water quality basin so north appear in the Skokie river we've got two examples headwaters projects we've got a base in there with water quality and also resolves flooding issues and we were trained its district to build a giant channel restoration project it also encompasses four things going so our federal state grants SFC prepares for larger grants ahead of cycle and no 319 water quality we do countywide request for proposals we bundled projects so SMC acting as a project manager this has been very successful process where we ask people for what their projects are it is a group of projects and it becomes as much here's the middle to the granting source we applied for the grants and then the individual projects become the sub-grantees and and we will step in and manage it grants covering construction it necessary or just being a financial agent for the sub-grantee if they're capable of handling that themselves so for example my house this is our one of our most successful mitigation tool if house isn't there it's not going to flood no matter how much it rains 100 year flood thousand year flood biblical flood houses flooding so we don't have to worry about how much storage to try to build the buyouts are going assumption is we're going to need 25% more Comanche chief I can imagine that it can't be blessed ties and if we can bundle that funding packages we go into the grant cycle we can manage it as we go along and if we can save money then that saves money and we can thank our money the SMC funds for a future grants and middle shares are expert on our buyouts over the years us for about the last 20 years we've got about 15 grants all right yeah we've got about seventeen point five million dollars and we've got 12 million 599 and I think four million globally I could touch anything the library is interested in a flood proofing grant for this structure here these are the people to talk to all right all right thank you Mike I know it sounds like our Department of Justice really you could get started to keep taking over our computer and I promise we will get you guys to take questions for all our flooding panelists right now I know we just turtle up locked so open to FEMA through this arm bar of any Mountain Lake Donny any questions out there [Music] right so educational institutions may be eligible sub applicants for some of our grant programs I would recommend talking to Stan all the child the state has made each officer double check if they meet the criteria additionally with baby willing to come in under County they wouldn't had to have participated in that local hazard mitigation plan that mr. Ryan spoke about earlier so if they didn't participate in it it's all about fit or have their own customization but that is a criteria for all of FEMA so the link coming would be the sub applicant for it's possible yeah it is possible thank you give any other additional questions I would recommend starting the township it sounds like this particular case says some issues there well okay so let's talk about that you have to work that is not my area of expertise but it depends on what area you're in where you go like honey I can get back to you look after that why don't you give me your contact information of any additional bloody questions I don't know so homer is not an eligible applicant program programs they would have to go to their community so I would start at the city level and uh neighborhood name to come if my question isn't answered but just to follow up I'm from a park district or art projects are a little bit more a smaller scale so these federal granting larger so we would be a sub applicant we would have to be working with local our local municipality or County to apply for the larger grant so the well answer her FEMA and I think it's probably the same for all a county so we do work with SSP projects and two of the programs also bubble projects into large into larger grants with several projects to qualify Harry it doesn't have to be a whole new we're going if you have we do see a lot of checkerboarding you do need somewhere like one home on this side of town has flooded home and another side of town flooded so doesn't necessarily actually the whole neighborhood it would need to be a flood prone structure you'd have to have damages from flooding in order to make it cost beneficial it is more cost beneficial if the structure is located within the special flood hazard area that hundred year flood plain that you're speaking about earlier but that is not necessarily a requirement just the benefit cost and this is a requirement it's also important to where the fact that there's a truth list that sent to us recognized because of reports of damage to printed as well as should be part of the National Flood Insurance Program if you're not able to participate with any case we're working with one community the individuals a welcome reason that I guess is because the cost of flood insurance going up to revoke it is one of it you thought they could no longer pay for those costs no more or the chairman said it was theirs mortals the opposite drop instruments but I'll find us we then had this qualifying for the biology to participate that's actually only your apartment here in the litigation resistance track so there are the other two grant programs that we can work with you guys possibly nothing here all right thank you very much I know we're gonna have more questions that will come up next few weeks so duck all the presenter information is going to be emailed to you as well as all the presentations I think it's a good time for us to move on to the infrastructure and transportation a portion of the workshop we've got Melissa Porter who is the chief of staff the Chicago metropolitan agency for planning or cement if you could not work with cement in the past you are in luck for that they are a great resource for all miss valleys [Music] just a quick outline for today I'll give you a little history on CMAP and our role in the metropolitan planning organization and then I'll focus on transportation funding opportunities and other funds and least depending your family I'm gonna make a pitch for up to 2050 which is our nice long range plan it's going to be out this summer and so CIX long-term planning role is rooted in a rich history in Chicago beginning with Daniel Berger planned in 1909 which was one of the first city their first urban plans that without their following in 1924 Cook County was the first County to create a growth plan and in doing this they went out in common traffic pedestrians started thinking more globally about engineering moving on to 1956 the Chicago area Transportation Study was created and this is a joint planning effort between Cook County and the city moving on beyond that and the federal program it started to get a stronger there was a desire or local voices to still continue to beaver and that eventually progressed into the creation of Metropolitan Planning help bridge the gap between the local governments state better finally in 1913 up high the generals definitely created see map to help create their tough period the MPO function and also to absorb the land-use planning agency which was formerly known as nipsey so that we would be responsible for comprehensive planning for the region this is the map of our region this is our current planning area to represent seven counties 284 municipalities and about 8.5 million residents the census dictates what our planning area is so with 2020 seventies well 2020 census will be paying attention to so there's going to be any revisions to this area so what does see map do in very broad strokes we help make people's lives in the region better we've got three main ways that we do this the first one is I already mentioned is that we created long-range regional plan the way that we do that is we collect data we start to look at trends the analyzed demographics we go out in Jeanne's residents and talk to them about issues that are affecting that and we take all of that information and we think about what the our current situation is and think about what we need to do now so that we can have a future that we want anymore and right now is 32 years out so we're looking at 2050 so our goals to develop recommendations for actions that people can take today and make sure that they'll have good quality of life in the future so well the majority of our funding is focused on transportation and leonie's issues we also have state responsibilities for doing planning so we cover ancillary issues such as economic development housing water supply stormy weather issues environmental and natural resource issues as well we've got a ton of information on our website but our strategy papers policy update snapshots beta issues we have data that's publicly available that you could use for your own purposes so I'd encourage you to go visit our website that's want to dig into any of these issues any further another way that we help make people's life better is that we work with communities to help them meet their needs and the temple that I'm here lists our local technical assistance program this program is created in 2010 it was funded initially with the grant from HUD and it was a program that was created to provide assistance to municipalities for planning so for example as the municipality wanted to create a comprehensive plan or a downtown plan or think about how to improve a particular corridor they get assistance and updating zoning ordinances or help with doing stormwater analysis this program was intended to help them with that so as soon as the program was created we've initiated over 200 projects last call typically we do the Fen an annual basis but this year we're delaying the culprit projects and until later this fall probably in early September the reason that we're doing that is because we were finalized and are on for 2050 recommendation month be able to take the priorities that are going to come out of that plan and the projects of the work with municipalities early on to push simpler regional recommendations down to local level the types of projects that we select are dependent on the funding sources available right now programs largely funded with our beautified work program funding so all the projects are funded that need to be tied to transportation issues but we've also been funded by private foundations Community Foundation prevents the funding through counties see DVD programs work on stormwater issues and we're continually seeking other sources of funding so that we can have the broadest range of eligibility for projects as part of this program so stay tuned the projects are those earlier this fall if you haven't already I'm gonna make a plug before we've got a weekly email that goes out the talks about big events that are going on and see Matt but we also to advertise events that are throughout the region from a planning perspective so I urge you to sign up for our weekly email another way that we help the region is by making sure the federal transportation that other flows for its projects and we also help guide transportation investments so how do we do this the first way is by maintaining the federally required Transportation Improvement Program and what this is is any projects that reduce federal having trust fund balance must be in the Transportation Improvement Program or what we call a tip and it's basically a database of projects listed by the project phase funding source in the air the database itself is required to cover a four-year period so many projects that will be billed within that four year period although her tip covers two years additional on top of that two main components within the tip or that cement needs to make sure that any projects that are in there are financially constraining and that means that we've got a limit on money that's available within that four year window spent on a project so we need to make sure that any projects in the database there's money to cover it and that's what the project can be both the second component is that all the projects that are in the tip must not violate air quality standards so we have to do an analysis of those projects to make sure that are built we will stay in conformity with the Clean Air Act and finally the tip it also has to comport with our long-range transportation plan which again I mentioned that's our unto 2050 plan that we're going to be adopting this fall there are a few programs where FEMA gets to have a say on how the money is spent and I'll run you through those pretty quickly the first one is the congestion mitigation and air quality improvement program and we got about 105 million dollars a year for that program we've also got the Transportation Alternatives program be unified work program and the cement program is pressure College abilities are set at federal law and this program is intended to fund projects that are going to improve air quality the money that's available for this program has to be spent within the region or it has to be spent where the air quality issues exist in order to mitigate them we typically do a call the projects over two years and the next call the projects going to be coming up in January 20 we've got an internal project selection committee that would use the compliance with the requirements and we also do a staff analysis of project and write those recommendations then for our project selection committee once they're approved for this project selection committee they ultimately go to our cement board in Department of Health I don't have a slide on the tap program again that's the transportation alternatives program and that's largely focused on piping facilities and it's another program that's competitively awarded criteria for approval for that program grows upon completing a regional amazing trails plan that's heard of it you also have to be able to show that there's a market for biking wherever you want to build this project and the favorite projects that are ready to go surface transportation program this program is a little more complicated than the other two that I mentioned in 1992 the state Regents development methodology for calculation of the funding amount it's week that's required to be spent within the region and so after the state takes this percentage up the top and it does what it needs to do the fund projects in other urban areas they need to multiplication and figure out what our allotment in is and this usually equals about 18.9 2% of the total pot from the state that ends up coming to the region last fall we prevent the program and I'll talk about that in a minute but under the old program the funds were some allocated to counties of the cities based on the formula and then those bones are further sub allocated based on the population to each Council of Governments the council then had different means for allocating their patience for together projects the funding that this money because as DP bonus could be used for it's kind of broad flexibility it can be used on a lot of different projects that are listed up here as you'll see there's about more than 50% goes to resurfacing and reconstruction projects to make sure that we're complying with all the federal requirements in our last certification and 2014 the federal government criticized the way that we had been some allocating money under the STP program and told us that we needed to revamp it and be forward they said that they wanted a instead of just having a straight some allocation to different councils to focus more on funding project right the best benefits being done priorities and this is what we call performance based programming so last year we were able to reach an agreement with the city and the Council of Mayors to improve the STP program just a few highlights of the program the new program or the reached agreement to create a new shared fund that would be programmed based on a project selection committee we're currently in the process of developing criteria for selection of those projects right now but again you're trying to be in that the programming criteria that one day only device and private many projects that will be put into the shared fund have to have support of the Council of carbon developing a program management process so it was happening before is that a lot of projects that were funded with STP dollars they were languishing and they were taking up that space in the tip and other projects when England funded the projects were moving forward so we're coming up with the process right now to make sure that we have a process for dealing the projects that are delayed to figure out how to move them into outer yours so the projects that are more ready to go this perturbation is dreaming together earth come together I also agreed to add additional seven million dollars to the pod which was super helpful that was way and he changes in the program programs the only thing I'm gonna mention under this too is that we also committed to doing a pavement management project and right now I got as responsible for assessing the pavement conditions of the federal roads and I got funded growers and there's a gap in data up is taken out city of the counties to to work with a contractor together about the condition of pyramid and then also we're just doing the early phases of that and our goal is to get a hundred percent to be able to get a project the process continues to move forward the trainee you just wanted to talk again about our on to 2050 plan again it's gonna be up for public comment this June and it'll be open until August 14th we're gonna have a series of open houses or will be that we'll be doing around the region they want to talk to the public about what's in the plan itself and we're super excited about that so I encourage you all to participate in the process of the ten of the open houses you can't we've also got our launch event scheduled for October 10 that's going to take place at Millennium Park we've got Terrance Anthony who's the executive director for the National League of Cities who's going to be our keynote speaker so you're all committed to that as well this is our project timeline that just shows you it's good about a three year process about this fall and the you guys might have also heard of our previous bands called Kochi 2040 so the end of 2015

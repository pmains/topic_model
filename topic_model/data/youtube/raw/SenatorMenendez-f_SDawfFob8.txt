thank you dr clark uh good morning everybody it's good to be here in newark in the center of the salud in the newark uh so i'm thrilled to be here with dr clark who has welcomed us on many occasions to promote the health care of our people and i'm here particularly when we are celebrating national community health centers day which is the day that we recognize the federally qualified health centers los centro ferales qualificado de salud the federally qualified health centers of our nation which delivers high quality health care to the people who need it most in our communities and it is an all taker system you have insurance you're welcome you don't have insurance you're welcome you're on medicare you're welcome you don't have status you're welcome it is in one institution that says to everybody our doors are open and we deliver high quality health care so i appreciate dr clark's leadership i appreciate the chief medical officer and what he does with all of the people at the center when i am asked in my 30 years in congress what's one of your biggest achievements it is the creation of federally qualified health centers in our state and my advocacy for them so that they will be paid the same as any other medical entity so that they can continue to provide those services that we created under the affordable care act which some people call obamacare i accept that because obama did care millions more have health insurance as a result of the law that we pass so that is part of what we are doing and celebrating today but i wanted to especially come dr clark because this weekend some of you may have seen the news in the united states senate we passed major legislation that later this week will be passed by the house of representatives and sent to president biden for his signature what's that law going to do it is the inflation reduction act it's going to help control prices so that our families don't get squeezed it's going to take care of seniors in our state and in our nation 1.6 million seniors are going to see reduced costs of prescription drugs and because of the provision in the law that i wrote there will be a cap out-of-pocket cap for all seniors in our country they will not have to spend you know some of them spend eight nine ten thousand dollars on prescription drug that's going to be capped at two thousand dollars for the first time in history and if they need time to get to that amount they will have a smoothing period that i wrote so they don't have to pay it all at once this is going to be in addition to that prices will be negotiated under medicare with the prescription drug companies that means we get lower prices for prescription drugs and as i saw with my mother in the twilight of her life my mother came to this country in search of freedom she worked in the factories of hudson county as a seamstress in the twilight of her life she faced a terrible disease in alzheimer's and she had a very large prescription drug cost no senior in our country should ever have to choose between putting food on the table keeping their home and having access to life-saving life-enhancing drugs and this law is going to make sure that that never happens again and that's one of the great things that we did the other the great thing that we did is if you're on medicare and you're diabetic and you have insulin needs insulin can cost a hundred or more dollars a month this caps it at 35 dollars a third of what that cost was and it does it forever so no senior on who has a need for insulin will have to worry about that and for all families we increase the subsidies under the affordable care act under obamacare for the next three years that will mean that the average new jersey family who is on health care under the affordable care act will save about six thousand five hundred dollars a year so those are some of the big health care provisions but what else did we do under the law we are you know how it's so hot and we're seeing things get hotter and we see wildfires in the west and we see flooding in kentucky and we saw our own superstorm sandy and hurricane ida well these are all because of changing weather panic plant patterns climate change we make the biggest investment in reducing climate emissions by 40 percent by 2030 only eight years away so we can ultimately have weather that's normal not abnormal and that we can ultimately breathe cleaner air because one of the provisions of the law that will pass later this week in the house and signed by the president we live in the port district here in newark and elizabeth i just came from elizabeth before the port is a great economic engine but it's also a great polluter and so as the doctors can tell you if you're polluting if you have emissions you're breathing that in which is why we have more respiratory illnesses than other parts of the nation this provision specifically sends money for environmental justice particularly at courts to change that dynamic so we are breathing cleaner air and our children are breathing cleaner air and that's so important so that's just one of the many provisions we're going to save money on health care save money for seniors on prescription drugs have cleaner environment and create nine million great jobs in our country and so that's what this law does that's why i'm so enthused to come celebrate with you because of what you do every day but what you will be able to do even more as a result of this now very briefly i'm going to try to do that in spanish i'm going to synthesize it and i'm not going to uh maximize it like mcdonald's

chairman and thank you to commander marshall and the leadership of dav for your strong testimony here today and a quick shout out to anyone from new hampshire dav who may be watching thanks for all that you do i wanted to bring up the issue of pfas contamination as we think about the honoring our pact act i know that i have a air force base in my district pease that has seen significant contamination from the a triple f where pfas has got into the groundwater and into the environment it has made individuals sick so as we think about the risks of pfas which are widely accepted nationwide in terms of health studies we have no way of connecting everyone who may have been exposed not just on the base in my district but hundreds of others across the country and around the world and we need to be providing them with the information that they need about these health impacts so i've introduced legislation the pfas registry act it's included in the honoring our pact act it directs va to establish a health registry for current or past members of the armed forces who may have been exposed to pfas so i heard you reference health registries earlier i'm wondering uh commander if you think that veterans would benefit from a centralized registry where they could access health information research updates other resources specifically as it pertains to pfas you know the va's health records uh you can walk in any va facility and they can instantly bring up your health record you cannot do that in private facilities but that is an important issue with dav and i will ask mr marshalleck our service director to respond to that further thank you commander and a great question they certainly can benefit from a registry the more we can do to be proactive in reaching out to these these veterans who who were exposed to these contaminants the better off we're going to be and the more information we can provide them about those exposures and what illnesses may be associated with them the more educated they're going to be about them so creating a registry would be is a great idea

I join the distinguished leader of the Committee on health education labor and welfare and opposing Senate joint resolution 36 and to support the National Labor Relations Board rule that would very simply modernize the process that workers use to decide whether they want to form a union and right from the start let's be very clear about what is at stake here it is a rule that the National Labor Relations Board has formulated pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act set by the Congress of the United States after comment that was solicited from all the relevant stakeholders and people who would be affected by it and they are rules that are long overdue because of the inconsistency and delays that are endemic to the current process as I travel around the state of Connecticut and I hear from people around the country I consistently hear about problems that exist under the present process for choosing a union this rule does not determine the outcome it simply modernizes and improves the process and it does it by a rulemaking process that is consistent with and pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act which is the way that the Congress has said it should be done and in fact it adopts the rulemaking procedure rather than doing it by individual cases which is the way that the united states supreme court and the courts of appeals have said to the board it should do more often so far from raising constitutional questions or issues of procedural lack of process the NLRB has acted in accordance with the will of the Congress and the Constitution in formulating this rule why is it necessary well for one thing there are 34 regional offices of the National Labor Relations Board and each of them has different policies and practices for processing election petitions we're talking about petitions that are submitted by workers who want to form a union and can do so by election when at least thirty percent of those employees send the petition to the NLRB the gap in time is an opportunity for intimidation by unscrupulous employers fortunately they are a minority small minority of employers but they exist that wish to discourage or deter workers from forming a union that intimidation is unacceptable we should do everything we can to stop it second the delays themselves are intolerable some of those delays are years as long as 13 years in some instances and the gap in time discourages or deters the exercise of rights that are guaranteed under the law so this new rule is simply to modernize the process end intimidation make sure that rights are made real in real time so that employees can exercise those rights without any discouragement from employers are the employers free to communicate with workers of course they are the rights of communication on the part of the employers are not eliminated by any means are they still part of the process yes indeed employers remain part of the process if they wish to do the effort here as one of the employers in fact that submitted comments the NLRB said quite pointedly healthcare west a healthcare company with thirty one thousand employees in its comments said quote reforms proposed by the NLRB are not pro union or pro-business they are pro modernization end quote and we'll quote modernize the representation election process by improving the board's current representation election procedures that result in unnecessary delays allow unnecessary litigation and fail to take advantage of modern communication technologies that quote from an employer really says it all some of the litigation is not only against the interests of employees it also is costly to the employers especially when it fails to succeed it creates uncertainties for other employers and it can block representation and lead again to unnecessary delays this rule has an impact on real people in Connecticut and around the country I to give you a couple of examples registered nurses who are at a number of the hospitals in Connecticut have come to me about the need to reform this process members of the employee workforce at t-mobile for example and Chris koza a technician at t-mobile USA in Connecticut joined with 14 colleagues came to me to recount his experience he filed for union representation with the support of the Communications Workers of America the CWA he experienced problems of exactly this kind because his rights were delayed and thereby almost denied and when t-mobile USA filed a claim that officially challenged the status of a of CWA as a labor organization he could see Chris cosa and all of us could see that clearly see da cewa is a labor organization this tactic was simply a delaying one and the NLRB rule would prevent the kind of frivolous challenges and frivolous litigation that occurred there mr. president let me conclude by saying that as has been said already this rule is neither pro-union norpro employer it is simply Pro fairness it is anti delay anti frivolous litigation and it is pro fairness in the workplace

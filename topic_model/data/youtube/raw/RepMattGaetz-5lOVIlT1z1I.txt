joining me now congressman Matt Gaetz who sits on the House Budget Armed Services and Judiciary Committees and Alan or vice president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association congressman your Democratic colleagues on the House Judiciary Committee just sent a letter to the president tonight announcing an immediate investigation about this executive action he announced today and they're initiating a resolution in the house to nullify the national emergency has the president gone too far he hasn't I hope the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee will look at the facts of what's going on on the border I think there are three national emergencies happening the first is humanitarian just in the month of December 20,000 children were smuggled across the border that is a terrible humanitarian crisis there's also a crime epidemic ice had to go and arrest thirty thousand sex predators who had come across the border illegally and then committed sex crimes against our citizens and then of course there's a drug crisis we just seized enough fentanyl on the border to kill a hundred and fifteen million Americans that's more than a third of the country so if drugs coming into the country that could kill a third of the country is not a criminal emergency like how much does it have to be does it have to be something that will kill 200 million Americans 300 million or all of us I mean to me it's a real emergency and it's probably three of them I want to play you both Nancy Pelosi's reaction to this emergency declaration watch president is doing and running about Congress about the power of the purse you've heard me say over and over again article one the legislative branch the power of the purse the power to declare war many other powers are listed in the Constitution and of course the responsibility to have oversight so the president is doing and runned around that Allen or do you believe the president lacks the standing the legal standing to declare a national emergency that predecessors have done it absolutely it's not about what the predecessors have done it's about what this president is doing and it's different than what the predecessors has done because in all other cases before the predecessors did not reallocate money from Congress for emergencies that just don't exist so when we talk about all of the numbers a increases at the border in crime then it really isn't consistent with evidence and the receipts that we have from Senator Nelson which says that family and children are presenting themselves for asylum which is a legal form of entry to this country which a wall does not prevent and when we claim that we're having a drug problem when we actually caught that big drug bus coming into the country at a port of entry then that's not really a problem it seems like it's working in a wall really isn't gonna solve that problem either so when we start looking for addressing issues we should look for overspending and then taking money away from our military forces to address problems that don't exist congressman gates so that you say yeah there's a president lack legal standing here even though Obama ford-carter everybody's declared national emergencies well I'm an article one guy but the Congress did authorize and appropriate funds to stop critical drug trafficking corridors one of the title ten authorities under section 284 that the president's going to use is precisely the type of money that we would intend for this purpose also the military construction money is precisely intended to aid in the protection of the country this is a an entirely appropriate use for those funds but like to say that because we found enough fentanyl to kill 115 million Americans everything's fine that's like saying because Chicago is the murder capital of the United States and we catch a bunch of people committing murder that we shouldn't worry about no absolutely not somewhat of a fallacy I'm not saying that at all and actually that he declared the emergency under the War Act not under the the drug act it was actually 10 USC 60 21 which was about war and so therefore it's a little bit different than what you're claiming it to be the matter is at the point of the matter is that if you look at Cato on the left and you look at institutions like the American immigration council on the right they all agree that the problems that you claim exist do not exist we're receipts and studies and not just saying this is how they feel about it wait this is the research that was done so you are you're claiming there is no national emergency or crisis at the border at all yeah I don't know what that means there is I don't think saying that what do you mean by there's an emergency there's a crisis it means that we should be addressing the people who are applying for asylum in the lawful manner no there you are what I'm saying is there's no legal emergency that requires an eight billion eight trillion dollar wall that is what I'm saying to you congressman I'm gonna let you react to that I mean is there a crisis at the border and how would you characterize it congressman get one it's an 8 billion dollar wall not an 8 trillion dollar wall - senator Nelson is no longer in the Senate he was beat by rick Scott and three the fact that you've got all these people that are using our porous border to bring you crime into the country the these stats are real there were 30,000 people that ice had to go and detain who committed sex crimes you think about how many more thousands of victims that were impacted by that and the other point is these are entirely preventable crimes there's a lot of crime that goes on in a country that we can't prevent but if we have a physical barrier at the border where the cartels and traffickers can't bring people here illegally we can 100% stop those crimes

thank you very much Madame ranking member for yielding mr. chairman members of the house I served actively on the Appropriations Committee for 23 years I'm still a member on leave never in the 36 years that I've been here have I seen an omnibus appropriation bill or a minibus appropriation bill brought to the floor before the August break regular order is to bring each to the floor debate each bill on its merit have the opportunity to offer amendments and debate the merits of the amendments and of that particular bill however the majority party has not done its job and I do not hold accountable the members of the Appropriations Committee I want to make that clear but for whatever reasons regular order has not been followed and so each member of the Congress of the United States is confronted with either voting for all of the bill with component parts alleged bill energy and water mill convey a defense bill that they may not like but if they vote no they will be accused of being against the security of the United States that my friends is baloney in his pledge to America or in their pledge to America the Republicans said and I quote we will advance major legislation one issue at a time this belies that representation the sponsors of this minibus package mr. speaker claim it will make America more secure I reject that argument senior military leaders have said that the greatest long-term threat to our national security is the growing national debt and the impact of interest payments on the debt as they crown out our ability to invest in defense and domestic priorities it is incumbent upon us mr. speaker to work together to pass a fiscally responsible budget agreement that lifts the sequester caps in a way consistent with the principle between defense and non-defense spending ladies and gentlemen to this house we were supposed to pass a budget on or before April 15th it is now July 26th we have passed no budget there is no plan for overall spending this therefore is a pig in a poke and nobody on this house floor or in this country knows the ramifications of the passage of this bill on the 8th domestic spending bills that remain untended I thank the gentlelady from them to attend commencing morning it is incumbent upon us mr. speaker to work together to pass a fiscally responsible budget agreement that lifts the sequester caps we cannot simply skip to appropriations without determining what our budget priorities are first it is as critical for our national defense and as it is for our ability to support economic growth moreover this is the earliest as I have said before that I can ever remember that the House considered either nomina bus or a minibus appropriation bill it is an acknowledgment by the majority that the house will not be able to move these bills through under regular order given Republicans internal divisions over spending bills so instead of working with Democrats to craft individual appropriation bills that can pass the house their resorting to legislative taxes to push them through on partisan votes I will remind my friends across the aisle that they have been unable to enact a single funding bill in the past seven years without ultimately appealing to Democratic votes so I urge my colleagues to reject this many bit and make it clear that we first ought to negotiate a budget agreement that provides certainty and clarity to the entire federal government not just a handful of agencies and we ought to do it through an open and transparent process with members permitted to offer amendments that could shape a budget and appropriation bills truly reflective of the nation's priority as a whole I urge my colleagues to vote no so that we can get on with an appropriation process that is in the regular order that makes common sense that is transparent and that will give the American public the best product that we can produce and I yield back the balance of my time gentleman yields back the gentleman from New York reserves the gentleman from New Jersey is recognized the Chairman are pleased to recognize the gentleman from California the chairman of the interior subcommittee at appropriations for three minutes gentleman from

not be as bad here as in other states but there are still concerns sherman oaks congressman brad sherman is introducing a bill that would help increase the supply of baby formula earlier he laid out exactly what he wants to do parents are naturally uh trying to make sure that they'll have enough and they're buying more more than they need right now if they can find it we had people buying huge amounts of toilet paper a couple of years ago uh this is obviously a more severe crisis and you were actually seeking a legislative solution is that correct on friday you introduced a new bill i published it and i'll be introducing it on tuesday it's the infant formula emergency act it's designed first to produce more in the united states by making it clear that the defense production act which is designed for military articles also applies here and that the president can order any plant in our country that's capable of making formula to make the formula even if they're making uh dehydrated milk or or any other similar substance the second thing we need to do is import as quickly as we can that will mean that we have to allow importation for products that may not have gone through the fda as long as they're approved by other countries that we trust such as europe or canada second that we suspend labeling requirements because the foreign products aren't labeled for u.s sale and that we suspend the 17 tariff that we have on most imports of infant formula so we have to be ready to import as much as we can and produce as much as we can how quickly are you envisioning this is going to get through and how quickly will parents see a change on the shelves i would hope that we would be importing a lot more starting uh the first of next month and but i do think we have a contest here we have on the one hand we're going to increase supply on the other hand there's nothing that can do more to increase demand than tell parents all over the country you may or may not be able to find uh a baby formula on the shelves in july uh that is that's gonna take all the july man and and put it on in the stores in june so this is gonna get worse before it gets better i hate to say that because i don't want to inspire the very stockpiling that i'm talking about but uh each parent is already thinking this through this is one of those things we have to make sure is available especially now with uh i think we're going to see a greater shortage just because parents will buy what they can find on the uh on the shelves uh whether they need it this week or whether they're putting it away for next month

seeing waters of California great thanks once again for your time tonight delighted to be with you thank you for inviting me one investigation already underway in your state another under consideration or we start with the denial of claims is that an incremental investigation there too well I am so pleased that Attorney General Jerry Brown has decided to take this issue up these stories we've been hearing for years people who pay their premiums year in and year out and then when they file a claim the war begins they've got to fight they've got to do everything to try and get these companies to pay and then they're oftentimes rejected this information by the California Nurses Association is extremely important this is a credible organization representing over 86,000 nurses in the United States of America and they've finally put the facts before us that which we suspect they're all along that there were huge rejections this 39 point of six percent of pacific air that is outrageous and then they asked us to somehow compromise and have a trigger to let these insurance companies keep on committing these crimes and somehow set some kind of benchmarks to give them an opportunity to do right they have been ripping off the taxpayers and american people the citizens of this country but far too long no compromise should be entertained by anybody yes the idea was we could have triggers if the system doesn't work the point is the system doesn't work right now we've already met whatever triggers could be established but let me ask you back about attorney general brown with all due respect to what he's trying to do does our nation's health care problem including the denial of claims does that is that owed more to the fact that sometimes laws are being broken or more to the fact that that so much is actually legal and the insurance companies can get away with effectively murder well the fact of the matter is we don't regulate them in ways that would even suggest what their rates should be whether or not they are should it should not be denying claims this is all within their power to do they can take someone again who's been paying premiums for 10-15 years on time regularly in one of these HMOs whatever you want to call it and they can decide after they do they all review whether or not to reject or to deny we don't really have a lot of control over that we already know about the financial implications of this and I hesitate to again use that incendiary term death panels but do people die in fact because of decisions made by insurance company executives we absolutely have stories we have information from people who have had the experience that there have been deaths as a matter of fact they are several that was cited by the Nurses Association as they presented this information about young people who have been denied certain procedures and consequently died this request for the inquiry into wellpoint and United that they coerced employees to go and oppose health care even if they did from the company's point of view so what what could possibly happen to the companies that would outweigh the benefits of creating these kind of fake public testimonials against health care reform well the fact of the matter is if they have decided to treat their employees that way and to intimidate them and maybe even suggest in some way that they may not continue to be employed if they don't follow the company line it's something that we ought to be investigating we should not allow them to do that congresswoman maxine waters of california as always great thanks for your time and good luck as you continue your fight on this thank you so very much

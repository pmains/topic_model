STORIES WITH THE SUBCOMMITTEE, MS. MALEY AND MS. FANO. PROFESSOR ARMSTRONG? YOU ARE NOW RECOGNIZED FOR FIVE MINUTES TO PRESENT YOUR OPENING STATEMENT. >> CHAIRMAN OSSOFF, RANKING MEMBER JOHNSON, AND MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE. THANK YOU FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING, AND FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY. THANK YOU ALSO TO THE STAFF WHO WORKED INCREDIBLY HARD TO PULL THIS TOGETHER, AS WELL AS THE COURAGE OF THE FAMILIES WHO ARE APPEARING AS WITNESSES TODAY. MY NAME IS ANDREA ARMSTRONG, AND I'M A LAW PROFESSOR AT LOYOLA UNIVERSITY NEW ORLEANS. I TEACH IN THE AREAS OF CRIMINAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL LAW, AND I RESEARCH INCARCERATION LAW AND POLICY. I HAVE VISITED PRISONS AND JAILS ACROSS THE COUNTRY, AND I'VE PARTICIPATED IN AUDITS OF THESE FACILITIES FOR THEIR OPERATIONS AND ADHERENCE TO BEST PRACTICES. MY STUDENTS AND I CREATED INCARCERATION TRANSPARENCY DOT ORG, IT'S A PROJECT AND A WEBSITE THAT COLLECTS, PUBLISHES, AND ANALYZES DEATHS IN CUSTODY IN LOUISIANA PRISON, JAILS, AND DETENTION CENTERS. AT THE TIME THAT WE STARTED THAT PROJECT, AND CONTINUING TODAY, THE TYPE OF INFORMATION THAT WE WANTED WAS NOT AVAILABLE, MAINLY INDIVIDUAL LEVEL DEATH RECORDS, AS WELL AS FACILITY LEVEL DEATH RECORDS, SO THAT WE CAN IDENTIFY WHICH FACILITIES IN LOUISIANA WERE ACTUALLY THE MOST TROUBLED. AS WE'VE HEARD TODAY FROM OTHER WITNESSES, THERE ARE A LOT OF REASONS TO BE CONCERNED WHEN A DEATH IN CUSTODY OCCURS. IN ADDITION TO THE IMPACT ON FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES, DEATHS IN CUSTODY MAY SIGNAL BROADER CHALLENGES IN A FACILITY. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO FIX WHAT IS INVISIBLE AND HIDDEN. AS JUSTICE BRANDEIS WROTE, SOME LIGHT IS THE BEST OF DISINFECTANTS, ELECTRIC LIKE THE MOST EFFICIENT POLICEMEN. INCREASING TRANSPARENCY ON DEBTS AND CUSTODY IS THE CRITICAL STEP TOWARDS ULTIMATELY REDUCING DEATHS IN CUSTODY. I'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU A GRAPH THAT I SHARED WITH YOUR STAFF, AND IT'S ON PAGE 28 OF EXHIBIT ONE. THIS CHART HELPS US UNDERSTAND WHY TRANSPARENCY IS SO CRITICAL. THE PERCENTAGE OF SUICIDES THAT HAPPENED IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT, ALSO KNOWN AS ISOLATION, RESTRICTIVE HOUSING, OR SEGREGATION, IS HIGHLIGHTED IN PINK. WHAT YOU CAN SEE IS WE ARE LOOKING AT THE LOCATION OF SUICIDES BY THE TYPE OF FACILITY. SO THE FIRST COLUMN IS THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS, THOSE ARE PRISONS. THE SECOND IS JUVENILE FACILITIES. THE THIRD IS JAILS THAT ARE LOCALLY OPERATED. AND IV'S PRIVATE. WHAT YOU CAN SEE IN PINK IS THAT 43% OF ALL SUICIDES IN LOUISIANA JAILS OCCURRED IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT. COMPARE THAT TO ONLY 7% IN OUR STATE PRISONS. OF THE THREE YOUTH SUICIDE THAT HAPPENED BETWEEN 2015 AND 2019 IN LOUISIANA, TWO OUT OF THREE OCCURRED WHEN THESE YOUTHS WERE CONFINED, ALONE, AND IN SEGREGATION. THIS FINDING SHOULD PROMPT REVIEW OF STAFFING, DISCIPLINE, SECURITY, AND MENTAL HEALTH PROTOCOLS IN THE JAILS WHERE THE SUICIDES OCCURRED. BUT UNFORTUNATELY, DUE TO CHANGES IN THE FEDERAL COLLECTION OF DATA ON DEATHS, WE WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY PATTERNS LIKE THESE. THAT'S BECAUSE THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE NO LONGER COLLECTS INFORMATION ON INCIDENT LOCATIONS WITHIN A PRISON OR JAIL. IT ALSO DOESN'T COLLECT INFORMATION FROM FACILITIES WHERE THERE WERE ZERO DEATHS, MEANING IT WILL BE HARDER FOR FACILITIES TO LEARN FROM EACH OTHER WHAT WORKS AND WHAT DOESN'T WORK. CHANGES IN WHAT'S COLLECTED IS NOT THE ONLY PROBLEM. IN ADDITION, THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS UNDERCOUNTING DEATHS. FOUR DEATHS IN 2020, LOUISIANA REPORTED SIX TOTAL DEATHS TO THE BUREAU OF JUSTICE -- IN CONSCIOUS, LOYOLA LAW STUDENTS IDENTIFIED 180 DEATHS IN 2020 IN LOUISIANA PRISONS AND JAILS, AND MULTIPLE SHERIFFS INFORMED OUR STUDENTS THAT THEY WERE NO LONGER REQUIRED TO REPORT DEATHS IN CUSTODY FOR FEDERAL DATA COLLECTION. IF LOUISIANA'S EXPERIENCE IS SIMILAR TO THOSE OF OTHER STATES, 2020 WILL BE THE FIRST YEAR IN ALMOST TWO DECADES IN WHICH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE CANNOT TELL US WHO IS DYING BEHIND BARS, AND WHY. CONGRESS HAS A RANGE OF TOOLS AVAILABLE TO HELP INCREASE TRANSPARENCY, WHICH ULTIMATELY, I

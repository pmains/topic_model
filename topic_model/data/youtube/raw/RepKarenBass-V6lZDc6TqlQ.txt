out front now Democratic congresswoman Karen bass who sits on the Judiciary Committee so you know getting down the spectacle of today the heart of the matter now congresswoman do you agree with the House Speaker that the Attorney General Bill Barr committed a crime well I don't know how you can interpret in any other way yes I do I mean he said that he had not received any contact any and he absolutely had that letter was dated you know several days before so I do agree with the speaker so Pelosi was asked about how bars should be punished for committing the crime as she said and I wanted to play that exchange before she was gonna box here it is Dipti there's a process involved here and as I said I'll say it again and how many other questions you and the committee will act upon how we will proceed and just in case you didn't hear because I know the reporter question was a little softer but the reporter said should he go to jail for this and she did not answer the question but if she's saying he committed a crime the crime is perjury obviously jail prison is part of that well I think what she is also referring to when she said that there is a process so you know we in the Judiciary Committee have asked the Attorney General to give us the unredacted report with all the underlying evidence and we wanted him to come and testify before us today so part of the process will be to you know see whether or not he will comply with that and if he doesn't you know we might have to go down the road of charging a contempt of Congress so there is a process that would take place so I think she is referring to that the question as to what happens in the Senate might be a different issue but the process that we will follow in the house will be we subpoenaed him we've asked him to give us all the information if he doesn't we will consider the contempt of Congress okay but but in terms of if he did perjure himself right I mean I I'm just saying from it's not whether he did or didn't but if you're going to come out and say that he did it would consistent to say well then okay you know prison time would be part of that as it would be for any other American who committed perjury well exactly and I mean one of the things that we are seeing and unfortunately we have seen from day one with this administration is a sense of contempt for the rule of law and so as we go through this process not just with bar but with other members of the administration when subpoenas are issued are they going to ignore it if it goes through court and they they have fines are they going to follow them so it's going to be interesting to see it's not just this situation but I think it's going to be multiple now the president is out saying that he's not going to allow McKee McCann to testify when he no longer works for the Department of Justice and so we will see how far this goes but there is an actual step-by-step process that we will follow so White House spokesman Sarah Sanders today weighed in on on the issue here right what you all said you wanted him to testify he agreed and then you know you said you wanted lawyers to be a part of it which you know look couldn't give you the chance to drill down at a specific issue in depth as opposed switching person to person but he said look you asked me to come in front of your committee not in front of lawyers that was the deal so that was the deal so White House spokesman Sarah Sanders weighed in on all of it today the big empty chair here's what she said if he and his committee aren't capable of actually asking the Attorney General questions themselves and need to staff that out it seems like a pretty pathetic moment for the chairman of that committee well I mean truthfully I don't even think that's worth the response but let me just tell you that we have other people come before our committee we did last year when the Republicans were in control and there were attorneys on both sides and so what the Chairman had proposed was 30 minutes on either side they could bring attorneys if they wanted to and so can we so there's a lot of precedent for this and it allows consistent questioning where you're not subject to the five-minute rule and you know to really engage with somebody like the attorney general more time as needed yes thank you very much congressman I appreciate your time thanks for having me on

Indiana Senator Todd young has been in those briefings he joins me now sir I noted yesterday that Marco Rubio the senator from Florida said that 99 of the information could have been made public and be Declassified do you agree I do it's an unfortunate habit that this Administration has and and In fairness we see that with previous administrations you go into a classified setting and uh 95 percent of the material is is read about in the newspaper afterwards so why not have the president of the United States finally speak to these issues clarify what the heck is going on what the intelligence gaps are if you need some additional resources from Congress to empower him to to clamp down on on these unidentified aerial phenomena let us know but he has a lot of questions to answer and hopefully we'll get some of those answers from his representatives in a further classified hearing today okay so that's happening today do you get the sense that we do do we have a sense of a new policy is our policy to shoot down these unidentified flying objects before we know what they are it's unclear uh it's unclear exactly what the policy is Dana over 250 of these unidentified aerial phenomena were found last year that's unclassified that's from our Director of National Intelligence none were shot down of course and then we have a balloon flown over Alaska ends up you know being shot down over North Carolina and suddenly we shoot down three uh it seems to me that those were very similar so has there been a change in Risk calculus has there been an official change in policy do we know something about those uh three that followed the balloon that we didn't know about the previous 250 all of these are unanswered questions and they need to be answered by the president vice president Kamala Harris is on her way to the Munich conference as where a lot of people gather every year to talk about National Security one of the big questions is about China and you know how do you think she should present our concerns about China especially with allies in the region well if the president's not going to speak publicly about these issues then Kamala Harris should be provided the the communications points to do so and what the focus really needs to be on is is re-establishing deterrence uh how do we put in the mind of Xi Jinping that it is inappropriate ill-advised and frankly uh a danger to him and his security to send balloons and another phenomena over the United States over our Farms our schools our our houses in our military bases so uh that's exactly the sort of information she needs to provide that's what I want to hear someone who who wants to prevent these activities in the future as opposed to enduring countless more unidentified phenomena in the future maybe a last final question here so in the briefings that you've had and the information that you have gathered are you more or less concerned uh than you were before because and I'm curious like do you is there an overreaction in terms of the shooting down of these UAP keys or do you think it was warranted where do you stand now you know I I'm probably marginally less concerned with the the three aerial phenomena that were found after the balloon uh when I first heard about it I thought they were certainly Chinese Communist Party objects that Still Remains to be determined but uh I'm leaning uh no on on the answer to that question but I'm much more concerned about the inability of our national security leadership to even get in touch with the Chinese leadership after all of this happened I mean the risk of miscalculation and escalation in future military conflict is great why haven't our presidents why hasn't this president established lines of communication like we did during the Cold War so that we can avoid that sort of uh incident good questions indeed Senator Todd young well great to have you on the show today thank you thanks Dana

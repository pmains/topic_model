i want to talk about biofuels for just a second farmers and ranchers are the original conservationists nobody is more motivated to leave our environment cleaner healthier safer for our for our children for our grandchildren than farmers and ranchers and i think biofuels can have a great impact on that and for this entire world i'm convinced that the the carbon footprint of a renewable diesel or or biodiesel driven cars tractors have have a lower carbon output from start to finish when you look through the whole cycle of making uh everything that goes in that car or truck to the to the tailgate tailpipe admission to the final disposal of that that they'll have a lower carbon footprint than electric cars and i'm just curious about your your uh thoughts on biofuels senator marshall it's great to see you and chat with you about all the creative work that you all are doing um in the state of kansas and you know we think about uh you mentioned the growing climate solutions act and all of our work that we will do to address climate change and you know we will be challenged to use many tools in our tool belt for doing so and the use of biofuels ethanol and bio energy have a critical role to play in helping to reduce carbon emissions and help helping to address critical climate change goals i mean i think it would be very important to to one to educate people on the environmental benefits of biofuels and bioenergy to expand uses for bioenergy you know their opportunities with uses in sustainable jet fuel in the fleet of vehicles i'm at usda and our sister agencies and and really promote renewable fuels production and infrastructure development so we can expand uh the use of biofuels that more people can purchase biofuel and then we can also think about how we can utilize bioenergy production and renewable fuels to create clean energy jobs throughout rural america and if i have the opportunity to be confirmed i will uh join secretary vilsack and members of the the industry um corn industry and others uh in fully supporting the use of biofuels and bio energy to reach important climate change goals thank you for that answer and we do appreciate your support

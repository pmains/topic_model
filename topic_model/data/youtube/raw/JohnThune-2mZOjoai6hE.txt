Mr President in his State of the Union Address last month the president expressed an encouraging desire for bipartisanship but I said at the time that I hoped his words will be matched by his actions after all the president spoke about being a president for all Americans in his inaugural dress but his first two years in office were not exactly distinguished by bipartisanship so what I was encouraged by the president's words in his State of the Union Address as I said I'm looking for them to be matched by his actions and renominating a slew of extreme nominees as the president has done so far this year is no way to start so far this year the president has renominated at least 16 individuals who were unable to get any bipartisan support in the last Congress they include an individual with serious unanswered questions about his possible role in a movement to push out senior career officials at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in favor of Biden loyalists multiple individuals aligned with Democrats radical Green New Deal agenda a nominee who was repeatedly embraced anti-police rhetoric multiple abortion extremists a leftist litigator who is called the U.S Senate and the Electoral College anti-democratic institutions and who has admitted that he is motivated by his hatred of conservatives and the list goes on and then of course there's the nominee who recently appeared in front of the Senate Commerce Committee for the third time Gigi song this is Miss Owens third nomination to the Federal Communications Commission during the Biden Administration her previous two nominations stalled thanks to her inability to Garner any bipartisan support and with good reason because Gigi son has to be the pollster child for terrible presidential nominees although I support the Biden judicial nominee who couldn't I say suggestion although I suppose the Biden judicial nominee who couldn't explain Article 2 of The Constitution should also be in the running for that title of worst Presidential nominee I have serious policy disagreements with Miss Owen on multiple issues she not only wants to bring back the heavy-handed internet regulation of the Obama Administration she wants to go further and have the FCC regulate Broadband rates and set data caps this should discourage Broadband investment and threaten U.S leadership in 5G or this would discourage I should say Broadband investment and threaten U.S leadership in 5G as well as diminished internet access opportunities for Americans outside of major Urban and Suburban areas as a resident of a rural State I also have serious concerns about Miss Zone's position on Rural broadband she's been publicly hostile to the efforts of rural Broadband companies to expand reliable internet access to rural areas while at the same time she supported the use of scarce government dollars to overbuild networks in already well-served areas her hostility to rule Broadband LED one former Democrat senator to ask how Democrats can support rural Broadband expansion and also support Gigi song but Mr President my concerns with Ms son don't end there I don't not only have serious policy disagreements with Miss Zone I have serious questions about her character and fitness for the office for which she is nominated the Federal Communications Commission has jurisdiction over radio TV and the internet which means that it deals with a number of sensitive issues notably Free Speech issues and for that reason it calls for Commissioners who are thoughtful fair and impartial misone is none of these she is a virulent and Unapologetic partisan known for speaking disparagingly of conservative media Outlets the same Outlets same Outlets I would add that she would be regulating and a politicians who disagree with her her nomination is supposed opposed by a wide range of organizations including the left of center Progressive policy Institute which opposes her due to and I quote pattern of ill-liberal intolerance for voices on the left who dissent from her hard left orthodoxies end quote misone is the very opposite of fair and impartial and I can think of few candidates who would be more detrimental to the fair and impartial adjudication of media issues and the protection of free speech on public Airwaves but the problems with her nomination don't even end there son has raised serious ethics questions recently with her political donations to several Democrat Senators at the same time that her nomination was before the United States Senate one of those donations was actually given to a member of the Commerce Committee which of course is the committee considering her nomination Mr President Miss sold may not have intended to influence Senators considering her nomination but at the very least her decision to donate to these Senators while her nomination is before Congress gives the appearance of impropriety and raises serious questions about her judgment but her ethical issues don't end there she was less than forthcoming with the Commerce Committee about her time on the board of a company that was found to be operating in violation of copyright laws and questions remain about how she got the substantial settlement against her company drastically reduced missonas volunteered to recuse herself if she's confirmed on a variety of issues related to broadcasting and copyright violations because of her involvement with his company and the settlement but I'm hard-pressed to understand why we would choose a commissioner who would have to recuse herself from participating in substantial parts of the fcc's work Mr President fortunately there's a lot more I could say about the problems with missones nomination but I'll stop here suffice it to say that I cannot think of a less appropriate candidate for this position instead of continuing to attempt to place a viral and partisan like Miss son at the FCC the President should nominate a qualified candidate who will do his or her job in a fair and impartial manner and as I said at the beginning if the president truly wants to usher in an era a bipartisanship in this period of divided government he can start by rethinking some of the highly partisan renominations he's made in this Congress and consider nominating individuals who are able to gain at least some bipartisan support Mr President I yield the floor

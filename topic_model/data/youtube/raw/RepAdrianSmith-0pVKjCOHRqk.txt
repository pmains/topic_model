Thank You mr. chairman Thank You ambassador a very timely hearing and ambassador thank you for your presence here today these these topics as you know and as you're articulating are very important and engagement on these trade issues is vital let me begin by thanking the president for bringing down the 232 steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada and Mexico on on May 2 17th I certainly advocated for that course of action I'm and I'm grateful that the USTR is making that a reality in lifting of the 232 tariffs and the decision to avoid new tariffs on Mexico have led to substantial progress in moving the u.s. MCA agreement forward both in Mexico and Canada we cannot lose sight of how important our North American trading relationships are and how crucial their continuation is to the well-being and economic survival of farmers ranchers and rural communities and let's not forget consumers as well no comprehensive trade agreement is ever going to be perfect in the eyes of everyone however US MCA is a needed modernization of NAFTA as you have stated I strongly encourage the ratification in a timely fashion because we know the costs of delay are very significant markets lost are not easily regained farmers and ranchers need markets man the president recognizes the current sacrifices made by our nation's AG producers I cannot emphasize enough to you just how real the pain is in parts of our economy and I know you realize that we all understand China is a bad economic actor on many fronts I'm pledged I'm pleased the president plans to meet with Chinese president gene next week engaging with China is certainly a step in the right direction thank you for also engaging with Japan on how best to reach a successful trade agreement and even while those talks continue Nebraska's livestock producers face declining market share due to competition from nations which have preferential trading terms already with the Japanese we need to level that playing field mr. ambassador the current struggles of our AG producers are very real we must work toward timely principled productive solutions and work toward sustainable and robust markets thank you again for addressing the committee I was wondering if you could reflective it on the current product progress of talks with Japan it would Thank You congressman I as you say first of all I make the point that I make here with all the issues in agriculture and there are substantial ones most of which predated this administration but about them that we're trying to deal with as you know as farm income has just been a problem for a number of years and it's and then and then you dump on top of it you know a million tons of rain and all of a sudden you have you go from a really bad situation to a crisis the president is very concerned about this it's something that I literally never have a meeting when he doesn't bring it up and I meet with him a lot so it's on his mind an awful lot the Japan thing specifically that you mentioned I would say this Japan that's been a pretty good market for the United States in a number of products it should be much better they still have a state organized agricultural sector and they also have fairly high tariffs but we have a fair amount of access particularly like in beef in some other areas we're in a position now some members may not know I know you do that because they entered into TPP and a separate agreement with Europe we're going to be in a position where we're treated worse than our competitors our competitors would be all of our competitors in Europe of which there are substantial but also Mexico Canada and New Zealand so it's a big big problem and it's one that we have to take care of in a very Swift manner so that the president has instructed me to get on this I've had a number of meetings I expect to have another meeting with my Japanese counterpart on the outskirts of the g20 next week I had a meeting with him here in town last week so this is in our staffs have met more or less continuously we understand the nature of this problem and we have to resolve it because if we don't these farmers are going to lose that market because of nothing they did just because Japan gave more access to somebody else and they may never get those markets back and the Japanese understand completely our position and I'm hopeful that we'll have something resolved in in the in the weeks and months ahead but there's an enormous amount of urgency and we completely agree with your assessment thank you and certainly as you look at 40-plus percent tariff on some US beef heading to Japan to reduce that obviously is good for our producers here but it's it's great for Japanese consumers as well if all countries would just keep consumers in mind I think we would be in a better place and I and I know that that is what you are working toward and I thank you for your time today I yield back

hi this is congressman Joe Morelli over the last several weeks my office has been receiving whole host of enquiries about the corona virus both in terms of what the science is and how you might be affected how you should practice social distancing all those things and then we've been getting a bunch of questions you can imagine about the federal stimulus packages which we've passed we passed three different bills the first one intended to provide some really quick relief to our health systems to deal with the early stage of the virus the second bill dealt with paid and sick family sick leave and paid family leave and then the third one was of course the two trillion dollar stimulus package which has a whole host of benefits for small businesses individuals families and is intended to try to provide relief for people so they can continue to pay bills put food on the table pay shelter etc so I thought I'd take a moment to answer a couple questions we'll try to do this periodically so we can get to the questions that people are sending to us on our website which by the way is Morelli house gov mor e ll e house Hou SC gov we have a long list of resources for people who have questions but thought I'd first begin with a question from Oscar who lives in gates he said where can small businesses obtain the funding resources they need so as I mentioned one of our philosophical views on this when we began looking at the stimulus package is how to help small businesses individuals and families one of the criticisms after the 2002 2007 2008 economic crash and recession was that the Congress at the time put too much of an investment in large businesses and spent less time worrying about individuals and families we took a different approach this time so one of the most important things I think for small businesses and small businesses in this setting means employers with fewer than 500 employees but it also includes sole proprietors it means freelance workers could be people who have very very small businesses so your local nail salon barber restaurant etc and the Paycheck protection program was instituted to allow those businesses to receive funding depending on how big their payroll is what their revenues are but they would get funding from an SBA certified lender that's most banks in the region deal with SBA Small Business Administration guaranteed loans the loan is guaranteed a hundred percent and what it essentially does is it allows a borrower to borrow money to pay payroll overhead which includes rent utilities debt service on equipment pay that for a period of up to eight weeks and if you start at the beginning of the loan period and end it and have the same number of employees and don't decline your headcount at all or reduce your headcount off the loan is 100 percent forgivable meaning you don't have to pay it back so this should really help with cash flow and really help folks get through the next several weeks my expectation is we may have to extend the period as this virus continues to wreak havoc on communities all across the country the easiest way to do this couple ways to get information on it first of all you can go to the Small Business Administration website sba.gov you can also go to our website finally if you have a relationship with a bank or a lender just call them and ask them for the SBA PPP paycheck protection program application talk to them about any specifics hope I still hope that answers your question and for others who are struggling to understand how to keep their small business going next question was from Bonita and Webster is there a deadline and filing taxes to be eligible to receive a stimulus check and what is the criteria for determining who will receive check this is a great question this deals with the rebate program which will send checks to families based on a couple of different factors first of all it's based on your 2019 tax filing so if you haven't done it yet the periods been extended to July so many people have done it some have not if you haven't done it we would use your 2018 tax filing so there are income categories for this so if you're a single filer the maximum award of $1,200 per person is for anybody with $75,000 of income or less you can however receive some benefit all the way up to having income and it's it's adjusted gross income on you and your tax return all the way up to 99 thousand of adjusted gross income and what happens is when you hit the $75 which is the amount you get for the maximum benefit for every $100 of additional income you made up to ninety nine thousand the benefit is reduced by five dollars so essentially if you made 75 thousand one hundred dollars instead of receiving a twelve hundred dollar check you would get eleven hundred and ninety five dollars it is different if you're a head of household that number starts at one hundred and twelve thousand five hundred and goes up to a maximum of one hundred and thirty six again it's deducting five dollars for additional hundred dollars of income if you're a joint filer then the income the joint income has to be a hundred and fifty thousand dollars or less to receive the maximum benefit all the way up to one hundred and ninety nine thousand the same applies you reduce for every additional one hundred dollars in income over the 150 thousand your benefit is reduced by five dollars these checks will come in or these benefits will come in two different ways first is if you receive your refund or pay your taxes electronically meaning the IRS already has your account information on file you will get this benefit automatically there's nothing that you have to do you don't have to file any forms it will automatically appear for those of you who paid with a check if you have a tax they have to do at the end of the year or receive a paper check in the form of a refund you'll get a paper check from the IRS to pay that benefit again you don't have to file anything other than your tax return in either 2018 or 2019 there is as most people know twelve hundred dollars for eligible individual five hundred dollars for children under the age of 16 and again that will all be done automatically people have asked questions about the Social Security Administration if you are a recipient of Social Security either the old-age Social Security which is typically what we think of the survivors Social Security which is a children who have lost a parent or disability insurance you'll get a check as well and again those recipients should not have to do anything other than to receive the check I would expect the the deposits will start being made in about ten days for the IRS they will probably make fastest for people who have automatic deposits but I would say this if people don't hear within the next couple of weeks please reach out to our office and we'll help track down for a very very small number of people there may be a requirement to file if you don't already file tax returns that information is made available on our website and certainly calling the IRS or contacting them will get that information as well but again for the vast majority of Americans they won't have to do anything to receive the rebate check will and brightness when do we expect a broadly available antibody tests so we can understand the true extent of the pandemic it's a really great question we don't have yet a widely available antibody and let me just make a distinction antibodies will tell you whether or not you have successfully recovered from the virus it doesn't tell you that you have the virus right now the antibodies occur once your body has in your immune system as dispense with the virus and developed antibodies unity we believe from future episodes of getting the virus the diagnostic test which is one we're really trying to get everybody who is sick to determine the spread of the disease that's available now although frankly I think the administration has done a poor job of making readily available those diagnostic tests but they are different from the antibody test we hope to have that there are reports that an antibody test which is a small prick of the finger to get just a couple drops of blood and is typically available in terms of results in about 15 minutes that will really tell us how many Americans were infected recovered and may have been either the mildest of symptoms or may have been completely asymptomatic but your immune system dealt with the virus hopefully as I said there's reports that'll be available in the next few weeks oh we certainly hope that's the case so I hope these have answered some of the questions that you have if not please go to our website you can add additional questions and hopefully in the next several days we'll be answering more and more as we get from residents again everybody please practice social distancing where I'm asked when you're out in public let's stop the spread of this curve and let's make sure that we make it keep this spread of this disease as and get over it as quickly as possible to keep it as flat as possible and let's save lives so social distance out there thanks so much for your time

Senator Stabenow thank you very much for putting together today's hearing I want to welcome all our guests I'm going to be mercifully brief I do want to note the fact that Senator Stabenow II is the ranking Democrat on our important healthcare subcommittee where she has really been our lead in terms of fighting for seniors and holding down the costs of pharmaceuticals now two years ago when then candidate Donald Trump was on the campaign trail he said that he would make sure Medicare would negotiate like crazy to hold down costs for seniors and taxpayers as of now well over a year and a half into his term most Americans believe it is crazy that we are still not negotiating to hold down the costs of medicine now the president made another another array of really remarkable statements he said that he would get prices to drop dramatically his words not mine we all know that what we've gotten instead was a lot of public relations mumbo jumbo instead of concrete steps and I want to put this into context because we feel very strongly that we need to play offense and come up with real approaches that hold down the costs of Medicine rather than all this public relations choreography it almost sounds like he's trying to schedule a limpin Olympics but nobody ever gets to show up no athletes get to show up it's just all a fanfare and hullabaloo so in addition to making sure that we can lift this ridiculous restrictions of Medicare could a bargain I have introduced a proposal that caps the out-of-pocket costs for medicine Senator Stabenow has put in a wonderful transparency bill to make sure that when you're in the pharmacy you can have a chance to get a reasonably priced drug and I've also introduced something called the spike Act which would force the pharmaceutical companies to justify these huge price hikes and we've included a version of that in our better deal proposal now what spike says is that the Department Health and Human Services when drugs increased by more than 50 percent or over five years or 15 percent in a year the pharmaceutical companies would have to explain the increases so that gets right to a valuable point senator Stabenow made are they spending the money on critical research and development or they just spend a ton on ads and all the rest so I'll close with just a couple of examples of what spike would mean right now for all of you and consumers Pfizer would be on the hook to tell the federal government and the public why it's nerve and muscle pain drug lyrica why the prices increased a hundred and twenty seven percent over the last five years Medicare spent 2.1 billion dollars on this drug in 2016 alone so if Pfizer and the Trump administration want to brag about all the steps they're taking to address drug prices in my view a better place to start would be justifying why seniors and taxpayers have had to absorb a triple digit price increase on one of Medicare's most used drugs I'm going to put in what we call around here put it into our kind of record because we have the same thing happening with crest crest or a drug for high cholesterol we have the same thing happening with lantus and insulin a product from Santa Fe but the point is what we want is more than PR that really isn't changing anything for people at the pharmacy window across the country we want measures that have teeth that are enforceable they're going to make a real difference for the consumer so they're stabbing out thank you thank you

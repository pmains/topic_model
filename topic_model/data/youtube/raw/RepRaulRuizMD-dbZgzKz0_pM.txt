our case dr. do we freeze for five minutes Thank You mr. chairman as many of you know I grew up the son of farm workers in the medically underserved community of Coachella I have seen firsthand what it means when the community is medically underserved and when they cannot access care and I can tell you this it was not for Medicaid the Coachella Valley and regions like mine all across the country would not have access to health care that every one of us up on this diet and our families enjoy if we repeal Medicaid expansion people will lose health care coverage they will stop seeing their doctors because the cost will be too high and they will stop taking their life-saving prescriptions because there are too expensive in California alone the nearly 3.5 million individuals who enrolled in Medicaid under the ACA expansion provision could lose their covers that's millions of families losing access to health care and if we repeal Medicaid expansion uncompensated costs will increase straining our nation's health care systems which will drive up costs for everyone because you see when people don't have health insurance they don't stop getting sick and our emergency departments do not turn someone away because they don't have insurance emergency physicians treat the patients like they should so the hospital's have to make up the costs and in 2014 alone Suter health systems at California saw a decrease in uncompensated care by forty five percent in 2014 I am all hospitals in my district in particular San Gorgonio hospitals has seen a drop in uninsured patients in the emergency department by half so we need to expand Medicare even more make it more efficient and more desirable for providers to see more Medicaid insured patients listen fraud is bad and political amplification of the problem to wrongfully justify cutting health insurance for sick patients is bad so here's the possible common ground here's what I think we can both agree on if we start with the premise that we want to cover more uninsured economic we struggling families like the middle class and more vulnerable families than we're on the same page but if you start with the ideological goal to cut or n Medicaid then you'll breed mistrust and millions of people will be harmed including the middle class so the real question and the real question mister Howard is are sick and injured people getting the care they need because anything short of this is Meg negligence so let's tackle fraud so that we can expand coverage to more struggling uninsured middle-class families so the question that I have missed Yoakam if you were to choose one thing that you can do to combat fraud if there's one action that you can take that we can make the biggest difference in the system what would that be I think it's around the providers making sure that we have eligible providers who are in good standing and that those who are not in good standing and should not be providing services aren't going across states to provide services thank you Miss Maxwell the one thing the one thing that will make the biggest difference I would absolutely have to go back to the data without that sort of transparency we cannot see what's happening in the program and we have a lack of data across the nation and also due to coming in from the managed care companies thank you mister Howard the one thing you had one thing you can change to make the biggest difference in fraud what would it be in fraud in particular anything yeah yes indeed data transparency as my colleague here on the test and ice was just saying Medicaid data should be on clade for all the states to look at so we can benchmark provider performance and engagement Thank You mr. Westmoreland what does the evidence suggests about how Medicaid expansion is making health care more affordable is there evidence for instance and Medicaid expansion is reducing patients need to forego medical care due to costs Medicaid expansion is highly associated with the decline in personal bankruptcies medical it is also associated with greater financial security for families who are newly eligible so these middle-class families who are having some economic security because of the Medicaid expansion what is the body of evidence say about how Medicaid expansion as if they affected patients access to primary care and preventive care people in those beneficiaries who are newly insured under the Medicaid expansion have much higher rates of traditional sources of the care seeing primary care and using preventive health services thank you very much I closing statement is you know if this is leading to increase in spanked expansion force economically struggling middle-class families then you know I'm in but if the ultimate goal is to create a facade and amplify a problem politically to then justify policies that will hurt the middle class and that would decrease health insurance then I'm not in so let's tackle fraud so that we can expand more health coverage to middle-class families thank you very much

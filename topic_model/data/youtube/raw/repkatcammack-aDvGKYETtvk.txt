Care Now recognizes the gentlelady from Florida for five minutes chairman thank you for our Witnesses for hanging in there your endurance it is a very important topic but I recognize that a lot of this is technical basically at this point all of my questions have been asked that I had prepared so we're just gonna free ball it here so uh all the witnesses this is to you but since I only have four minutes and 38 seconds please keep your answers brief in the first panel Mr glass from ntia he was speaking about the coordination efforts between Commerce department and the FCC and I was looking back on my notes and one thing that he had mentioned was quote they were always striving to improve when I asked him to follow up on that about what does that mean exactly because you know bureaucrats they say that right what does that mean what metric do you measure to when you talk about improvements and he said that they don't have any So speaking from the private side the industry side what would be a acceptable metric a system by which they can measure a tangible level of improvement that increases transparency for industry uh efficiencies within the system so that we can keep moving forward on this and gives the public quite frankly uh confidence that things are moving forward and we can just go right down the line for the question I'd want to think about metrics it's a really important issue and I wouldn't want to just come up with one off the top of my head to let us Circle back with you on any specific metrics but I will say um I think in terms of outputs that we see from the private sector side and things that have been useful the NTA FCC mou the renegotiation of that you know we're seeing and hearing about increased communication between the FCC and ntia and we think that's really critical I would say also as we're talking about satellite streamlining and ways to make coordination ease the burdens of coordination make things easier I think early communication by the FCC to NTA of satellite applications could be very useful most of the satellite applications need to be coordinated with Federal operators and so um I think that looking at how early the FCC is sharing those applications out to NTA maybe one measure we could take a look at okay Mr Goldman yeah thank you for the question I think looking at speeds of speed of decision making is critical um it's when I was listening to the panel this morning there was a lot of talk about the mou and the increased coordination and absolutely this spectrum is shared not just with commercial interest but also with Federal interests and absolutely needs to be coordinated with everyone who's there but the more people you add into a coordination process the more everything slows down and so I think making sure there's a counterbalance that um as we more add more parties to the coordination discussion we're looking at longer and longer timelines and so being able to make sure that we keep the pressure going the other way as well that these these coordination discussions are thorough and they're complete but they're also done in a timely way thank you I would just add I don't know if this is a metric or not but it if you look at orbital debris kind of the regulation of orbital debris I don't know there's maybe five agencies maybe more than five that are involved in some aspect of that and the jurisdictional um you know kind of land grabs on that in that topic um are not efficient and so there should be some I don't know what this coordination or clarification of who's in charge of what in the U.S government okay I think would be very useful to have that's a good one I like that and I'd just like to share that the FCC has in fact recently required an ntia data form for its filers especially of experimental licenses which effectively documents the technical parameters power modulation schemes to assess interference into its Network which is a step above what was required in the past which usually looked like a series of emails back and forth to Air Force NOAA NASA which was kind of a guessing game of who you needed to include as well so okay thank you I'm running short on time so I'm going to ask two questions be submitted for the record uh one dealing with uh specific regulations that you would love to see taken off the books uh second uh since this is a committee on innovation in this space some of the workforce challenges that you all are seeing and Trends and how we can address that on the front end but I'm going to give my last 30 seconds to you Mr Goldman my district speaking broadly emergency departments and First Responders are having to invest upwards of 15 million dollars per County and I represent 12 in building out an updated emergency communication system can you touch on the work that SpaceX is doing in addressing those first responder Communications and where that might be a good alternative yeah we don't need the same sort of ground infrastructure to be built out we're already there we already have coverage so you don't need to do that initial huge we're kind of already done the huge investment up front and we can just with the deployment of user equipment we can come in and we're already actually working with a lot of First Responders in Florida to do that and I'm happy to work with your office to see what we can do specifically in our district excellent with three minutes seconds over okay thank you

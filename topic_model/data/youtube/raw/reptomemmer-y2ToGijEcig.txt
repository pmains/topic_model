congressman emmer happy national ag day let's begin by talking about how significant agriculture is to the state of minnesota wow happy national ag week not just day i mean uh look i don't think a lot of minnesotans who live in the 9 to 11 county metro out of the 87 counties in minnesota understand that the two primary drivers of our state's private economy happen to be ag and manufacturing ag is a huge uh factor in the economic uh prosperity of the state of minnesota and quite frankly uh minnesota farmers not only feed minnesotans mark they feed the world now i'm not sure if you're you're in dc right now i assume that you are and i've been seen on social media a lot of farm machinery on display at the national mall have you been able to encounter any of that no no not yet not yet but uh hopefully we will just another version of what i remember it's machinery hill as a kid at the minnesota state fair uh which right now has become farm fest right every august that's where you get to see the best stuff in minnesota but hopefully we'll get a chance to see it in d.c as we start to dig into some pressing issues for farmers in minnesota and across the country certainly input costs are a concern and i wanted to ask you about tariffs on fertilizer imports and what congress could potentially do to help ease that inflation on farmers yeah you know uh you say uh inputs are becoming a challenge i think it's a crisis our farmers mark are facing unprecedented price hikes ahead of the growing season when it comes to uh fertilizer in particular in fact fertilizer prices right now are their highest on record uh and you know it's not just the last two years that our farm families in minnesota and across this country have had to face uh and overcome incredible challenges they continue to be under enormous pressure between the high energy costs you know the cost of fuel the feed costs uh and now here comes fertilizer costs i you just can't afford another curveball and that what we're trying to do i even though you haven't asked me last week we sent a letter to the chair of the international trade committee jason kearns asking that he lift duties on fertilizer imports from morocco trinidad and tobago to try to lower the costs increase the supply of fertilizer that's available to uh minnesotan and american farmers and we are absolutely watching this issue closely and i think you can expect further legislative effect have you received a response from the itc yet yes yes and are you optimistic that these uh duties will be addressed in the short term or will this be a longer term solution well it's both i'm hoping that we get some short term relief but that's not going to be absolute relief remember fertilizer prices last week were nearly 10 higher than the week before according to green markets north america fertilizer price index that's the highest price point ever recorded prices are now actually 40 percent higher for fertilizer than they were a month ago just prior to the invasion of ukraine i one of the problems is you probably know mark uh russia is consistently among the world's leading exporters of fertilizer they have a trade volume of almost nine billion dollars on an annual basis and the us imports uh an estimated 10 billion or so a little bit more worth of fertilizer for uh crops each year or at least it did in the most uh recent year of record 2021 and of that a little over a billion almost a one and a half billion came from russia which uh is now off the market so with the sanctions that's bringing uh global trade with russia to a standstill it's imperative that we open up these uh other markets morocco trinidad tobago etc to try and lower costs and deal with this uh russian issue hopefully that will be a short-term help but we we've got to look at a more long-term solution because we have no idea what's going to happen uh with ukraine and russia going forward and certainly there's volatility because of russia and ukraine not only with fertilizer prices but grain prices in general and as you think about risk management tools that farmers need to have that segues well into work on the next farm bill what are you hearing and what's being discussed but you know what it's uh it's just beginning and i shouldn't say that because little pieces of it have been discussed all along but you're right i think the biggest concern right now uh it's not just the uh you know the the safety nets the uh the risk uh protection for farm farmers and farm families and people in the ag business in general mark but these high fertilizer prices the high fuel prices uh all of the challenges that our farm families are having across the country this is having a chilling effect on global food production not just uh uh you know in minnesota in uh across the united states but around the globe i i i'm concerned that we're gonna see uh some in our ag production say look i just can't take this risk this year because the costs are too high uh we don't know what the outcome is going to be that's going to create a whole other set of problems so i know that there is a big push even though we're in an election year to really start focusing in on what we're going to have to do with the next farm bill because it's imperative that we we reform it going forward i think farmers have some great ideas people in the ag industry have some great ideas uh it's about making sure that we know where the next generation of farmers coming from making sure that the existing generation is able to pass ag lands off not just to their own family members the people who are interested in farming period and then making sure that the programs that we have actually meet the needs as we see them before we run into a much bigger problem with uh you know potential food uh disruption supply disruption uh maybe as early as this fall and i think that's something that's on everyone's mind right now in washington switching to biofuels congressman emmer the clock is ticking on uh making a way for e15 to be sold during the summer months i know there have been uh bills introduced in both the senate and now in the house that would address uh the year-round e-15 issue what what are the prospects of that getting done in time for um the summer driving season so it's going to be tough i i mean i i'm trying not to put my partisan hat on here mark it's going to be tough because there is a uh from a procedural standpoint uh the uh those in charge nancy pelosi and company uh really are not doing the job necessary to move things i that being said the good thing which is a bad thing for the country and for our farm families uh the ag sector in general is this runaway uh gas prices the fuel prices are going to force well they already have forced some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who would like to kill uh all of this uh you know the the fuel that you and i uh whether it's biofuels whether it's regular traditional gas coal liquid gas etc their goal was to kill it when this session started mark and because of the challenges that americans are having not just in our ag communities but across the entire uh nation uh some of them have already started to change their tune and that might be a good thing for you and me and for our ag sector when it comes to uh our ag based fuels this uh time for year round e15 is so long overdue i and who knows maybe this is uh just the thing you know out of a crisis can come some some good and maybe this is one of those that we can see happen in the next several months congressman emmer anything else that you want to make sure we talk about today no i just i and to you and all your listeners mark hang in there i enjoy ag week i and i understand we're all celebrating all the work that you're doing but we also recognize the challenges that you have been up against not just right now but over the last uh well two years plus so uh we're in it together we'll finish this thing and better days are ahead mark you

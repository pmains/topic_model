THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE   GENTLELADY YIELD BACK OF THE THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES THE GENTLEMAN   FROM NORTH CAROLINA, MR.   MCHENRY, FOR FIVE MINUTES. MR. MCHENRY: MR. SPEAKER, I RISE TODAY WITH A HEAVY HEART --  THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE   GENTLEMAN WILL SUSPEND.  THE CHAIR WILL REMIND ALL  PERSONS IN THE GALLERY THEY ARE  HERE AS GUESTS OF THE HOUSE AND  ANY MANIFESTATION OF APPROVAL OR DISAPPROVAL OF THE PROCEEDINGS   IS A VIOLATION OF THE HOUSE  RULES. THE GENTLEMAN WILL CONTINUE. MR. MCHENRY: MR. SPEAKER, I RISE TODAY TO DELIVER A SPEECH TO   THIS BODY THAT NO ONE WANTS TO   DELIVER, BUT IT'S WITH A HEAVY   HEART I SPEAK TODAY IN HONOR OF  TIM, AN OFFICER WITH THE SHELBY, NORTH CAROLINA, POLICE   DEPARTMENT WHO WAS MORTALLY  WOUNDED IN THE LINE OF DUTY THIS PAST WEEKEND.  HE WAS DOING HIS JOB KEEPING   TOUR COMMUNITY SAFE WHEN HE WAS  SHOT IN THE LINE OF DUTY VERY  EARLY SATURDAY MORNING.  HE PASSED AWAY FROM HIS INJURIES ON MONDAY. HE WAS ONLY 38 YEARS OLD AND   LEAVES BEHIND HIS WIFE AND   4-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER DAPHNE.  OFFICER RAKEEN WAS A LAW   ENFORCEMENT OFFICER WHO LOVED  HIS JOB. LOVED WHAT HE WAS DOING. HE HAD BEEN WITH THE SHELBY  POLICE DEPARTMENT SINCE 2004 AND PRIOR TO THAT WAS A DETENTION  OFFICER WITH THE CLEVELAND   COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE. FOR THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS HE'S  WORKED AS A K NINE OFFICER WITH  HIS PARTNER, PSYCHO, HE HAD A  PASSION FOR HIS WORK AND   WELL-KNOWN THROUGHOUT THE  COMMUNITY. OFFICER OF RAKEEN AND HIS DOG  OFTEN DID DEMONSTRATIONS TO SHOW HOW OFFICERS AND THEIR CANINE  PARTNERS WORK TOGETHER TO KEEP   US SAFE. IN 2019 HIS SERVICE AND  DEDICATION TO HIS DUTY WAS   RECOGNIZED AS THE SHELBY POLICE  OFFICER OF THE YEAR. THE CITY OF SHELBY IS A TRULY  SPECIAL PLACE. SO IS THIS POLICE OFFICER. IT WAS SHELBY POLICE CHIEF JEFF  LEDFORD WHO SUMMED UP THE  OFFICER BEST WHEN HE SAID, TIM   WAS A GREAT PERSON.  IF YOU KNOW WHAT TIM WAS LIKE,   JUST LOOK AROUND THIS TOWN.  HE'S EXACTLY RIGHT.  BECAUSE, MR. SPEAKER, SHELBY IS  THAT VERY SPECIAL PLACE. IT'S A TIGHT KNIT COMMUNITY THAT EXHIBITS WHAT IT REALLY MEANS TO BE A COMMUNITY.  THAT WAS CLEAR MONDAY NIGHT WHEN HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE  IN THIS SMALL TOWN REPRESENTING  A VARIETY OF BACKGROUNDS PACKED  THE COURT SQUARE TO PRAY FOR HIS FAMILY AND HIS FELLOW OFFICERS.  AND IT IS CLEAR AS WE DRIVE  AROUND SHELBY ANTI-REST OF   CLEVELAND COUNTY, BLACK AND BLUE RIBBONS, AND THE MESSAGE OF  SYMPATHIES THAT ADORN THE  WINDOWS OF BUSINESSES AND HOMES, AND IT WAS CLEAR YESTERDAY AS  POLICE OFFICERS, FIREFIGHTERS,   AND EVERYDAY CITIZENS LINE THE   STREETS AND OVERPASSES TO PAY  RESPECT TO THIS FALLEN LAW   ENFORCEMENT OFFICER. AS THE PROCESSION TRAVELED TO  THE FUNERAL HOME.  AND THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME I HAVE SPOKEN ON THE HOUSE FLOOR   ABOUT THE SHELBY POLICE  DEPARTMENT.  IN JUNE OF 2015, AFTER THE   TRAGEDY IN CHARLESTON, THAT  HORRIFIC VIOLENCE THAT OCCURRED  THERE, IT WAS A SHELBY POLICE  DEPARTMENT THAT APPREHENDED THAT VIAL SHOOTER IN THAT EVENT.  AND WHAT WE SAW THEN WAS A   COMMUNITY WHERE FAITH LEADERS  FROM EVERY PART OF THAT REGION   WORKED HAND IN HAND WITH LAW   ENFORCEMENT TO REPLACE THE   DIVISIONS WE SEE IN OTHER PARTS  OF THE COUNTRY WITH THE  CONVERSATION AND UNDERSTANDING   THAT REPRESENTS THE BEST OF WHAT IS IN WESTERN NORTH CAROLINA.  I HAVE NO DOUBT SHELBY WILL  RESPOND TO THIS TRAGEDY IN   SIMILAR FASHION. WITH THE PERFECT TRAITOR OF THIS HEINOUS CRIME CAPTURED, OUR  FOCUS TURNS SOLELY TO PAYING   TRIBUTE TO OFFICER RAKEEN AND  HIS LIFE OF SERVICE. MR. SPEAKER, I EXTEND MY   CONDOLENCES TO HIS FAMILY,   ENTIRE SHELBY POLICE DEPARTMENT, AS THEY MOURN THIS TRAGIC LOSS.  MAY WE KEEP HIS FAMILY, HIS  FELLOW OFFICERS, AND ALL OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN BLUE IN OUR

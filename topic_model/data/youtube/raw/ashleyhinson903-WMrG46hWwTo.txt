well good morning everyone and thank you so much for joining us for another episode of hot seat with hinson i'm congresswoman ashley henson coming to you from iowa back home in iowa always great to be back home from our time in washington dc and today i have the pleasure of introducing you to a great candidate right across the mississippi river uh esther joy king she is running to flip illinois 17th district from blue to red so esther good morning to you thank you so much for stepping up to run uh please tell us more about uh what's happening in your race and uh your district right across the river from me yeah hi neighbor it's good it's good to be on hot seat with you ashley and i'm honored first of all so a little bit about who i am in my race um i ran actually in the 2020 election so what brought me to western illinois to run for congress my parents were christian missionaries in mexico is where i grew up so you can imagine with parents like that they just taught me esther if there's something wrong in the world it's our responsibility jump in make a difference do something about it and that fabric that that my parents wove into me growing up has just kind of been the theme of my whole life from when i first graduated from undergrad i the first job i took i went to be an aid worker in kabul afghanistan doing women's rights work in afghanistan that experience really inspired me to become a lawyer just seeing the contrast between afghanistan and the united states and we're so blessed here with this thing we call the rule of law i said i gotta get involved so i became a lawyer then joined the united states army as a jag officer so currently i'm an officer in the u.s army and served at the rock island arsenal here in the quad cities where i live and then you don't live here very long in western illinois without really realizing that the current representative is under representing us it's just kind of like everybody talks about it's like the word on the street and sherry bustos who has represented this district she's just moved really far to the left and it doesn't represent our midwestern values so people mentioned to me actually a business leader here in the quad city said esther with your background you'd be a great political candidate will you run for congress and with my parents teaching me it's my responsibility to jump in i was compelled yes of course like if not me then who i can't sit on the sidelines and complain if i'm not willing to step up and do something about it so led to me running in 2020 we were candidates alongside each other last time and i felt just short in that election and said i'm this fight's not finished so i'm running again in 2022 and it truly has been the honor of a lifetime to to get to know people my favorite part about this whole process is the people i get to meet for sure absolutely and so many great stories coming from the people that we represent and i know you've done a great job getting out in the community meeting with folks all walks of life and i want to start by saying thank you for your service as sir because you have really stepped up not only to help people who are underserved in afghanistan but um to help people in this country um through your service as an officer in the army so thank you uh for stepping up to serve our country and now you're stepping up to serve in a different way and i'm 100 on your team and want to make sure that you get to congress it's an open seat this time around so you have a great chance to make your case again to voters i think it's a really great opportunity to send another republican woman to congress and when you look at um the the history we made in 2020 we we got the path started for yester we we elected a record number of republican women um we elected minorities and veterans and um you um you know obviously have a great story to tell there uh what's your perspective on why we need more of of those kinds of voices yeah i'm truly honored to be to be part of this movement like you said it was such a big focus of the 2020 election uh and i think ashley you know this just as well as anyone people want people that are in touch with what they're going through whether it's being a mom like you are or for me uh balancing a career and and service and being in the military all these elements of just normal life that we're all walking through each and every day and taking that real world exposure and experience with us to washington d.c truly allows us to be excellent representatives of our communities and people are hungry for that that authentic connection that people know that their representatives hear them and understand them and so it really is cool to be a republican woman this is 2020 was just the beginning like you said and now it's exploding in 2022 and ashley because i ran last election cycle and i'm running again i've kind of become a key touch point for people when they're like oh who's a good who's someone we've got great candidates who's someone they can talk to to maybe learn a little bit more about being a candidate well esther she's been doing this for two cycles so i get to talk to a lot of republican women who are running and i am so impressed i'm so impressed with the quality of of people that are jumping in to serve this election cycle across the united states there are so many women running i i saw a statistic recently that there's more women running this election cycle than ever before and so i'm i'm just excited to help these women uh win and be part of the team that we all get to to washington dc join you and fight for for our voices and fight for our conservative values and believe it or not at this point we're fighting for our country so i can't wait for our country and common sense right and that's the thing i feel like common sense has just gone by the wayside i feel frequently and i say this all the time the kitchen table conversations are working families are having right here in iowa are not being reflected in the back room conversations of speaker pelosi's office or of the back room conversations happening in the white house and that's just wrong and it's very clear to me people are coming up to me at the grocery store right when i'm at the meat counter buying food for my family i'm talking about inflation talking about high gas prices um you know when when you look at those issues and how they really affect a family's bottom line you're hearing about that out on the trail too i'm sure yeah oh every day just a couple days ago a woman uh let me know her food prices her concerns over food prices she said esther the the amount of groceries i buy i can carry out of the store in just a handful of bags and it used to cost me forty five to fifty dollars that same amount of groceries one handful of grocery bags now cost me ninety to a hundred dollars right and she's just she's worried about paying for lunch for her kids and another mom she was like esther i drive my kids i three kids in three different schools and so i drive a lot every morning and i can't even afford the gas to now just take my kids to school in the morning and every every um time every conversation last night i was at a a homebuilders association dinner and just listening to small business owners they that like these people are the heart and soul of our economy our country and everything from workforce issues to supply chain issues i mean like you're highlighting washington dc the the white house the biden administration has caused these crises and it's affecting everyday americans and you get to talk to them every day i get to talk to them every day and it's we're fighting for them absolutely we are and it's a it's a very real fight because when i say they're turning a blind eye to these things it's absolutely true we've been calling on them to to do something about gas prices in the supply chain for more than a year we've been calling on them not to overspend because we knew exactly what that spending spree would do once they turned on that spending spigot last year and disrespected taxpayers in the process we said it would cause inflation and look we're at 40-year record high inflation so um we have a lot to fight for to get our country and our economy back on track and that's why i'm so pleased that you get it your constituents know you get it and i believe that they're ready to send you to washington dc to help us in this fight so um you've been running a great campaign you've been out in the district meeting with folks from all walks of life as i said so what's been the most exciting thing um that you've done um and if you could elaborate a little bit about um i know that you know you you look at your time in afghanistan and how important that was um it's personal to you what happened there it is yeah so um first of all campaign what's most exciting so the thing i love most about this whole process is just the people i get to meet i am a very extroverted personality and i joke that when i was a little girl my parents forgot forgot to teach me that cardinal rule don't talk to strangers so i just think everybody's my friend and running for congress is the ultimate meet new friends job description so i love love love getting to meet people and really having that human connection and find out from people like what matters to you it's really it's inspiring it just lights a fire inside of me when i talk about talk to families and moms and people that are struggling whether it's economic issues or i'm sure you you uh hear this a lot the the drug crisis the fentanyl flowing into our country i hear so many stories just from families or people that have lost oh yeah my my cousin my son my neighbor overdosed from fentanyl so that's another thing that i hear about regularly and it affects rural communities really directly so but what it gives me and what i what i really value is just that capacity to let someone know your story matters your voice matters and it inspires me to want to fight for us even that much more uh to represent the illinois 17th congressional district so that's one of my absolute favorite parts of this whole process is making new friends and meeting people all day every day yeah no it is great and i think what it does is it highlights that you're in touch with the people of your district and you will be a good representative because you you understand their plight you have their the context that you need to make decisions on their behalf and be their true advocate and um that's something that you've done not only here at home but um i just wanted you to talk a little bit about the work you did to help people who were um struggling after the bud administration's withdrawal from afghanistan completely botched withdrawal and um you know our office did a lot of work on this um you know to try to help people escape um the taliban and the oppressive regime there but you were able to do a lot of work there too because of your connections and your time there yes so uh to give a little bit of background so because of my my aid work in afghanistan while i was there my mom and dad actually came to visit me in afghanistan right after i graduated from college and they said you know what afghanistan needs a lot of love and support so my mom and dad actually moved to kabul afghanistan 13 years ago and started a school to help educate kids in afghanistan so they'd lived there for the last 13 years and they were not in afghanistan during the withdrawal because they'd come back to the united states and were on a sabbatical however their school was still running all of their teachers their students at the school their lives were directly in danger and so just knowing knowing these people personally my friends from when i lived there and worked there i said i have got to help and so i jumped into action mode and it certainly it it pays off being a member of the military i called everyone i knew and said hey do you know anyone that's on the ground and at the airport in afghanistan so i got in touch with soldiers who were in the airport and then i also running for congress is really helpful i called every every connection i had in washington dc and said hey do you know someone at the state department do you know someone can you help me and just what i ended up being ashley is i kind of became a project manager of evacuations and was contacting people and being like okay i have this family and people knew that i was involved so people started reaching out to me they were hey we know this american family they're at the airport they're at this gate okay let me help you can you email me their their paperwork really quick and i'll i'll submit their paperwork and we'll get their evacuation forms filled out and get it to all the soldiers at that gate and if they they have their pictures they they know what they're wearing so they'll be on the lookout for them so i kind of just started project managing evacuations at the kabul airport it gave me a frontline perspective on first of all the the incompetency the dear election of duty i would even say of our administration just how the biden white house made poor decisions and the state department just botched the withdrawal in so many ways and and but the common citizens just everyday people here in america that cared a lot of us veterans but also just people that were invested or actually one really fun story there's a there's a farmer in my congressional district they'd met an afghan family here on an exchange program so there were agricultural um cross-cultural meetings around agriculture and agriculture education and they'd had this afghan family come and stay with them for a few days all the way from afghanistan to learn about american agriculture so this family here in illinois 17th they had friends in afghanistan and the the wife of the family just she was like a dog with a bone helping this afghan family because they knew them personally so there's so many stories of just regular americans helping people on the other side of the world to save lives and i personally was able to be involved in 51 people getting out of the afghan airport and being safe and and and not having to live under the taliban rule but ashley you know this as well as i do there's still americans in afghanistan right now who are trying to trying to get out and what is happening from the white house we need accountability and it's why it's why we have we have got to take back the the majority and uh work to bring accountability in washington dc absolutely well you served as a great community connector and i i feel like that should be a good uh a good resume builder for you in terms of people who are going to be going to vote november knowing that that's what you did when you weren't even a representative yet imagine what you'll be able to do when you're a congresswoman so i look forward to having you as a partner in congress and i'm sure people will be excited to head to the polls to vote for you in november so what can we do

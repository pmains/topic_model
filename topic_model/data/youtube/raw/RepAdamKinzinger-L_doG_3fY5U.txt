appointed by republican uh presidents to the judiciary in the january 6 committee hearing this week i want to bring in congressman adam kinziger one of two republican members of that committee it was pretty stunning testimony as you as you look at the hearings that have been held so far what do you think is the bottom line takeaway for the american people look i think the bottom line to all this is first off nothing has changed in essence from those days so we could very much focus do this focus on this again but i think or the the thing i think that people need to stand out from these hearings is how much the president was involved in the lead up to january 6th how we got to a position where so many people charge the capital because honestly they believed that the election was stolen and i think you know in an american democracy how we've been raised to believe how we were formed you know if you truly believe that deep state owned the election and the democracy was stolen and the election was stolen that's the most logical outcome and that's what i want people to see is look the president knew what he was doing there was a plan but nothing's changed you say the president knew what he was doing in six and 10 americans according to our new poll with ipsos believe the president should be criminally prosecuted for his role in the january 6 insurrection but as you know there are difficulties in prosecution as well proving state of mind proving intent is the key factor there how do you do that look i mean what we can do from the committee's perspective is show you know as we have so far for instance the pressure that was coming down on mike pence and how the president knew what he was doing and how he had been stopped prior at other areas we're going to be talking thursday about some of the stuff with the doj we're going to have a discussion tuesday about state pressure and so you can see where the president knew all of that stuff we can i think show the american people that now what can the department of justice do in a court of law that's up to them uh they can you know have their own information they'll be able to see what we're doing here and it truly is unprecedented but let's be honest we this attack this attack on january 6 is unprecedented and the rot that led up to it is also unprecedented it is essential at this moment that we get a grip on this and figure out how to defend our democracy it's up to the department of justice in the end but have you reached enough have you reached the conclusion that president trump should be prosecuted i certainly think the president is guilty of knowing what he did seditious conspiracy being involved in these you know kind of different segments of pressuring doj vice president et cetera obviously you know we're not a criminal uh charges committee so i want to be careful in specifically using that language but i think what we're presenting before the american people certainly would rise to a level of criminal involvement by a president and definitely failure of the oath the oath has to matter here your your your personal demand to stand for the constitution has to matter and if you have people that don't regard that at all there is no law in the world that we can pass it's going to make a a bit of difference you're in a small minority among republicans only one of two republicans on the committee our new poll also shows a huge partisan divide 91 percent of democrats believe that president trump should be prosecuted only 19 percent of republicans 91 percent of democrats believe the president bears ultimate responsibility for what happened only 21 percent of republicans how do you explain that gap how to explain the views of a majority of republicans well look i i i would guess that before nixon you know really resigned you probably see something fairly similar now this is obviously we're in a way worse position i think today and i think this blows actually watergate uh you know out of the water but how do i explain it is leadership lack of leadership in the republican party so if you have people that don't trust what they hear on the media they don't trust what they hear from certain leaders and everybody has people they trust in where they get their information but that whole segment of leaders that republican voters trust that includes kevin mccarthy of course that includes donald trump and others if you're going to stand in front of those people and lie to him and tell him donald trump's right the election was stolen because that has you give me twenty dollars when i send you the next email or it's way easier for my primary election we can have no doubt that eighty percent of the country is going to believe what their leaders are saying this is where like if if you're not willing to tell people the truth in america you shouldn't run for congress like go just go go do something else but this should be a position where you can tell the hard truth and unfortunately my party has utterly failed the american people at truth it makes me sad but it's a fact that she said has also put you under some threat your staff shared some communications you and your family have received we can't put it up on the screen it's too ugly for that too dangerous for that how worried are you about your personal safety look i'm not worried personally um this threat that came in it was mailed to my house we got it a couple days ago and it threatens to execute me as well as my wife and five-month-old child i've never seen or had anything like that it was sent from the local area uh i don't worry but now that i have a wife and kids of course it's a little different there are people that there is violence in the future i'm going to tell you and until we get a grip on telling people the truth we can't expect any differently all signs are pointing to the next election having having a similar controversy at the end of the day it's it's very possible we're seeing allies of president trump being elected to run elections in state after state i've already pointed out the divide between republicans and democrats over what happened on january 6th how worried are you about 2024 very worried you know i have an organization country countryfirst countryonest.com one of the things we're focusing on are those like election level elections as well the people that will determine whether they certify an election you know what kind of equipment's being used we just saw recently in new mexico uh people refusing to certify an election because they used dominion voting machines which are actually really good voting machines but they bought into this conspiracy and this is the unsold thing we focus so much on what goes on in dc in congress in the senate but when you have these election judges that are going to people that don't believe basically in democracy authoritarians 2024 is going to be a mess and uh wake up america wake up republicans because this is not going to be good for you if you think it is congressman kinziger thanks for your time this morning you bet

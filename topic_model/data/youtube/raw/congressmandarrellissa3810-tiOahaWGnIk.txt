many things separate Darryl eisah from other candidates and in particular in a race for Congress Congress is after all a house that depends for its functioning on seniority and if you've got some it's worth a great deal not only to the individual member but to the district that he represents in this case we've got a man who is tremendously gifted articulate most important courageous but actually he's got the virtue especially it is a virtue in the house to be someone who has seniority now what the scene you already mean it means that in the committee's where he is seated he has a leg up on those who came afterwards and in Darrell's case it led him to become the chairman of the very very important Oversight Committee a responsibility that is a very high responsibility and one that he discharged remarkably in ways that I think no other chairman of that committee has well for all those reasons I am pleased being more than pleased I am delighted and heartily endorsed Darryl ISIF because we've been friends for many years but what it's really meant to me is that not only you can you trust his word but that he will take the initiative on behalf of his district or any cause in which he believes and give it as all and he did that repeatedly in his first tour of duty he will be I think in a more even more outstanding member in this return to the house where he has seniority where he is well known greatly respected and deservedly so so I am delighted to be here we are friends make no bones about that but even beyond that he is someone that deserves the recognition that he receive and he certainly deserves the vote of people who are looking to be well represented effectively energetically represented in his district thank you so much for your support and your endorsement in this race my pleasure

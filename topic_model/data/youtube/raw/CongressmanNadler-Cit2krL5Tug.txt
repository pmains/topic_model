Turner a master to me thank the gentleman for yielding Mr Speaker I rise in support of the fast Act which authorizes 305 billion dollars over five years for highways transit and rail including M track although many of us would have preferred much higher funding levels the conference agreement provides an increase in funding of twelve point eight billion dollars above the House bill and twenty six point eight billion in guaranteed funding above fiscal year 2015 levels the funding increase allows us to preserve core highway and transit programs and still invest in new key areas New York State will get an additional one and a half billion dollars above current levels in highway and transit formula funding over the life of the bill of which an estimated five hundred million dollars will go to projects in New York City the bill provides four and a half billion dollars for the new Freight program originally created in the House bill for large-scale multimodal projects critical to our regional national economy this was a key recommendation of the freight panel in which I was ranking member along with mr. Duncan is chairman and I'm very proud that it is included in the final conference report the bill increases funding for transit including the major programs that benefit New York such as section 53 40 high-density state program the state of good repair program and capital investment grants and it preserves the ability to flex other transportation funding to a major transit projects and most of pleased that the conference report authorizes ten point two billion dollars over five years for intercity passenger rail including eight billion for Amtrak dedicates resources for Northeast Corridor improvements and provides two hundred million dollars to help commuter railroads implement positive train control it also increases the liability limit on rail passenger accidents to 295 million dollars retro actively to help cover claims for those killed or injured the Amtrak derailment outside of Pennsylvania last May I commend chairman Schuster ranking member DeFazio my fellow conferees for all their hard work and finally bringing a long-term transportation bill to fruition it's been too long I'm glad we finally did it I urge all my colleagues to vote for this conference report I yield back

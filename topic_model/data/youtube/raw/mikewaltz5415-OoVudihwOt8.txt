joining me right now is florida congressman house armed services committee member and former green beret commander michael waltz congressman it's always a pleasure to see you welcome back uh what are your thoughts on what the us should be doing a couple of weeks ago we spoke when you said look ukraine can win with just a few things that they need do you still feel that way and what's your uh uh assessment of the us's response well i agree with zielinski president biden should go to ukraine uh pelosi just went and if she can get in there i think the president the united states uh could get in there too to be an incredible symbol uh and signal not only to russia but also to china uh and a an ongoing rallying cry uh to the ukrainian uh resistance fighters think of those poor souls uh that are in the mario steel plant right now fighting to the better end holding down over a dozen russian battalions uh but he should go maria and one other thing though on on pelosi's visit there was a lot of tough talk from her that's fine but guess what the house is out of session right now the senate is in but the house is out and if she's serious uh about giving ukraine everything they need to win then call us back into a special session and get that 33 billion dollar aid package pass well i think i think you make such an important point and the same goes for the house's response to issues around china i want to get your take on these new concerns over a potential deal that would allow a chinese company with links to the ccp to take control of forbes media uh in the securities and exchange commission disclosure last month the spec that the purchase would be done through magnum opus acquisition ltd noted that chinese officials could take operational control of forbes now congressman you were first to point this out and you sent a letter to janet yellen the treasury secretary last week you write we have this letter here that you sent you write should the ccp have a major footprint in your respected u.s media entity they will be able to spread propaganda through a platform here at home undermine undermining american interests congressman what's going on why is it that it seems that the congress as well as this administration rolls over when it comes to china your thoughts on where this deal stands well maria the reason the ccp is the most dangerous adversary the united states has ever faced is that they've corrupted so many elements of american society as you have rightly covered we already have academia hollywood wall street sports industry the hedge fund major hedge funds and we could go down the list and now uh they're looking to get their tentacles uh into major media conglomerates uh as well why don't we just go ahead and and sell them the wall street journal and fortune magazine and you know every every other uh icon of capitalism this is how the ccp operates and my letter to secretary yellen as head of the scipios board that looks at what things should be exported and allowing for in transactions in our major infrastructure is that telecommunications major media companies on how americans get their news should be considered major infrastructure it should be investigated by cyphus and if it's not then i want answers from secretary yellen on why not well accomplishment you also have the federal retirement thrift investment board now apparently going to open the doors uh this is an 800 billion dollar fund and it's the 401k for our military men and women i mean you know this better than anybody uh you you you probably you have this 401k uh federal thrift savings plan and they're going to be making a second attempt to put chinese companies into the thrift federal savings uh plan we're going to talk with marco rubio coming up on this he's been very aggressive and outspoken on it but what are your thoughts about tsp participants uh owning companies that may very well turn around to be the companies that uh that lead the ccp to try to overtake the united states as the number one military power thank you and maria think of the sad irony uh of our soldiers sailors airmen and marine who are out on the front lines who are out in the pacific ocean right now sending portions of their paycheck home to retirement uh saving for retirement and the board overseeing it is investing those billions and their retirement savings into the market of our greatest adversary that has its defense companies openly listed one of them's bow high shipyards that just launched last year two new nuclear ballistic missile submarines and we were able to engage president trump on this he immediately called for a stop to it and and told this board to cease and desist and they did uh but now they know they can get away with it again and and we have to get out of this mentality of wow uh we're just seeking the best returns we are funding uh their military build up with our dollars congressman we're going to keep a spotlight on

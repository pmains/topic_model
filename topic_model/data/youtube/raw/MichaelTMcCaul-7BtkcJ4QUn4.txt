it's great to be home in austin and in the western district uh i wanted to come by just to really say thank you and to um you know we're dedicating this new space uh but we're really dedicating the men and women of this task force and the great work that you do whether it's the sheriff's office police department u.s marshals service working together to bring fugitives back to justice you know a year ago today the number one fugitive was hunted down and killed bin laden it was really the beginning of the end in the war on terror but it really began a long time ago you go back to 1993 one of the other greatest fugitives we've ever had ramsay youssef tried to bring down the night of the world trade center in 1993. he was not successful although he killed many people and he fled to pakistan where i've traveled many times as the congressman and he went to islamabad he met up with his uncle khalid sheikh mohammed another fugitive the mastermind of 911 and from what there they talked about flying airplanes into buildings so when ramsay youssef was eventually arrested and fred burton in town with uh stratfor as one of the persons involved with that takedown they found something very eerie in his hotel room and it was these baby dolls 12 baby dolls filled with chemical explosives and the plot was to take these baby dolls on 12 different airliners and blow up the airplanes simultaneously fortunately we caught him before he could carry out that sinister plot but it does give you some insight into the mind the sort of evil genius behind of the terrorists he was eventually brought back to new york where he's in prison today again a great uh piece of work bringing fugitive to justice and um they pulled the blindfold off his head and said see you didn't you didn't do it you didn't pull it off he said i would have if i'd had a little more money and i'll talk to the marshals involved with that arrest and then of course to clean sheikh muhammad his uncle was able to pull off one of the greatest attacks on u.s soil in 2001 september the 11th then successfully bring down the world trade center unfortunately we caught him another great fugitive brought to justice he sits in guantanamo bay i've had the opportunity to see him at the time i saw him was actually during prayer hour as he laid prostate over his prayer right and he looked up we could see him he couldn't see us but again this evilness this darkness that's out there but i can tell you this with the killing of bin laden i believe the beginning of the end is is near it's not perfect in afghanistan i just got back there last november there's still a lot of work to do we do not want that to become a safe haven again for the terrorists but locally here the work that you do whether it's counterterrorism work whether it's bringing these sex offenders to justice and so many of them have been brought to justice whether you deal with fugitives going to mexico bringing them back just yesterday i was down in laredo chairing a field hearing with congressman cuellar and we met with the task force similar to this down there as you know the mexican border is a very dangerous place and in fact in nuevo laredo i believe that the cartel violence is going to increase not decrease over the next year with that comes a threat to i think texas and to the united states you know this corridor i-35 is the route that they use to bring in the drugs and and bringing the violence uh to texas but the great work uh here uh the men and women i wanna just highlight three cases that i was reading uh last night it was just fantastic federal prosecutor and as someone who worked in ag's office and somebody who worked on these issues in the past the work you know you know bring sex offenders to justice as well it just gives me great pride to stand here before you today no longer a prosecutor but one always at heart once in law enforcement always as an alumni but it gives me just such great pride to stand before you to say thank you for all the great work you've done but i want to highlight three cases that i found to be just outstanding colton uh peteniak the 2006 murder on ut's west campus of jennifer cave we all remember this one a brutal murder uh where her body was dismembered to he was eventually apprehended in mexico and given a 55-year sentence he's serving in tdc as we speak paul gilbert defoe 2007 capital murder fugitive he shot and killed six individuals one from marvel falls for george johnstown and one 81 year old grandmother from serene castle pennsylvania a grandmother he's on death row currently one thing i did when i worked for john cornyn was i oversaw all the death row appeals and what how you feel about the death penalty maybe a point of personal conscience or religion but i can tell you the cases that i presided over are so horrific that i believe it is warranted in many of these cases like this one killing a grandmother another one william willie griffin hayes county attempted capital murder on march 16th out of parole he lured a 17 year old girl brutally stabbed and sexually assaulted her and left her for dead at the hayes county blanco county line the victim's ability to recall the events led to his arrest within two weeks these are just three of many many cases that y'all worked on really trying to bring the worst the baddest apples get them out of society and get them behind bars so they can't repeat these awful defenses again so with that i just want to again say thank you the threats out there not just from the drug cartels not just from the terrorists but really just from homegrown criminals who want to do harm many times to children which is the worst in order to hold people or unsuspecting victims and so what you do really makes a difference and really at the end of the day in life that's what it's all about is making a difference so know take pride in your work that every day when you're out there trying to bring these fugitives to justice that you are making a difference in public safety and the lives of the citizens of central texas so thank you so much for having me thank you

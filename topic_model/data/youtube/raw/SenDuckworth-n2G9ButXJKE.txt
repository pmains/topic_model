mr. duckworth Thank You mr. chairman miss Cornwall can you speak a little bit to whether or any of the ladies if any of your spouse's brutality against from the military side or were spoken to by their chain of command or you said the GOS that they're gonna stay in their Lane can you talk a little bit to that upon leaving my husband's knew he did receive a phone call from his major that he was very upset that my husband Hatton kept him in the loop which was actually not true either because we also had a conversation with him about what was happening on the base um so while my husband didn't have anything in writing my husband did receive a phone call okay either wonderful my husband was never retaliated against but I do want to say that his chain of command has been extremely helpful for the families coming forward now that everything has come out in the media and they are aware of the issues they have encouraged families to come forward and have said that they would help if there were families that needed the help my husband was never personally retaliated against and however during the midst of our situation and this happens numerous times I've heard several people attest to the same situation the housing communities will call our husbands command and tell lies things that are completely untrue trying to get our spouses in trouble that happened to us personally my husband's command did take our side in that situation but that happens a lot where these housing companies reach out to command in order to try to get command in trouble or to get the military person in trouble so they're outright either lying I'm not just intimidating but I'll right lying to the change of command is yes absolutely unacceptable um can you any of you speak a little bit too in the amount of time I have left a little for a minute too any type of disability accommodation so issues that you might have with disability issues one of you has a daughter with a hurt knee I believe my daughter has a rare genetic condition and it affects her ability to walk sometimes she has issues with her knees and before we moved to Fort Meade the korvia staff assured us that we were placed on the wait list in time that we would be able to be accommodated with a one-level home and just a few days before we arrived to Fort mean they told us that the house is no longer available and when we explained to them the issue we told them this when we signed for the house when we signed the lease the first time and also when they called us five days before arrival that we did need a one-story home that they said they didn't have anything left and if we wanted a home we had to take what was being offered which was the townhome did the a chain of Manor the military families with special needs office do anything to help you in this case we didn't reach out to anyone because everything was just happening so quickly and we were already just in the height of PCs season it was the middle of the summer and we didn't think that we would be able to have our needs accommodated I we didn't even sign into my husband's unit yet so we didn't know who really to reach out at the time thank you for your very brave testimonies ladies thank you mr. chairman thank you sir

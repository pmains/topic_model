what's happening here from the standpoint of the ordinary consumer is very simply highway robbery literally every day they drive they are paying excessive rate as a result of market dysfunction and agency in action we're saying to this agency that it must act using its emergency powers because there is an emergency very simply within the intent of Congress this kind of broken markets is exactly what the CFTC should be addressing through the use of its emergency power and we are giving it not only the authority but the compulsion to act effectively we're talking about more than just inconvenience for consumers it is a crisis for our economy our all too fragile recovering economy is threatened by this speculation which truly is out of control the most meaningful statistic for me is that eighty to eighty-five percent or more of the futures delivery contracts are being bought by people who have no intent or desire to take delivery and who economically have no justification for buying them except to profit and so consumers are paying out of their pockets for profits of the traders and speculators and potentially the manipulators I've asked for the Department of Justice to investigate using the task force that was appointed a year ago and so far has done little or nothing President Obama is right we need to do all of the above one of the above should be stopping speculation because none of the above will work if the markets aren't working the Department of Justice has a Financial Fraud Task Force that is supposed to investigate potential illegality in these markets issuing some subpoenas compelling some witnesses using grand jury subpoenas if necessary would be perfectly appropriate if there is evidence of illegality which I think they're likely is so I've urged the Attorney General the United States to take such action through that task force which has been in existence for more than a year that is action that will tell the markets we are watching we are enforcing the law we are not passive or by standing we will make sure that consumers and the economy are protected and you know speculators exploit fear or apprehension part of which results from international events part of it from consumption but that kind of message to the markets can be very effective

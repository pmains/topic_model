well i mean it's it's a complex issue i just got back from Russia and you really get the sense of mr. Putin's trying to dial back to pre sort of cold war-style like Stalin the the Baltic nations the former Soviet bloc countries I think he has a desire to want to take those back and I think he also sees a little bit of a weakness now with this administration to be able to do that I think as you said our budget cuts back the Defense Department to just right after World War two budgets so I think they see a little bit of weakness I think they're making a move like they did in Afghanistan in the 70s so they have they basically annex Crimea now into Russia we are going to be voting on sanctions we did vote on loan guarantees to Ukraine but it's it's complicated issue that I don't think any anybody wants us to put troops over there but it is concerning in terms of the outright aggression on the part of one nation into other areas

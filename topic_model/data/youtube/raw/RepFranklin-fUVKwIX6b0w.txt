thank you to our witnesses you've endured a lot over these last several hours but i appreciate your time today i had held great hopes that we would get to the bottom of some of the the events that happened on january 6. it was no doubt a dark day in our country's history unfortunately this hearing has not been anything like i would have anticipated uh this is not an effort to get to the truth it's not to find out what really happened it's nothing but a political show and let me dive into that a little bit but first i do have a question for for our three witnesses and first chief conte which law enforcement agency would you say has the primary responsibility for protecting the capital the united states capitol police thank you sir mr rosen would you agree with that assessment i do agree with that the the capitol police are part of the legislative branch and are responsible for security at the capitol okay thank you and mr miller would you agree as well yes i agree okay thank you all uh it is interesting that we have no one here from capitol police today um chief conte this this will be a question coming to you but on on january 3rd the capitol police issued an internal report called a special event assessment stating that the intelligence and interagency coordination division was tracking several protests that were to take place on january 5th and 6th that there were indications that the protesters could be armed it doesn't appear that that internal report was shared with other law enforcement agencies or the fbi was your agency made aware of that report no not prior to january 6th that's correct would it have been helpful information to you to know that there was another cooperating source that there might be armed folks come taking place in those events on the 6th i believe it was it would have been helpful but the metropolitan police department just in terms of our deployment we had signs posted on the national mall regarding individuals who could be armed that kind of thing but i certainly would have been helpful great thank you um a similar report was issued by the fbi's field office in norfolk we've heard about that it was in the press warning that extremists were sharing online plans to travel to d.c encouraging each other to be violent and quote ready for war the fbi claims that information was shared with the field office in washington and then subsequently the joint terrorism task force which includes capitol police the park police dc metro police among others um chief were you were you aware of that report from the norfolk fbi office no it was emailed to us to our agency okay so that that was emailed to the agency but not didn't make it to your attention okay that's correct yes sir okay our understanding as well uh chief son of the u.s capitol police uh claims that he didn't receive that report either seems to me like that'd be some pretty critical information to know but um everyone seems in agreement that the the capitol police would be the agency uh most responsible for uh protecting the capital and yet they're not here today i i can't for the life of me fathom why if we're gonna call a panel of witnesses that the agency primarily responsible for safeguarding this institution wasn't invited to participate that's that's another question for another day so beyond that another another topic that came up here it was brought to my attention mr rosen and mr miller the two of you along with secretary mccarthy received a letter from mayor bowser on january 5th are you familiar with a letter i'm talking about or should i refresh you guys on it i'm familiar it's attached to my written testimony okay and could you elaborate for for all of us here a little about of what the mayor was stating in her letter to you uh yeah she she wrote to the uh army secretary and to uh the acting secretary of defense and me and just indicated that she wanted us aware that um i'll just read the the beginning as the law enforcement agency charged with protecting residents and visitors throughout the district of columbia the metropolitan police department is prepared for this week's first amendment activities mpd has coordinated with its federal partners namely the park police and u.s capitol police and u.s secret service all of whom regularly have uniform personnel protecting federal assets in the district of columbia and she goes on and clarifies or expresses that the district of columbia government has not requested personnel from any other federal law enforcement agencies and to be clear the district of columbia is not requesting other federal law enforcement personnel and discourages any additional deployment without immediate notification to in consultation with mpd if such plans are underway well thank you and it seems to me that that's important information and you know again i would love to have the mayor here so we could ask her directly about some of this but for whatever reason my colleagues across the aisle have not deemed those witnesses to be important enough to bring before us today i look forward to getting to the bottom of this when we're ready to have a serious hearing apparently that's not the case today but thank you madam chair you're back

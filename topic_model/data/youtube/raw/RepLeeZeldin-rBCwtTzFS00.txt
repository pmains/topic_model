Thank You mr. Speaker I rise today to discuss my resolution h.con.res 20 in July of 1999 three brothers Yi Li 25 years old Agron 23 years old and Mehmet Batu Qi 21 years old who were born in the United States and resided in Hampton Bays New York went overseas towards the end of the Kosovo war to fight mass war crimes aimed to eradicate the civilian Albanian population from Kosovo these three men left the comfort and safety of their homes in the u.s. to embark on a civilian humanitarian mission they were trying to stop abroad those horrific crimes against humanity it was done during that time in that civilian humanitarian mission that they were arrested after accidentally crossing into suburb Serbian controlled territory two years later two weeks later they were given a judicial order of release instead the brutal execution of these men followed shortly after and it was not until 2001 two years later that their remains were found in a mass grave while Serbian authorities have investigated the deaths of the brothers there have been no charges brought against those responsible for those murders moreover the main suspect remains a prominent member of the governing political party today we remember Ely Agron and ma'amed for senselessly and brutally murdered eighteen years ago since taking office over two years ago I've been committed to helping the Batu Chi family receive the Justice they have long deserved I've been in contact with the family as we work to resolve this in the last Congress I introduced h.con.res 51 calling for justice to be served in these horrible murders and imploring the Serbian government to make it a priority that this must be properly investigated and that those suspects be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law I'm proud to have reintroduced this resolution in the 115 Congress has h.con.res 20 it is absolutely reprehensible that despite many promises by Serbian officials to resolve the case no individual has ever been found guilty of this horrible crime nor of any crimes associated with the deaths of these innocent Americans it is a responsibility of the Serbian government to resolve this case and my resolution notes that progress into this investigation should remain a significant factor which determines the further development of us Serbian relations their inaction on finding and prosecuting those responsible is the insult not only to the memory of Yi Li a grandma met and the Batu Chi family but to every American the Batu Chi brothers gave their lives to fight injustice it is now upon us to return this favor and deliver justice for their family those responsible for these unspeakable acts against our citizens must face the law and his vital that the Serbian government steps up and does what is right 18 years later it is time we put an end to this sad story Thank You mr. Speaker I yield back

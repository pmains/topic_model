Mr. Speaker,
I am pleased to rise today in support of the Boots to Business program. Running a small business requires a wide variety
of skills: one day you’re the company’s accountant, the next day you’re researching
marketing strategies. Many of our servicemembers have the temperament
and experience to excel as small business owners and entrepreneurs, but they lack the
industry-specific skills to turn that dream into a reality. The Boots to Business program helps bridge
this gap by offering exiting servicemembers and spouses a two-day in-person course on
business ownership followed by more in-depth instruction through an eight-week online course. Since the program launched in 2013, more than
50,000 service members and spouses have participated, learning how to start and grow businesses
– and thereby grow our economy. This month, I introduced the bipartisan Veteran
Entrepreneurship Training Act with my friend from Iowa, Congressman Rod Blum. The bill would codify the Boots to Business
program. Our veterans served our country with honor. They deserve our support as they transition
from military to civilian life. I urge my colleagues to join us on this bipartisan
effort.

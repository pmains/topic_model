thank you mr chairman thank you to our panel uh this this is very timely obviously i i'm excited that we can have this a type of engagement uh i i i just think it's a unifying issue certainly the expertise on our panel here i'm grateful for for your participation traveling my district recently i got to visit a a specialty coffee auction uh it's called zabooni specialty coffee uh that is this coffee auction that actually as pointed out before you know we we know that trade agreements need to be mutually beneficial and so it's exciting to see when a business in rural nebraska as i represent can you know have a place in the world especially as commerce is related where this coffee auction can actually make sure that growers in africa get a greater share of the of the price paid that a lot of folks across america are willing uh to pay and so i i just think that any trade agreements that can reduce the trade barriers that's great for businesses here but that's great for for growers in in kenya too and across africa so i i'm anxious to to see things proceed here i i do have concerns that perhaps the eu with their very protectionist agriculture policies not based on science i might add and then obviously china as has been mentioned several times uh moves the goal post and so forth uh you know that they're setting the stage and i i'm just wondering if what we can do right now and to prevent these two entities the eu and china from from getting their foot in the door and that would reduce the opportunity that we might be able to experience so if all of you would want to answer hopefully briefly in the in a limited amount of time ms lisa if you want to start

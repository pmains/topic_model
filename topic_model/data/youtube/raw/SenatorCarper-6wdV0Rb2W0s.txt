OBJECTION. MR. CARPER: MADAM PRESIDENT, I RISE TODAY TO DISCUSS THE CHIPS AND SCIENCE ACT, A BILL APPROVED BY THE SENATE YESTERDAY, AND I'M TOLD JUST APPROVED LITERALLY IN THE LAST SEVERAL MUTES BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. IT'S A BILL THAT I'M PROUD TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT, ALONG WITH MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES. THIS BIPARTISAN LEGISLATION WILL INVEST IN OUR NATION'S SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY, STRENGTH AT ANY AMERICA'S MANUFACTURING COMPETITIVE EDGE OVER FOREIGN COMPETITORS, AND REDUCE SUPPLY CHAIN BURDENS OVER -- THAT EXIST WITH RESPECT TO OUR COUNTRY AND OUR PEOPLE. YESTERDAY'S VOTE MARKED AN IMPORTANT STEP IN PROVIDING AMERICA THE AUTHORITY TO SET THE RULES OF THE ROAD FOR A 21st CENTURY ECONOMY. I WAS PLEASED TO JOIN SO MANY OF OUR COLLEAGUES IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL SO THAT STATES LIKE DELAWARE, LIKE NEVADA, CAN CONTINUE TO PUNCH ABOVE OUR WEIGHT IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY FOR YEARS TO COME. MADAM PRESIDENT, WE PROBABLY ALL HEARD THE SAYING BEFORE TODAY, THEY DON'T MAKE CARS LIKE THEY USED TO. WELL, SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES KNOW, MANY FOLKS IN DELAWARE KNOW, I CAN ATTEST TO THAT PERSONALLY. FOR TWO DECADES, I DROVE A 2001 CHRYSLER TOWN AND COUNTRY MINIVAN, A SILVER ONE, AFFECTIONATELY CALLED BY MANY THE SILVER BULLET. IT HAD 600,000 MILES ON IT. I WENT TO THE DMV, I TOOK WITH ME THE YOUNG MAN THAT WANTED TO BUY IT, THEY ASKED HOW MUCH I WAS GOING TO SELL IT FOR, I SAID $1. THE LADY THERE AT THE DESK, AT THE DMV SAID, WELL, ALL I HAVE TO DO IS TURN IT OVER, SIGN THE TITLE ON THE BACK. $1. AND SO I WROTE $1, AND I SIGNED THE DOCUMENT, AS DID THE PURCHASER. THEN THE LADY, THE DMV, SHE SAID THERE IS A TRANSFER FEE THAT YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR THE VEHICLE. I SAID WHAT IS IT? SHE SAID 3%. I SAID 3% OF $1? SHE SAID YES. I PULLED A NICKEL OUT OF MY POCKET AND GAVE IT TO HER, AND SAID KEEP THE CHANGE. MY OLD MINIVAN IS MORE POPULAR AND FAMOUS IN MY LITTLE STATE THAN A LOT OF PLACES THAN I WAS. ANYWAY, THAT VEHICLE HAD SEEN EVERY CORNER OF THE FIRST STATE, WITH SOME 600,000 MILES TO HER NAME. SHE CARRIED CARPERTOWN STAFFERS, CONSTITUENTS, FAMILY MEMBERS, AND EVEN A FUTURE PRESIDENT. WHEN IT CAME TIME TO RETIRE HER EARLY LAST SUMMER, THROUGH ANGUISH AND HEARTACHE, I OPTED FOR A SLIGHT UPGRADE, A RED TESLA Y, THAT MAYBE SOMEDAY WILL HAVE 600,000 MILES ON IT. WE'LL SEE. LET ME TELL YOU, THEY DON'T MAKE CARS LIKE THEY USED TO. THEY MAKE THEM A LOT BETTER. A WHOLE LOT BETTER. AND A WHOLE LOT CLEANER, AS WELL. ON TOP OF BEING FULLY ELECTRIC, LET ME SAY THAT TWO, THREE, FOUR YEARS AGO OUR SELECTION OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES, LOW-EMISSION, NO-EMISSION VEHICLES WAS LIMITED, VERY LIMITED. THE FOLKS FROM TESLA WERE LARGELY OUT OF THE GATE FIRST, THE PEOPLE FROM G.H. HAD COME UP WITH A -- FROM G.M. CAME UP WITH A VERY GOOD HYBRID VEHICLE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. IT TOOK A LONG TIME FOR US TO GET INTO THE BUSINESS, BOTH DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN MANUFACTURERS ARE BUILDING AND SELLING FULLY ELECTRIC VEHICLES. BUT ON TOP OF BEING FULLY ELECTRIC, RIGHT WHEN YOU STEP IN THESE NEW CARS IS, INCLUDING THE ONE I OWN, YOU SEE A WORLD OF TECHNOLOGY IN FRONT OF US, A STATE-OF-THE-ART TOUCH-SCREEN GPS SYSTEM, BACKUP CAMERAS, DIGITAL HEATING AND AIR-CONDITIONING CONTROLS. IT'S A FAR CRY FROM MY OLD MINIVAN THAT DROVE SO MANY MILES. THE ODOMETER DIED ON ME AT 500,000 MILES. I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW MANY MILES IT HAD, BUT IT HAD A LOT. AT 500,000 MILES, I WENT TO DOVER DOWNS, THE MIRACLE MILE, THE MONSTER MILE, WHERE WE DO AUTO RACING, NASCAR, AND THEY LET ME DRIVE MY MINIVAN AROUND THE TRACK AS FAST AS IT WOULD GO, HOLDING THE STARTER FLAME OUT THE WINDOW. I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO RIP MY ARM OFF, BUT IT DIDN'T. ONE RIDE IN A CAR LIKE MY NEW ONE, IT'S CLEAR AUTOMOTIVE TECHNOLOGY AND THE AMERICAN ECONOMY HAVE DRASTICALLY ADVANCED IN THE LAST 20 YEARS. THAT'S THANKS IN PART TO THE ADVANCES OF SEMICONDUCTOR TECHNOLOGY, OR SOMETIMES WE SAY CHIPS. NOW, FOLKS AT HOME MIGHT HAVE READ ABOUT CHIPS. I THINK THEY MAY HAVE HEARD ABOUT SOME CONNECTION WITH SEMICONDUCTORS, AND OUR SUPPLY CHAIN WOES ON THE NIGHTLY NEWS. THEY STILL WONDER WHAT THAT HAS TO DO WITH THEIR EVERYDAY LIVES. SO HERE IT IS, A LITTLE CHIPS 101, CHIPS 101 BEFORE I GET IN MY NEW VEHICLE AND HEAD FOR THE DELAWARE STATE FAIR. AS FAST AS I CAN GO, LEGALLY, LEGALLY. CHIPS 101 -- A SEMICONDUCTOR OFTENTIMES REFERRED TO AS A CHIP IS COMMONLY USED MATERIAL IN TECH MANUFACTURING MADE OF ELEMENTS LIKE SILICON THAT ARE VALUED FOR THEIR ABILITY TO MANAGE THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY. OUR TECHNOLOGY, A CHIP AS SMALL AS A PUZZLE PIECE OR SMALLER THAN A FINGERNAIL IS VITAL FOR CREATING THE PHONES WE CARRY IN OUR POCKETS, OUR PURSES. THE WASHING MACHINE IN OUR BASEMENT, THE TELEVISION IN OUR FAMILY ROOMS, AND ALL THAT TECHNOLOGY IN OUR NEW VEHICLES. BUT MORE THAN THAT, SEMICONDUCTORS HAVE A VITAL ROLE TO PLAY IN SOME OF THE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT THAT MONITORS OUR HEALTH AND THE WEAPONS SYSTEMS THAT PROTECT OUR COUNTRY. BUT AFTER TWO YEARS OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND ECONOMIC SHOCK, UNPREDICTABLE SHUTDOWNS ALONG WITH LABOR SHORTAGES AND LOGISTIC FAILURES HAVE LED TO SEVERE SUPPLY CHAIN CONSTRAINTS. THESE SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES HAVE CAUSED THE SAME INFLATION THAT AMERICANS HAVE SEEN PLAY OUT IN EMPTY SHELVES AT THEIR LOCAL GROCERY STORES OR IN NEW TECHNOLOGY THEY'VE SAID UP FOR YEARS TO BUY, BUT ARE HAVING A HARD TIME FINDING IT ON THE MARKET AS OF LATE. JUST LAST MONTH SENATOR JOHN CORNYN AN I CHAIRED A FINANCE TRADE HEARING AND IT WAS A HEARING ON SUPPLY CHAIN RESILIENCY AND WE DID IT TO TAKE A LOOK WHAT THE CAUSING SUPPLY CHAIN BACKLOGS AND HURTING AMERICAN CONSUMERS. WE HEARD THAT DAY FROM THE EXPERTS ABOUT THE NEED FOR GREATER INVESTMENTS IN SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING HERE AT HOME AND ABOUT THE VULNERABILITIES WE FACE WHEN COMPANIES THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY, MAYBE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD, CAN DETERMINE THE ECONOMIC SUCCESS OF AN ENTIRE AMERICAN INDUSTRY. BECAUSE OUR MANUFACTURING SECTOR RELIES ON THIS TECHNOLOGY, WE BEHOLDEN ON THE COMPANIES THAT PRODUCE THE SEMICONDUCTORS. THAT'S INCREASINGLY A PROBLEM WHEN AMERICA'S SHARE OF GLOBAL CHIP PRODUCTION DROPS FROM 37% IN 1990 TO JUST 12% TODAY. OR WHEN MORE THAN 75% OF CHIPS ARE MANUFACTURED IN ASIA ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD. THIS RELIANCE ON FOREIGN MANUFACTURERS MAKES OUR ECONOMIC AND OUR NATIONAL SECURITY VULNERABLE TO GEOPOLITICAL SHOCKS FROM HALFWAY AROUND THE PLANET. AND THAT'S A PROBLEM FOR COMPANIES IN MY STATE, DELAWARE, AND YOUR STATE OF NEVADA, MADAM PRESIDENT. BUT ONE OF THE COMPANIES THAT I WOULD MENTION FROM OUR STATE IS HOLOGIC, AND THEY'RE LOCATED NEAR THE UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE, NORTHERN PART OF OUR STATE. THEY RELY ON A RELIABLE STREAM OF SHIPS TO PRODUCE MAMMOGRAPHY MACHINES. FOR HOLOGIC, A LOWER AMOUNT OF CHIPS MEANS A STRUGGLE TO REPLACE AND REPAIR OLD MACHINES THAT MEN AND WOMEN RELY ON FOR CARE TO DETECT BREAST CANCER. AFTER MORE THAN TWO YEARS OF THIS PANDEMIC AND CANCER SCREENINGS ALL-TOO-OFTEN DELAYED FOR MONTHS, THAT MEANS MORE CLINICS AND DOCTORS' OFFICES WITH OUTDATED EQUIPMENT WILL OFFER LIMITED SCREENINGS, AND THAT MEANS MORE WOMEN IN STATES LIKE MINE, LIKE YOURS ACROSS AMERICA WILL HAVE TO PUT SCREENINGS THAT COULD SAVE THEIR LIVES ON THE BACK BURNER. AND THAT'S JUST ONE VERY SERIOUS REAL-WORLD EXAMPLE OF WHY THESE INVESTMENTS ARE CRITICAL TO FAMILIES AND THEY'RE CRITICAL TO BUSINESSES UP AND DOWN THE FIRST STATE AND ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. SO, MADAM PRESIDENT, WE CAN AND WE SHOULD TAKE ACTION TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE WEAKNESSES IN OUR ECONOMY AND TO COMPETE WITH COUNTRIES LIKE CHINA IN THE PROCESS. THAT'S WHY I'M PROUD TO SUPPORT THE CHIPS AND SCIENCE ACT. IT'S A MUCH-NEEDED INVESTMENT FOR THE MANUFACTURING OF SEMICONDUCTORS AND THEIR DEVELOPMENT OF OTHER CRITICAL TECHNOLOGIES IN OUR COUNTRY AND WILL PROVIDE TAX INCENTIVES TO MAKE OUR TECH SECTOR THE ENVY OF THE WORLD ONCE AGAIN. BY INVESTING IN AMERICAN-MADE CHIPS, WE CAN REDUCE COSTS OF TECHNOLOGY FOR AMERICANS, WE CAN IMPROVE SUPPLY CHAIN RELIABILITY AND WE CAN CREATE NEW OPPORTUNITIES AND JOBS FOR A LOT OF AMERICAN WORKERS. BY INVESTING IN THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION AND THE AMERICAN INNOVATION HUBS, WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO JUMP-START AMERICAN INNOVATION AND GROWTH ONCE ENG.N.P. THIS LEGISLATION WILL MAKE LIFE A BIT EASEIERS FOR BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS ACROSS AMERICA, FROM CAR DEALERSHIPS IN DELAWARE ON THE EAST COAST AND IN YOUR STATE OF NEVADA OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GREAT WEST, FROM CAR DEALERSHIPS THAT DON'T HAVE ENOUGH INVENTORY TO MEET CUSTOMER DEMANDS AS TO BEING ABLE TO ACCESS CRITICAL PARTS. AND AS SECRETARY RAIMONDO AND THE DEFENSE SECRETARY HAVE MADE MERE OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS, INCLUDING A LEAVING THEY HELD WITH US, THIS BILL WILL BOLSTER BOTH OUR ECONOMY, BOTH OUR ECONOMIC AND OUR NATIONAL SECURITY. NOT ONLY THAT, TO NOT ACT, TO NOT INVEST IN AMERICAN JOBS IN MANUFACTURING, SECRETARY RAIMONDO DESCRIBED IT WOULD CAUSE -- HER WORDS, THIS IS A QUOTE -- IRREPARABLE HARM TO THE UNITED STATES ECONOMY AND THE UNITED STATES MILITARY OPERATIONS, CLOSE QUOTE. BECAUSE WHEN AMERICA ISN'T IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT, SOMEONE ELSE IS, AND THEY'RE TAKING THE WHEEL. AMERICA MAY WELL FALL BEHIND AS A RESULT. SO WE HAVE NOT JUST AN OPPORTUNITY, I THINK WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO AMERICAN CONSUMERS AND TO OUR NATION'S WORKFORCE TO INVEST RIGHT HERE AT HOME. THE ACTION WE'RE TAKING SHOULD BE THE BEGINNING RATHER THAN THE END OF OUR EFFORTS TO STRENGTHEN ONCE AGAIN AMERICA'S ECONOMIC COMPETITIVENESS. THERE ARE MANY BIPARTISAN IDEAS ON THE TABLE THROUGH DEBATE ON THIS LEGISLATION. I HAVE SOME IDEAS THAT DIDN'T MAKE IT INTO THE FINAL BILL. MANY OF THEM WERE WORTHY OF OUR FUTURE CONSIDERATION. AS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE FINANCE COMMITTEE ON INTERNATIONAL TRADE THAT I LEAD WITH SENATOR CORNYN, I WILL CONTINUE ADVOCATING FOR GREATER ECONOMIC ENGAGEMENT IN OUR ALLIES ACROSS THE GLOBE AND ESPECIALLY, ESPECIALLY IN THE ASIAN PACIFIC. THERE IS MORE WE CAN DO. I'LL SAY THAT AGAIN. THERE IS MORE WE CAN AND MUST DO TO STRENGTHEN SUPPLY CHAIN RESILIENCY AND SUPPORT AMERICAN WORKERS AND INNOVATION. I WAS PROUD TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF CHIPS AND SCIENCE ACT BECAUSE, FIRST AND FOREMOST, I SERVE THE PEOPLE OF THE FIRST STATE, AND YESTERDAY'S VOTE WILL MEAN INVESTMENTS THAT CREATE JOBS FOR DELAWARE WORKERS AND STATES AROUND US. WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN OTHER STATES THAT WORK IN DELAWARE EVEN THOUGH THEY WORK IN PENNSYLVANIA OR NEW JERSEY OR MARYLAND. BUT YESTERDAY'S VOTE WILL MEAN SUPPORT FOR THE TECHNOLOGY THAT KEEPS OUR LOVED ONES HEALTHY AND SAFE. AND IT WILL ALSO MEAN MORE AFFORDABLE GOODS DELIVERED FASTER TO FAMILIES IN THE FIRST STATE AND EVERY OTHER STATE. I WANT TO COMMEND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES FOR THE ACTION THAT THEY TOOK TODAY IN PASSING THIS LEGISLATION, AND, MADAM PRESIDENT, WHEN I LEAVE HERE TODAY, I'M GOING TO GO OUT AND GET IN THAT RED SPORTS CAR THAT I DRIVE THESE DAYS, AND IT HAS INCREDIBLE MUSIC, INCREDIBLE MUSIC CAPABILITIES, AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW. MOST CARS HAVE THAT THESE DAYS. I THINK FIRST I'M GOING TO HEAD FOR THE DELAWARE STATE FAIR, WHICH I LOVE. THE FIRST TIME I RAN FOR OFFICE -- A MILLION YEARS AGO -- I'LL PROBABLY PICK OUT SOME MUSIC TO LISTEN TO. THE FIRST SONG -- THE FIRST SONG I THINK IS A WILLIE NELSON SONG, "ON THE ROAD AGAIN." AND I'M GOING TO GET ON THE ROAD AGAIN AND HEAD FOR THE FIRST STATE, FOR THE DELAWARE STATE FAIR AND LOOK FORWARD TO MEETING A LOT OF PEOPLE. I WISH YOU A GREAT WEEKEND. AND TO MY IT COLLEAGUE, DAN SULLIVAN FROM ALASKA, MARINE COLONEL WHO IS ABOUT TO TAKE THE FLOOR, HAVE AT IT.

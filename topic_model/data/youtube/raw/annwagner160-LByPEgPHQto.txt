Greenfields testimony the projected representation among women and people of color in the industry over the next 10 years is expect to continue increasing we look forward to hearing more about that dr. green fields research shows that there are different areas of strength and weakness when the industry within the industry when it comes to representation for women she says that retention is an area of strength while hiring and promotions are areas of improvement where improvement is needed for people of color hiring is an area of strength while promotion and retention our areas for more focus is needed these findings are reflective what what this subcommittee has heard from multiple witnesses that while there are clear efforts being made by the industry to improve and a clear acknowledgement of the benefits of a diverse workplace good work is being accomplished and more can be done I look forward to learning more today about the current state of diversity and inclusion within the financial services industry the direction it is heading and how Congress can help promote the best practices and strategies that we hear about today I'm proud of this committee for examining these important issues and applaud the chairwoman for her efforts in this space thank you and I yield back thank

all right Mississippi Republican senator Senate rules committee member Roger wicker with us right now senator thank you for coming good to be with you so how does it look to you shaping up to be a big day and I do think there's a reason the stock market's up over 300 points and has been up in like numbers this whole week and I really think the job creators in this country see this happening and and all of the efforts to get to real tax reform and real increase take-home pay for Americans is about to to come to fruition and we're going to make a big step either tonight or tomorrow so you think it's still set for a vote certainly before the weekend and and that the John McCain's decision to vote for this was that crucial to you well it is crucial because you know well you can only lose three and we lost him once before so yes but also his statement is exactly right this will provide a great boost for the economy and and much-needed tax relief for Americans and I think it's going to create jobs now on do so no I'm sorry sorry you uh you know better than I that behind the scenes they're doing a lot of wheeling and dealing and then that's natural here but one of the ideas being expressed is to maybe raise that corporate tax rate from the 20% being been at about 21 22 percent and that could do a lot to to secure other votes for other means I can get into the other means but on that what do you think well I would not like to see that I would think we would want to stay at the 20 you know some of our European and Asian competitors are lower than that in terms of corporate rate and looking to go even lower if they possibly can so that's that is a measure of how we treat job creators and I'd like to stay at the 20 I think we can nibble around the edges of these various scores without without raising that 20 percent corporate rate up to 21 or 22 rather not do that would you rather not do with some of your house counterparts have feared you might do not use facility with the Senate you know an up or down vote after all this is done in the Senate assuming it's passed and lead it to the house to just vote yea or nay on what you've come up with no I I think I think we all acknowledge that we're going to conference and as a matter of fact and a senator who goes over and checks with my brothers and sisters on the house side and I met with leader McCarthy yesterday and he made it clear we're going to have to have a little conference and and are not out some of these differences but but the the major outlines the major bones of these proposals are very similar and I think we're going to get there all right I like the way you say we're gonna have to have a little confidence in my dad you say we're gonna have to have a little chat senator thank you very much very good seeing you thanks for having me

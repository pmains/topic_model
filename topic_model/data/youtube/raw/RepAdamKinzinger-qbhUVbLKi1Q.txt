congressman adam kinzinger of illinois is a member of that committee and he joins us this morning good morning to you congressman do you expect this to be more of building a public narrative or will new information come to light in these hearings well i think certainly new information will come to light i think it's important you know we've been talking about january 6 now for a year and a half it's important for us to lay the whole story out in front of the american people from both what led to january 6 the lies after the election the fundraising the 187 minutes the president basically sat in the oval office and and everything since including the response by dod and it's important for us to be able to put that in front of the american people because ultimately they have to be the judge yeah you know the department of justice will make decisions based on information but the american people are going to be the ones that have to take the work we've done and decide what they want to do with it or what they want to believe after that you know we keep hearing from the committee including the chairman that there will be members of congress requested to come and speak and answer your questions it's still none of them have come really are are you in favor of subpoenaing members and if so who do you need to talk to well i won't say who i think we need to talk to yet i mean i think everybody needs to come and talk to us we've requested information from various members in terms of whether we move forward with a subpoena is going to be both a strategic tactical decision and a question of whether or not you know we can do that and get the information in time we make every day yeah i mean i think ultimately whatever we can do to get that information i think if that takes a subpoena it takes a subpoena but i think the key is regardless of even what some members of congress are going to tell us we know a lot of information around it we right now we're kind of not even building a broader narrative we're going deeper with richer and more detail to show the american people a lawyer for congresswoman marjorie taylor-green said this week she was not a participant in the january 6 violence she was a victim there were text messages revealed this week in which she was discussing martial law with mark meadows then chief of staff do you need to ask her a few questions yeah i mean i'd love to ask her a few questions we know some things i won't confirm or deny the text messages of course but let me just say this for marjorie taylor to green green to say she's a victim it's amazing how you know folks like her attack everybody for being a victim i mean she assaulted i think a survivor's family from a school shooting at some point in d.c she stood outside a congresswoman's office and yelled at her through a mail slot and said she was too scared to come out and confront her and then when marjorie taylor green is confronted she's all of a sudden a victim and a poor helpless congresswoman that's just trying to do her job it's insane we want the information look history is not going to judge her or people like her that are buying the big lie well i firmly believe that vice president mike pence did the right thing in terms of certifying the election he is a central player in this story as a republican do you want to see him come forward and actually speak to you yes i would love to see that i hope you would do so voluntarily uh these are decisions i think that we're going to end up making from a tactical perspective in the next you know week or two as we basically pin down what this hearing schedule is going to look like the content and as we go into the full narrative of this thing i would hope and think that the vice president would want to come in and tell his story because he did do the right thing on that day if he doesn't then we'll look at the options we have available to us if there's information we don't already have right i know you're not a fan of the former president but he is in some ways playing a very large role in some upcoming primaries in ohio in particular jd vance he's endorsed a number of other candidates pennsylvania herschel walker georgia if those hand-picked candidates end up winning is this a sign that indeed donald trump is still the leader and king maker within the party yeah i think it would be a sign and i think you know there's that's going to be a big this primary season is going to be a big moment to figure that out so i have this uh organization countryfirst country1st.com and our focus is on playing in some of those primaries to bring at least reasonable people to the forefront encouraging folks that are going to live for instance in a guaranteed republican district you know vote in that primary it matters and uh so yeah i do think the primary season is going to going gonna tell but keep in mind the president's the former president's tactic here if somebody starts falling behind in the polls he always finds a reason to unendorse them because he doesn't like having a losing track record well jd vance so that's what may third when you say reasonable people you don't think reasonable people are voting in the ohio republican primary for him well you know look from what i've seen there's uh one at least maybe reasonable candidate but no i mean look if you if you're jd vance two years ago you know you're a totally different jd vance than you are today this is a guy that said that he frankly doesn't care what happens in ukraine it's very similar to what people like tucker carlson have said um look i i mean that can't for me as a republican that doesn't represent what i believe and the party has to make the decision if they want to be that kind of party or not speaker pelosi and top democrats were in ukraine overnight as i'm sure you know do you see impediments to getting this 33 billion that the president has asked to be passed i certainly hope not i mean look there's we do have outliers of people that seem to show some putin sympathy but for the most part congress is vastly and largely united on the issue of ukraine we recognize ukraine is fighting for all of us that 33 billion is significantly less than what we would have to spend if we took russia on directly so i hope we don't have any impediments to that at all i wouldn't expect we do senator kaine was with us and he said it is too soon to begin talking about potential use of force in ukraine do you think he's right no i don't i don't think we need to be using force in ukraine right now i just introduced an aumf an authorization for the use of military force giving the president basically congressional leverage or permission to use it if wmds nuclear biological or chemical or used in ukraine doesn't compel the president to do it it just says if it is used he has that leverage it gives him you know a better flexibility but also it is a deterrent to vladimir putin if vladimir putin wants to escalate with the west he will it's easy for him to do it uh and i think right now what we're doing with supplying with lynn lease with the financing is right but there may be a point that we have to recognize you know look this is at world wars prior to world war ii there were moments nobody ever wanted to get involved and eventually came to realize they had to i hope we don't get to that point here but we should be ready if we do all right congressman adam kinzinger thank you for your time today

pleasure thank you mr chairman i really appreciate this round table uh the issue of public safety is one um we can call this a round table but let me tell you people back home are talking about it at their dinner tables um this is very real and and very very troubling in too many parts of my state and and in in and across indian country and and has been for a long time i have shared with the committee that we have seen studies and news reports that have documented the public safety crisis in in my state one in three alaska native villages lack any law enforcement presence so think about what that means when there is no law enforcement presence these communities that have no presence then have no justice when you think about those communities that are off the road system almost four times as many sex offenders per capita compared to the national average we again i've shared this with committee members but we had a then attorney general barr out to alaska came to to visit the small village of nepaskiak this was back in 2019 he looked around he listened he declared a law enforcement emergency he stated that the isolation of alaska villages contributes to law enforcement problems not seen anywhere else in our nation and he made this declaration of emergency in recognition that quote alaska has the highest per capita crime rate in the country and the unique circumstances of alaska's geographical and jurisdictional landscape and so we've been trying to build on the the momentum of that designation since that that time of course covid didn't didn't help in our efforts uh we saw just further ramped up instances of domestic violence five domestic violence homicides in only 10 days in in rural alaska the number of calls to our domestic violence shelters increased 52 percent we know in this committee all too well the disproportionate uh number of missing and murdered individuals within the american indian and alaska native population the steps that we have taken here as a committee with the not invisible act the savannas act what we did with the with the bipartisan effort and a good strong effort on the reauthorization of vawa 2020 i think we're i think we're moving in the right direction as we as we look to how we can address this public safety crisis in in meaningful ways i was very proud to see last week three alaska women were appointed to the not invisible commission michelle demmer tammy giroux vivian corthias they're going to do a fabulous job and provide valuable perspective to that commission but as we think about the vawa reauthorization and all that that is going to mean across indian country i'm very thankful that we were able to move out of this committee a strong expanded tribal title and um and do so in a way that that was bipartisan we have a very unique and complex jurisdictional landscape in alaska as a result of the alaska native claims settlement and because of that legal framework we were effectively alaska tribes were effectively left out of avawa 2013 but working with advocates across the state and in response to really years of a lot of good work there we were able to include the alaska public safety empowerment pilot project to to help tribes in alaska provide for public safety and justice in our native villages and and so now we get to the implementation part this is the hard part but i am confident that alaska tribes are up to the job they're good partners they will be good partners with the state um just as we have seen the tribes in the lower 48 do as they're providing safety in native communities in addition to empowering tribal courts resources are critical of course we included in the omnibus spending bill last year an increase of five million dollars for cold cases and mmi w activities also an increase of four million for tribal courts and pl to 280 states so we're making some headway there but i hope i hope that with this roundtable today we can have a broader discussion about what do we need on the capacity side what do we need to to really strengthen our tribal justice systems so mr cleghorn i'm going to ask you uh to start out and again thank you for for your work and and the work of the team at the alaska native justice center as you focused on on how we strengthen self-determination of alaska tribes um so what do we do how do we what more can we do to strengthen tribal justice systems in alaska and and maybe maybe the way to start the the conversation is to share the main challenges that we're seeing with our tribes in alaska as they have worked uh over the years to develop justice systems so it's a it's kind of a broad question but it gives you room to run here alex and i i know you can you can feel this and and many of the other questions that we'll have well thank you senator murkowski and i do want to start by thanking this committee and you and senator schatz for holding this roundtable and for your efforts in vawa it has been long fought and we know that the hard work starts now and i'll take the question in two parts right so what have the challenges been i think uh the challenges have been in addition to what you laid out a real lack of understanding of the impacts of anxiety and public law to 80 upon tribes and the difference in our land status not being 1151a indian country and while the pilot project is important and exciting i think that 813 a is not to be overlooked here right that re-affirmation of inherent authority and now the alaska-specific land-based definition for uh you know personal jurisdiction that we were lacking and i think that that is um something that we will be clearly communicating to state partners throughout the state around the scope of authority that tribes do have now and i think that that in addition to the challenges around understanding confusion around the status of tribes and their inherent authority it's been funding has been a real challenge and here i think it's helpful to contrast what alaska tribes and tribal organizations have been able to do with our tribal health system with consistent funding tribal authority and self-determination we have a tribal health system that all alaska native people in large part are proud of that is an example uh of what self-determination can do and what it looks like so if i can interrupt there because i think your point about um about understanding and and a little bit of education here um i think it is important to to remember that for our pilot it's it's not just any tribe can now uh move forward and um and exercise this this special criminal jurisdiction an interested alaska tribe has to apply to the department of justice to participate there's a preference for villages that have a populations that's predominantly indian and that lack a permanent state law enforcement presence because we want to get out to the remote rural villages the tribes will have to meet the criteria set by doj which will include having a tribal justice system that can adequately safeguard the the rights of of the defendants i i know that there's been some discussion or perhaps confusion in the state um where a a a tribe located just outside of of the anchorage municipality um uh there was there was confusion between what they're trying to do with uh with areas of law enforcement and whether or not it fits within what we're doing with a special pilot and and i think it is something that goes back to just an understanding of what we're trying to what we have established through the pilot program and and what some of the existing authorities are so we're we're talking about funding which is is so important when you talk about the consistency of funding because as you know we we kind of fight every year for a little meager plus up in npl 280 funding it used to be that alaska's pl 280 states didn't get tribal court funding so we're starting to work our way in but there's no consistency to any of this so there's a couple a comment to you on the funding side but but also a comment um that i might have you respond to just with greater understanding as to um what we're what we're hoping to accomplish with our special tribal jurisdiction well and thank you for highlighting that senator i think that um you know we've begun getting the word out i think that that is a long road in being very clear about the pilot project and the sideboards that are around that that the tribes in alaska that are interested in doing that first we've got the two-part preference and then we have the same kind of process or questions that need to be answered as tribes in the lower 48 and those are the indian civil rights act concerns making sure that when we're talking about building establishing reaffirming tribal criminal jurisdiction over non-indians that all of those are in place this is not something that is automatic there's not a light switch that has now been turned on what is available to alaska tribes in the in the pilot project is the runway that we are no longer shut out and that we can have tribes who are interested and ready to start moving down that runway and so we we are excited to be involved in that process in whatever way is helpful and you raise the question also of confusion i think that there continues to be real misunderstanding throughout the state on some core issues including whether or not alaska has tribes and that any opportunity we can share the basic fundamentals that there are tribes in alaska that their jurisdiction is clear and that um you know that uh angsa did not terminate tribes and that uh tribes are not all of a sudden because of the pilot project uh you know going to be exercising criminal jurisdiction over non-india i think that meeting people where they're at providing clear factual information and answering questions and also trying to help keep the temperature low right sometimes this gets to be a very heated discussion and people have concerns i think that part of anjc's role is as a you know trusted place of um you know information uh for those that have those kinds of concerns well and yeah no we thank you for that and and again for the leadership that ngca is it provides here i am hopeful that uh our legislature is going to um uh well i believe they have passed the the legislation that would allow for that tribal recognition um and and hopefully that that is signed by the governor um uh but again that's happening on the state side mr chairman i have uh i think that it's not just in alaska that we are focusing on what we need to be doing to build uh tribal capacity in order to to implement special criminal jurisdiction i know that you have tribes across the country that might have some some good and helpful ideas best practices that we can look to in alaska i might ask nikki borchardt campbell um from the american indian court judges association if she's got any advice for us on on how we build out the capacity but i know my colleagues are also waiting for an opportunity to raise questions but if she might speak to that quickly and then we can move to others absolutely um thank you with regard to trying to build out capacity with our uh tribal justice systems you know that's always um a tricky question only because when we're thinking about the special tribal criminal jurisdiction there it's multifaceted so we need to unders and understand that we need to build out our codes we need to review and revise codes we need to support our justice systems and ensure that we have sufficiently trained judges which we we do and to also support those justice system personnel as well in order to make sure that they're understanding the types of cases that are coming in and support those technology needs as well um in addition you know we have some amazing courts and justice systems who went through the initial pilot program in 2013 and who have been working with the inter tribal work group with the national congress of american indians and other organizations who have been meeting quite frequently to discuss the capacity needs the capacity issues and have been sharing those best practices in monthly calls and in regular trainings and additionally we also make sure that our tribal court judges are not only receiving the nuts and bolts but what they need to know about managing cases hearing certain types of cases and addressing those criminal justice needs in their communities but we're also looking at innovative practices as well so what are the best types of interventions based on these types of cases and then they're also leading from the bench they're looking at the types of cases coming through they're looking at the data they're looking at the community and they're leading from the bench by trying to create specialty courts they're trying to create solutions in addition to um you know of course just leading in an adversarial way and so i know that we might talk a little bit more about you know restorative justice and traditional justice practices but those types of things are also coming into play when we're talking about preventative services and really trying to help families and like mr cleghorn said meeting people where they are and really trying to address some of those underlying issues that are bringing individuals into the justice system to begin with thank you mr chairman sen

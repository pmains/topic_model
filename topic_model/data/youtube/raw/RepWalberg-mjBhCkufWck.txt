Thank You mr. Speaker I rise today in support of s 3201 opioids heroin fentanyl and fentanyl like substances have ravaged communities of all of us like mine across this nation synthetic opioids have claimed the lives of tens of thousands of Americans last year and I've heard firsthand some of those devastating stories from friends neighbors and constituents in my district the DEA has been able to combat this part of the epidemic by changing the scheduling so that the administration could combat all fentanyl related substances passing s 3201 will allow law enforcement the leeway to properly combat these fentanyl like substances my support of this measure is strong but I'm admittedly frustrated we need to make this scheduling classification permanent we cannot let expiration dates approach while political games that we've seen for months and months now take the spotlight and consume precious legislative time that could have indeed helped to deal with some of the concerns my friends on the other side of the aisle have expressed about about minimum mandatories and criminal justice reform we've come dangerously close to the expiration of the temporary order making fentanyl related substances schedule one I urge my colleagues to support s 3201 but also encourage immediate action to be taken to make these changes permanent and stop using political games to stand in the way of doing things like this pass this legislation today and I yield back

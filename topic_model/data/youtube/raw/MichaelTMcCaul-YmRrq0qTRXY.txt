thanks Jim and I want to thank heritage and we're also honored to have attorney general ed Meese here I joined the Justice Department's he is transitioning out and dick Thornburgh was coming in and what an honor it is the c/e sir one thing Jim left as I by five teenagers so when it comes to homeland security issues i feel like i am a lot of personal expertise on the home front but i want to think the heritage foundation for having me i can't think of a better forum to deliver this speech i normally don't get prepared remarks but in this case i am and i'm going to cover a lot of territory but we will have a very robust Q&A healthy discussion and dialogue about the many issues facing nation you just mentioned the strike yesterday where we took out the leader of the Khorasan group that was hugely significant one of the biggest external operations threat to the homeland into the united states and i commend our military for their efforts in doing that you know last week Tara did strike in the American heartland and this was the type of event we've been worried about probably the most lately a radicalized suspect not on the radar screen launching an assault here on US soil killing United States Marines and a sailor in this individual was inspired by a hateful ideology and he attacks soldiers who risked their lives to protect us in the name of freedom and our hearts go out to the families and friends who were killed in Chattanooga where r consolations cannot outweigh their loss we can honor the memory of the victims by confronting the root of the violence we saw last week and refusing to allow complacency to fall in the wake of terror and that is why I'm here today I'm here to tell you that radicalism is on the rise and war is being brought to our doorsteps if it happened in Chattanooga it could happen anywhere anytime and i agree with British Prime Minister David Cameron who said this week that we faced a struggle of our generation a deceitful perverted brand of Islam is expanding globally and a great cost to the free world and we need to act decisively to defeat it first I'll talk this morning about how this new age of terror has altered the security landscape on the home front and spread rapidly throughout our communities then I will address a second front in our struggle with extremists overseas and how important it is for us to take the fight to the enemy and challenge its ideological core but first I'm disappointed to announce that I believe we are losing on both fronts in this war against Islamist terror our enemies have the momentum and they have thrown us off balance the numbers don't lie last year was a deadliest year on record for global terrorism with the tax rising by thirty five percent over the previous year and terror deaths worldwide nearly doubling the motive power behind the terror surge is the rise of Isis and its affiliates as well as Al Qaeda's persistence and by any measure we have failed to turn the tide against them their global recruitment has soared their territory held or expanded and the number of plots against us has spiked the pace is so staggering that I directed my committee staff to begin issuing a monthly terror threat snapshot cataloging the rise and extremist activity since the president declared Isis to be the JV team of terror early last year the group has inspired or directed more than 50 terrorist plots against the West Isis also went from a single terrorist sanctuary to having a direct presence or affiliates in 18 countries the group's rapid rise has inspired more than 25,000 citizens from at least a hundred countries to fly to Syria as foreign fighters a figure that has tripled tripled since last July and officials now estimate that more than 250 Americans have sought to join or succeeded in joining extremists in Syria terrorist groups have succeeded in spreading their influence because they have evolved gone are the days of bin Laden where extremists plotted through couriers and caves we are now seeing a new generation of terrorists radicalizing and recruiting online across borders Americans are especially concerned that we are losing on the home front where groups like Isis have started to permeate our society with terrifying speed there are people right here in our country intent on striking from within captivated by an evil and twisted ideology that drives vulnerable minds into unconscionable acts of violence and hate we have seen more than a dozen Isis linked terror plots in the United States including recently thwarted plot plans to set up pipe bombs on a Capitol Hill behead law enforcement officers conduct mass shootings detonate bombs at New York City landmarks and livestream a murderous rampage at a college campus we even disrupted terrorist plotting to attack July 4th celebrations in the United States in fact more than 60 Isis supporters have been arrested or indicted in the United States in the United States in the last year that more than one per week and now the FBI director says that he has open Isis investigations in all 50 states the majority have never set foot in a faraway safe haven and were recruited by Isis online or distributed the group social media propaganda and with over 200,000 Isis tweets per day this is an astounding number over there are over 200,000 Isis tweets per day how can we possibly get a handle over this the chatter is so high and the volume is so loud that's difficult to get a handle this isn't terror as usual this is terror gone viral I commend the FBI Homeland Security and state and locals for their disrupting of these many plots but as we saw in Chattanooga we cannot stop all of them in this age of peer-to-peer terrorism authorities are searching for suspects who use secure apps we call dark space to communicate and crowdsource their calls for attack inspiring operatives who have never never have crossed into the borders of Syria but cross over borders through the internet to conduct acts of terror Isis cyber commanders now regularly send out internet directives and mrs. to their followers as we saw in Garland Texas sometimes our first indication of a hatch plot is an Internet hashtag we need to have a frank conversation in America about the challenges posed by violent extremists using social media and dark space to further their violent plots extremists have migrated away from telephones and onto new platforms but our laws and policies have not kept pace making it more difficult to uncover terrorist plots they communicate in darkness and we can't shine a light on the darkness to see what the communications are too back in the United States I don't claim to have all the answers to this I've started a working group with the FBI and homeland and justice to and the intelligent knee high tech community to get some answers now but what I do know is that we all share some common ground from Silicon Valley to the halls of Congress this has to be the starting point in an urgent dialogue between the high tech sector and policymakers to find solutions for the lawful monitoring of violent extremists while at the same time protecting civil liberties we also need to do more to stop the spread of fanaticism before it leads to violent plotting we spend billions of dollars to detect and disrupt terror plots but we have dedicated few resources towards embedding and preventing the radicalization at the root of terror this is called the crucial prevention aspect of counterterrorism and sadly wall extremists recruiters are moving at broadband speed we are moving at bureaucratic speed the administration is not appointed a lead agency in charge of combating domestic radicalization and few resources or personnel or even allocated to it when asked by our committee the top departments and agencies can only identify around 15 million dollars with an M million being spent and around two dozen people working full-time on this issue that's basically it and that means we've arrested twice as many Isis recruits in the United States this year then there are full-time officials working to prevent Isis from radicalizing Americans in the first place in a high-threat environment I believe this is unacceptable and every day we wait we cede more ground to our adversaries as chairman of the Homeland Security Committee I will not stand on the sidelines asking for more reports and studies while terrorist plot inside our communities murr murder our people murderer millet kill our US Marines and servicemen and seek to divide our nation last week my committee decided to push forward a bill to streamline and raise the priority and focus of the Department of Homeland Security's efforts to combat the viral speed of violent extremism for instance our bill would give DHS the tools to combat Isis and al Qaeda propaganda here at home through counter narratives that show Islamist terror for what it really is it would also help DHS empower local communities to spot signs of violent radicalization and help them develop off ramps to discourage individuals for being lured overseas to fight with terror groups or from being convinced to commit acts of violence at home ultimately we must recognize the best homeland defense is a good offense and to win this war against Islamist terror we have to take the fight to the enemy overseas I spent the last weekend in Tampa Florida meeting with our generals and leaders and top intelligence and operations officers at the US Central Command and Special Operations Command at MacDill Air Force Base and I'm proud of the work they have done to dismantle terror groups and their focus on defeating Isis and the recent victory in taking out the leader of the Khorasan group but the White House strategy under which they are operating is flawed it only gives them the authorities to contain Isis rather than to roll back and defeat it now some turkey and they said we need to drain the swamp so we don't have to swat the mosquitoes we all know Isis will replenish its ranks and that's a fact for the numbers we have killed over there and strikes they've replenished an equal amount and we all know that they will expand globally until we've eliminated at the source in Iraq and in Syria yet right now we are fighting with one arm tied behind our back under the current strategy the rules of engagement are apparently too high to strike important targets and the number of military trainers is too low our forces being kept from fully assisting with the fight and the president has taken options like ground troops off the table telegraphing weakness to our enemies as a result Isis has been able to hold an extend key territory in Syria and Iraq despite our airstrikes and the Iraqi government is beginning to rely on Shia militias Iran proxies to fight back the development which empowers Iran and it could prolong the struggle by in flaming sectarian tensions with the series I expressed this concern to our Iraqi leaders several weeks ago when I was in Baghdad meeting with the Prime Minister and the speaker but it's clear that with that expanded American leadership and regional assistance they are running out of options to win this fight the bottom line is this right now I believe that we are losing the war against Isis and the wider war against Islamist terror the present strategy has failed and the evidence of failure mounts with every terror plot in America every attack against our ally and every emerging terrorist sanctuary used to radicalize or recruit foot soldiers willing to die in the name of a deprived and depraved ideology the time has come to overhaul our counter-isil strategy and it is time for the president to level with the American people about what the threat really is and about what is needed to win this generation long war with radical Islamists so today I want to outline a basic framework for both starting with the campaign against Isis we must take immediate steps to in our efforts including increasing the number of US military trainers in Iraq and expanding partner participation by bolstering the air campaign through ford air controllers close air support and easing the rules of engagement beyond zero collateral damage authorizing american military personnel to accompany and assist the iraqis in combat including ramping up the number of special operation forces and accelerating the delivery of weapons to Kurdish Peshmerga forces and Sunni tribes but even with these improvements more will be needed to win this campaign the president's Iraq first strategy has left us with a credible ground force to fight Isis it's I'm sorry has left us with without a credible ground force to fight Isis in its main stronghold in Syria recently defense secretary Carter announced this month that we have only trained 60 60 Syrian rebels to combat this group which can range between thirty to fifty thousand strong depending on who you talk to our reasons we have and one of the reasons we have so far recruits is that reportedly we make them pledge not to fight the Assad regime an absurd policy especially when their hometowns are being attacked by Assad in short we like a series ground force in Syria while Isis itself boasts an estimated thirty thousand man army today I'm calling upon the president to stand up a multinational coalition to build the force needed to clear the terrorists sanctuary in Syria we need to combine air and ground campaign in Syria now one composed of vetted opposition forces Western trainers and advisors special operation forces and Mo importantly regional military partners including indigenous partners the coalition's immediate mandate should be distractin the opposition so that they can take the lead in taking back their country not just from Isis but from all Sunni extremists terrorists and this coalition must also force aside to step down we cannot clear the ISIS terror safe haven in Syria any time soon with the current regime in power Assad's brutal oppression is one of the main drivers behind the growth and rapid growth of Isis in Syria in the first place and he continues to decimate the moderate Syrian opposition including with chemical weapons recently that we that we need so bad we need these moderate Sunnis to fight these extremists with a side out of the way internationally backed Syrian rebels staying a far better chance of rolling back terror groups and our regional partners who want Assad gone and would be far willing to engage in the fight if they had that assurance before taking action the coalition would first need to develop a post-assad transition plan Siri cannot go the way of Libya which is falling apart in the absence of security and a strong central government as a result Coalition action in Syria must be paired with a viable plan to stabilize the country and prevent it from becoming a lawless vacuum we must step up moderate inclusive parties for success and sideline extremist factions eager to exploit the post-assad chaos our regional partners would play a central role on the ground in this coalition I spoken with Syria's neighbors on many delegation trips both in Turkey and Saudi and in Jordan and other allies who are willing to put forward these resources willing to put forward combat troops on the ground but they asked me what is your strategy and it's hard to articulate that we have one because we don't and they want the assurance that Assad will be out of the equation because they will not do anything that will empower and embolden the Assad regime these countries cannot live with an extremist sanctuary next door and the spillover effects of terror including refugee flows and suicide attacks some are prepared to help stabilize Syria and fight Isis by committing their own ground troops especially if it means the end of Assad this is after all their backyard it is their mess and I think it's incumbent upon them to clean it up under American leadership and for us not to have to carry their water but there is no substitute for American leadership and right now there is no other nation capable of rallying a coalition to this cause other than the United States of America that was pleased earlier this year to see Arab leaders proposed the creation of a regional military force to tackle the spread of violent extremism but such an organization is years away from reality regional partners are not ready to do this alone and we cannot afford to wait the presents piecemeal strategy to play out a strategy he admit will take years we need to take the lead in assembling this coalition of Nations like we did in the Persian go for we also cannot forget the core principles needed to win the wider war against Islamist terror the reach of Isis and al-qaeda extends far beyond their primary territories yet the administration's global counterterrorism approach can be best described as a whack-a-mole by drone this may be low cost but it's also short-sighted make no mistake we have eliminated key terror leaders through targeted airstrikes including the head of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula yesterday I'm sorry earlier this month the leader of the Khorasan group in Syria corzine group in Syria the biggest leader of external operations against the West to blow up airplanes using nonmetallic IEDs but these terror groups are getting better and quickly replacing fallen leaders when we can chase these fanatics we can chase them through the gates of hell but to when we must destroy sanctuaries and defeat their insidious ideology and to do so we need to identify confront threats early wherever they emerge in places like Libya and Yemen we need to work gently with regional partners to develop full-fledged stabilization plans before power vacuums turn into extremist hotspots and we must counter the ideology at the core of Islamist terror because when left unheated we have seen it spread to all corners of the globe in the same way ideals like communism and fascism led to the decades of destruction in the short run this means exposing the brutality and naked tyranny of life under the role of Islamist terrorists so potential recruits will realize that they are headed to a prison instead of a communal paradise this is the counter narrative that is not happening right now at the State Department the DoD is trying and it's not happening at DHS and in the long run we need the President to outline a whole of government grants strategy for this fight the strategy should draw on all elements of American power to promote liberty and human dignity as a great alternatives to repression fear and terror history has shown that authoritarian systems are the wellspring of fanaticism political and economic development or the only reliable long-term antidotes to terror which is why American foreign policy he must be geared towards shaping a balance of power in the international system that favors the expansion of free states we've learned the hard way that leading from behind leads us into danger indeed weakness invites aggression as Churchill talked about and leads us to face more enemies in our city streets rather than on the battlefield overseas I do believe we are in for a generational struggle as Prime Minister Cameron talked about that I've confidence that our country will prevail our ideas prevail every time we witness events like we saw in Chattanooga America's Val not to be intimidated or coors by violence and we send a clear message to fanatics if you try to bring terror to our shores we will bring justice tears that is a resolve the American people and our resolve will propel us to eventual victory in this war against Islamist terror thank you very much

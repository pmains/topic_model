thank you mr chairman thanks for joining us good to see you again director williams during your confirmation hearing uh i used the entirety of my time to visit with you about the greater yellowstone grizzly and i'm going to start with a question about that again today because it's so critical to my state so my first question is will the service follow the statutory deadline set by the esa to respond to wyoming's greater yellowstone grizzly d-listing petition within 12 months with a statute with a status review and recommendation these timelines are really important to us senator lamas thank you for that question and i um enjoyed visiting with you on this issue because it's one that's very near and dear to my heart as well and and have you know very much appreciate the efforts of your state and the leadership they've shown especially recently with grizzly bear recovery efforts we did receive the fish and wildlife service did receive a petition from the state of wyoming as you mentioned we also received from one from the state of montana and one from the state of idaho they are similar but not entirely the same no surprise there and we are currently working on all three of these petitions and i'm aware certainly aware of the the deadlines that the endangered species act sets out well and the reason for my asking the question of course is that the service has already missed an initial 90 day deadline and if you're trying to bundle our petition with montana and idaho i want to encourage you to respond to wyoming's petition alone and on its own merit because doing them together will slow things down for us so incredibly and uh make it even more difficult for addre us to address uh the ongoing issues as this issue is slow walked and not dealt with in a manner that i believe would be contemplated under the act so [Music] is it your intention to address them all three together or are you willing to address the wyoming petition as a standalone senator lumus i i don't think i can answer that perfectly for you i know that um well our regional office are they're working on this and i um have not been engaged at the moment nor should i be and that this you know is a scientific review at this point other than i know that they're working on these what i i understand your request and it's something that i will ask and i can go back and look at and and i understand your request also because i think the issues are somewhat similar in the three states and yet they are distinct and i think that as you look at the grizzly bear recovery amongst all three states in the lower 48 um they are complicated and maybe different than just wyoming's petition alone so i hear your request and we'll look into it well the the as you know the geographic area the geography around yellowstone uh does tend to uh keep grizzly bears uh within certain areas um that from which they do not stray they don't some sometimes they don't go into the other states adjacent just sim because of simple geography so please um i i implore you to respond to wyoming's petition alone and on its own merits okay my next question is similar to senator cramer's and that is people in wyoming are concerned about this 30 by 30 plan and of course nepa requires that any major federal action undergo analysis um do you believe that 30 by 30 should undergo nepa analysis senator lumus as i answered to senator cramer and i mean to be consistent i think that is a question more for the council on environmental quality than for me but what i can say too is i view the america the beautiful initiative um and if you look at its underlying principles it sets out principles it sends out a way of undertaking actions and any specific actions that the fish and wildlife service would undertake um as a result of it i'm sure that trigger nepa we would do so an example of what the fish and wildlife service already did and the america the beautiful i think confuses um or amplifies is our partners for fish and wildlife work so it i don't think the america the beautiful changes that work it only um i think amplifies and encourages a way of of collaborative locally and voluntary conservation mr chairman can i have a quick follow-up i know i'm running over no no you're fine okay um it it would be so helpful to the people i represent to have a legally cited explanation uh for why potentially changing the use of hundreds of millions of acres is not a major federal action where when an initiative is announced that is hugely consequential for the west yet it doesn't have the normal framework uh that is used to have interaction and public input and dialogue um in a state like mine that is half federal land it's you know it's scary so um how can we get something in writing should i ask the eq am i asking the wrong person today senator lomas what i would say what i can answer is i would be more than happy to work with you and work with you in the state of wyoming so that we can be hear from people we want to be transparent and i'm you know happy to address any concerns and opportunities that there are around us so i i'd be willing to work with you on this end in wyoming specifically thanks director williams it's it's a it's a thing that people fear in wyoming and you know you hate to see when you have this grandiose uh aspirational program america the beautiful and the american people are afraid of it then there's a disconnect that we need to resolve so thank you thank you very much mr chairman are you

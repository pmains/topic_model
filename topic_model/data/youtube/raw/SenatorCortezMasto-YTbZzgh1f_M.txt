thank you Thank You dick and thank you I'm honored as well to stand with all of my colleagues today to fight for passage of the DREAM Act to fight for our veterans and I'm here today with with all of my colleagues to really send a clear message to dreamers not only back home in Nevada but throughout our country we hear you we stand with you and together we will make sure that Congress passes the DREAM Act veterans day as we all know a Saturday and I honor and celebrate the service of our brave service members but for nearly 900 undocumented service members it is also a reminder that their commander-in-chief does not honor their service instead he's told them that they're not wanted and that their service is not recognized he's told them that their service to America and their patriotism is not wanted you know I'm asked all the time when I'm home in Nevada what can you tell dreamers every chance I get I tell them you belong here you belong here and I want them all to know we are so grateful for their contributions to our country and what they continue to do today so Saturday we will be celebrating with them those contributions the crucial skills that they bring to our communities is is oftentimes not talked about under the military ascensions vital to the national interest program you know daca recipients with essential skills are able to serve and give back to the only country that they have ever known these dreamers they're real people they're contributing to our communities and to the safety of this country they represent the very best of us every single dreamer that I have met and there's so many that I have met in Nevada they work hard they put themselves through school they serve our country they support their families and they make lives better for themselves and their communities in Nevada but throughout this country these young men and women are skilled and contribute so much to our state's economy in Nevada alone in Nevada alone our economy would lose 585 million dollars every year if the dreamers were deported and those numbers are similar across this country rescinding daca doesn't fix our broken immigration system and it doesn't protect our country what it does is tear apart patriotic American families including military American families think about this US Customs and Immigration Services reports that over 100,000 members of the military are naturalized citizens these are people with roots in this country service members with kids spouses mortgages and as we look ahead to Veterans Day I celebrate them and the over 500,000 veterans of foreign birth that have served our country president Trump's action is bad for our country safety bad for our economy and bad for Nevada and I call on my colleagues my Republican colleagues to honor the service of these veterans and of the many dreamers that continue to serve it is time for all of us to pass the DREAM Act thank you for joining us today

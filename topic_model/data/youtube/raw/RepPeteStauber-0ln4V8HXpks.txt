Louis County was recently given a Haida designation that's acronym for high intensity drug trafficking area this is great news as this program would provide st. Louis County with federal resources to assist in the coordination and development in drug control efforts among federal state local and tribal enforcement officials as a former law enforcement officer in Duluth I have seen firsthand the devastating impact that fentanyl heroin opioids have had on families across northeastern Minnesota and I know that our law enforcement officers are doing an exceptional job combating this crisis and this heighted designation will expand their efforts in various counties across the nation the hyda program has successfully prevented illicit drugs from making their way into our schools homes and communities and I look forward to seeing the same results in Duluth in the state newest County area again a reminder to press star 3 to ask a question you know I as a member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee I'm also committed to bringing our nation's infrastructure into the 21st century that's why over the August work period I traveled to sue to the Soo Locks in suit Saint Marie Michigan to highlight their importance to economic and national security as well as the Virgen need to modernize this critical piece of infrastructure every year more than 75 million tons of cargo pass through sue locks in fact the Soo Locks serves as the only method for transporting the iron ore from the mines in northern Minnesota to the steel mills and the lower Great Lakes unfortunately the pole lock which is the largest of the Soo Locks is currently outdated and considered the weak link in the North American industrial economy as one unplanned six-month closure could cost up to 11 million jobs fortunately after my insistent insistence the president included a request of more than 75 million dollars for the Army Corps of Engineers to reconstruct the Soo Locks in his budget proposal for fiscal year 2020 this was a crucial step in full funding the Soo Locks I was glad to have the chance to publicly be an advocate for the Soo Locks and will continue to help secure the necessary funding to keep this critical infrastructure up and running and lastly I wanted to discuss my recent efforts to protect the Great Lakes Lake Superior along with the other Great Lakes our national treasures a key pillar of our economy and the backdrop of countless memories for our families and our friends protecting the Great Lakes have always been a priority of mine so last week I helped pass legislation I introduced with other colleagues from the Great Lakes region that would reauthorize and increase funding for the Great Lakes restorative initiative out of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee I was proud to promote a bill that will bolster critical Pollution Control endangered species mitigation and ecosystem restoration and I look forward to voting in support of this critical piece of legislation coming out of the House floor as your representative in Congress I'm excited to tell you that constituent service is a central function of my office it's a priority whether it's helping veterans or seniors secure the benefits they deserve coordinating a tour of our US Capitol for the family is visiting Washington DC or flying a flag over the US Capitol to commemorate an important event or helping individuals navigate the difficulties of a federal agency my staff and I are here to serve you if you need assistance then I encourage you to call my office at area code 208-373-4007 - Leighton Hall don't forget to press star 3 to enter a question in the queue alright so up first we have Wayne from crafter Wayne you're now live on the call oh thank you for having this Town Hall I as I told the screener first I got the worst past news I got treatable lung cancer and I just got my second radiation treatment today through the VA they discovered it because I have kidney stones so they did an x-ray they went what's that natural on your lung we tested it and I'm getting really great treatment from the VA and matter of fact I'm in a study with the VA they're studying the differences between radiation and regular surgery so I guess I want to know what's your plans for the VA you plan on following funding them again like having new studies because if they don't know if radiation for sure radiation than doing well but they need to do a side-by-side study to see if it is as good as they think it is and now people can maybe get less surgery which is a heck a lot harder on people so I just wanna know how you you support this research that the VA is doing and other research projects I guess how what to think the VA should be doing in the future yeah Wayne thank you very much for that question and I want to wish you the best of luck and best of health during this process for you so I'm you know you know like when after you and other veterans what to have done for us that we must always ensure that we are standing up for you and our veterans as Americans and I believe I share commitment to ensure that the benefits that this country the country promise you that you are going to get them you earn them we promised them to you and we're going to deliver you know sadly over the years we've heard too many stories of veterans who've been forced to wait or haven't received the care of benefits that they earned and this is absolutely unacceptable and I can tell you the husband of an Iraq war weapon I am especially dedicated to helping our veterans and all of our veterans have a very special place in my heart and they are I'm very very supportive of them you know specifically there's several VA or veterans piece of the legislation Wayne that that I supported the veterans access to child care of course I supported that the Bluewater Navy the Vietnam veterans act that was in the house for some time it was eventually you know signed into law and then the homeless veterans families act the burns Pitts Accountability Act as we know there's many people with lung issues many veterans with lung issues the the improved well-being for veterans Act this legislation authorizes Wayne a grant program that allows the VA to provide funding to nonprofits and community organizations that coordinated like their delivery of services to veterans who are at risk or a risk of harming themselves on the military veterans any legislation that comes in involving veterans or how we can make sure that we care for them and make sure we those benefits that this country promised and that you've earned I am in full support of our veterans and always will be and again Wayne thanks for the question and I wish you the best of luck okay so up next we have a question from Tyler from Aurora on broadband Tyler you are now live on the call hi I just was curious um you know I enjoy living in a rural part of the state but no part of the struggle is having competitive access to internet which in today's market is very vital for businesses let alone individual students I guess I'm curious what your hopes are for expanding internet access across the rural areas you know Tyler a great question it's very timely because I'm on the Small Business Committee with infrastructure and contracting that has a exactly everything to do with the expansion of broadband into rural America you know we've been talking about this our society has been talking about pushing broadband out to our rural communities for many years and and I'm one that's okay we've done enough talking let's let's make the move right now there's a couple things that we need to do we need to make sure that the mapping of the of the broadband is you know accurate so when we invest in those places Tyler that don't have broadband we want to make sure we invest in in that type of legislation and action introducing legislation with representative Jared golden out of Maine to enable rural counties to expand broadband through grants and we're working on that in that in that committee you know I've said this and I think many of you may have heard me say this a broadband a reliable high-speed broadband it's not a luxury anymore it's a necessity it helps keep our rural schools open and competitive it helps keeps our rural hospitals open and competitive and those are some things it helps for our you know the realtor selling our homes when we have broadband it it helps that because people aren't going to you know if you if you have a home with internet access and then two miles down you don't have you have a home that doesn't have internet access those homes the one that has access is most likely going to be the one that sells in according to many many Realtors I've talked to so Tyler the the deployment of broadband across not only rural Minnesota where we live but rural America is a high priority not only in the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee but in the Small Business Committee because we know that small businesses can compete with anybody as long as they have that reliable broadband and sometimes they're deficient when they don't have that reliable broadband furthermore I'm I've had people tell me that if rule America or rural Minnesota had high-speed reliable internet connection they would move their business out to rural Minnesota for the quality of life and so we have the ability to do to really make some make some really headway in the deployment of rural broadband but it starts out with a mapping we have to do the mapping accurate that's not only the bigger companies but the midsize companies have to come together help us with the mapping and then we need to deploy or invest in rural broadband in those areas that don't have it so Tyler that's a priority for us I just hope that that you know we continue to have it as a focus and work on it and make sure it happens okay thank you again for joining congressman pete sauber stella townhall don't forget to press star three to enter a question in the queue so as next we have a question from Glenn from Duluth the question is on impeachment Glenn you are now live on the call thanks Eric Osmond our since the Trump campaign had at least 38 meetings and tour and 40 contacts with the Russians we have the Ukraine report recently showing that he had President trumpet withheld aid before having the meeting with them along with the emoluments clause we have all the golf trips where the taxpayers paying president Trump directly his resorts and the other meetings what would it take for you to support impeaching the president since he's clearly violated at least three or four constitutionalized direct clauses in the Constitution great question and again that's a timely question Glenn you know this morning immediately after it's released I reviewed the entire unredacted transcript the president Trump's telephone conversation with Ukrainian president zolensky and there was no quid pro quo and no mention of withholding any military aid to the Ukraine you know impeachment is not to be taken lightly and I think it was irresponsible for the speaker to bring forward an impeachment inquiry last night without having without having any shred of evidence that wrongdoing occurred all impeachment we'll do is further divide our our already divided nation you know my constituents didn't send me to Congress to engage in political games they sent me here to work on the most pressing issues Glenn facing our nation and I I will continue to focus on protecting Social Security and Medicare moderate modernizing the krummel crumbling infrastructure that we talked about and the TNI Committee every week lowering the cost of prescription drugs generating economic growth in our communities and of course creating fair trade deals you know for the American worker that's that that's the whole that's my statement on your question and Pietschmann is not to be taken lightly and Nancy Pelosi what she did last night really in my mind hurt the process in the House of Representatives okay thank you again for joining congressman pete sauber stella town hall again don't forget to press star three to enter a question in the queue so up next we have a question from Gerald out of Duluth Gerald's question is on butch Lewis you are now live on the call hello ed your hello hi Gerald I thank you for having this Town Hall and once again I'd like to say thank you for reaching across the aisle the sponsor the butch Lewis act my question is because it directly affects my family because we're part of the central state pension plan and what is the odds of this passing or going anywhere we're at a critical point in time this is my wife's retirement and since I'm I work part-time I'm retired on Social Security and and a disabled vet but I'm grateful that I still AM able to work part-time so basically it's a critical it's really a critical point to my family um right so frightened Jerald thank you for the call you know as a former union member myself I know that America's working men and women and helped build this nation and will continue to build our nation and and as I said on the campaign trail I'm always going to fight to ensure that the working men and women receive the wages of benefits that they have rightfully earned you know whether it's opening the door for responsible mining or creating fair trade deals committed to introducing and supporting policies that provide good quality jobs you know for all of us and you know the economy's currently doing very well unemployment is down and I have to say to your question Gerald the butch butch Lewis is currently in the Senate it passed the House and I'm very happy that I was a part of that push to make butch Lewis past the house and it sits in the Senate now it's currently in the Senate and I will keep pushing for its passage in the Senate and I think that one of the things that we need to make sure is is that you know of course our two US senators continue to push for it I did my work in the house reached across the aisle to make sure that it passed the house and I think that you know our two US senators you know we need to ensure that senators Klobuchar and Smith do their part in the Senate to get it on the floor for a vote and I was very very happy to support butch Lewis and we know that pensions we rely on our pensions we work our entire life and we pay into the pension out of our paycheck and I think that we it's very responsible to make sure that those pensions are taken care of and so are you Jerald you and your wife can live in your in the golden years with financial security thanks for the question okay thanks again for joining congressman pete sauber Stella Town Hall don't forget to press star 3 to enter a question in the queue so next we have Thomas from Cooke and he's got a question on gun control Thomas you are now live on the call thanks for taking her calls Pete and you're a good you're a good goalie - not too bad yeah you you being a ex retired police lieutenant I was wondering your thoughts on gun control and if anything being done about it and it would it be different if things would happen around here if there was a mass shooting would things go faster with you or to go at the same pace so it's a great question and you saw in our in the in Duluth Minnesota the incident involving Duluth East High School you just saw our local authorities went through the process and they gave an individual probation who threatened to mass shoot I want you to think about that he was given probation after threatening mass shooting got a loaded gun was found in a parked vehicle in the parking lot so with that being said I think Thomas both you and I are I mean many of us are just sickened by the violence that has plagued this nation and as a former law enforcement officer I was a victim to violent gun crimes however you know we want to make sure that the individual law-abiding citizen continues to have the right to keep and bear arms to protect themselves or others from great bodily harm or death there's a couple of Thomas's a couple of things we have to look at mental health I think the root of many of these problems is the human one and and mental health is a priority and we need to ensure that those suffering from a mental health crisis get the care and support they need in an immediate and timely manner and that means that when they they're asking for help that that door is opened that they give the immediate help not not an appointment three weeks from today now and I think that many mental health professionals and law enforcement and EMS agree that the doors got to be open immediately and then the second thing Thomas as I support the mass violence prevention act in fact I'm a co-sponsor of it it this addresses the underlying and repeated tragedies including the including and I eight there has been some failure in lawns workmen in law enforcement and response to some things you know the mass violence prevention Act will establish in a prevention center like a fusion center that would coordinated intelligence collecting anything pertaining to the threats of mass violence by federal state local law enforcement what that means is if you see a statement by it on an on the internet by an individual that says for example I want to do harm to this and here's how I'm going to do it we make sure the mass violence prevention act gives an opportunity for somebody to make one phone call this is what was seen on the computer we believe this individual made the statement so the local authorities in conjunction with the federal estate and in tribal authorities can respond immediately not like ok we thought ok because this is a federal crime the feds will take it No we start with whoever gets that this fusion center we come together and literally the mass violence prevention act says with just within a few minutes action the action is immediate and so I think that those are some things that it that we need to do it and we need to strategic operational planning for mass violence prevention which integrates this this act inter integrates the federal state and our local law enforcement agencies and then provides a recommendation to the Attorney General on mass violence prevention programs and I think that it's important that that from the law enforcement standpoint we can we can say because what do we know better we do better when law enforcement reviews its after-action reports some of the things they missed and they'll admit and and when you know better you do better and I think that law enforcement you know unfortunately through these incidents have have the responses it's getting better and better and the coordination is a must and then the third thing Thomas is that the background check so universal background check today checks to databases and the next currently pulls from the or Crime Information Center it's that interstate identification and then the we have the ni CS and then the index the index is the third database it's the third database that was created by the FBI following the September 11th attacks on this country and so this database it aggregates the criminal record from various federal local and state agencies and it provides critical information to the criminal justice community and like the index is it's utilized by local enforcement agencies our campus police railroad security probation officers in prison so this the National instant criminal background check system I'm supporting that third element to be checked but currently that third element isn't checked and we've been told that several of those incidents were those perpetrators those those violators would have been caught using that third check and I think that the inference is the Charleston shooter had this third check pin and he would have never been able to purchase and I think the Department of Justice the Spector general would audit those reports and and has and would have revealed that in the Charleston it would have prohibited this incident from the alleged shooter you know acquiring a firearm you know so there are rules in America that clearly state who should be able to buy a firearm and who should not be able to get the government you know we're I using all the technology at our fingerprints to enforce the rules and this legislation the mass violence prevention Act legislation would really prevent guns from getting in the wrong hands without increasing the bureaucratic delays for law-abiding citizens so I think there's a win-win I think there's a really a bipartisan effort in Congress to put that forward but Thomas great question but I can tell you I would much rather be talking about the safety in our communities then then what's happening right now in Washington with what speaker Pelosi is doing okay thank you again for joining congressman pete sauber stella town hall again don't forget to press star three to enter a question in the queue so up next we have a question from Katherine Bergquist Katherine you are now live on the call good morning senator flubber all right Chuck Nori's and evening I'm quite well I'm a handicapped person that I'm not sure this should be going to you maybe should go to our rarer but there are so many places that you can get into because they don't have a handicap push-button thing that lets you in and out I've been to so many many places this summer I finally got well enough like a button about in my electric chair and all the places that I can't get in makes me feel bad because I know we're servicemen had a lot to do with putting those in years ago and somehow or other they've gotten lost in the shuffle well Katherine I will I will just say this that I fully support the Americans with Disabilities Act the ADA a and and and I know that we must protect the advances made by this bill and I want to even strengthen it so you know I want to talk a little bit on a personal level Katherine when I was a st. Louis County Commissioner and when I was a chair of Public Works and transportation we were doing a lot of road construction and and we were doing a lot of you know working on sidewalks and what-have-you and I can tell you that that the you know director of Public Works Jim policy and many others in this department really we really took into consideration at the intersections how making those intersections were that where you come up on the from the road onto the sidewalk but we wanted to make those insure they were ad a compliant that was a that was a priority for us because we know that that persons with disabilities and I look at that I say persons with abilities because we have to look at your abilities I think that you know in a wheelchair not you have so much to offer on this country and so what we wanted to do is make sure that there was accessible sidewalks and and that was really a top priority and it still is st. Louis County and I'm very proud of that and and obviously uh Katherine if you don't know my wife and I are blessed with a special-needs child and there are times that we have to push them around in the wheelchair and sometimes it's when you when you have when when Isaac our Isaac is in a wheelchair where we really see some of the some of the things that you just discussed well how are you supposed to go up this ramp or these stairs with the wheelchair I think it's important upon our country and to make sure that that we are eighty-eight compliant and to you know make it you know easy for you to traverse our our country our roads our sidewalks our elevators and and you name it so Katherine just know that the ADA is important and absolutely critically important to us thanks for that question okay Thank You Katherine um like I said before don't forget to press star three to enter a question in the queue up next we have a question from rust from Chism he's got a question on polyMet Russ you are now live on the call Thank You congressman for all your help and you have my supporter of you I one time I'm retired right now but I had a mining supply business in Hibbing Minnesota and so I'm Pro mining in a big way I'm just wondering what the statuses of polyMet is right now and if there's anything that that the US congressman could do to push it along well thanks for the comments rest you know Russ Minnesota's blast we're blessed with an abundance of natural resources you know it really puts us in a unique position to not just ensure that our country remains competitive on the global market you know but it also is good for good paying jobs and hard-working Minnesota folks like yourself and and I believe that you know like many Minnesotans are the state is a natural beauty and I believe using 21st century technology and and facts and science that that mining both iron ore and and copper nickel they're not mutually exclusive we can do both we can mine and keep our environment pristine and I think that through their approval policies and really sensible regulation we can unleash the economic engine to your specific point I think that we're polyMet is right now I think I'm I think it's October 23rd but don't quote me on that I think that's the date where they're going to have the discussion or arguments on polymaths permitting process and and I've always said that that when when a project meets or exceeds all federal and state regulations it has to move forward and and you know opponents in some instances arrests continue to want to move the goal-line back so the project doesn't go at all and I think that right now litigation is part of it it's in litigation and you know we'll see what comes out on October 23rd but even during the campaign in my nine months you know I said I support copper nickel mining they've met all the you know the state standards federal standards to the EPA etc I think it's important that it can't can't move forward because we're I believe we're blessed with these minerals in the ground and we can do it best in this country and I say Minnesota can do it best we can lead the country and we can lead the world because I want to get these Minnesota I want to get these minerals rust from Minnesota not China or Russia who have zero Labor Standards and zero environmental standards we can do it best in Minnesota and you know I believe we're going to lead on this so Russ we'll see you know where it goes depending on what happens in the court so thanks for the question okay Thank You Russ and thank you again for joining congressman pete sauber Stella town hall up next we have a question from Millicent O'Connell she's got a question on Social Security and Medicare Millicent you are now live on the call I'm interested in having Social Security funded all over candy from what I understand I am taxing all income would make a fun viable and also on Medicare I would like Medicare for all with private insurance also and that way all of us could be covered by all the social programs that already done through the Veterans Administration and Medicare programs that are done already they know how to do it and I'd rather that they weren't done by a private company except where people want private health insurance what do you think about that Millicent great question I mean the health care debate has been going on you know for many years and and and I've said this before that that that if the Affordable Care Act were the answer we wouldn't be talking about health care now we know there was some there were some really you know tough things in the Affordable Care Act that you know like the Cadillac tax that was unanimously voted out a couple months ago unanimously and you know rightfully so and the individual mandate which is which is part of that now was not part of it so I think that obviously I absolutely you know support Social Security Medicare want to keep them vibrant and sustained and you know but one of the things little said that I don't I don't support a government takeover of our health care system I think that I think that competitive private markets is much better because I think we lose when the government takes over and we limit choices limit competition and you know maybe when we talk about Medicare for all it it changes it will change the delivery system for our seniors there's no doubt about it and I think that when we look at the ability to kind of tweak what we have going on put partisan politics away aside and tweak what what's going on I think we can do some really good things and I'll give you an example you know I've co-sponsored the Social Security Fairness Act of 2019 which eliminates the two provisions that have unfairly penalized educators police officers and other public servants across Minnesota and the nation for too long and what it does it eliminates the windfall elimination provision of the government pension offset so basically it provides retiree certainty to retirees who have devoted much of their lives to public service and as a public service retiree you know many of my colleagues not only in the 8th district but around the state millicent have said you know we need to make sure that that Social Security is remains a you know supportive and and that Medicare remains supportive and solvent and that's exactly what we intend to do and I think that through bipartisan good legislation millicent and we can do that I firmly believe that ok thanks again for joining congressman pete sauber stela town hall don't forget to press star 3 to enter a question in the queue next we have a question from Barbara from Duluth she's got a question on insulin Barbara you are now live on the call yes I want to know why drug companies are not forced to take responsibility for diabetics poor health care and dying from the need for insulin when this is an old drug it's not research and development they're just lining their pockets at the price of people Barbara great question and I agree with you that's what we're trying to do I can tell you that out of the health our correction out of the Energy and Commerce Commission there was a it passed out of the ENC Commission Energy Commerce unanimously provisions to make sure that drug companies were transparent in their pricing and what happened was they when it came out of energy Commerce in a bipartisan fashion unanimously to make drug companies make them more transparent on their pricing etc when it went to the House floor speaker Pelosi put three what we call provisions amendments that made it a partisan and it didn't go through and so what happens is we had energy and commerce it comes out of that committee unanimously it should have gone directly on the House floor that's the process directly from the house for Barbara it voted on it would have passed almost unanimously and then it would have gone to the Senate because they were waiting for it Senator McConnell says bring it over and what happens is those partisan politics got in the way and it's sitting right now it's sitting doing nothing and it could have been in law right now so we need to make sure that we have a bipartisan solution for the drug companies and that you talk about insulin critically critically important and I know there are some legislation specifically to insulin that we are actually working through and taking a look at and you know as they come to the floor but that Barbara you and many other folks have talked about that that have like I do diabetics and our family it's critically important that we stop the this political divide and do what's right and I agree with your statements okay so up next we have a question from Brad out of Duluth he's got a question on robo calls Brad you're now live on the call yeah congressman actually I had like that two little small questions in there I under the National do-not-call us it since probably about June you know they just I get twenty a day is there anything the federal government is going to do about it and to it has to do with the VA on that the percent of disability when you're awarded disability in the beginning you know you may get thirty percent or whatever but as you grow older as a veteran as I have if you get thirty more percent you're not actually getting to sixty because if you I would only have 70 Leslie take thirty percent of the seventy which is twenty one which would give you fifty one not sixty so it's a long process to try to get up to one hundred percent after initial loop certificate is awarded is there any way that Paul Smith gets a change that policy has been in effect firm you know probably since Korea yes well I tell you what Brad let's go to let's talk about the robo calls that we talked about the VA the robo calls we get them I get them on my cell phone it's irritating that's why I co-sponsored the trace Dec it which will stop these calls and right now we are around the district almost all of my conversations with constituents in groups robo calls or these repeated calls to our cell phones is brought up and and that's why myself and many other members have signed on to this legislation to be able to stop you know stop these and which it's frustrating I'm going to listen I'm going on the House floor tonight I'm walking up the Capitol steps and the phone rings and it's an out of country no idea of course I didn't answer it but those are frustrating things for all of us so Brad I heard you and many others loud and clear and my co-sponsoring of this act hopefully we'll stop the calls now reference the VA and I I don't know specifics and Personals about your service-connected disability you know but I do want to say that that in in our in our VA system we're trying to make it we're trying to make it better easier less cumbersome for our men and women who have served to be able to you know get to get the service they need and not have to jump through the hoops and you know I'm a co-sponsor on the bill to help vets on disability to keep more of the money that they deserve these are some things that that a lot of people may be back in the district don't see but we're working on legislation and in particular for our veterans that that can help I should say make the process easier and more transparent for you Brad like the numbers used to wrote as you're talking to me I'm chicken that's interesting I didn't you know I didn't know you know those specifics on the service-connected disability and the actual percent but I will tell you this Brad we do our staff is the number one priorities constituent services so I if you need a help you may call our office and we will connect you with with a staff member that specializes in VA benefits etc and she's an exceptional exceptional and knowledgeable staff member so you just need to call our office and ask for Margaret okay thank you for that question up next we have a question from back out of Duluth he has a question about the listing the gray wolf that you are now live on the call hi yeah I had to sort of environmental questions one what is your plan to keep the gray wolf from ever being close to extinction again and - what is your plan on building the renewable energy that you mentioned that we need to work on because so far all I've heard was support for mining Jamison but yeah as act let's do the the gray wolf again in 2013 the Obama administration agreed that the gray wolf could be delisted off the endangered species act and allow the states and house in our case the Minnesota DNR to monitor the health and well-being of the gray wolf however that became we had some folks that the sued the Obama administration went to court and what I would say an activist judge out of Washington DC of all spit places ruled that the Obama administration was wrong and the delisting of the gray wolf will not happen and they're going back on the endangered species list and so I believe it I believe in the Minnesota DNR I believe that they can monitor our very wolf situation I'm hearing it from the Minnesota deer hunters Association our farmers and just recently in Duluth there was a wolf attack when the owner was 10 feet away so it is the delisting is is good and I believe that the Minnesota DNR can do a very good job of monitoring the gray wolf we have states in Wisconsin bipartisan by the way bipartisan support for this not only on the Minnesota you know like myself and call and Pierce and then district 7 are sponsoring it together and we have our reps out of Wisconsin in Michigan as well so a renewable and a great question we have we have the ability for to have wind and solar and electric vehicles and I think it's a very important literal that I'm a co-sponsor of legislation to expedite permitting for renewable energy projects on federal lands you know I support an all-of-the-above energy policy and of course mining as you know Zack mining is needed for renewable energy if we're going to get those critical minerals we need for instance copper for the windmills nickel for the batteries and what we can get them here I would rather like I said earlier on the phone call Zach I would rather get the minerals that we can mined here with our standards and our labor force rather than the countries of China or India who have neither and we're the biggest pollutants so I'm sponsoring their renewable energy legislation carbon capture legislation and I think those are those are and those are bipartisan bipartisan support for those and you know and look forward to continuing to do that so thank you very much Zach for the call okay Thank You Zach just a reminder to press star 3 to enter a question in the queue up next we have a question from Emily added to loose just added question about pre-existing conditions Emily you are now live on the call yes thank you and thank you confidence our um I had a question on pre-existing conditions I have a family member who I believe probably wouldn't be alive today if they if we still had those restrictions in place that we had previously and I'm a little concerned with the way that talks have happened in the last year or so with regard to health care specifically for folks with pre-existing conditions I know Minnesota and other states we have a few more protections that obviously I would want to see keep and on a national level I would like to have an answer from you about why specifically you voted against one of the bills that would have protected that for more people and then I would like to hear from you about I know you talked about the transparency in costs for medications which I agree with and I think that's a great start but when you talk about competition with drug companies we have competition with drug companies right now and that's how we still manage to have these high high prices for drug other places in the world have a system of health care that is better that it's cheaper for everyone and I would like to know from you what you see other countries doing well that you believe could be applied to our healthcare system in order to lower the cost of prescription medication and to lower the costs for me to go to healthcare because I know personally I make health decisions unfortunately these days based on how much I can afford and I would like to have a congressperson is prioritizing lowering the cost of health care for everyone across the board Thank You Emily what a great question and I appreciate the question I will say that you're either you have incorrect information or but but you're factually wrong on mice on the pre-existing conditions that you mentioned I supported the pre-existing conditions resolution in fact I crossed party lines to support it I said that on the campaign and I voted for it I also co-sponsored I was a co-sponsor of the pre-existing conditions Protection Act and the continuing coverage for pre-existing conditions Act these pieces of legislation ensure that protection for pre-existing conditions are never eroded regardless of what happens in the courts and I repeat that I voted for legislation that protects pre-existing conditions and never eroded regardless of what happens in the courts so I appreciate that the conversation I just wanted to make sure Emily that you understood I think you and I are on the same page in supporting pre-existing conditions because you have a family member and not who it is but I know that my wife and I are blessed with a family member who has pre-existing conditions so we're on the same page and I think as far as as far as other countries and what-have-you I want to do what's best for the American people and that gives them the opportunity to control their own health care so it can be more of a personal policy for them and their families I think that's important and that's what we're working on those are some of the by parts and pieces of legislation that we're working on in the house to be able to make that your healthcare make it your decision between Emily between you and your doctor where where it's your drive in the conversation and not limited by government or any type of you know government control and I think that you and your doctor know the best and I think that as we go forward we're seeing we're seeing good talks and our committees on health care and it's it's it's moving forward slowly but surely but I can tell you that the pre-existing conditions are extremely important so I just wanted to correct you Emily thank you very much for the question okay so we just have time for one more question tonight that question is going to be John from Duluth he wants to know what the congressman is going to do to unite our country John you are now live on the call oh thank you thank you for taking my question now basically I was really gratified to hear you come out against partisanship and divisive news and politics I agree a hundred percent so I'm rather worried that you use the divisive dog whistle calling a judge an activist judge because you didn't agree with a decision when you do that you cast doubt on the courts and you are in essence saying that the judges did not apply the facts in the law as they were presented in the court but merely made them sound like a political branch if the courts are last bulwark of nonpartisan behavior become viewed as just another partisan branch you have managed to destroy the country and I know you don't want that so if you would just kindly watch your language a little bit and be a little bit more neutral it would be helpful thank you John bring great comments and I appreciate the comments one of the things that that I'm doing in in to try to make this country laughter this Cove is I'm part of the problem solvers caucus that means there's twenty there's only 24 Republicans and 24 Democrats there's only 48 members of the 435 in in Congress that are part of the problem solvers caucus and we are gaining traction we are the middle ground where the middle legislators like we like to call ourselves we legislate in between the guardrails John and I think it's extremely important I will also tell you that I took the civility pledge I went through down at the Lincoln Park school the civility a group of people that we met I took the civility pledge to be able to to have the discussion on you know a good healthy discussion understanding we're not going to agree on everything but there's not after we have the discussion and there is a vote or there is legislation we move on to the next piece of legislation and I think that I Johnny I'll give you this hockey analogy a great great hockey coach and college hockey's Herb Brooks coach to the u.s. Olympic team what he said he said the name on the front of the jersey means more than the name on the back of the jersey you meaning we have that jerseys that says USA on the front and on the back it doesn't matter which name we are we are USA members of Congress and I think that going in there the hundred sixteenth Congress there's many freshmen that have that have looked at let's be the class that changes the tone in Washington and John per the MPR I am the most bipartisan federal legislature in the state of Minnesota today and I'm very proud of that I said on the on the John I said on the campaign I'm not only going to reach across aisle I am going to walk over and build relationships across the aisle and that's exactly what I'm doing and tell you what it's just a blessing to be able to represent the state of Minnesota Minnesota's 8th congressional district in DC so everyone thanks for thank you for joining it's an honor to serve and and please do not hesitate to reach out to our office at any time if there's anything that we can do to serve you and again we can be reached here in our Washington office either at 202 2 - 5 6 - 1 1 or back home in Minnesota 8 it's 2 1 8 4 8 1 6 3 9 1 so it's 4 8 1 6 3 9 6 okay so with that being said everyone have a wonderful night go twins go Vikings and wild get a good start on the season thanks everyone have a good night

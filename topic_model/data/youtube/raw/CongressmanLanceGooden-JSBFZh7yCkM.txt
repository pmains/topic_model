joining me right now is texas congressman house financial services committee member lance gooden congressman it's great to have you this morning thanks very much for joining us where are we not very far along in fact the senate negotiators which consist of no one in the senate have been meeting with nancy pelosi and why i say no one is mitch mcconnell is not really involved in these talks it's steve mnuchin treasury secretary white house chief of staff nancy pelosi and chuck schumer that's it they've said that if they don't have an agreement by friday then mark meadows recently said that we should perhaps just move on as if there's not going to be one the clip you just played of the president talking about executive action i suspect that's what's going to end up happening a week ago i told you i thought we'd have a deal this week so i should probably stop speculating but i see a scenario at this point where no one reaches a deal president issues an executive action and do you really think the democrats are going to sue the president saying don't evict americans that are past due on their rent i can't imagine that being the case but it seems as if progress has has stopped and we're approaching that deadline why did progress stop what is the sticking point the democrats won't agree to the eviction uh they won't cut they won't come down up to 600 extra unemployment they're not interested in the liability protections that republicans want to make sure schools and businesses aren't being sued for the next several years they want the three plus trillion dollar number to be what it is uh republicans at one point i understand we're saying we want something closer to one trillion and the other problem is that we've now come to a point where we're not panicking like we were back in the springtime when republicans voted 96-0 on aid packages that they otherwise would never have supported in the past that panicky situation doesn't exist today i believe there'll be at least 20 plus republicans that are no votes on whatever agreement if there is when agreement comes forward i think that's the the same in on the house side republicans are not united in this belief that we need to spend trillions more dollars at this point especially if it involves concessions to nancy pelosi that are too painful i say yeah dagon jump in congressman did the republicans realize that the democrats might be setting up the president and republicans for to keep unemployment high and still look like the victors and champions of the american people with this plan what are you going to do you're going to keep paying people an extra 600 per week in unemployment benefits which encourages people not to get back to work with so many earning more on unemployment than they did in their jobs you funnel money to schools even though they might be staying close so you keep schools closed that hurts unemployment and then you refuse to include a liability protection which discourages businesses from bringing workers back and from hiring it is the recipe for unemployment to stay in the double digits which which is what i think they would like between now and november obviously nancy pelosi is not going to say that but i think democrats are perfectly fine with no deal passing at all being able to blame the president and the heartless republicans as they say and then move forward in the next 90 days and say we'll save you if you vote for us you're absolutely right the 600 number encourages people at that level not to work it's disincentivizing people from coming back to work businesses want to hire people but people that are are actually making more money with the 600 edition are not going to go back to work because it makes no sense for them financially and democrats want this to continue through the election you're absolutely right yeah that definitely feels that way meanwhile you know you better watch out if you made any money during this pandemic senator bernie sanders taking to twitter tweeting this i will be introducing legislation tomorrow to tax the obscene wealth gains billionaires have made during the public health con crisis so sanders is suggesting that you he wants to tax any gains on billionaires at a sixty percent rate if they made money during this pandemic what do you think i think that he'll be successful if democrats take the senate and joe biden wins the white house they're they're spreading this message that progressives are going to run the nation if they win and they're right um it's interesting to me that many of these billionaires that he's going to be taxing are in silicon valley and are worried about censoring the president in the next few months you would think that some of these billionaires in silicon valley would not be interested in a bernie sanders-led senate majority uh in january uh but that seems to be a par for the course a concern to me as we haven't heard anything from joe biden i have really no idea what his plans are if he were to win he seems to be letting the far left like the bernie sanders crowd do this do his talking and planning for him well he's already come out with a task a a unity task sheet which is he and bernie sanders so we know a little about biden's plans he's teamed up with bernie sanders when it comes to economics so it may very well include some of bernie's plans and one of those plans is to tax anybody who made money during the pandemic congressman it's good to see you this morning thanks so much stay with us we'll be right back

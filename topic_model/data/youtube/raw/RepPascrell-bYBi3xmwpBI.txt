gop's ongoing effort to undercut defund and destroy the law to heavy fire to hearing and things took a turn for the dramatic when democrat bill paschall from new jersey rose to defend the law from an onslaught of republican attacks this is pascal addressing the hypocrisy of the gop's sabotage assault by reminding republicans that when president george w bush expanded medicaid democrats opposed it but then worked to make it better to improve it we lost the policy fight and what did we do we went back to our districts and we told our seniors of all we voted no we're we personally believe and we'll work with the bush administration to make it work that's what we did and how many of you stood up to do that none zero zero there are numerous proposals including the one that i'm a co-sponsor of i yield back deals pre-existing let conditions take the time back are you serious what you just said for the gym are you really serious we've gone through 44 votes 48 votes now of you trying to dismantle the legislation you call that cooperation i don't well congressman bill pascal joins us right now along with sam stein the humming pose congressman you're the kind of guy i grew up with you're like a little like maybe slightly older than me maybe slightly younger but you're just like my father's friends in the knights of columbus you speak regular english you talk the talk this clown show on the republican side that 40 times they voted against the bill that the president had and there's not a single republican for 150 000 years that's had a health care plan they don't have one there's 40 million people sitting right now in the er they don't care about those people then the guy comes out this griffin character from arkansas you know where he stands for nothing i'm so glad you called him out i'm i'm sure he came up the afterwards and said how can you be so direct with me anyway tell me what the reaction was to being direct for once these people some folks were surprised chris that i yielded my my time we only had three minutes but you know what i like that i knew where he was going he had a sheet of paper in his hands where the hell was this three years ago three years ago one year ago uh he just signed on to that bill by the way five days ago this is hypocrisy this is hypocrisy at its worst and i wish i had more than three minutes but i'm going to defend what i think should be defended you know chris we talked way back when three years ago and i said to you there were some things in this i didn't like and some things that should have been in that warning there but the thing is done we voted for it the supreme court supported it and here we are with it's all over again it's like repetition repetition help us make it better you know they remind me sam of like ben brantley the uh the theater critic of the new york times he doesn't have a play to put on he doesn't put anything out there for the public to look at he just sits around and comes in on monday morning and trashes something how come the republicans get away with not being for anything at all for the working uninsured and then they come off and they dance around prance around suggesting little nuances of concern they've had what a joke your thoughts let's stipulate for the time being that the rollout of the website has been pretty bad uh but if you ask a republican if they want it to be resolved quicker they would say of course no they're cheering on its failure same with the exchanges the republican governors did not expand many of them did not expand our take on the responsibility of building a state-run exchange putting the burden on the federal government that doesn't excuse the federal government for botching the rollout they should have done this dave camp's right they had three years to do this but certainly there is an element of hypocrisy here from the republicans who actively work to undermine this thing and now are cheering the fact that it's failing so i think the congressman has a valid point well let me get back to the congressman what do you think the people on that committee on the other side of your committee would like to see as the danumo the end of this talk do they want a better bill do they want to revise it refurb it revive what do they want to do reform it chris maybe i'm being naive about this but i think there's still a good 25 to 40 percent on the ways and means committee that want to see some kind of a breakthrough where they don't feel that they're being tied down if they say something nice about the aca and i i asked today in the very spot that you just showed i said i stood and i said which one of you are going to tell the parents when you condemn this thing and then destroy it that your kids are no longer going to be covered with special needs your kids are no longer going to be covered uh because they have a precondition are you going to tell the parents are you have the courage and the guts to do that you're going to tell the seniors that they're no longer going to get a shot with the that famous hole in the doughnut when you're paying premiums but you're not getting benefits are you going to you're going to go back to the old way none of you have the courage to do that and until you do things are not going to change around here but what else do you need to know that we're not going away let me go back to sam on the analysis here it seems to me that the congressman made a pretty good point there that the democrats didn't dance all over the grave of the prescription drug program they they nursed it along even though it was w's plan is that a fair positive statement by the congressman yeah no it's absolutely true if you look back at history that's what happened and i think at some point some republicans may recognize that president obama is going to be in office through the 26 elect 2016 elections into 2017 in that there's just simply no way that he will sign legislation that repeals his law or that cripples it until it's inoperable so there is two to three two and a half more years here where they have to recognize that they have an opportunity to work within the confines of law to make it better in their ideological vision or they can continue to do what they're doing and i should recommend to the congressman he democrats should have called this heritage care not obamacare maybe they would have been more reasonable in working with you on that then that's very interesting a very important point we'll take a look at this congressman two weeks ago speaker john boehner brought the economy to a brit to brink of course by taking us to the edge of a government default of the affordable care act itself yet today he told reporters that the gop's fight against the aca the american affordable care act is really about get this growing the economy that's his concern let's take a listen obamacare is like a wet blanket over our economy american people are looking for more jobs better wages but with all the uncertainty around this law employers are having a very difficult time making decisions it's time it's time to delay this it's time to fix this before it gets any worse you know congressman hold your ears but i said a comment i might use the comment i don't usually use what do these guys want obama to do and he's talking about a wet blanket this president is out there killing our enemies the way w couldn't do it with all his rootin tootin gee whiz gi joe talk he let him go and torabora this president caught him and killed him he also doubled the stock market to the point where today the dow jones for the people with some money in their 401ks now are going to all benefit from them and cut the deficit one of these guys going to stop there the complaining and the grousing and say you know what i'll give them that i'll give them that just once a year say what is it about your colleagues on the right that don't ever want to give an inch and even say you know he's not a bad guy he's kind of a loner but he's not a bad guy he's a good husband he's good father just once in a while throw them a bone they don't do that they hate them for some reason what do you think help america chris it does not help america whatsoever from the guy who led the troops into shutting down the government which cost us billions and billions of dollars in jobs just a little while ago chris and he's telling us about obamacare we've extended medicare because of the affordable care act so just that in itself is something that we should all be proud of both sides all sides in this issue let me jump in well will rogers is right bro will rogers is standing right behind you congressman the great khan the great american will rogers from oklahoma he would appreciate the republicans complete hypocrisy here last night from you sim yeah no i think you know the president is partially responsible for this mean because he did delay the business mandate in the affordable care act which was a recognition that businesses were uncertain about this but if the problem here is uncertainty caused by obamacare then i don't think john boehner has much of a leg to stand on because as the congressman rightly said it wasn't that long ago that we were at the brink of a debt default and we were in the midst of a government shutdown because of efforts to delay and defend obamacare so uncertainty is you know not something that republicans appear to worry about all that seriously there's a difference between the guy who stops his car to fix the tire and the guy that runs the car off the road anyway thank you bill pascal the congressman of new jersey i'm honored to be here honored to have you and sam stein so much moving up as always with your now

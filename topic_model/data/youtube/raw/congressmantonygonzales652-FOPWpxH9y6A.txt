texas congressman tony gonzalez says president biden can fix this at any moment but he chooses illegal immigration over fixing the broken system and he joins us now good morning congressman hey good morning easley good morning i mean holy cow when we saw those images yesterday a massive caravan coming to america what do you think about this because you're a texas resident yeah no the biden administration uh just continues on this illegal immigration route and all it's doing is encouraging more and more people to make this the sad part about it is this caravan that we're seeing of thousands of people is only the shiny object underneath that these these folks aren't controlled by the cartel these are kind of a local organization that has put these together so what you're not seeing is the thousands of folks that are run by the cartel continue to make it over our southern border it's only going to get worse until this administration stands up and does something you know congressman we see these images yesterday we had griff jenkins in the crowd and he was showing us people in wheelchairs lots of kids in strollers of course our heart breaks for them we understand how much they want to be in america because by the grace of god we were born here many of us have come here and done it the right way isn't there a better way to do it though there is absolutely a better way to do it and you know the the sad part is instead of this administration focusing on legal immigration reform which i think a lot of people especially on the republican side are open to the discussion on legal immigration they have chosen to go down the illegal immigration route just look at the the reconciliation package you know kevin mccarthy last week held a a round table to discuss it and in this reconciliation package is amnesty for about 10 million folks which is completely the wrong approach what isn't in this reconciliation package a package of trillions of dollars is nothing for border patrol zero for border patrol they're ignoring it so when you when when we hear that the texas rangers and texas police officers they're heading a thousand of them are heading down to the border we see those images of what they did in tapachuli yesterday they ran right through the mexican national guard how do we know they're not going to do that to our men and women that are down there at the border yeah texas has been alone on this fight from the beginning the federal government joe biden is nowhere to be seen i mean he won't make it to the border he won't send anyone else to the border as well so texas is on its own for the first time though i think you see uh texans get behind texans and we're ready to secure our border on our own sadly that's what it's come to you know you've got texas national guard there you've got of course dps agents as well the bottom line is people regular everyday people do not feel safe because of the chaos that this administration is causing the images right now congressman this is what's coming to america thank you so much for being on with us we appreciate all your service and what you do for our country thank you ashley you're welcome we are just one week out from virginia

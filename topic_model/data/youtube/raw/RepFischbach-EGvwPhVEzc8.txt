for more than two and a half centuries the united states of america has been a beacon of freedom and hope to people all around the world as the story goes no longer were the american people subject to the tyranny and oppression they once knew and our country was born the journey has not been easy but our great american experiment has endured so as we celebrate another independence day we do so with the same sense of hope and pride that our founding fathers had so many years ago we do so with appreciation for those who went before us and with hope for what is to come we celebrate what makes america so great and we relish the opportunity to become whoever we strive to be it is no secret that we live in the greatest country on earth and it is our duty to preserve that greatness for all generations to come after all freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction happy independence day god bless you and god bless america

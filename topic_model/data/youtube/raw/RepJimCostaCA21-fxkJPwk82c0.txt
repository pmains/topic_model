the gentleman from California is recognized I thank the chairman of the subcommittee for bringing up I think what is a very important hearing this morning and this afternoon in what I think is one of the most important flash points that we're dealing with around the world when you look at other challenges both in Korea as well as in Venezuela as well as and and so clearly you've acknowledged that this is a humanitarian crisis and and you've acknowledged that there have been talks at high levels that between the the president I remember the Oval Office meeting with the Prime Minister of Pakistan about him talking about engaging in some sort of a mediation however it's not clear that you have a plan that is focused together I mean you've there's been a ban by the Indian government in terms of access to Kashmir by one of our own colleagues and by the press it's not clear to me notwithstanding all the engagement you've talked about it's two months now since India's unilateral action as to what this plan is that that you're pursuing and that you're bringing together by plan I think with regard to India the continued engagement with the Government of India to see the lifting of the restrictions and a roadmap that that the international community can understand about the return to political and economic normalcy in Kashmir Prime Minister Modi you know shortly after he revoked article 370 you made a commitment to the people that has been reaffirmed publicly by members of his cabinet that you if Kashmir Jammu and Kashmir would return to being a state would return to having assembly elections how do you get there and so that's a very important conversation to have with respect to the tensions between India and Pakistan he's also talked about one nation and one car institution mm-hmm that seems to be in conflict sir it's going to depend upon the legislation that's pursued and and and and adopted right now we see and we've talked about the National Citizen you do believe human rights are being violated today and Kashmir among the the moslems and the Sikhs do you not I believe that there have been human rights violations yes and I mean I believe that as a democracy India's institutions need to function and sometimes they function more slowly than we would like these house arrests this bringing in of additional troops into Kashmir almost eight hundred thousand I believe for eight million people it's almost one troop for every eight people and these house arrests what protests has our government made to the Indian government for those actions as I've said we've spoken to the Indian government expressed our concerns you've seen our statements made publicly but we value very much our partnership with India and India as a like-minded I think we value it's the world's largest democracy I mean we value that partnership both with India and Pakistan and they both have nuclear weapons why this is such a potential flashpoint I think and it's just not clear what this administration is doing about it well you've seen the President himself engaged multiple times with prime ministers Khan and Modi he's spoken publicly about his concern over the tensions that exists between the countries he's offered to mediate his officials have engaged with their counterparts and the key to getting to a dialogue is creating an environment that allows one to take place and that means ensuring that sustainable and irreversible steps are taken to counter militants operating from Pakistani soil so what steps are taken by India to restore political what do you think the purpose of the myth of the military buildup is in that region the troop numbers that are cited are misleading in the sense that a lot of those troops many of those so but what anything on the line of control and against the line along the line of control there are ongoing military skirmishes yesterday 10 people were killed as a result of cross-border fire and you this has been the state of the line of control since the ceasefire of 2003 broke down we urge both parties to return to respect for the line of control use of the D GMO hot line and other confidence-building measures we welcome the fact for instance that in November a corridor will be opened up between India and Pakistan that will allow Sikh pilgrims to travel to holy understand that good wores have been closed is that your understanding among the Sikhs I'm sorry that their their Sikh temples have been closed is that accurate do you think the corridor that we're talking about is to allow and facilitate pilgrims Sikh pilgrims from India to travel freely to Pakistan in order to visit a shrine and I've met with a number of constituents Kashmir Americans who are concerned about their relatives in the region and trying to contact them and it's been noted by other members about the lack of access to cell communication and other means what are you trying to do - what advice would you give me to give these Kashmir Americans who are very concerned about the relatives we share their concern approximately 4 million cell phones have now been turned back on along with 50 thousand landlines that's about half of the cell phones it does not allow SMS there's not you know net coverage in the Kashmir Valley in Jammu and Ladakh the situation has largely returned to normal and we're encouraging the Indian government to move quickly so that people can live a normal life and not face these terrible burdens my final question is why do you think nd has not allowed the establishment of the Commission of Inquiry on the High Commissioner for Human Rights to investigate any potential human rights violations that have taken place both in Indian held and pakistan-held Kashmir it's a long-standing position - by India to reject the internationalization or multilateral Asia of of Kashmir and what cooperation do you have or have you sought from the United Nations to as they've noted that this is a challenge that they are trying to focus on we believe that India and Pakistan need to engage bilaterally thank you thank you

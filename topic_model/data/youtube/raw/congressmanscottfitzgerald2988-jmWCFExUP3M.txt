all right joining us now to discuss in reaction here is wisconsin congressman scott fitzgerald congressman thank you so much for coming on uh again breaking news here the u.s economy officially in a recession two consecutive quarters with negative gdp growth shrinking by 0.9 percent of the second quarter 1.6 percent it shrank in q1 talk to me about this and the messaging again from the white house trying to paint a better picture of this trying to get out ahead of it all but redefining recession how do you clean this up from a white house perspective well you could see that you know what they were trying to do is avoid kind of the discussion that's already ensued in congress which is uh we are we find ourselves we anticipated this we find ourselves in a recession so if you're a member of congress you don't have the luxury of simply sitting back and spinning this that you know once again the economy has constricted and we're going to pretend that it didn't really happen by redefining it so you know i not only my my colleagues that i talked to on the republican side but democrats are very concerned because the next round of figures are going to come out right before that that november election cycle so you can see that uh you know we don't have the luxury of just pretending that uh that this new definition that they continue to spend is actually going to be real it's not and we all know that uh two quarters means you're in a recession and you serve on the uh this the house small business committee what impact is this going to have when talking about gross to medic domestic product oh you know we've been hearing from small businesses really across the nation as we've uh had hearings and markups on individual bills that they have been feeling this already for the last 90 days if not sooner and you know they have to react again this is real life versus white house spin and the president can have you know press conference after press conference from his basement and and tell people that in fact don't worry there's other parts of the economy that are strong enough but the fact of the matter is and even with the fed what a disappointment that even the fed is uh doing its own version of spin when it comes to you know what what anybody that said uh economics 101 would understand is that is absolutely the definition of a recession and it was uh unfortunate that uh director powell didn't admit that yesterday there's a parallel story that's often uh also happening aside from the announcement of a recession or the gdp um shrinking this mansion's latest shocker 700 billion dollar deal we'll show it on your screen from politico schumer mansion finally got into an agreement here money for climate change clean energy bringing health care costs down taxing those who make 400 000 or more corporate taxes as well mansion has been against a major portion of this bill if not the entire thing for some time there was a pivot he's agreed at this time but when you put the agreement next to a recession next to inflation how do you explain to the american people that government spending is what is needed at this moment well unfortunately it looks like senator manchin kind of threw in the towel i'm not sure what got him to that point but let's be honest this is just uh another version of buildback better and it is absolutely going to once again fuel the idea that inflation cannot be checked if you keep dumping cash into the economy government printed cash and that's exactly what this is going to result in so you know i'm disappointed um but at the end of the day i mean you know joe manchin's a democrat he's got a d behind his name and although uh you know he's been uh a uh frustrating uh figure for the democrats uh somehow they got to him and and uh this is a it's a bad deal for america it would be a question for him but do you have any indication of how he would swing that vote did something happen that that many did not know about it doesn't seem that much has changed he wasn't for money for climate right now or clean energy at this moment also he represents west virginia which is a major producer of fossil fuels in his state you can imagine his constituents may not be so happy with his decision what have you heard in the background plus kirsten cinema i want to bring that senator in this as well will she be a swing vote yeah i mean the one thing that's disappointing is uh the the parameters that the senator set for himself which was to wait until this morning to see what the inflationary figures would look like right and whether or not the economy wasn't a recession was kind of his own benchmark and and for some reason they arrived at a deal even before that right yeah i mean there's no guarantee i guess uh senator cinema has been pretty uh tight-lipped on on this whole uh adventure that the democrats have been on now for the last couple of weeks uh but once again it i think it just underscores the idea that the sooner we can get control in the house and uh very hopeful that my senator ron johnson is re-elected and that the u.s senate goes republican in the fall all of this matters even that much more because we just know at the end of the day that there's a ton of pressure on these moderate democrats to to comply with what the far left wants yeah i would love to know what changed there with senator manchin as his previous statement said that he would not be a yes vote for this at least not at this time that it seemed to change congressman scott fitzgerald congressman thank you

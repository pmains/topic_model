Thank You mr. chairman Big E mr. I for being here don't hold me to this but it seems like Idaho's agreement with the federal government the penalty is like 60 thousand dollars a day that's the number that comes and I think we were fairly cheap I think South Carolina did a lot better job in negotiator I think there were upwards of a million bucks a day or something ever it very well could be but i would like to research that for the chairman to be accurate yeah but you mentioned waist confidence in order to build a new reactor we have to have waist confidence they have to show that there's going to be a path forward to the disposal of the waste how are we going to do that now we're going to license any new reactors or power plants nuclear power plants if we don't have if we can't meet that waste confidence rule of where the where the way she's going to go well I do believe it's going to it's going to become issues in proceedings because the proceedings that have gone forward so far have been with the understanding that there was going to be a repository built you know that change has just been a recent announcement and you know as things go especially in the you know the Yucca Mountain process as i understand it make a may fall on congress to have to legislate waste confidence which i don't think was original intent but that's what you're talking about now well and that's my understanding there congress i think under any scenario congress has to take the lead and has to act on this right should we suspend the the taxes being paid by the ratepayers that use nuclear power the tenth of a cent per kilowatt-hour that they're paying i was looking at the amounts most people look at that and say what's a tenth of a cent a and ending in new york was like 81 million dollars a year the ratepayers play hey there that could stay in their economy and at least suspend it until we did we decide where we're headed with this because we got 24 billion dollars i think it is sitting in that fund right now well there is quite on and and my personal opinion is I think it ought to be considered and done yes sir but there is litigation that is going forward now where that very issue is concerned and nay rick is involved in that could you tell me in general what are the what's the status of the storage pools the capacity that are currently the curlies just at a nuclear power plants around the country are they getting are they getting fuller yes sir and I believe and I have that document I think with me but the Nuclear Energy Institute does have a document that I can supply to the committee that does show the reactors and who is you know whose polls are full and are now in dry cast and those that are nearing being full and considering dreich a story okay I thank you for being here this is a dilemma that we're going to have to face somehow yes but it's a it's a problem we need to address and solve yes sir I appreciate it thank you

today I rise in support of HR 51 30 the capturing all small businesses act bipartisan legislation that I sponsor to protect our nation's small businesses against being prematurely forced out of the small business category due to sudden growth this legislation lengthens from 12 to 24 months the time period used by the SBA to determine the average number of employees a business has alongside revenues the calculation of the average number of employees is one of the size standards used by SBA to determine if a business is still small by extending Essbase calculation period for employee based size standards Congress recognizes that the current twelve month time frame can have detrimental effects on small businesses that experienced temporary spikes in employment these additional 12 months recognize that many factors including large contracts or seasonal contracts and cease when unemployment can cause a small business to take on extra employees but only take them on temporarily while in fact they are still a small business for the majority of the year in my home state of Texas which has a great economy small businesses make up ninety-nine point eight percent of all businesses and employ four point seven million Texans and when I'm back at home one of the things that I do has a program called mark means business where I go and visit businesses to learn about what other people do in their jobs and it's been great for me to be able to do this I've had this experience working alongside constituents and and employers and employees in the area and and the small business is really the lifeblood of our economy so anything that we can do to help them will be a benefit for the entire state of Texas and the economy

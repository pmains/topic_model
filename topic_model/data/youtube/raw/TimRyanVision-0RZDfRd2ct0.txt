hi I'm congressman Tim Ryan and I represent Youngstown in Akron Ohio I'm proud to stand with the one in three campaign and the advocates for youth and would like to thank them for including me in this year's speak out but most importantly I would like to thank all of the individuals who shared their stories your refusal to be silenced will begin to break down the stigma in the shame that all too often surrounds abortion I was elected to political office at a very young age and being raised in a Catholic household always considered myself pro-life but over the past 14 years in political office I have gained a deeper understanding of the complexities and emotions that accompany the difficult decisions that women and families make when confronted with these situations I have SAT with women from Ohio and across the nation and heard them talk about their varying experiences abusive relationships financial hardships hell scares rape and incest today i'm a 41 year old father and husband whose feelings on this issue have changed I've come a long way since being a 26 year old state senator and I'm not afraid to say that my position has evolved no federal or state law banning abortion can honestly and fairly take into account the various circumstances that make each decision unique I have come to believe that we must trust women and families not politicians to make the best decisions for their lives

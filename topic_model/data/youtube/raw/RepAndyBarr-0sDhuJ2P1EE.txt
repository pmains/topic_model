terry yellen you have created a team within treasury to focus on climate change you are also the chair of the financial stability oversight council which is charged with identifying systemic risk to the financial system i certainly understand that changes to weather weather patterns could pose risk to individual credits or insurance policyholders but linking hypothetical climate scenarios to risk to the entire financial system seems to me highly speculative and on the flip side i worry that injecting ill-defined climate scenarios into financial regulation and supervision creates the immediate and very real risk of driving investment and credit allocation away from job-producing industries like fossil energy an industry that still provides eighty percent of total energy consumed in the united states and remains the most affordable and reliable source of energy to the american economy are you incorporating this real risk into your assessments around climate and how do you plan to account for the disruptions in the labor market the very significant disruptions to the labor market from lost energy jobs and what about increasing energy prices and decreasing reliability for consumers is that something f-sock will look at in addition to in the context of your of your climate czar and you need to unmute i i believe that fsoc can play a role in um arranging discussions among financial regulators all of whom have responsibilities for assessing risks from climate change to the financial institutions that they supervise and regulate to coordinate a system-wide response using the best available tools i think f-stock can facilitate identification of data and information including high quality financial disclosures that are needed to understand climate risks and make sure that climate risks are addressed fully in light of these assessments i don't see if stock is playing a role in telling financial institutions what kind of lending they can do but information is important thank you and if just reclaiming my time i would just encourage treasury uh to consider the role that shifting consumption away from fossil energy towards renewables despite the market's continued demand for fossil that that the impact that that could have on the economy as well and systemic risk as opposed to just looking uh at hypothetical climate scenarios uh broadband uh madam secretary that the pandemic has been especially hard for rural families who don't have broadband connection in my home state of kentucky and i'm glad that the american rescue plan allows for necessary investments in broadband but one of the ongoing ongoing problems we've had is that funding on broadband infrastructure often goes to areas that already have broadband and the dollars never get to underserved areas like in my district i was disappointed that this committee in the markup of the american rescue plan rejected my amendment to dedicate funds to rural areas for broadband will you commit treasury to using its authority to see that uh in the uh american rescue plan broadband is spent first and foremost in underserved rural areas well we're going to we we need to distribute the funds um to states localities uh territories and and the like based on the requirements that are in the arp and um using the funds for broadband or water or sewer uh for the state and local funding is certainly a permitted use but um i we're going to give flexibility to the recipients of these funds as to precisely how they uh deploy them consistent with the requirements thank you and i look forward to working with you and treasury on that i appreciate that i think we can work together on that final question with the multi-trillion dollar deficit uh spending bill just passed the promise of an additional three trillion dollars in spending by this administration on top of the four trillion and borrowing in uh because of covid last year um does the treasury or the fed or both of you intend to lengthen the maturity of government debt before interest rates rise a treasury his treasury has been looking at this question and has no current plans to do that the gentleman's time has expired

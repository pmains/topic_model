Chairman I became a doctor to help struggling families get the care they need when they need it most health care providers like me want nothing more than for patients to have adequate health coverage so they can have the access to care that they need preventive primary follow-up services you name it but just because coverage is offered if people can't afford it what good will it do affordability equals access in my years in medicine have never met a patient who didn't have coverage because it didn't want they didn't have coverage because they couldn't afford it so I'm deeply concerned that this bill will make premiums and other health care costs unaffordable for working families and seniors and they will lose their insurance and care at a time when far too many Americans are living paycheck to paycheck this bill will impose harsh penalties call it a sick tax for patients for an entire year if for no fault of their own lost their job and lost their insurance it will die a sickly increase premiums for seniors because they will have to pay five times more coverage than young adults this bill is unacceptable this will make health care more costly for families first and they will get double in return time has

national affairs question for you are we seeing the sort of cooperation from Iran in the wake of the multinational nuclear deal that was reached with Tehran are we seeing the sort of cooperation you would like to be seeing at this stage with respect Gooden and the answer is yes but then there's a big asterisk after it in terms of Iran's compliance with the nuclear deal that Congress gave a green light to in September they are complying with the terms of the deal and even for example the Israeli chief of Defense essentially the head of their joint chiefs of staff a guy named Ghazi I'd encode recently gave a speech in Tel Aviv where he said look this is huge because it has reduced Iran's program probably for 15 years and given us more transparency to what they're doing that was a very powerful public admission by the chief of the Israeli military that the deal is working on the nuclear site but we are seeing continued activity by hardliners in Iran who don't like the deal who are worried about the advance of the Reformers and moderates in recent elections and elsewhere they keep taking provocative steps for example testing anti-ballistic missiles and as part of the Foreign Relations Committee I've waited with my colleagues to the administration into the UN saying hey this clearly violates a separate UN Security Council resolution they're following the nuclear deal but they're engaging in other activity that we have to insist that there be consequences for because they're breaking international law Merrick garland is meeting with some of your colleagues but we're still hearing from the Republican majority in the Senate that there will be no hearings on his nomination to the Supreme Court do you think that position can hold a few small number maybe it's just one actually Republican has said let's go ahead with the process let's take it further down the traditional road of hearings in a vote that we typically see what's your expectation and I guess maybe the real question is the precedent if that is there is no if there is no hearing or vote on garland and four years eight years from now the shoes are on the other feet are we going to see is this going to become a normal part of our politics now you just the president didn't nominate yet yes person and you won't wait for four to eight years because the precedent that the Republicans are setting and they need to pull back from this is if you don't like the president you never have to take up their nominee they're saying it's about the last year of an election there's nothing in the Constitution that limits the power of the president or the Congress in the last year of a term if there was one third of the Senators who are up for election this year wouldn't be able to do their job so the real precedent they're creating and they're creating it you know in a way that it's directly contrary to the way they've treated 43 presidents before President Obama is we have such disrespect for this particular president that we will not take up this president's nominee that is not lost on Virginia citizens we were on a two-week recess and I was traveling around they understand that this is fundamentally about a majority that is evidencing disrespect for this president not the nominee because remember they announced before Mara carwin was nominated we will not take up a nomination from this president and you have to ask the question of why when when the Senate has confirmed Supreme Court justices more than 15 times in the last year of a presidential term and never refused to have a vote on one sometimes they vote yes sometimes they vote no what is it about this president unlike any other president that has led them to have such disrespect for a nominee that by all accounts even their accounts are so highly qualified I think they need to pull back because of the message it's sending to the people and also because of the precedent it sets and that precedent would be if you don't like the president you never have to take up their nominee this isn't just about the last year of a term it's a broader precedent that would do deep damage to the institutions of the presidency in the court but the worst damage it would do would be to this institution is that it of the United States in I'm sorry it only the couple seconds I have left any set any chance you think that could happen that there will be a reconsideration I sure hope so I'm I right now it doesn't look that likely but but those of us who care about this institution and when you're here sure you're representing your state and you're representing your country but you got to be a guardian of the institution and the constitutional framework that that establishes the three branches we've got to be guardians of it and so we're going to keep this you know front and center with the spotlight on to remind people that they should not disrespect the institution because of animosity they have for this particular president they need to do their jobs senator Cain always great to have you here Bruce thanks for your time absolutely

I have a dream today that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character life's most persistent and urgent question is what are you doing for others darkness cannot drive out darkness only light can do that hate cannot drive out hate only love can do that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere history will have to record that the greatest tragedy of this period of social transition was not the strident clamor of the bad people but the appalling silence the appalling silence but the appalling silence of the good people the ultimate measure of a man is not where he or she stands in the moments of comfort and convenience but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy I have decided to stick with love to stick with love to stick with love to stick with love hate is too great a burden to bear we must learn to live together as brothers and sisters or perish together as fool's the time is always right is always right is always right it is always right to do what is right wonderful King jr. taught us the way of peace the way of love the way of non-violence he told us to have the power to forgive the capacity to be reconciled so I said to each one of us today we must never ever give up we must never ever give in we must keep the faith keep on the bride you [Music]

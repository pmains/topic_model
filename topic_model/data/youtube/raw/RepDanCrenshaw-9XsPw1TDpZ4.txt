we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created as a member of congress i get to have a lot of really interesting people in the office experts on what they're talking about this is the podcast for insights into the issues china bioterrorism medicare for all in-depth discussions breaking it down into simple terms we hold we hold these truths we hold these truths with dan crenshaw welcome back folks another great episode for you this time on the moral case for capitalism the moral case against socialism we're going to get in to some philosophy some philosophy on the free market and on the american founding and so i found some guys got a doctor of philosophy degree in moral philosophy and political economy from the university of oxford um great writer uh has written a lot of books uh we can go through some of them i guess the most recent reason faith and the struggle for western civilization uh sam gregg is his name and he's with us today sam thanks so much for being on congressman it's a great pleasure to be with you today so you um you know i gave some of your bio there you went to the university of melbourne and um you're australian okay that's where the accent's coming from everybody um you ready for national review a lot that's where i've seen a lot of your stuff and um i i think just recently you wrote a piece on the moral case for capitalism and talking about how we need to be talking about that and you know here's some stats you point out in in the last two years americans in the 18 to 24 age bracket went from 58 favoring capitalism to just 42 having a positive view of capitalism what what has caused these changes you think you know and i'm a guy who's in politics and talks to people all the time and it's still not clear to me why they're changing their minds on this and what they think the alternative might be sure well thanks for the question it's something i think a lot of us are thinking about because those numbers that decline of people between the ages of 18 and 34 in terms of how they view markets and their increasingly favorable view of what they call socialism is pretty disturbing let me just preface it by saying that when they say socialism it's not always exactly clear what they mean by that sometimes it seems to be this sort of general yearning for some type of equality sometimes it's about a sense of they believe that socialism is just and somehow capitalism is inherently unjust i don't think many of them are talking about uh the idea that they want to replicate something like we saw in the soviet union with command economies and very few of them would say we want to be like venezuela or cuba for that matter but it's a more i think it's it's there's a number of things going on which explain what's happening first of all um generally in the air if you go to any mainstream college or university you hear a pretty relentless beat against capitalism markets are bad markets are exploitative and really the only defenders of markets that you'll find within universities might might be in economics departments so uh to that extent those that are going to college they're hearing a pretty consistently negative message about capitalism so that's one factor i think another factor though which a lot of people i don't think are paying attention to is that we can't underestimate the damage that was done to the the case for capitalism the case for markets by the 2008 uh financial crisis and the great recession now i could give you and i'm sure you could give lots of reasons why that crisis and the subsequent recession owed a lot to bad monetary policy bad housing policy a lot of bad government decision making there's one of some bad things that happened on wall street but the point is it really damaged the reputation of capitalism in the minds of many many people so even today so we're what 13 years away from the financial crisis whenever i'm talking about a subject like capitalism this comes up every single time and i think those of us who favor markets have got to do a better job in explaining why that happened and how it happened uh the third reason i think here's the third reason i think why markets are on the nose so to speak among a lot of young people is that those of us who are fiscal conservatives we are really good at articulating the case for markets on policy grounds we can show why free trade works why closed economies don't work why free exchange works why free prices work we're really good at articulating economic and policy arguments for these things the left i think are actually very weak in that regard where the left are much better is articulating a moral case for their preferred vision of what economic life should be like now the fact that it doesn't work the fact that as we know command economies don't work as we know european social democracies have all sorts of problems but for many people that doesn't matter what matters is that people who are in favor of markets are often not very good at explaining what you might call the ethical the philosophical case for markets and if you're a young person young people are idealistic young people are looking to change the world young people are more optimistic generally in many respects they have a vision a thirst for life all these good things and they want to hear idealistic strong philosophical cases for why they should be this rather than that and those of us who are fiscal conservatives i think generally speaking don't do a very good job in that regard and i think one of the challenges is how do you persuade one of these kind you know assume they have good intentions and i don't think they're always do people advocating for some of these things i think mostly they want more control and power but but but i think the people that they persuade probably generally have good intentions along the same lines as you've just expressed right they they want to feel like they are kind they want to feel like they are supporters of justice and equity and they don't think very deeply about what that means or the second third order consequences of pursuing that goal single-mindedly so yeah they don't want venezuela but how do we convince them that your your kind rhetoric always ends up in venezuela every single time every single time you know cubans get so mad about this it don't bring up cubans because it's a hot topic right now and they really hate socialism every every cuban american has a really bad taste in their mouth of socialism and they often tell me we have heard all this rhetoric before it's exactly how it started you know and it doesn't happen overnight i mean just because it's it's human evolution nothing happens overnight and so it's it's it's a very frustrating thing and and utopia is a very strong and powerful tool and it's working against conservatives too look you you note that uh approval of capitalism amongst republicans went from 81 percent to 66 percent um you know like what what do people think is the problem exactly i mean now i do think conservatives come at it from a different point of view i wonder if you if you use the word free market uh republicans would be more apt to support it you know i don't know but there is a populist uprising on the on the right that is uh i think normal everywhere outside the u.s but is new here in the us and i i frankly i'm not a big fan of it um it just it just kind of makes us a different it just makes us people that agree with democrats on economic policy um right but we just don't like them you know like but but we're disagreeing on all cultural issues so um sure let me say a couple of things one is um you mentioned conservatives in the way that uh there's been a decline among conservatives younger conservatives about how they view the favorability with which they view markets i have to tell you i have spent more of the past six years arguing with people on the right about markets than with people on the left so i've been having a lot of arguments with those people who describe themselves as economic nationalists you might call them economic populace etc um and they're reacting against all sorts of things and there are aspects of their positions i'm not i'm not unsympathetic too but it does seem to me that in many respects when you drill down and you look at some of the arguments they're making they're not that different from some of the things that the left is saying about musicians they argue based off of resentment i mean it really feels like resentment politics i just don't like that this company or this person is powerful and has more than me you know i mean it's and it's not an objective opinion you know because it's like it doesn't it's not obvious to me that because you're richer than i am that this somehow takes wealth away from me but this is the sentiment that many people feel yes it's a type of zero-sum mentality that if i am wealthy or someone else is wealthy it means that someone else is poorer now you know anyone who has spent you know maybe a few months studying some very basic economics will soon realize that just because some people are rich does not mean that other people are necessarily poorer that's a zero-sum mentality it assumes that the pie is fixed and of course we know that markets grow markets increase well and over time it's the case that more and more people get out of poverty and the envy question that you mentioned i think is also very important because i think it was alexis de tocqueville who i think still wrote the most insightful book about the united states back in the 1830s but he pointed out somewhere else he pointed out that even when societies get rich everyone is always looking up to see who is wealthier than them so you and i are much wealthier and much healthier than an aristocrat in 18th century france right so the the the if you like the the line by which we judge these things is constantly changing particularly in america because we're getting the societies getting wealthier and wealthier all the time so the standard by which people judge these things changes it means that people get envious about things that they really have no reason to be envious about either you mentioned also utopia that is also another problem because there's a lot of young people who really do believe and not just not just young people i think intellectuals have this problem as well right of thinking that you can construct a perfect world on earth that you can build heaven on earth now this is a temptation that's been going on for thousands of years very human and it's very very human and it comes up all the time just as the envy question comes up so one of the things i try to do when i'm dealing with these sorts of arguments is to say okay i think that if we're going to talk seriously about economics we need to engage the economic arguments we need to understand how markets grow how markets create world how markets have historically gotten millions and millions of people out of poverty the fastest rate in history we need to do all that but we also need to ask ourselves what type of economy fits the reality of who we are as human beings and that gets people thinking because what you realize is that socialism social democracy whatever you want to call it is built upon a vision of human beings that's simply untrue it's simply untrue it denies human creativity it denies human liberty denies human individuality it also assumes that there's some sort of government figure that can know everything that we needed to know to build the perfect economy that would that would fit everyone it also wrongfully assumes that producers and men are angels in the sense that they will keep producing more and more and more even though knowing that that production and the benefits derived from it will be redistributed like so so that's that's just very much against human nature that the fact is is that humans operate off of incentives and if you're not going to get any reward for your work you're not going to do the work like i i think i think that's fundamentally why it fails i want to say what we're thinking that i i love talking about the resentment problem and the inequality argument and a really simple math problem sort of highlights it for everybody let's say there's two people uh in society and one makes fifty thousand dollars and the other makes a hundred thousand dollars okay well let's double both their incomes let's increase both of their incomes by one hundred percent the same increase so one person will now make a hundred thousand dollars and the richer person will make two hundred thousand dollars but also the inequality between them just doubled as well so is that inherently a bad thing and see this is what drives people crazy the rich got richer yeah but if you look at the last four years in america after the tax cuts the poor got richer four times as fast as the rich because pro growth policies actually help the people at the bottom we have a ton of data on this uh and people just don't know these things but like you say we're good at making the economic that's an economic argument what i just did and it's a math argument but the moral argument so let's let's let me go back i like what yeah well let's talk about that because i try to say that what we need is a sort of let's call it a moral realism moral realism about the human person so what do we know about human beings we're individual and we're also social we are self-interested beings you mentioned incentives that's clearly why a lot of people do things but we're also capable of altruism we're capable of doing great things but we're also not god we're creative beings um and we can use that creativity for great purposes or for really bad purposes as well we're also free that's another thing that makes us very distinct we have reason we have will and we have all these qualities that make us distinctly different from the animals so i think when you're talking about economics and economic policy and what type of economy you want you need to take all those things into account socialism doesn't right because socialism denies human liberty it denies human creativity it denies the idea that we really free in any real sense of the word at all it prioritizes equality as sameness rather than equality before the law so i mean i think that pushing some of those arguments and really challenging the left to say okay you you say that you're really in touch with reality let's talk about what you think human beings are because i think your understanding of human beings is deeply flawed deeply mistaken and it doesn't it's not a foundation on which you can really think seriously about economic life if you deny self-interest if you deny the effect of incentives you're going to end up in a very miserable state so how do you respond to people when they say well when you say people are self-interested and you should encourage that you know how do you differentiate that from just being greedy and taking advantage of others well the thing i typically do is say if you look at the way that someone like adam smith the way he talked about self-interest by the self he didn't have in mind the sort of autonomous radical utility maximizer that does nothing but calculate how they can make more money for themselves by self-interest yet a couple of things in mind one is that people do look out for what is in their interests it's natural that people do that there's nothing wrong with people asking themselves what's in my best interest how can i realize that that's not greed that's simply a reflection of looking at our needs and our wants and then trying to realize that the other thing is that i always point out the self in self-interest who is this self well this self is someone who usually comes from a family or has a family they have interests which are economic but some of those interests are not economic they're interested in all sorts of other things besides economic advancement so in other words this self is this very complicated um mixture of good motives not so good motives good behavior good action they have their whole personal history so in other words when you think about self-interest in that way you realize very quickly that this is not green and what's greed greed is the irrational desire for more of something that you either already have or you're placing so much value on upon something whether it's money or sex or whatever it happens to be you've attached so much value to it that you've lost perspective of what is really important self-interest is very very different from greed in that sense greed is ultimately something that consumes you it destroys you because you are valuing something much more than you should but self-interest isn't that at all it's a very very different phenomena so i think we need to calibrate our language to explain that when we're talking about people pursuing their self-interest alongside lots of other people pursuing their self-interest and how all these different self-interests come into communication with each other they need to trade with each other they enter into exchange with each other that's i think the one way we can talk about this that exercises this language of greed and greed is good that many people associate with the very idea of self-interest right so if i were to summarize the argument the moral case for for capitalism it might go something like this the outcomes are better for everybody that this that is a that is a data-driven fact it's an undeniable fact number one but number two it is a realistic view of human nature and allows humans to live as humans meaning people that operate in their self-interest uh that freely exchange without one another and that choose their destiny and you know put in the put in american terms to pursue their happiness as they see fit right right and the economic system which no i think that's right and i think the economic system that fits those aspirations is clearly markets and you mentioned right at the beginning the the american founding they took this idea of self-interest and this realist understanding of human beings very very seriously the person i look to in this regard who who thought a lot about this with regard to questions of economics was alexander hamilton remember he's he would say things like we are not angels human beings do have a dark side uh we can't pretend that human beings are angelic creatures who will never do anything wrong and who will always have this very utopian view of the world he was very clear about that he said no so there's a whole tradition of thinking within the context of the american founding that takes this realist understanding of human beings very seriously we see it reflected in the constitution i think the constitution very much reflects this conception of human beings but it also reflects the way that americans talked and thought about commerce in the late 18th century and i think a key distinction is between conservatives and liberals because i think liberals will also acknowledge that humans are obviously capable of evil i mean they think every conservative is evil so clearly they think we're capable of it but here's the big difference here's what hamilton would have followed with and we know that because you know they wrote the constitution and the constitution by definition is a limiting document it's it's a it's a document that limits the power of government and so that's an important point to make because what the left would actually say is look yes we know people are evil which is why we have to make them change you know and we can and so so it's a collectivist philosophy it's a centralized philosophy versus a decentralized philosophy so hamilton the founders conservatives nowadays would say yeah we know people are bad we know they're not angels but if if you place parameters around them and if you operate off of incentives you will have the most you will have the most ideal outcome didn't say a perfect outcome just the most ideal as about as good as you can get given given what a mess humanity is and always will be because we're here so well i think this what you're pointing to is another reality which i think makes a very big distinction between the left and the right not just in america but everywhere it's this the left really do think you can change human nature whether it's through social pressure through cultural pressure through quote-unquote re-education whether it's through using the state they really do believe that you can transform human nature and this is not a new thing this goes back to the this is one of the decisive differences i think between the american revolution and the french revolution right i think the french revolutionaries really did believe that you could change human nature so that you would produce these people who were somehow devoid of all these problems that we know that human beings have the american revolution and and the american tradition of capitalism and commerce says no human nature is more or less fixed you can be virtuous or you can be you can be a bad person you can make free choices for good or for evil etc etc but there are certain constants of human nature that don't change and you're much better off whether it's in politics or economics trying to have a political or economic system that reflects those realities about the human person and tries to turn them towards the good i mean this is the inside of people like say adam smith right he acknowledged these realities about human beings and said okay so how do we optimize these realities so that we produce optimal economic outcomes for the overwhelming majority of people the left are not at all comfortable with that language or that way of thinking because i think it runs straight into what i think is their their let's call it their prefer referential option for social engineering mm-hmm it's a great way to put it okay let's transition a little bit to um what what you something you mentioned early you know con uh what would we call it economic nationalism you know that sort of the populist wing of the right um because i'm gonna i'm gonna quote some of your work again you know since so this is this so maybe not socialism but you know just more government right like that that's so that's that's kind of the in-between again like conservatives like us would say you know that that's just a that's just the next step to socialism guys because you know what one thing i usually point out is look you can you can you can enforce a minimum wage right but then less people will be working so then what's next well you have to make the companies hire the people that aren't working anymore so just make them do it okay well now the companies are going under okay fine then subsidize them you see how quickly the cascade effect happens because of that first government intervention so anyway but but my point is is people are skeptical of this you note that 74 percent of republicans under 45 that just man i who i don't know but that's like this is a crazy stat 74 of republicans under 45 support increased spending even at the risk of higher taxes um that's concerning i don't know if that's true in my constituents but i just i can't imagine them answering that question that way to be to be perfectly honest with you but you know it but that being said i think the new wing the new strand of republicanism in the populist wing very happy to get two thousand dollar checks you know for for covid and i was like i was up in arms about this because those are going out to 100 million plus people that never lost their job throughout the pandemic there's no reason to believe that these people are in dire straits they never lost their job okay you know and it turns out we have a system in place for people who did lose their job in the form of unemployment benefits but even that has turned out to be a disaster here in this country um because people won't go back to work because of those extra benefits so you know i guess what's my question here um what's your take on that where is this coming from on the political right and what's the proper place for because i think i think it i think it does stem from a a general anger at corporate cronyism which is a good anger to have i think that's a that's a concern but also international economies and trade and unfair trade practices and uh i'm very sympathetic to that yeah well i have a i mean as i said to you before i've spent more time over the past five six years arguing with um let's call it populist conservatives or economic nationalists than i have with the left and in many cases as i'm sure you know many of the economic policies are not that different from what is being proposed by senator bernie sanders or senator elizabeth warren there isn't really that much difference whether it comes to things like trade or industrial policy so where is this coming from well i think the first thing is um a lot of conservatives i'm sure you see this are very angry with the corporate sector they're very angry with the corporate sector because one they see a lot of cronyism which is true that's absolutely there there's no question about that they're also and that has been exacerbated by the unfortunate trend of what we call woke capitalism right so that's another aspect of this which infuriates a lot of conservatives a third thing is they're looking at things like trade issues and they're wondering okay this seems to be hurting parts of america i don't understand why we're doing this so there's a number of different motivations a lot of it i think does come back to this issue of anger with the business sector now i always point out to people well one of the reasons i'm in favor of free markets is because the free of the market the less scope there is for cronyism in the first place right because if you move remove the ability of either legislators or business leaders to sort of try and leverage regulation to get a privilege rather than going out and competing in the marketplace you can understand why they um you can understand why a lot of conservatives get angry with us so there's there's there's that side of that and i understand that why they're concerned about that on the other hand there's also a trend within this group of people who are saying literally saying things like we have this big administrative state we've tried to reduce it that doesn't seem to have worked maybe we should use it to realize our own purposes and that i find very very disturbing because the administrative state the growth of the administrative state is to be lamented it's a problem it should be resisted the moment we start thinking that way about the state and the role that it plays in our life i think our claims to be american conservatives start to look very very shaky indeed so a lot of its frustration a lot of it is this sort of temptation to use politics as a way to get one's way to use the state to sort of force certain things upon the rest of the population like the left do all the time but also there's some bad economics there's some bad economics as well and that's part of the problem so for example when people say to me well manufacturing is is disappearing well we're de-industrializing i will say no we're not manufacturing in terms of its um productivity is up way way way high since the 1970s number of people employed in it has gone down that's no question about that but why primarily because of technology which is what you want right i think you want people moving away from these often what were very difficult very hard forms of work and moving into other segments of the economy so when by heat people say things like well the number of people working in manufacturing has declined that's true but the number of jobs overall has massively increased since the 1970s as well so all those people or their children who would have once gone worked in some of these industries they're working in the service sector now they're working in other segments of the economy and that's what you want i think that's what you want yeah you know the counter argument would be yes but there's there's there's a sense of fulfillment in building something sure you know okay and then man and like when you when you are a laborer like that you do tend to get paid more so you know i get that again like but but but what can you really do about it um is is is the question it really takes the private sector to figure that out it's hard to see where government comes in um but but this is well as you know government has a terrible record in this regard when it comes to things like industrial policy which is the sort of the way that sort of selective interventions into different industrial and economic sectors yeah right this is what's been talked about well what do you think about like um so the national security arguments right so the libertarian right versus the uh frankly the mainstream right in this case but uh for something like the jones act so protecting our shipping industry you know and this is something where you know you can get me to be pretty libertarian on domestic politics but i'm much more in domestic economics but i'm but i'm much more sympathetic to the nationalist argument when it comes to international economics because these other countries are just out doing us and this is really bad for us as a maritime power so let's stick to shipbuilding for instance the chinese have just exponentially just run right past us on shipbuilding primarily because they just subsidize it to me there's not really any other explanation for it and and they put a lot of government effort into it and i think it needless to say we have a huge interest in having a strong maritime industry we're a maritime power we always have been you know and so what's what's what's the right balance there um frankly i don't think it takes a ton of money um except for some policy changes and maybe some protectionist policies like the jones act so how do we contend with that well i have a lot of thoughts i mean i'm i'm very much a free trader so i have difficulties with protectionism in general obviously but i do also think as no less than no less than adam smith said right he said defense trumps opulence right so national security is not something you can reduce to economics you can't you can't be basically reducing questions of national security to issues of trade there are issues of national security that go way way way way beyond the benefits of trade so i mean i don't and to tell you the truth i don't know many free marketers who would say no no national security is not important no no no free trade will solve everything i don't know many people who would say that or think like that but of course the devil is in the details so you mentioned china for example um they have unembarked especially over the past what 12 13 years upon using the state aggressively in the economy to sort of build things like a maritime industry to try and um expand their their power through things like the brick and road initiative etc throughout the world the difficulty is that a lot of those policies in china are now failing right we know this because there are there are cities that are that are basically full of no people the brick and road initiative is building great resentment around the world where it's being implemented because we know the chinese are lousy colonizers and people resent all the political strings that are now becoming more and more apparent about the way that they do this but china's re-centralization of the economy using many of the policies that you just described including with regard to trade is also hurting them now it's reducing their growth it's promoting corruption it's lessening transparency all the problems that we associated with the command economy that was used by countries like the soviet union etc all those phenomena are now starting to become more and more apparent in mainland in mainland china so i i my hesitation about these issues is i always say look the chinese are going down let's let's call it this neo-mercantilist part yeah neo-mercantilism doesn't work in the long term that's the problem so when it comes to responding to chinese aggression i'm all in favor of that there's all sorts of things i think we could be doing in different parts of the economy to try and combat what is clearly a hostile power a power that clearly has designed upon establishing itself as the preeminent power in at least the asia-pacific region right but we should be very careful before we start implementing policies that resemble something very like what china is trying to do in different parts of its economy is because that's just that's just the general thing with protectionist policies it's basically a race to the bottom right because protectionist policies hurt us just as much as they hurt those who they are directed against so i i i mean it's not easy because um the chinese threat is real they are behaving in this way they're not the only country that behave in this way i mean countries like france for example have been trying a lot of these policies for a long period of time and there are negative consequences for the united states in that regard but replicating those policies i think is a little bit like cutting off your nose to spite your face so like you i'm more willing to i'm more sympathetic to some of these national security arguments but i really wonder about some of the policies that are being proposed because they don't think in the long term in the end it does depend on the policies i mean i'm sure you've you've seen oren cass's work on this uh with the american compass you know he really attempts to make the economic intellectual argument for economic nationalism and i really got down to the details of okay what do you there's a lot of rhetoric here but when you get down to the details of what he's proposing it actually seemed to be pretty mainstream conservative you know it's like invest in invest in workforce training and apprenticeships you know think things like that it didn't it didn't seem like very extreme policies um and like you said devil's into details kind of and it depends on the issue in particular i use shipbuilding as a as an example because it's so important and it's uh it's a little bit ignored i think and look i think a lot of people are what would if you ask them the question like okay widget x will cost you more if you don't engage in free trade or yeah it will cost you more if you don't do that if and you make it be manufactured here and um are you willing to pay that extra 10 cents a dollar two dollars whatever it is for widget x if it means that there's now a factory in ohio that employs a thousand people you know and it kind of depends right and you know a lot of those policies end up um costing a lot of money uh the other thing is as you know economics always tells us there's lots of unintended consequences for these things so let me give you an example remember the um the tariffs that the trump administration put on it was a steal in march 2018 well you know it's estimated that those policies saved about 7500 jobs but also cost 75 000 jobs why because all the users of steel in america who are suddenly finding themselves having to pay higher prices for the use of steel so how do they deal with this well they keep their costs down by letting people go or using technology to try and um cut their labor costs that's part of the problem as i see with with these sorts of things there's these unintended consequences and the way also i mean even with the national security issue which i take very seriously you probably know better than i do that there are lots and lots of companies that will claim the national security mantle in order to try and extract some sort of subsidy or tariff for which there really isn't a very strong justification this happens a lot um all sorts of companies saying well yes but our industry we believe in free trade for everyone else but our industry is vital to the defense of the united states and therefore it could receive a subsidy or a tariff whenever i hear that i'm willing to say okay well i'm willing to listen to your argument but i enter it with a skeptical frame of mind because i think in most cases this turns out to be not the case at all yeah and what they're really looking for is a privilege so let's move on to um you know the difference between social conservatives and fiscal conservatives you wrote about you know romney's child care benefit proposal i i'm also on a proposal to um you know that that that would help for child care by basically allowing you to borrow from um your social security benefits of the future uh there's another proposal which i might even like better than the one i'm on uh which just allows you to borrow from your future child tax credit so you know the but obviously the goal here is to be pro-family right this is where the social conservative comes into play here uh this proposal for romney that you wrote about is 250 a month per child between ages 6 and 17 and 350 for children under five i don't know if that's means tested or is that just for everybody uh i think it's means tested up to up to a point but a very high number okay so you know it's um yeah we're we're we we're we're encouraging the growth of the family which is not a bad thing to encourage i think one of our greatest threats of the future is a an aging population and a population that is not reproducing so right it's uh luckily i mean this is where china i think has real big problems um japan has had that problem for a long time so you know i i do appreciate you pointing out earlier some of the pitfalls of of china we always hear a lot of optimism for china we're always scared of it but there's it should be noted that their their foundations are extremely shaky but anyway how do we how do we address this what's the right way to talk about this um that this sort of divide between kind of the libertarian fiscal conservative and the social conservative well i'm in the curious position of being a social conservative and a fiscal conservative so i find myself arguing with both sides depending on who i'm with right so i think um i i do think for example you mentioned demography well demography is i think china's big achilles heel and it's really hurting them now already just think about all those young chinese men who are never going to have a spouse simply because there aren't enough girls around right or just the fact that how are they going to support an aging population with this shrinking shrinking base of younger people we in america just hit a new low when it came to the birth rate this is really serious because economic growth tends to go along with population growth we also know that strong families are really important for all sorts of good social reasons but also they reduce the call on the state when it comes to welfare a strong family two-parent intact family is the best form of social security than anyone can have so i'm all in favor of policies that make it easier for people to have families to grow families for families to remain stable etc on the other hand when it comes to using the federal government to do these things i often think this is a bit of a very big stick trying to fix problems and i'm not sure always easily fixable in a fiscal way i think for example when it comes to um the african-american population one big cause of the undoubted social problems experienced by the african-american family since the 1960s i don't think it's a correlation that things started ahead go very badly in that part of our community family-wise when the great society came along and basically tried to substitute all sorts of existing social and familial structures with interventionist policies in the form of the great society um uh my friend i don't know if we've ever had ever had her on but amity schles who i think has written fantastically on them on the subject but the great she's been on the podcast yeah well she's written very well on this subject and she goes through and shows how so many of these things these sort of um very complex rich social networks were basically torn up from the ground and thrown away as a consequence of many of these policies so that's one thing the second thing so there's a very long history of the state trying to do things in these areas that turn out very badly when it comes to some of the proposals that are being made i mean i just wish if they're going to do these things and do things in this area i i do think that that reducing taxes for these families as much as possible is the preferred way rather than giving people stuff i tend to think that because here's the other thing when you give people say a child benefit or whatever it happens to be there's no guarantee that the family will use it in the way that it's intended right there's no that we can't we can't assume that the single mother with a few children who gets this child benefit i wish i could assume that the single mother or single father for that matter is going to use this extra money in a responsible way we just don't know that we can't control that so my tendency on these issues is to think is we need to reduce the fiscal burden on these families or in all families really but these families in particular because i think that's the way in which you can be most delivering them the help that they need without the state sort of meddling in their lives or trying to push them in particular directions when it comes to the way that they live their lives and the way that they live they raise their children that's kind of that's why i liked the proposal that we had which was basically borrowing from what you're already entitled to uh in the future right i mean that you know because that actually makes more sense to me i i like to the social security one because when i'm retiring i i plan on i plan on planning ahead like i'm not going to need that money at age 67 you know and if i do like i really screwed some things up um you know the biggest indicator of wealth in humanity is your age you know if you if you only know one thing about two different people and it's their age you can mostly be correct by assuming that the older person is wealthier and so you know this is a broader broader topic on social security it is a transfer from the poor to the rich just directly and uh it's the biggest it's a huge scam and we need to get it under control doesn't mean we don't i don't want to get rid of it everybody listening don't want to get rid of it we don't want to throw granny off a cliff but but we got a lot of really wealthy people collecting social security checks and that and that check comes directly out of the millennial family that is trying to make ends meet it is trying to pay higher rent and you know trying to pay off student loans so because we just we do in in actual terms my generation has much higher costs when it comes to three things healthcare education and rent or housing and this isn't that surprising i mean the house everybody's like rolling in their graves about the housing thing i'm like look there's a lot more people and we're all still trying to pack ourselves into the same space it's it shouldn't surprise us that housing is more expensive it is a supply and demand issue now you can deregulate a ton of things to make it cheaper and i mean and so maybe that's a policy discussion there it's like not only just letting you borrow from your own entitlements but policies that make things cheaper you know and that's where we get into the deregulatory regime it makes things cheap especially with housing and um you know there seems like there's some things we could do there well the other thing of course is that when it comes to the general pattern that you're pointing to the thing is that the wealthy those who are already wealthy they can afford the cost of the regulatory state it's they just have more resources if you're on the lower end of the income scale your cap it just simply eats up more of your income the same is true for businesses especially i mean a small business doesn't have a team of lawyers and people for compliance whereas a large corporation's like regulate it all you want you know it's uh just actually helps us uh shove away the competition yeah it blocks people it blocks young entrepreneurs young businesses out of the marketplace i'm actually writing some things on this this very topic right now and one of the things you find is that entrepreneurs one of the main things they complain about apart from you know lack of access to capital but then one of the main things they complained about is the sheer regulatory burden that's encountered by anyone who wants to start a new business now this differs from state to state some states are better than others and all this but what's disturbing is that compared to um even european countries in some european countries it's easier to start a business than it is in the united states which is not how it should be right traditionally it's been exactly the opposite so enabling people to get into the marketplace so that they don't have this regulatory burden is extremely important and of course big businesses i mean as you say you know please regulate us that's what the refrain you often hear is because they're not stupid they're very smart people they know they know that the greater the degree of regulation the less likely it is they're going to have competitors emerge to challenge their position in the economy whatever sector it happens to be and this is one of the counter-intuitive ways i think we need to talk about some of these issues because i think when you do it when you explain things that way and you say things like hey look regulation serves the interest of established big businesses that changes the nature of the conversation about markets and capitalism right away absolutely can we talk about europe for a little bit i'm not sure my audience always gets an insight onto what what the policy differences the philosophical differences are in europe because a conservative in europe is different than a conservative here um you know a conservative in europe is generally still very comfortable with the welfare state um comfortable with the you know in britain comfortable with the national health care system so it's just uh it's not quite the same um but we can learn things from europe i mean as you stated it's especially in the nordic countries they went out on the regulatory freedom issue all the time in our own studies like from heritage foundation for instance uh they have no minimum wage you know they uh they have some really interesting hallmarks about them that maybe we should learn from and that's what the young democrats that are always saying we should be more like them look how great and compassionate they are well it's you know maybe we should you know and and then you should pay 60 in taxes and they're like wait a second wait what well you know let me let me say a couple of things one is that when people like senator sanders talks about sweden i think he's thinking of sweden in the 1970s sweden is since 1970s is not what sweden is today in the ninth late 1970s and really into the night in the 1990s and early 2000s sweden and quite a few other scandinavian countries engaged in significant deregulation of lots of their industries they reduced their highest tax rates from things like 90 to 60 now that sounds terrible to us but it sounds pretty good if you're a swede right yeah so there's all sorts of things that they did on the other hand there's lots of other things about european what i call european economic culture which i think are very problematic one for example is that um the emphasis is there when you talk to people in europe you say okay if you have what do you what do you think is more important security or liberty nine out of ten will say security they'll say security over liberty and it's not surprising right if if you've lived through if you're living in a continent that's gone through two horrific world wars the great depression national socialism fascism communism et cetera et cetera i can understand why they're a little nervous they're very anxious to be a little bit more secure i get that but that has consequences for the way that economic policy is approached it means that economic liberty is not prioritized economic security through the state is the priority so many europeans including lots of european conservatives they don't have the same skepticism about state intervention that you find in the united states even think about for example even the british conservative party the tories who are who do have a a significant free market wing but just think about them they have a conservative government in britain with a huge majority they're going through going like us they're going through the covert crisis but think about this the way that they talked about it was all about we need to protect the national health service yeah right so we need to retain promise right adding 50 000 doctors and nurses i remember it right right and and i i lived in britain for for a number of years and i have to say the health service there is lousy but if you talk to a lot of people in britain about it the fact that it's lousy doesn't matter what matters is that the state is providing health care right so the fact that it does it badly is not important so that's an example of the way the very different mentality the other thing i think which is very different is that when america is very much a bottom-up society things grow from the grassroots up and that is very much part of the economic culture of america going right back to the pre to the colonial period in brit in europe it's top down the state is the point where things are expected to begin people look to the state to solve all sorts of problems top veal talked about this when he compared america in the 1830s to the france of of his time he said you know in america when there's a problem people bring themselves together in associational forms from the bottom up to deal with the problem they don't go after their state capital they don't go to washington dc to try and fix the problem in france he said someone in marseille who has a problem with their neighbor goes to the the responsible ministry in paris and tells them to fix the problem right and i think that's very illustrative of the difference now we've moved in that direction there's no question about that we've moved a bit in that direction but it's still a major cultural differences americans are much more willing to take the initiative to deal with problems you see there's a non-profit we create a charity we just want to right solve it we want to solve it now we're impatient right right it's a good thing is about the state the state needs to take care of this you see a poor person in the street their response is well this is a failure of the state to take care of this problem not how about you go over and help that person no no no that's the job of the state yeah yeah it's a totally different question of morality too when they say jesus was a socialist i'm like no jesus wanted you to give charity not ask not not you know not tell other people to give charity that's totally different um and also in these presentations that i'll do on this on this topic um i'll always point out that the uk minister of loneliness yes there's a minister of loneliness like they literally established a position to address loneliness it's like it just it just really just proves that point it's a totally different mentality of what the government can accomplish you know it also speaks to the the weakness of civil society in so many european countries whereas here you know civil society has its problems here but it's weird no it is it's definitely weakening the habit of association the rise of you mentioned loneliness the rise of people who don't have many friends etc etc the people who are not involved in in civil associations you know that's all in the down in america right now but it's still much stronger in america than it is in europe despite the problems that exist in america and this that regard and part of it of course i think is it it still reflects the fact that america is still a much more religious society even though religious practice is down and church participation is down in america it's still much more religious society than you find in europe and topville noted this as well right and he said most of the forms of association that you see in america overwhelmingly it's through religious organizations through churches through synagogues whatever his point was this is what how this associational habit is how americans make liberty work and how liberty doesn't degenerate into this type of radical individualism where people have nothing to do with each other the habit of association is what americans have that fix that unfortunately in europe that habit of association is extremely weak yeah it's um it's it does seem that way and look i mean in the south at least in houston i mean churches are packed they're always packed and there's multiple services you know so that i do feel like it's still strong but you know you go to our younger generation packing themselves into apartment buildings in the cities you know you're surrounded by people but you won't talk to them and it's um you know it's because like what excuse do you have to talk to them you know and people need to develop that kind of group so you know some people join a crossfit gym whatever it is but yeah it's something we have to talk about more and it's not something that government can just make happen you know because i ask this question a lot like how do we how do we get the god back into the schools and you know it's like we kind of just have to win on cultural grounds and um it's uh i've got ideas on how to do that but i can't necessarily mandate it um that's that's a it's a danger yes and i also find that there are some conservatives who are sort of using that type of language a little bit to say well you know maybe the state needs to be taking a more proactive role in building civil society and i always say no you you don't want that because when the state get it gets involved even with the best will in the world it is going to crowd out competitors is it going to crowd our competitors and i think the way we did it if we did it at all it just incentivize it you know like reward it don't how about don't get in the way of it it might be it might be a good good start so maybe what's up with this um on something you talk about which is the the moral cultural vision of what america is supposed to be and um i and i think that's a it's a vision statement so like what what should our vision statement be and i like the i like how you put that because i'm always talking in terms of visions and what we're aspiring to and how we define that and then let's then let's map out a path towards it because right now it seems more and more like like people believe that a representative like myself should be offering them something should be giving them something you know because you've quoted alex to tocqueville a lot in this episode so here's another quote from him the end of the republic is when politicians figure out they can bribe people with their own money so it's a sad truth and i think it gets to again it's definitely bubbled up on the conservative side too it's something we've been talking about so what's our proper what is our proper mutual moral cultural vision of what america is supposed to be well um i'll say this as someone who was born outside the united states as someone who's now lived in america for uh over 20 years and who became a citizen of this country 13 years ago i think i'm like a lot of other migrants to the united states in that i can see things about america that maybe a lot of native born americans don't automatically appreciate well i don't know about me but i think it's very common i mean you mentioned cubans and other people who have come here and their vision of what america is supposed to be really to my mind resonates very very closely with what we find in the american founding that america is a country that's built upon ideas about ideas about human beings about human happiness about human life and human freedom and there's really i mean i often say this to people when i'm i'm asked questions what's the most distinctive thing you find about america i always say it's a country that is built on these ideas there's no other country really like this in the world so it's this mixture of judeo-christian heritage the good side of the enlightenment and it all comes together in this sort of very very powerful package at the end of the 18th century and it gives flower to the republic i find myself drawn more and more to reading the writings of founders and they didn't agree about everything we know that they did not agree about everything but there was this sort of common commitment to the united states as a society of free men and free women who are given the liberty to pursue their happiness in the context of lots of other people doing that and in a way that's very reflective of an appreciation of the realities about who we are as human beings we talked at the beginning about how many of the founders had a very deeply realistic understanding of human beings but they didn't see that as something that made it made was going to mean that life was going to be short nasty and british they thought that this was something that you needed to build upon and appreciate in order to build this republic in which liberty and virtue go together hand in hand never apart liberty and virtue and again that's something you hear the founders talking about again and again and again and i think in america part of the problem is we have and this is not just on the left but on the right a lot of people talk about liberty a lot of people talk about virtue very few people bring the two together and understand how they have to balance and reinforce each other the republic in which people are free but they're also free to pursue this better version of who human beings um human beings are meant to be that's my vision at least for someone who's come from the outside and i think that's something that is is very reflective of human reality american history and the aspirations i think of lots and lots of people who come here seeking that type of society yeah people don't come here for our welfare programs i mean they're impossible to navigate first of all um but you know and i like that and by the way that that essence of america is found in a lot of our symbology too look at the statue of liberty she holds the torch of freedom but it's not just freedom for freedom's sake it's not like do whatever you want because in her other hand she holds the tablet of law and right and inscribes on it it's actually our declaration of july 4th 1776. i think that has a lot of meaning to it because i think that the declaration designated the purpose of government for us to protect your inalienable rights to protect your right to pursue happiness but within that protection is is is an understanding that you can only really be free you can only trust people with freedom if they are morally good and that they adhere to some sort of long-held virtues timeless virtues and those virtues can only really be derived from judeo-christian history yeah there's no there's no other place it's why we have in god we trust on the house of representatives above the speaker's chair and it's why moses is the single picture there's 23 law givers that span the house of representatives on the ceiling but moses is the only one who's centered and looking down at the speaker because the ten commandments are true in a very fundamental way they're true you can't argue with right and you have to have that anchor of morality in order to live in an in a society that values liberty right and so part of the issue we have it right now in a lot of america is there are many people who talk about liberty but without connecting it to that deeper a deeper history and a deeper moral code which really goes back it ultimately goes back to to um the hebrew people right i mean this is where there's no mistake that you find people like washington quoting the old testament over and over again because they took this side of things very seriously so you have we need people to understand that freedom is not freedom to do whatever the heck you want beyond all reason beyond all laws of civilized countries but we also need people who understand the importance of virtue to understand that you can't be virtuous unless you make the free choice to be so it's impossible to be a good person unless you freely choose to to be a good person and i think that's part of the divide that we have in much of america today the other thing i will say is that what you just described in terms of the people looking up and seeing the different statues and seeing people like moses etc if you look at the american founders the text that they cite the most if you go back and look at all those people who are founders the text that is most cited is not john locke it's not montesquieu it's not even people like blackstone it's the bible it's the bible that's something like 38 or more of citations made by founders is to scriptures the scriptures that tells you something about how they understood the republic to be they did not want a theocracy they did not want state and church being locked together but they did believe that religion played a major role in shaping the way that liberty would work its way out in this new republic tokyo noticed this right away when he first came to america because he came across where france where religion and the world of religion and the word of liberty were at war with each other he comes to america and he says hey what they're not guillotining each other they're not locking each other up what's going on here this is different and i think that's something that even if you are not up even if someone is not a believer they can still appreciate this particular role that religion has historically played in america and why we ought to be worried about the decline of religion particularly among younger americans that's absolutely right i mean even if you don't believe in god the bible is the quintessential morality guidebook and it does inform a lot of the ways we think about due process neutrality under the law fairness equality it there's it's packed with it it's why our founders um referenced it so much i imagine i'm out of time because we got i gotta go take some votes so um okay we're about an hour anyway sam thanks so much that was a a great podcast i think the listeners enjoy it immensely um can they find your work anywhere else or what would you like to say to to end it i just simply i'll go to the acton institute's website actonacton.org or go to the heritage foundation where i'm visiting fellow and they'll find many materials that i've written there as well but thank you for having me on congressman it's been great to talk with you thanks sam it was excellent you

gentlelady from Indiana this will ask you to inquire Thank You mr. chairman and ranking member Brady for holding this hearing I look forward to working with both of you and the rest of my colleagues to find ways we can enhance our country's infrastructure thank you to all of our guests as well we all know too well to fixing the Highway Trust Fund is a difficult issue we've neglected it for too long the National Association of Manufacturers last week released a report that said we need a reliable user-based long term funding stream so the families drivers and manufacturers can have the safe efficient highways they need and two that I absolutely degree I have one of the largest manufacturing districts in the country we need to stop using budget gimmicks to keep the trust fund afloat we need to focus our energies on financing infrastructure projects with a sustainable funding stream while also addressing burdensome regulations and permitting requirements that run up costs and delay projects so with that mr. Dale Loretto the fast act included several provisions to improve the condition and performance of the national freight network and to support investment in Freight related surface transportation projects what's the status of our national freight network and what's the biggest area of need we need to ensure our national freight network is not hindering the flow of goods well the big the biggest concern and freight and certainly my colleague here on the panel will tell you is the congestion that each one of those trucks face trying to get to a port to deliver their goods or picking up their goods and taking them back to market and not only are they sitting in traffic but so are the people that work at those facilities that are sitting in traffic so if we looked at that secondly we have the issue of the facilities themselves the bridges and the highways that all of those freight networks have to go over building on that fast act we need to think about how to fund such critical investments in our infrastructure and our economic security do you think of freight vehicle miles traveled the VMT that flows into priority freight corridors would have the potential to replace the gas tax mr. mr. diarga just still thanks sorry my apologies well it certainly could be one of the options at this point you know we're looking at a way to get funds in here to fix these problems today and those kind of ideas take a number of years to put together mr. Scribner my colleague representative lumen Huayra and I recently energy introduced the move America act which creates move America bonds to expand tax-exempt financing for public/private partnerships and move America credits to leverage additional private equity investments for states do you believe allowing States to leverage expanded tax credits and basel provided needed boost in resources to ease the strain on state and local governments yeah I do think increasing financing options certainly relieves some of the pressure on traditional funding channels do you know of any other funding mechanism that we could build on to help infuse private capital into those infrastructure projects well as I said in my testimony I think if we want to see a lot more more private sector investment in these public purpose infrastructure projects the big one to tackle would be eliminating the private activity bond volume cap which is currently set at fifteen billion dollars and about more than two-thirds of that has been issued or obligated to date Thank You mr. chair back I thank the gentlelady with that let me recognize the gentleman from New York

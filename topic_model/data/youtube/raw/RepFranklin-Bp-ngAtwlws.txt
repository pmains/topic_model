thank you mr chairman and uh you asked some of my questions about the growth in the teams that's encouraging general to hear that we're there they're 14 more slated um cybercom has shown a great deal of commitment to building both capability and capacity with cyber mission force reaching full operational capability ahead of schedule we see further maturing i do know in in the state of florida we've got training units at quarry station and at hurlburt field both successful operations how are we learning from these institutions to help develop cyber related curricula and building sustainable readiness across force so one of the most important ways that we're learning is really two-fold congressman one is that our force is learning every single day in the operations that we're conducting in cyberspace this is a force that's engaged against a variety of adversaries every single day of the year and so the important piece is how do we take those lessons learned every day and bring them back to a place like corey station or pensacola and that's one of the things that we certainly have done but the second piece is i think also important that is the people that have led our teams the people that have operated on our teams the people that have been on hunt forward missions in different countries how do we get them back into the schoolhouse that they are the principal trainers of our young people that come forward general the fy 23 budget contains 11.2 billion dollars for cyberspace activities and that's a 7.6 percent increase year over year which sounds very strong and a few months ago i would have thought that would be the case but considering we're now at 7.8 percent inflation it's actually a net decrease i realize there's a lag time between when when you all are putting budgets together when they finally get out there but is your determination that the cyber threat to the country is stagnant or decreasing that is not my determination in terms of my view of the future i think it's it's increasing in terms of what our adversaries present to us as a nation so i know we had a long hearing earlier today about the fy 23 budget but this is a budget that fails to keep pace with inflation or are you are you confident that you will be able to to make do and like good soldiers and salute and carry out the plan of the day but but is uh is this budget adequate or do you are you would you be asking us for to plus that up so congressman the the amount that's been funded to us today is is what we need uh to start with but we've also identified unfunded priorities uh and we'll provide that to the committee as as directed by the ndaa okay thank you dr plum uh what is your assessment of our ability to deter cyberspace attacks on the u.s government and critical infrastructure in general um thanks congressman you know defending the homeland deterring cyber attacks of at least a i guess i would say a strategic nature absolutely essential i think um i guess what i would offer is i don't think cyber deterrence uh is is a is a piece unto itself so i think deterrence uh comes uh you know we've been using this term integrated deterrence i'm sure you've you're well aware of it i know everyone here is uh but you don't deter cyber just with cyber alone uh you deter with all instruments of national power and i think at the moment the president has used the megaphone of the united states of america to warn the russians not to attack critical infrastructure at the same time uh through cyber command and through our department of homeland security partners we've been working with private sector and the defense industrial board to make sure that people's shields are up that they're ready that they're being alerted to threats so i think part of that is the defense piece part of that is a warning of a retaliation and i think i actually think that is at the moment uh holding okay are there additional tools or resources or authorities that would that would be helpful to help bolster our ability to to deter these cyberspace attacks against the country i think on the specific question of tools i would ask the general to answer that i don't know if that's answerable in this session i don't have any i i believe the authorities are in place i believe the authorities are in place this time general unclass would that anything you would want to offer in this setting so i have the authorities that i need right now congressman to accomplish my mission uh obviously we we look at a series of partnerships and and no one department or agency can do it all in cyberspace so what we are very focused on is how do we develop the partnerships with cisa and with fbi and with foreign partners and most importantly the private sector to ensure that we all have a common vision and a common vigilance thank you gentlemen i yield back mr chairman thank you you

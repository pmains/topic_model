Thank You mr. president and let me congratulate my colleague from Oklahoma for a very time statement and and and let me associate myself with each and every word and each and every fact that he outlined in his very final statement and also with the remarks of my friend from Missouri who went before him I appreciate their leadership on this issue and let me at this point also give a salute to the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States to the right of freedom of speech which we have seen exercised in this building and in this nation during the course of this debate the freedom granted to petition the government for address of grievances we have seen examples of that they've been on full display in this health care debate which a phase of which will come to a close I hope this evening let me give a shout out to our staff members mr. president they have fielded thousands if not tens of thousands of phone calls letters emails visits from Americans exercising their rights under the First Amendment and Americans have come to their Capitol City almost all of them in a an appropriate and non disruptive way sometimes intense for sure expressing their opinions but also in in display of their First Amendment rights after all the debates and all the conversation and all the exhortation on this issue we've seen a lot of things said from the floor and a lot of things said on the news media that amounted to a matter of opinion but mr. president here is one thing I know for a fact and that is for four straight elections 2010 2012 2014 and 2016 for four straight elections Republicans ran on a promise to repeal and replace Obamacare we ran on that platform and for four straight elections Republicans prevailed at the ballot box on the strength of that platform I know that for a fact and this I believe millions of Americans are at work today nor at home or getting home from their offices from their shops from their factories and they are turning on the media they're checking online they're turning on the radio and they are wondering if a campaign promise is going to be kept by this party that they have given the reins of government to enforce trade elections we're close to keeping that promise mr. president we're closer than we've ever been and we can take a big step tonight on making good on that promise now it's not just a matter of keeping a promise but I will say to my colleagues that it is important that this that this platform be be honored mr. president told that I need to ask for consent to speak for ten additional minutes there are no other people from the other side without a Gascon for for consent so we're keeping a promise but there's a lot more to it and it's my friend from Oklahoma outlined not only in in in fact but also in stories from honest-to-goodness Americans this debate is about keeping Americans from hurting about relieving the pain that this 2009 ACA has caused people to have they were told they could keep their doctors they wanted to keep their doctors and it turns out they lost their doctors they were told they could keep their health care plans they liked their health care plans and in fact they were not able to keep their health care plans and they were told that their premiums would go down and we've seen chapter and verse as the gentleman from Oklahoma so forcefully outlined of the dramatic drastic unspeakable increase in premiums that Americans have under undergone they were told they'd have choice when it came to health insurance and they've not had that choice they've lost their freedom to make their own health care decisions and that has been sacrificed in favor of a big government approach so people are hurting as has been explained on the floor tonight families in my state do not have employer-based health insurance are paying nearly three thousand dollars more per year in premiums than they did four years ago in my state it's a 116 percent increase in premiums under the Affordable Care Act over this short period of time I guess we should be thankful that we're not the 200 1% increase in premiums that our neighbors from Oklahoma have are the 223 percent increase in health care premiums that our neighbors across the line in the state of Alabama have but still it's pretty bad wherever you go and they were told and this program was sold on a promise of reducing health care premiums and as has also been pointed out six million independent-minded Americans have just said I will not purchase this required insurance I will pay the penalty instead the Supreme Court says it's a tax we know it's a penalty but it comes right out of their pockets but they're doing that many times because they're independent upon it but many times because it's the only thing they can afford so Americans are hurting Americans from Missouri and Oklahoma and Mississippi are hurting and they're hurting all across America my Republican colleagues know this my Democratic colleagues know this and they say well the ACA needs it deeds adjustment it needs some help but what's their solution I think we're beginning to know based on statements made and and based on information coming forward that our democratic friends really want a single-payer system that's their solution to the failed Obamacare system that we have now a british-style european-style government-run insurance for all program I don't think we need that in America I don't think that's what Americans thought they were getting now mr. president my wife and I have never moved our family to Washington DC we've kept our home on the same Street in Washington in Tupelo Mississippi the whole time we raised our kids in Mississippi when the last bell rings this weekend I'll be on a plane back home to my state moving around the state talking to Mississippi and speaking to people that gave me this great opportunity to serve in this great body in this great system of government I want to be able to tell them when I go home after this vote that I've taken a big step in keeping the federal government out of the business of deciding healthcare for their families I want to be able to tell them that they're now going to have more options to choose the plan that works for them I want to tell people back home that put me in office that we put more power in the hands of the states not unelected Washington DC bureaucrats I want to be able to tell them that we passed a bill that as my friend from Oklahoma says answers the concerns about pre-existing conditions and takes care of those people with low incomes who need assistance in buying insurance and I want to assure the people back in my home state and all across America as my friend from Oklahoma just did so eloquently that the Medicaid program will continue as a matter of fact it will continue to grow but at a rate that is more sustainable so that we can afford it today and so that we can afford the Medicaid program in future generations this has taken long hours of give and take it may take more long hours in debate tonight and in conference with the house but we can get there I see the solution formulating and I am as optimistic as I've ever been that we will be able to keep this for election promise that we've made these reforms are now within reach we should take advantage tonight mr. president of this opportunity to deliver on what was promised to the American people to relieve Americans who are hurting from the current Obama care system and to give them a better opportunity for affordable and accessible health care Thank You mr. president and I yield the floor

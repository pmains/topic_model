on January 17th 1994 a big 6.7 magnitude earthquake hit the San Fernando Valley in Southern California epicenter that quake was Northridge which is a suburb about 20 miles north of LA that earthquake caused widespread damage freeway collapses schools and buildings and homes destroyed dozens of people were killed northridge quake 1994 one of the hardest hit school buildings in that quake was the northridge middle school parts of that school were so smashed up they spent four years rebuilding it well now 22 years after that big quake Northridge middle school is getting another big makeover once again for the last few weeks that middle school campus has been a construction zone they're not taking four years to do it this time though this time these crews were working day shifts and night shifts they worked on a long plus Saturdays plus Sundays they worked right through the Christmas and New Year's holidays with only one 24 hour break for Christmas Day and that was it otherwise it was 24 7 and the reason they were in such a hurry is because they just got told that they're getting in all of a sudden influx of a thousand new students who are arriving tomorrow because the old school where those students used to go has had to shut down on very short notice immediately and indefinitely because it's been gassed Northridge middle school is about to get a huge influx of all the kids from nearby Porter Ranch California because Porter Ranch schools have had to shut down they've had to shut down because of the biggest gas leak in the history of this country we've been covering this disaster in california for more than a month now a bleak first started in late october these are infrared time-lapse images of the huge cloud of methane that's been billowing out of a busted natural gas storage facility near porter ranch it's releasing so much air pollution is this is the the greenhouse gas equivalent of driving 7 million cars every day Bloomberg News says that the leak is releasing enough methane to fill the entire empire state building every day and it's been leaking like this since October the fumes are making people so sick that about 3,000 local Reza it's up now been relocated and school officials so far have shut down two schools starting tomorrow morning Northridge middle school would be the new home for kids from Porter Ranch community school they'll be there at least till June Southern California gas is paying to relocate all those thousands of families there supposedly going to be paying for moving the schools to they also had to start doing something new at the site where they're still trying to stop the leak recently the gas company recently started installing mesh screens around the leaking gas well because in addition to the billowing clouds of stinky methane right that are that are big enough to fill the Empire State Building every single day residents also say there's now some sort of weird goo goo like mist that's been drifting off the leaking well site residents say they found brown oily residue on their cars in their gardens all over their homes and here's what the gas company said to local residents when local residents brought in samples of this brown oily goo that has now started falling all over their houses and yards the gas company said to them quote we sampled it and according to our retain toxicologist and medical expert the residue contained heavier hydrocarbons similar to motor oil but it does not pose a health risk so now we're soaking you in motor oil which means don't worry because everybody knows soaking in motor oil is totally harmless and besides we'll put up these mesh screens California Governor Jerry Brown met with Porter Ranch residents last week he toured the side of the leak in well and then right afterwards the officially declared a state of emergency in Porter Ranch under the emergency order the state says they'll step up resources to try to fix the problem they also say they will ensure that Southern California gas covers any and all costs related to this disaster but the disaster is still ongoing the leak is still spewing the company now says it will start burning off some of the gas that's still in the giant tank that's leaking that should hopefully alleviate some of the pressure in the well it at least means that there will be less gas in there to keep leaking out flaring off of the gas they say could start as soon as this week but in terms of stopping this current leak that still is not expected to happen until oh say March and meanwhile again we're talking enough methane to fill the Empire State Building every single day joining us now is congressman brad Sherman of California he not only represents the district reporter ranch is located he and his family also live in Porter Ranch congressman Sherman thanks for being here really appreciate it good to be with you I only represent a portion of Porter Ranch and the lion shares in another district that is where you live that's where I live so um ask somebody who calls porter ranch home at first of all do we as an outsider looking in do we adequately and the sort of impact this has had on your community what is this done of people's lives well it has a very different effect on different people my next-door neighbor has just mild asthma he's evacuated whereas we've stayed in our home we have special filters and we don't go jogging in our own neighborhood but it has it's one of the windiest areas in southern california so the effect is dramatically different every day and dramatically different depending upon a health condition of the person that you're talking to I know that you've been very involved in working with the gas company to try to obviously the the problem needs to be fixed the leak needs to be stopped but in the meantime ways to alleviate the problem what do you make of this decision that they've come to to try to burn off some of the gas well they're not going to put up a big flare they're trying to capture the natural gasses it comes out and if they can capture it they'll incinerate it and it's a step to take but it's going to be difficult it's also potentially dangerous you see if your methane won't burn pure air won't burn its butt when you try to capture the methane it's already got some air in it and when you have I believe it's a 15-percent methane and the rest air you you have an explosive mixture so are there other options that the gas company or the state indeed could take to make this less of a problem between now and when the thing finally gets fixed are there other options that there is one but Diane I'd been pushing it for about a month now but they're not willing to take it and that is they're withdrawing natural gas from this reservoir as fast as they can sell it the ordinary course of business they're not willing to give it away or discount it or take any steps to to dispose of it because they view this natural gas as an asset when we in Porter Ranch view it as a toxin that seems like that's unbelievably callous to be looking at this leak as a shame because they're losing their asset rather than looking at this leak is something that is the biggest air pollution crisis in the country by a mile they're also looking in terms of being able to provide natural gas with system security as we move into the summer and we burn on a lot of natural gas to generate electricity they're probably going to be unwilling to take all the natural gas out of this facility because they plan on using it it's by far their largest storage facility one of the biggest stars facilities in the world it is remarkable is the state of emergency going to make the anything's things any better is that there's a governor power I'm hoping the governor will use that power to direct the natural gas be pulled out as quickly as possible not just as quickly as needed for resale but so far I haven't been able to persuade either SoCal gas with the governor to do that that is a remarkable dynamic I'm happy to have clarity on that and shocked at the same time and the other thing is we need to see a natural gas storage integrity system nationwide we had some explosions and we ended up with a good set of regulations for natural gas transportation the we've got no reasonable regulations for natural gas storage this is 60 year old pipe they've removed the safety valves and the testing system is not designed to find anomalies in the pipe just find where it's already leaking not where it might leak so we've got technology on transportation we haven't applied at the storage Hersman brad Sherman of California thanks very much for helping us understand this this is a hell of a thing in your district good luck with this but thank you we've got lots more head including a big update today from Flint Michigan the governor finally taking questions on that disaster today stay with us

okay thank you one other question major criticism in some quarters of dodd-frank has been that the regulatory burden that it has placed on small banks in particular there's a legislative initiative that would raise the five hundred billion to two hundred fifty billion the regulatory threshold for heightened oversight by the Federal Reserve you agree that overly burdensome regulations has hindered particularly small bank lending to the effect of contributing to maybe the slowness of that economic recovery that we've both talked about from the last recession well I I do agree that community banks face substantial burdens regulatory burdens and it's very appropriate for the Fed and other banking regulators to look for ways to reduce the compliance burdens that they face we are very fine oh we meet with many community bankers and are very aware of concerns about this we are really focused on trying to tailor our supervision so that we find ways to reduce regulatory burdens we've put into effect a number of changes that reduce reporting and requirements and recently have a simplified capital proposal that we think should be address some of the concerns but we have long been on record as favoring some increase in the ten and fifty billion dollar asset thresholds that are incorporated into dodd-frank in particular we think that the Volcker rule and incentive compensation are things that should not apply to smaller less complex banks and we do think an increase in those thresholds would assist us inappropriately tailoring our regulations we do think it's important that the Fed of retain authority to imposed enhanced Prudential standards on banking firms particularly in the hundred to two hundred and fifty billion dollar total asset range both for safety and soundness and financial stability concerns and in particular stress testing we think is a particularly important component of our safety and soundness approach and do think it's appropriate for that to apply to banks let's say over the hundred billion dollar threshold III I want to ask you about regulation I think that the Fed has generally done a good job under your leadership in writing regulations that have strengthened the safety and soundness of our financial institutions but there have been discussions in Congress right now about tailoring these regulations that were put in place after the financial crisis and as you know the Senate chairman Cramer Crapo has introduced bipartisan legislation on regulatory relief uh a major package for banks ah some people want to go further than this and and really rollback dodd-frank so I have two questions first do you think it is a good idea to rollback dodd-frank in this post crisis regulatory time and secondly what do you think of Chairman creepos regulatory relief package do you think it goes too far or do you think it strikes the right balance well let me start with the first question about rolling back dodd-frank I think that dodd-frank provided a an excellent roadmap to a series of changes that have led to a far safer and sounder banking system and one that has been able over the last ten years there have been stresses of all sorts that have hit the US financial system sometimes emanating from abroad and it proven resilient and able to support good growth in a strong labor market and core reforms include more and higher-quality capital more liquidity stress testing which i think is very important and resolution planning so if a systemic firm were to fail that we would have the tools to be able to deal with it without it's imposing such costs on the economy and I would not want to see those things roll back I think it would be very dangerous to do so that said do believe it's appropriate to tailor regulations to the systemic footprint of a financial institution and so tailoring is an important principle and we've long indicated that we would be supportive of raising some of the thresholds incorporated into dodd-frank in particular the ten billion and two hundred and fifty billion dollar thresholds and that would give us more ability to tailor to the systemic footprint of particular firms particularly important to us is having the continued ability to impose enhanced Prudential standards on a firm that might fall under a new threshold if we thought it was justified by safety and soundness or financial stability concerns so the legislation that's been proposed I mean I haven't had a chance to study every detail of it but I would say it generally incorporates those those principles and is a move in a direction that we think would be good in enabling us to appropriately tailor our supervision

a gentlewoman is recognized thank you Mr Speaker and I rise in support of the rule to bring up to the how and resolution number nine socialism and why am I bringing this resolution to the floor of the United States House of Representatives because young people in America are being brainwashed by the news media and Academia into believing that socialism is an economic model for the greater good of all Americans and the problem is that they're falling for it they're believing it and here is the proof almost 40 percent of gen Z and Millennials think the Communist Manifesto written by Carl Marx the father of Marxism is a better defense of freedom and equality than the Declaration of Independence written by Thomas Jefferson one of the creators of the American experiment the American exceptionality and the document which gave birth to the most prosperous and resilient democracy in the history of the world ours the United States of America worse yet in a recent poll that shows that 40 percent of Americans of all ages not only the youth forty percent believe that socialism is good while 33 percent of them say that they are likely to support a member of the Democratic Socialist of America the organization that has shaped the ideology of many of our colleagues with the poison of neo-marxism if you go to their website to the Democratic Socialist of America website you will read their neo-marxist positions with pride I represent District Number 27 in the city of Miami or in Florida the city of Miami a Bastion of hundreds of thousands of Cubans nicaraguans and Venezuelans who have fled who have escaped from the Despicable Horrors that you cannot imagine produced by that ideology so why did the Venezuelans flee well because Venezuela why would they do that if Venezuela has almost 20 percent of the world's oil in other in other words that means the largest reserves of oil in the world the Venezuelans have more oil than the Saudi than the Saudis in Saudi Arabia in the 50s and the 60s they have the same GDP as Germany now inflation is 156 a year the third largest in the world the average Venezuelan has lost 15 pounds for lack of food in the last 20 years over 7 million Venezuelans have escaped the Democratic Socialist Paradise anywhere they could go that is more people than have fled the violence in Syria so that indicates that socialism is more devastating than a civil war another country who has lost everything is Nicaragua in the 70s was the Bread Basket of Central America but then the sandinistas arrived Daniel Ortega took power under the guidance of Fidel Castro in Cuba he expropriated almost 30 000 properties in few years right now their citizens are poorer than they were in 1977. but Ortega promised Democratic socialism but delivered dictatorship in the last presidential election seven people dared to run for president and he put them all in jail still today they're either order house arrest or in jail every socialist is a dictator in Disguise in Cuba after 60 years of living the Socialist Paradise the average Cuban 70 percent of the Cuban eats only once a day the average Cubans makes 23 dollars a month that is 40 cents a day and their retirees the seniors make twelve dollars Cuba in 1960 had the highest per capita income in the hemisphere and it was comparable to Italy and we know that because there is hungry hunger Hunger is a very powerful motivator so today Cubans throw by the thousands throw themselves to the sharks in the Straits of Florida looking for freedom and hoping to get to the district that I represent on this floor and that's just in this hemisphere in China 55 million died in Cambodia 1 million in the USSR 10 million froze to death in the gulags socialists are in the business of power and it only takes one generation to believe their false promises and lose our freedom it is a lie that socialism will solve your problems economic or social and if it's Democratic socialism and socialism and socialism is always socialism we cannot let this evil ideology take hold in this country we are in the United States the stronghold of Freedom that is why we must pass this resolution I yield back the balance of my time thank you gentleman

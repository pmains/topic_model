four minutes to the gentleman from Maryland the distinguished Democratic whip mr. Hoyer gentleman from Maryland is recognized for four minutes not a single person has read this bill it was filed an eight o'clock last night if we had put this on the floor not a single one of you on that side of the aisle would vote for it not one you have demagogued for years about reading the bills this doesn't come close to your three-day layover rule not close it is being rushed through because some have fundraisers perhaps this weekend or have flights or Codell as they want to go on and because we have wasted six months passing the appropriation bills which were supposedly should be passed by September 30th of last year no one can be proud of this process the speaker said when we set the caps that he would bring a bill to the floor he promised the 73 of us that made it possible to set these caps because you didn't have the votes on your side he promised that he would bring to this floor a fix for the dreamers who are at risk of being kicked out of the country I know there's a case but it's short-term not permanent but the speaker did not keep that promise it has not been on the floor what will you now have on the floor there's an appropriation bill I think most of us know what's in this appropriation bill these are earmarks you don't call them earmarks you call them authorizing language they're bills that nobody in the Appropriations Committee has read and if you have stand up and correct me as I said nobody's read that either this is report language come to the well if you've read this language none of you none of you would support this process if we had offered it now the good news is that what the Appropriations Committee has done is quality work and I congratulate miss LOI and mr. Frelinghuysen and the subcommittee chairs and the ranking members it is worthy of support but I'm waiting for all the tea parties people who harangue me and others on my side about reading the bills give me a sufficient time to consider them the Speaker of the House said when he became Speaker we will take issues one at a time is there no shame is there no realization of the hypocrisy that is being displayed mr. speaker the product is a good one and I say that about the appropriation bill I have no idea all the report language says and I certainly don't have some idea gentleman is recognized for one additional minute I thank the speaker and I thank Miss LOI we brought this country from the brink of depression to a growing robust economy with a stock market that is almost tripled by passing the National Recovery and Reinvestment Act not a single Republican voted for that mr. speaker not one I wonder how many will vote for this bill after they had time after time after time after time read the bill have three days labor now actually your three-day rule is a 24 hour and two second rule the last second of the first day 24 hours of the second day and the first second of the third day you put everybody in a quandary because this is a good product that the Appropriations Committee has delivered it does good things for our country both in terms of national security in terms of domestic investment what a sad state of affairs how dysfunctional this body has become how marginalized has the Appropriations Committee on which I was so proud to serve has become rushing it through in just a matter of minutes it's a sad day mr. speaker gentlemen Simon six-mile back the balance of my time it's time has expired gentlewoman from New York reserves gentleman from New Jersey is recognized mr. chairman I'm pleased to yield two minutes to the chairman of the labor Health and Human Services Subcommittee mr.

thank you mr chairman now more first i guess i would want to start with that a point of order uh is it too late to put in an amendment no the this we're what we're on david is the scalise amendment to the aims you can offer another one well you don't know if this other amendment mr chairman i just i just yes we may very well want to do that i just want to make sure that it was not too late to put in another amendment because uh with the congress woman eschew and i have worked together very well over numbers of years and i really appreciated that she brought to the attention the the bill we had last year uh hr 9 90 21 called the nursing home modernization reform modernization act um i think everything you learned you don't have it the amendment ready you mean yeah it's it i think i think you have it i've got a copy of it here now um and um are you prepared as an amendment i'm pretty yeah i've got to prepare this amendment but i'm saying well we can do i want to make sure that it was going to be it would be appropriate because sometimes the committee you we have to have two hours beforehand to submit those amendments no i know well one just let us look at it and submit it to the clerk and then uh we'll take a look at it for germaneus but if it's prepared and it is an amendment well it may it may not be germaine to to this section but then then we can offer it indeed but i'm just hoping that uh well let's take a minute because my my my point of bringing it up frank your chairman to your attention is i would hope that that that given that it was part of the rationale why on the other side of the aisle you wouldn't be supporting scalise's amendment because we have an alternative uh so if we put the alternative in would that change the temperature on the other side if we were to put this thing in the issue and i've put together this well we've got to look at it and see we're i mean you yeah you can't and you're not going to use it to amend the scalise amendment at this point i don't think right so why don't we take a look at it because right so let's take a look at it and see if we can bring it up uh under this title or whatever all right would you make sure that so then i i want to be able to uh maybe uh to yield to uh and ask you if she wanted to comment about that if we put uh because we've got it prepared as an amendment maybe she wants to take a look at that did you want to comment you just wanted to look is it is the gentleman yielding to me yes yes thank you thank you mr mckinley uh uh first i want to say i value my uh partnership and friendship uh with mr mckinley and uh i don't know whether uh this will pass the test of germaness uh so uh uh if it doesn't mr chairman um uh under regular order uh i believe that the legislation needs to move so uh i appreciate your uh willingness to take a look at it and uh um and putting a spotlight on it uh because i think it's gonna go a long way uh to uh uh to make the corrections uh that need to be made so with that i uh yield back thank you mr mckinley and thank you mr chairman mr mckinley i still got it one and a half minutes ago i hope that uh anna will continue with me and working that we can get that if it's not germane for this section it would be germaine for part d and i would hope that she would support that because what we're talking about in this legislation is a lot of what scalise has been talking about it it calls for oversight and res and and uh response and reporting provisions with it so it is dovetails very closely with what scalise is trying to accomplish here to getting reporting so we know what it is so i i i'm hoping if not now then we'll do it in d but i don't want to wait until we go through regular order on this because that we're on a subject right now that's hot it's it it's appropriate it's timely i hope that we can get this included in this bill thank you i yield back all right thank you and we'll take a look

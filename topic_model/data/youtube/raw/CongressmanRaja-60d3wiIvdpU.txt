. >> EARLIER IN THE SHOW WE DISCUSSED THE LATEST JANUARY 6TH HEARING AND AN ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN POTENTIALLY. NOW WE'RE JOINED AGAIN BY REPRESENTATIVES ROBIN KELLY, RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI AND JAN SCHAKOWSKI. AGAIN, WE ALSO INVITED ALL OF THE REPUBLICANS IN THE ILLINOIS CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION BUT NONE ACCEPTED OUR INVITATION. AND THANKS TO THE THREE OF YOU FOR STAYING WITH US FOR THIS CONVERSATION. I WANT TO START WITH LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR JULIANA STRATTON WHO TESTIFIED IN WASHINGTON TODAY THAT ILLINOIS IS QUOTE AN ISLAND FOR REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS AFTER THE SUPREME COURT OVERTURNED ROE AND THE STATE NEEDS HELP WITH THE FLOOD OF PATIENTS COMING HERE. TAKE A LOOK. >> ILLINOIS AND OTHER STATES WITH LEGAL ABORTION NEED MORE ACCESS TO FEDERAL MONEY TO SUPPORT DEMAND. >> CONGRESSWOMAN JAN SCHAKOWSKI COULD ILLINOIS GET FEDERAL FUNDING TO HELP WITH THE INFLUX OF PATIENTS COMING HERE? AND WHERE WOULD THE FUNDING COMING FROM? >> I'M HOPING IT WOULD. THERE IS AN EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT HAS A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT THINGS THAT WILL HELP WOMEN, HELP WOMEN ACROSS THE COUNTRY. BUT IN ILLINOIS WE HAVE REASON TO BE PROUD. WE HAVE ONE OF THE VERY BEST LAWS AND I THINK WOMEN WILL BE COMING TO THE STATE OF ILLINOIS IN DROVES PROBABLY TO GET ACCESS TO ABORTIONS. I HOPE THAT THERE COULD BE MORE FEDERAL DOLLARS TO HELP THEM. BUT WE HAVE EVERY REASON TO BE PROUD OF ILLINOIS. AND THE PRESIDENT TALKED ABOUT WHAT HE WANTS TO DO IS FOR SURE IN THE EXECUTIVE ORDER PROTECT THE RIGHT TO TRAVEL. IMAGINE SOME OF THE STATES WANT TO PROHIBIT WOMEN FROM EVEN GOING OUT OF STATE TO HAVE THEIR REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS REALIZED. >> CONGRESSWOMAN KELLY DEMOCRATS HAVE SCHEDULED VOTES ON ABORTION ACCESS INCLUDING PROTECTING THE RIGHT TO TRAVEL, BUT WITH REPUBLICANS AND ONE DEMOCRAT OPPOSED IN THE SENATE ARE THE MEASURES THAT ARE BEING PROPOSED ARE THEY BOUND TO FAIL? IS THERE A LEGISLATIVE PATH HERE? >> WE STILL HAVE TO TRY. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED ON THE GUN VOTE THAT PEOPLE NEVER THOUGHT WOULD PASS. WE STILL DID WHAT WE NEEDED TO DO AND PASS IT OVER TO THE SENATE. IT DID NOT COME BACK EXACTLY WHAT WE WANTED AND WE HAVE TO TRY. ALL THESE ADVOCATES AROUND THE COUNTRY. WE NEED THEIR HELP AND SUPPORT ALSO. BUT BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY WILL OR WON'T DO THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE DON'T DOUGH WHAT WE NEED TO DO AND DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT SOMETHING GETS PASSED IN THE SENATE SOMETHING THAT WILL HELP NOT JUST ANYTHING. >> CONGRESSMAN KRISHNAMOORTHI YOU TALKED ABOUT THE FILIBUSTER AND THE PRESIDENT SUPPORTS CHANGING THE FILIBUSTER IN THE SENATE TO CODIFY ABORTION RIGHTS BUT NO ACTION HAS BEEN TAKEN YET ON THAT OR VOTING RIGHTS. ARE DEMOCRATS FRUSTRATED HOW SLOWLY THINGS ARE MOVING ESPECIALLY AS WE APPROACH THE MIDTERMS? >> YES. BUT IT IS NOT A TIME TO AGONIZE IT IS A TIME TO ORGANIZE. THIS IS THE TIME WHEN WE HAVE TO GET PEOPLE TO RECOGNIZE THAT IN ONE ELECTION CYCLE, WE COULD ELECT AT LEAST TWO OR THREE NEW SENATORS. I DON'T CARE IF THEY ARE REPUBLICANS OR DEMOCRATS WHO WOULD BE WILLING TO CREATE THAT CARVE OUT AT THE LEAST IN THE FILIBUSTER RULES FOR REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM, GUN RIGHTS, VOTING RIGHTS. AND I THINK THAT WOULD BE A GAME-CHANGER. IN THE MEANTIME, HOLDING THE VOTES IS IMPORTANT FOR MAKING SURE WE GET PEOPLE ON THE RECORD. WE KNOW WHERE THEY STAND ON REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM AND THEN WE HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE IN NOVEMBER. AND ONE OTHER ISSUE THAT I WANT TO BRING UP WE HAVE TO ABSOLUTELY PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF ALL DATA THAT WOMEN HAVE ENTRUSTED TO TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES, AD COMPANIES WITH THEIR REPRODUCTIVE AND SEXUAL HEALTH. I'VE LAUNCHED AN INVESTIGATION WITH CAROLYN MALONEY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE APP COMPANIES THAT HAVE THIS DATA SHARE EXACTLY WITH WHOM THEY'VE PROVIDED THIS INFORMATION OR TO WHOM THEY HAVE PROVIDED THIS INFORMATION AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY DON'T PROVIDE IT TO OVERZEALOUS PROSECUTORS WHO WILL GO AFTER THESE WOMEN BASED ON THAT INFORMATION. SO WE HAVE TO TAKE ALL THESE MEASURES. PROTECTING WOMEN'S RIGHT TO TRAVEL. PROTECTING THEIR PRIVACY OF THEIR SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH INFORMATION AND MAKING SURE THAT MEDICATION, ABORTION MEDICATION IS ALSO AVAILABLE AND ACCESSIBLE AND WE PROTECT THE PROVIDERS AND PHARMACISTS WHO DISPENSE IT. >> AND SPEAKING OF THE MIDTERMS, PRESIDENT BIDEN'S LOW APPROVAL RATINGS, 39% VOTER TURNOUT FOR THE PRIMARY ALSO LOW AROUND 20% STATE-WIDE. AS THE CHAIR OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY OF ILLINOIS WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO MOBILIZE VOTERS AS INFLATION AND GAS PRICES ARE SO HIGH RIGHT NOW? >> THE GAS PRICES ARE COMING DOWN. AS THE NEWS REPORTED. WE'RE TRYING TO TOUCH AS MANY DEMOCRATS AS POSSIBLE AND GET AS MANY PEOPLE REGISTERED. WE HAVE VOLUNTEERS ALL OVER THE STATE. WE HAVE DATA AVAILABLE FOR PEOPLE. WE HAVE ALLIES THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH AND COUNTY CHAIRS AND TOWNSHIPS, DEMOCRATIC CHAIRS. WE ARE ALL OVER. AND ALSO TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE REALIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE VOTE IN NOVEMBER. IT'S GENERATIONAL NOT JUST ABOUT TWO YEARS AND WHY SOME OF THE THINGS WE'RE DEALING WITH NOW THAT WE DON'T LIKE WHY WE'RE DEALING WITH IS BECAUSE WHO IS AT THE TABLE PARTICULARLY ON THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. SO WE WANT TO SEE VOTING GUNS AND GUN VIOLENCE AND WOMEN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE AND PRIVACY AND EVEN THINGS ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WE HAVE TO HAVE THE RIGHT PEOPLE AT THE TABLE AND IT'S UP TO THE PUBLIC TO CAST THEIR VOTES. >> REPRESENTATIVE JAN SCHAKOWSKI, SPEAKS OF PRESIDENT BIDEN, IS IT A MISSTEP FOR HIM TO GO TO SAUDI ARABIA AFTER HE PROMISED DURING HIS CAMPAIGN THAT HE WOULD MAKE THE KINGDOM A PARIAH? >> WELL, WE'LL SEE WHAT THE GOAL IS TO MAYBE EXTRACT SOME THINGS FROM THE -- FROM THE SAUDIS. I JUST I WANT TO SAY THIS. THERE HAS BEEN RIGHT NOW, A SEA CHANGE IN THE ENTHUSIASM GAP. DEMOCRATS RIGHT NOW ARE IN THE LEAD. AND ALL OF THE INCUMBENT SENATORS ARE DEMOCRATIC INCUMBENT SENATORS ARE WINNING RIGHT NOW ACCORDING TO THE POLLS. SO I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE CONCENTRATING MORE NOT ON THE FOREIGN TRIPS THAT THE PRESIDENT IS MAKING. BUT ON THE ISSUES THAT ARE AFFECTING THEIR DAILY LIVES. LIKE TAKING AWAY ABORTION RIGHTS IT IS A TSUNAMI OUT THERE OF PEOPLE PROTESTING THAT AND WE'RE SEEING THAT IN THE POLLS NOW. >> OK. OUR THANKS TO REPRESENTATIVES ROBIN KELLY, RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI

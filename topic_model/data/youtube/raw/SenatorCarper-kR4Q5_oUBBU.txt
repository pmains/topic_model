at least once a year the president nited states addresses a joint session of the Congress when he does that the the latin words eep loris onnum appear of right behind him the words I never took Latin but for those who have a explain to me the pleura sonam means from any one from anyone and the the suggestion there is that while in this country we come from many places in the end or we're one or the United States of America and sometimes we need a reminder of that and sometimes reminders can be pretty tragic probably one of the biggest tragedies we've ever lived through the nation was the the catastrophe the tragedy of 911 when we lost thousands of people and the crash of the two airplanes into the towers in New York City into the Pentagon and in a farm field near place called Shanksville Pennsylvania where the passengers on that airplane had learned that of the crashes into the World Trade Towers they learned about the crash the airplane into the Pentagon and their aircraft had been flying out I guess flying out if I New Jerseyan they learned that the other three planes it crashed and that their aircraft have been commandeered and rather than allow that aircraft to proceed to its destination piloted by the terrorists some of the passengers took matters into their own hands and they're led by a fella it's a regular citizen named Todd Beamer and he and some of the other people on other men I believe on flight 93 decided they weren't going to let that plane continued to its destination which a lot of a lot of intelligence experts believe was the capital of the United States US Capitol where I work the words that I think Todd Beamer said as he led the the assault on the terrace in the airplane that day or let's roll and what the United States needs to do is to roll again and to pull together as as one very much as we did on that day of 911 very much as the people did the passengers did on that flight on 93 on that day that evening of 911 there was a almost a spontaneous gathering on the steps of the Capitol and we had Democrats and Republicans House and Senate members who gathered there for a prayer and the the visual message from from that gathering I think was was was strong was really what we needed as a nation the idea again employer him from many states many congressional districts we were one we're one that that day that night and they recreated shortly thereafter under legislation and 911 commission is Democrat it was Republican led by Foreman Republican Governor Tom Kean of New Jersey and led by Lee Hamilton for congressman from Indiana was one of my mentors when i served in the house and although they were democrat republican it was equally divided in the end they adopted sum 41 recommendations to help make us stronger more secure as a nation and everyone on that Commission although they came from many places voted as one and again for many one and the Congress took up those the recommendations and adopted almost not all of them but almost all of them we have handful still to go and Lee Hamilton and Tom Tom keen or again encouraging us to finish our work and I hope that we will few of us who are alive and watching the news on 911 will forget the moving vision of hundreds thousands of people rushing away out of and away from the towers in in New York and in washing the firemen and the police and other emergency workers rush in that was the kind of sacrifice that we saw on flight 93 and that's the kind of sacrifice that really has made our country great over the years where people from many places decided to pull together united as one do what's right for for our country we need eye on this 911 is 10th anniversary commemoration 911 we really need to rekindle that that spirit people watch what goes on in our nation's capital these days sometimes do I'm sure with the with despair and rather than just be despondent and and moan and groan about well it's too bad it it is this way we need to change it and it that certainly puts a burden on me to reach out to my colleagues and I try to do that every day I try to take the spirit of Delaware really the spirit of return day to our nation's capital in to infuse the way we do work together in Delaware I into the way that we ought to be working together in Washington it's a spirit of 911 we never think of that as the spirit that the reserve really permeates the way we operate in our state but we do and we need to restore that not just for a day or for a week or for a couple of months but for a long long time and to those who from our state whose lives were were touched tragically by loss of a child or a parent or an uncle who knew someone who was on those flights or in those buildings we just want to especially remember you today but I think the best way to remember all those who lost their lives and all those who sacrificed their lives to save others the best way the really the best way most fitting way to remember them as for us to set aside the bickering set aside the the name-calling and the blame me and everything and remember those words those Latin words a player's unum from many one and to remember that we're not just the United States of America we are the United States of America the United States of America and it's time that we again acted as if we were that United States of America god bless you

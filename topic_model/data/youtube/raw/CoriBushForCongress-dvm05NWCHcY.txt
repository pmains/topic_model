I've lived in St. Louis all of my life, and
my heart hurts to see our region being represented by career politicians that take large sums
of money from corporations while we have some of the highest rates of poverty, unaccredited
schools, and healthcare disparities. We should not have to wait another 17 years
for change. I am a registered nurse and an activist, but
I am also the people I represent. So I, too, have struggled, trying to give
the best to my children on a minimum wage salary. That's why I'm fighting for 15 - because families
deserve a livable wage. I want to see our children, regardless of
zip code, have quality education - because that is the best deterrent for poverty. I want healthcare for all - because it is
a human right. I fight for all of these issues now for free. I just want the chance to do it in Washington,
D.C. I am Cori, and I'm running for U.S. Congress
in Missouri's 1st District. Paid for by Cori Bush for Congress

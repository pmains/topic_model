let's bring in south carolina congresswoman nancy may she is a member of the house transportation and infrastructure committee as well as the oversight and reform committee congresswoman good to see you this monday afternoon why is it important to you that this critical race proposal not go forward well for certain i'm a parent of two kids in middle school and critical race theory this is marxist ideology that they're trying to teach to our children that says to us that all of us are racist and it is about indoctrination it's about forcing our kids um to see that we're all racist and to teach racist ideology and to further divide our country and at a time when we are so divided and not working together this is the last thing that we need to be doing right now is the reason that i'm sponsoring legislation that defunds critical race theory in our military and being taught in public schools this this kind of decision should be made by school boards and states where parents get to have a say and not the federal government we'll get to that legislation in just a moment but first of all jackie mentioned just a little bit of this these 20 attorneys general have said that if the department of education does not take away this proposal for critical race theory it should at least quote make clear that grants may not fund projects that are based on crt including any projects that characterize the united states as irredeemably racist or founded on principles of racism or that assign fault blame or bias to a particular race or to an individual because of his or her race could could you be guaranteed that even if this proposal went forward that those conditions were met or do you have to scrap the whole thing i think you have to scrap the whole thing i mean honestly and every state is going to be different and different municipalities would be different which is why it's important that we understand that the federal government should not have a say on curriculum for states or different school boards they should be able to make that decision because they're the ones that are held accountable to parents like myself and others around the country whose kids are being educated in public schools so let's get back to the legislation here because we know that during the trump administration the white house uh passed a rule that prohibited the teaching of critical race theory to federal employees you have signed on to legislation that would restore that after the biden administration took that down as well as not teaching critical race theory to members of the military clearly because they're supporting the bite administration democrats aren't going to allow that to happen so what are you trying to do here get on the record lay the groundwork for november 2022 what's the goal yeah absolutely and president biden and he's reversed almost every good decision that president trump and his administration did including defunding critical race theory in our country and it's important for republicans to stand up have their voices heard in 2022 we have a lot to run on i mean this is president biden is being guided by the far left by aoc by nancy pelosi he's done more damage in 100 days than i thought possible in four years and it's important for us to let parents make a decision let school boards make a decision on how our children are educated and so there are two very important bills that are circulating right now on the hill and one is to defund critical race theory with our military and also in our public schools and i'm on board 100 and so should every other republican out there today let's talk about infrastructure because that's another big topic there on capitol hill and at the white house the white house counter proposed the republican counter proposal by saying it would come down to 1.7 trillion dollars for infrastructure so there's still a tremendous amount of real estate between the republicans in the white house and in the white house's counter proposal they take away almost 40 billion dollars from traditional infrastructure of roads bridges and the like is there ever going to get a deal done here i'm saying it's doubtful every day i think president biden he's just playing ftse with senate republicans right now he left all of the horrible green new deal spending that's in there environmental justice and social justice that has absolutely nothing to do with traditional infrastructure and i drove my kids this morning to school and dropped them off and i sat in traffic for quite some time this morning i understand like every other working american out there everyone has to take their kids to school that those things have nothing to do with our roads and bridges and they've got to trim down the bill at 1.7 trillion you're still going to have to have one of the largest tax hikes in american history to pay for it they refuse to cut spending anywhere else and this is critical for our nation's future a presidential aide over the weekend said that the president's going to give it a little bit more time to see if a deal can get done and if not he's going to give up on the idea of bipartisanship 10 seconds left here do you expect that the democrats are going to go it alone here and can they well nancy pelosi from where on the street is she's already taken over the house infrastructure committee there will be no deal as far as we're concerned which is why you're seeing republicans in the senate and the house put their own proposals and alternatives forward and that's how we're going to move forward on this one

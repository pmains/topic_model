senator from Rhode Island Thank You mr. president I'm very pleased to join my colleague senator Franken and Senator Warren who was also here for this conversation that was kicked off earlier this afternoon by our friend and colleague from West Virginia senator mentioned that West Virginia does not have a whole lot in common with Rhode Island where a coastal state and Senator Manchin comes from a very landlocked mountainous state our biggest mouth in a while it is probably the Johnston landfill but we have something in common which is the extent to which opioid addiction and opioid overdoses have stricken our states we had over 200 guests per year going and in a state our size you know everybody is within two or three degrees of separation of everybody else and those 200 deaths reverberate through our whole state there's a small town in Rhode Island called Burrillville up in our northwest corner Burrillville is a very small town in Rhode Island and I went up there for a meeting about the opioid epidemic at the Burrell high school and in the previous quarter in just three months that one little town had had six deaths from opioid overdoses at six times the little police force had to respond six times the funeral parlors had to handle grieving families six times that death notices had to be published in the local paper it felt like a battering to people in that community senator Manchin I think has a pretty good idea to help make sure that we have the funding to get treatment to people before these tragedies take place he proposes what he called the lifeboat act which is one penny one penny for each milligram of active opioid in a prescription drug one penny it's only a penny but it would have raised about two billion dollars last year and two billion dollars would save a lot of people and save a lot of lives just to give you some idea of the scale Purdue pharmaceuticals generated estimated sales of more than thirty-five billion dollars since 1995 for opioid medications it has annual revenues of about three billion dollars mostly from oxycontin that's just one company so the idea of adding a penny really doesn't seem to me to be asking very much I know the way we operate now in the Senate asking corporations to do anything seems impossible because they have the financial whip hand over so many senators because of the unlimited money they're allowed to spend and threaten to spend in our politics but really after all the lives that have been lost after all the lives have been effective you would expect that just out of common decency this industry would step up and say for a penny we're in so let's hope that they come around to that because I think it's a good plan Trump care on the other hand would be a disaster so many people get their opioid treatment through Medicaid and many through the expansion of Medicaid that the Affordable Care Act created to undo that to strip 1.4 trillion dollars as president Trump has proposed out of Medicaid is inevitably going to die people access to care that's not just me saying this somebody who works in Providence with recovering heroin addicts wrote to me his name is Travis he wrote to me about his clients who are receiving medication-assisted treatment he credits them being able to come in and get the care that they get to the Affordable Care Act it is the reason he said that he and his colleagues have been able to help recovering addicts enter effective treatment programs and it works Travis relates that repealing the Affordable Care Act would have what he calls a profound impact on his clients ability to get needed addiction and recovery services I will turn the floor over to Senator Warren in a minute but I want to recognize one other person I won't use last names his name is Mark he wrote to me from Rumford Rhode Island which is a very nice part of East Providence Rhode Island this is a gentleman who became addicted to opioids at the age of 52 he had a surgery after the surgical procedure his doctor gave him opiates for the pain the doctor was somewhat indiscriminate about continuing to prescribe those opioids and Mark realized that he was addicted he went to a Recovery Group in Rhode Island called Kodak which does very very good work for treatment he went into recovery and he succeeded for eight years without using opioids and sometimes happens family stresses business stresses other stresses intervene and in his case a family stress caused a relapse but he knew what to do he went back to Kodak he became sober again and now he's back in recovery clean and sober this pattern of recovery and then an occasional relapse and then back to recovery again is very often the way people who have an addiction thrilling and to make sure that the treatment is there for them when they relapse can be a lifesaver by the way mark is a success he's in the music business he has toured around the world and the fact that Kodak was there for him on these two occasions has allowed him to achieve that success again a 52 year old individual who a surgery sent into addiction I'll close by pointing out that one of the things that the Caribbean of us worked so hard on accomplished was to send the message that addiction is not a moral failing it is a medical condition and it should be treated as a medical condition not only is it not a moral failing I think many of us who have had family loved one friends or any experience with folks who are going through recovery what we have learned is that recovery is actually a noble accomplishment it's not an easy path but it's a path of demands deep honesty deep courage deep trust very often love and that it's a path that people who are walking it can and should be proud of and we should be proud of them for their achievements and we should be there for them in their relapses and make sure that the care that will put them back onto that path is available so with that I will yield the floor to my terrific colleague from Massachusetts

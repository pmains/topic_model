I think senator grassley has already raised the issue of bipartisan legislation he and Senator Wyden and others on this County crafted in order to try to reduce prescription drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries and it's not every day that we have the kind of consensus that we had in this committee on on this issue but we're encouraged by that little as you know the legislation would with lower drug prices for seniors of large drug prices for Medicare and Medicaid require drug companies to publicly justify the prices for their products in a day and age when we're trying to find ways to save money with respect to pharmaceutical costs and other health care costs in ways that are humane with the people I think this is a very good effort we're proud of it we sass to you and the president support the Finance Committee's bipartisan bill to reduce drug prices we we've been very active in working with the bipartisan leadership of this committee to try to advance this legislation if we want to get this or some other comparable bipartisan package through we need to do this it's a this is certainly one that fits the bill if there are other approaches that we need to take to try to get this to the floor and get it passed we're open to that but we've been very deeply engaged with Democrats and Republicans on this committee to advance the Grassley Wyden legislation thank you some of our Republican colleagues have believed that the finances a bill would amount to price controls in the pharmaceutical industry and jeopardize an innovation for for new therapies and as a former CEO a native I think of Salisbury Maryland but it was a former CEO of a major drug company do you agree with these concerns and the second half of that question would be do you think drug companies can continue to innovate under the Finance Committee's bill I with all respect I fundamentally disagree with the notion that the inflation penalty provisions that are in the Grassley Wyden bill constitute price caps or price controls these are the reason these are reasonable restrictions on price increases that create basically a financial disincentive to the year-after-year price increases that we see as long as those incentives are in the system we will continue to see year after year price increases and the Grassley Wyden package would contain that it's important to remember these drug companies already signed contracts with the middlemen with long-term price predictability price predictability guarantees so this is not an alien concept to the drug companies this exists as a commercial practice already we would just get the benefit for our seniors and our taxpayers through this through this program and I'm sorry I said there was a second part of your part your question I want to make sure I get that yeah senator Carper before you repeat that second equation without taking time away from you wouldn't another way of saying it since we pay a hundred and thirty eight billion dollars of taxpayers money for Medicare drugs that we would be just capping the subsidy that we give to insurance give to pharmaceutical companies what it does and that's that's one of the really important innovations of the Grassley Wyden package is it actually changes the dynamic right now interestingly the middlemen who run these drug plants have every incentive actually for the drug companies to jack up their list price because it races the senior to what's called the catastrophic phase where the government pays most of the cost of that insurance through the reinsurance this would be fixed by Grassley Wyden thanks Roman the second half my question I don't think you got to it was do you think drug companies can continue to innovate under the Finance Committee's bill oh absolutely the changes here still leave plenty of room for profit margin innovation and investment there there would be no material impact in any way to the R&D Enterprise in the United States which we are all committed to all right my colleagues here we have quote from time to time Matthew 25 was goes something like this when I was hungry did you feed me when he's naked did you clothed me when who's thirsty did you give me to drink doesn't say anything about when I desperately needed pharmaceuticals it saved my life doesn't say anything did you provide that but I think the the intent is clear and sadly with respect to the President's budget the answer to these questions is not all not entirely but too often no over a hundred million Americans have you as you've heard as you know however million of our fellow Americans have pre-existing condition these folks depend on the Affordable Care Act's protections for their health care and the promise of affordable health insurance regardless of their health conditions the president has doubled down though on the Texas law suit against the ACA in this budget contains no plans as far as I can tell to replace the ACA if the court strikes down the law which will leave millions of additional Americans stranded without health insurance Medicaid and high prescription drug costs all while cutting taxes for the wealthiest among us my question mr. secretary would how will the president protect Americans with pre-existing conditions if the ACA is struck down in the courts so the president has been very clear that he will never sign legislation that doesn't that would replace the Affordable Care Act if it does not have adequate protections for those with pre-existing conditions it's important to remember though that even under the ACA there is a there is a statement of protecting against pre-existing conditions but let's say you're a a two person family making seventy thousand a year in Missouri you're gonna pay over thirty thousand a year for premium and you're gonna have over ten thousand dollars in out-of-pocket so I do think we have we we have to not over glamorize the current situation in terms of the protection of those with pre-existing conditions because for those people that that insurance card is a in some respects a meaningless protection for pre exit conditions and we'd work we want to work that Congress if there's the opportunity to replace it was something that really would work for my time is expiring let me just conclude with this quick comment if I could my understanding if the ACA is struck down in the courts the president won't have to sign anything that'll be that would be it and I want us to keep our minds and our eyes on that thank you

millions of young people are hurting right now in America they are up to their eyeballs in debt and they can't find good-paying jobs for example we've seen in our home state according to the Oregon Employment Department that the overall unemployment rate last year was nine point four percent but was nineteen percent for workers aged 16 to 24 and I would also note that we have seen again most recently that the labor participation for young people as declined as well so we have a enormous array of challenges in front of us and the reason that this legislation the stop student loan interest rate hike is so important is that it allows us to achieve two important objectives first it puts us in a position to hold the line on student debt the second part of this legislation in my view is by holding the line on debt you increase the opportunity for young people to get more value out of their education and the reason I bring this up mr. president is my sense is that future policy in the higher education field is going to be about marrying these two objectives let's support this important legislation s 2343 to expand access and use it as a foundation to move on to the next step of education policy which is to get more value out of the education that a young person pursues I've also introduced a piece of legislation with our colleagues from the other side of the aisle Marco Rubio called the student right to Oh before you go act so that it is possible for students all across the country to get information about the expected average annual earnings after graduation the roommate rates of remedial enrollment for a particular field at a particular college the average cost both before and after financial aid and the prospects of a student earning a good wage after achieving a particular degree at a particular school and with this legislation mr. president we lay the foundation for what I think will be the education policy of the future ensuring that students have access and ensuring that they get more value out of the education and in many instances these loans and other programs that they have to pay back and the two go hand in hand and if we don't take steps to hold the line on debt first of all and that is to pass senator Harkins bill so we don't say to college you know sophomores juniors you know we don't care if you rack up any more debt when we know how much heartache it's going to bring up to them and then move on to the next step which is empowering students and families to be able to get the maximum amount of value out of their education I think we will have let the country down in this area at a crucial time we understand that higher education is one of the principal if not the best for many students paths to success not for every student but certainly for millions and it has been and why I describe particularly what young people have contributed in technology a real spark for our economy so I see other colleagues waiting to speak and I only urge colleagues to pass this legislation 2343 to ensure that we don't heap more debt under the backs of students and in college and now who might be looking at re-upping on those loans and wondering if they can afford it and then as we expand access let's look at taking additional steps to ensuring that our young people get more value for their college education center Rubio and I have teamed up on a bill that I think addresses that question the student right to know before you go act and to me going to that next step of adding more value to a young person's education when they're armed with the facts requires that you lay the foundation of access to a good education which I think requires at this time when so many young people are hurting and I went through the statistics it requires that we pass s 2343 with that mr. president I yield the floor

say thank you to those who served our veterans uh in fact in my book every day is veteran's day i can't speak here not help but think about one of my favorite veterans and that was my father a world war ii veteran who served as obama gear on b17 in the european theater and i think about his generation and what they did for america i think about uh franklin roosevelt i think about winston churchill what he talked about and that is weakness invites aggression he talked about appeasement and they defeated one of the most evil forces known to mankind and they handed down a better america to my generation a safer and more prosperous nation i had the great honor of going to the reagan library last weekend in a national defense forum with the secretary of defense secretary of homeland security and a lot of the top military officials in our our government i'm proud of the work they do and i i couldn't help but notice the words on the wall at the library it said peace through strength and that's what reagan stood for and i think those words ring so true today that only through a strong military can we have true peace the peace through strength really really means something today and it was that peace through strength that defeated communism in the cold war and now we face a new generation of threats and that's radical islam is terror we know that in iraq and syria that isis has taken over and formed a caliphate we know in northern africa the radical islamist forces are at play uh as we speak this is a threat to my generation it is a threat that i hope my five children will not have to deal with in their lifetime that's why our military is so important and as we look at the russian airliner being down by an isis a bomb placed by isis on an airplane we thought al qaeda al qaeda had that capability but now we see isis has this capability to blow up airplanes i don't want that threat turned against the united states of america on airplanes inbound to the united states everything i do in this job is to prevent that kind of threat from occurring into united states military that will finally defeat and destroy this evil force known to mankind and we need a strategy we need a military strategy to defeat it because if we don't defeat it over there it will come here so i want to say thank you and i want to leave you with um one of the greatest moments of my life i think on my bucket list if you will was going to normandy uh this last may and my father was part of that air campaign and to lay a wreath at the monument in normandy the picture of my father in the middle of all the white crosses at that hollow ground that sacred cemetery of our fallen heroes and then they played taps and there wasn't a dry eye in the house and then we went to omaha beach where the 3 000 soldiers were killed in one day on one beach and then we saw a point to hawk where colonel rutter that fighting texas aggie led the army rangers up that cliff for many scenes and movies that we have all seen to go up that cliff and defeat the nazis that were on top and the pill boxes on top of that cliff and i think about what they did and they were just kids they were 19 20 years old and think about what they did at a time of great darkness when people say that things are so bad today i remind them of that time and how great that generation was in defeating one of the most evil forces known to mankind and coming out victorious as a nation's as a world superpower and i would submit it's time to lead as a superpower across this world you want them to like it but they're all not going to like it but if they don't like you you want them to respect you and if they don't respect you you want them to fear you that is her doctrine i believe it's a doctrine of churchill ronald reagan and i think it's a doctrine that will defeat this evil force that we have in our lifetime our great generational struggle and i am optimistic that we prevail at the end of the day because this is a great country and we will restore the greatness of america so i want to leave you with these words it was written by a father of brian in the marine corps and i think it really defines the soldiers so well he said uh he said it is a soldier not the minister who has given us freedom of religion it is a soldier not the reporter who has given us freedom of the press it is the soldier not the poet who has given us freedom a speech it is the soldier not the camp campus organizer who has given us freedom to protest it is the soldier not the lawyer who has given us a right to a fair trial it is a soldier not the politician who has given us the right to vote it is the soldier who salutes the flag who serves beneath the flag and whose coffin is draped by the flag who allows the protester to burn the flag god bless all of you veterans out there may god bless this great state of texas and may he got may bless the united states of america

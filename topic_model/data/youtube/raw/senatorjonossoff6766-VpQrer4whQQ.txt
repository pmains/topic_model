good afternoon all and thank you for joining me i'm convening us this afternoon to sound the alarm our state's precious natural resource the okefenokee swamp one of the most pristine black water swamps and wetland ecosystems in the world a place that countless georgians have visited to learn about our natural environment to go paddling or camping with family or scout troops the okefenokee swamp something precious to our state is at dire risk of destruction and so i am calling on the environmental protection agency the army corps of engineers and georgia's environmental protection division to save the okefenoke swamp and i am urging every elected official in georgia and we already have strong bipartisan support for the swamp this is not a partisan issue every organization and group committed to the protection of our environment every group of fishers and hunters and outdoorsmen scout troops to engage and join me in this effort to save the okefenoke the hydrological and biological damage that could be done to the swamp if this lithium strip mining proposal goes forward is immense we cannot afford the destruction of one of georgia's most precious natural resources and with that i'm happy to take any questions members of the press all right frank thank you senator um as a reminder if you have any questions please use the ray's hen function on zoom um you can also pop into the chat that you'd like to be immediate or put your questions in the chat and i will read them from there i'm not seeing any questions if anyone has anything please pop it into the chat okay we have a question from ms landers about the proposed mining project so this is the proposed twin pines mine along the fringe of the okefenoke swamp and hydrological and biological analysis of the impact of this mine suggests that it may do severe and irreversible damage to the swamp ruining the swamp as not just a place where people can go and enjoy themselves and participate in nature but also as a vital natural resource a wetland ecosystem a biodiverse habitat for precious wildlife remember guys this is a natural resource that's being considered as a world heritage site this is one of the most precious natural resources that we have in the state of georgia and as and and to answer your questions specifically miss landers as for the specific mineral deposits that may be sought by twin clients mining there i'll have my team follow up with me directly about that for any clarity that you need all right thank you senator um one last call if anyone has any questions let me know in the chat or use the raise hand function um if not well thank you for joining us and if you looks like one more um from mary in the chat okay well ms landers asks about potential action by uh epd and you know i can't comment on epd's internal deliberations but again i'm sounding the alarm because i am deeply concerned that our state may lose the okefenokee swamp this precious natural resource unless epa the army corps and georgia's environmental protection division take action to stop it there is bipartisan support among elected officials for saving the okefenoke swamp overwhelmingly the people of georgia and of the local community treasure the okefenokee swamp but i'm sounding the alarm because we need an all hands on deck effort now to bring the pressure to bear necessary to save the okinopi swamp from destruction great thank you senator yeah this is a final question i'm going to take from from ms landers if anybody else has uh any questions related to the subject matter then now is the time to put those in the chat or raise your hand but ms landers to your question regarding the core as you know i have contacted the epa and the corps to determine what federal authorities exist to protect the swamp and the answer is that the federal government does have the authority under existing law to prevent the destruction of the okefenoke swamp and i would refer you to those agencies to get specific comments from them on which authorities they might exercise to do so so uh thank you all for your time if you have any follow-ups please contact jake i appreciate it

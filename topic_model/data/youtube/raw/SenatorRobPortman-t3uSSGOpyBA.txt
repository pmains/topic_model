and president come to the floor today for the 26th consecutive week that the Senate's been in session to highlight the very latest from Russia's illegal unprovoked and deadly assault on Ukraine this continues to be a critical time for Ukraine and Ukraine's Freedom Fighters and it's a classic fight for freedom at this critical juncture right as the winter months approach Russia's morale is flagging and ukrainians are making steady gains on the battlefield it is absolutely vital that the United States and our allies continue to stand by the people of Ukraine we can't pull back now Ukraine as you know is a democracy they're a great Ally of ours they just want to live in peace with their neighbors including Russia over the objections of 140 countries in the United Nations Russia launched a brutal invasion of Ukraine on February 24th that was nine months ago and they haven't let up well we celebrated Thanksgiving holiday this past week here in America ukrainians endured a deadly week of Russian attacks and bombardments on civilian population centers far far from the front lines they didn't get a Thanksgiving break for the war Russia's military is actually continuing to bomb inside of Ukraine even today civilian targets what's interesting is that at the same time Ukraine is winning on the battlefield so over half of Ukraine's russian-occupied territory has now been liberated remember at one point Ukraine included occupied territory appear near Kiev the capital and all this area most of that area has now been liberated and these are the areas where the Russians continue to occupy Crimea which they took back in 2014 parts of the don't ask that they took back in 2014 and in these additional areas and even today the ukrainians are making progress in these areas so on the battlefield the ukrainians with our help and the help from about 50 countries around the world are making progress and yet Russia continues to launch these missiles into Ukraine even in a place like Bak moot one place where the Russians were making some progress using mercenary forces the Wagner group it's called their months-long assault by these Russian forces has turned into a grinding a grinding Battle of attrition and Russia's made little to no gains so in the Bak Mook region which is right here even there where the vaunted Wagner of Wagner group is fighting they're not making significant progress at all by the way back in April of 2018 I visited Bach moot I was able to go there as part of a congressional fact-finding trip and the uh Ukrainian military allowed me to see the line of contact actually go to that border area the line of contact being between the occupied part in 2014 and the rest of Ukraine that's where I learned that the ukrainians were going to fight by the way because I talked to a lot of the soldiers there about what was going on and when there was discussion uh several years later about whether ukrainians would fight if the Russians invaded as it appeared clear they were going to do I had no doubt the Russians were going to fight because I met these soldiers and talked to them and they were hardened and they knew what Russia had done to them and their families and their country and their freedom and they have fought here's a photo of me back in 2018 in this area of bakmud and as you can see you have Ukrainian soldiers walking around freely here's a photograph of buckmut today to show you the difference back when I was there there were sniper sniper activity you could hear some artillery being fired off in the distance but today months and months of Russia's brutal assault has led to bakmut looking like this here's the Ukrainian Soldier today um it's a hellscape straight from the Western Front of world war one isn't it Relentless artillery bombardments of forced soldiers into these trenches just like they dug in France during World War One World War II this is the condition that Ukrainian soldiers were fighting in to defend their families to defend their freedom to defend their country and they're doing it as the temperatures plummet and winter approaches but they're undeterred and they continue to fight hard the response to Ukraine making progress on the battlefield is by Russia to launch these missiles into the interior I really think it's out of frustration it's a cowardly approach they can't win on the battlefield so instead they're sitting back in Russia and bombing these civilian targets here's one you can see it's an energy grid in Ukraine this is in Western Ukraine and it's just Relentless bombing they're killing people when they do this by the way they're not just taking out energy infrastructure they're killing civilians including energy workers again it's a cowardly approach they're killing civilians and non-combatants needlessly slaughtering men women children they they're attacking residential areas and they have been all along apartment buildings hospitals Community buildings and of course causing cities to go dark as they go into winter dark and cold when we were in Ukraine just a few weeks ago Senator Coons and myself Senator Coons colleague on the other side of the island I went to get some additional information on the ground in Ukraine we got to see this firsthand this is uh in key the capital of Ukraine and this is where the control center was for the this energy utility and this had happened just a few days before we got there so the Russians are targeting very specifically energy to knock out electricity knockout heating knock out water that night by the way we had dinner with Ukrainian parliamentarians it was a dinner meeting to talk about what we can do as Congress and what they can do as parliamentarians to help the Ukrainian people right now we had to have the meal by flashlight and candles because there was no electricity the systemic bombing of Civilian infrastructure throwing these Ukrainian cities into the dark and the cold without running water has been met by heroic repair of by ukrainians I imagine this is already repaired but again the Russians keep bombing they need our help to be able to help repair and provide more equipment as this equipment is being destroyed by the Russians today I was pleased to say see that Secretary of State Anthony blinken announced an additional 53 million dollars from the United States to support efforts to rebuild this Ukrainian energy grid that keeps getting destroyed by the Russians this package will include distribution Transformers circuit breakers surge arrestors disconnectors vehicles and other key equipment it brings U.S support for Ukraine's energy infrastructure since February up to about 145 million dollars but again it's not just us and it shouldn't be just us our allies need to step forward to help Ukraine in this difficult moment as well and they are Finland as an example I just saw will send energy equipment to Ukraine this week the EU European Union will give Ukraine 200 Transformers and 40 heavy generators to support the energy sector that's the eu's probably giving more than anyone else this critical Aid is needed because again these attacks just continue and continue the recent attacks in Keith by the way that we saw earlier when I was there three weeks ago three hundred thousand Ukrainian citizens and Kiev had lost power when we were there I'm told that there are currently about 130 000 key of residents losing power without electricity Ukrainian military again has been making progress and they've had a huge success here in Harrison um this city of Kershaw or Harrison as it's called and Ukrainian was the first provincial and only provincial capital that the Russians occupied and the first major city that they took the Ukrainian military carefully and over time orchestrated a great Victory there and about three weeks ago it was liberated as this photo shows Ukrainian citizens have welcomed these soldiers as Heroes and you've probably seen some of this on the TV news but you know they've just embraced these soldiers and they put the Ukrainian Flags back up in all the buildings um and they've told these soldiers and others including the investigators from the international criminal court of the war crimes the unthinkable war crimes that were committed by the Russian occupiers while they were there so the Russians were forced out of caresol because of very effective work by the ukrainians using the weapons that we and the Europeans had provided them including longer range missiles taking out their supplies taking out their ability to resupply themselves so what's happened now is that Russia once they have left Carousel have now started a bombing campaign just non-stop bombing in the very City that they occupied only a few weeks ago so they're saying if we can't have it we're just going to bomb it into Oblivion ukrainians are having now after having lived through the occupation to try to live through this bombing I saw the Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine recently urged civilians to leave Carousel and go to other parts of Ukraine this winter during due to these Russian attacks that's what has to be done the soldiers will stay and they'll fight but the Russians are just constantly attacking kerosol this area this oblast it's called the provincial area 10 people have recently been killed 54 injured um they shelled the Russians shelled this provincial area around here 49 times on Thanksgiving Day 49 missiles and bombs on Thanksgiving Day hitting residential buildings a shipyard school grounds gas pipelines everything the Russian shelling hit a school that was being used as a distribution point for humanitarian Aid in the zaparesia area up here so in zapparesia they had a school that was handing out humanitarian assistance and it was attacked by a Russian missile it killed a social worker it injured two other people you probably saw that also in eastern Ukraine recently the Russians attacked a maternity hospital and they again they killed innocent civilians they actually killed a newborn baby a baby boy critically injured a doctor the overnight explosion left a small town Hospital there in total disrepair just a crumble of bricks and Scattered metal medical supplies by the way strewn all over the streets the newborn who was killed was only two days old two days old but he had a name Sergey in his death will not be forgotten in Ukraine these are flagrant human rights abuses and war crimes as a zelinsky presidential advisor said there's no military logic here they just want to take revenge on the locals this is a huge War crime end quote I agree Vladimir Putin is trying to bring Ukraine to its knees but you know it's doing it's only strengthening the resolve the amazing resolve of the Ukrainian people and Russia is beginning to feel the negative impacts of this war more and more the sanctions are beginning to bite more we should strengthen them even more in my view but it's having an impact the Russian banking sector has been hit by this the Russian Central Bank reported that a record 14.7 billion dollars in hard currency was withdrawn from the Russian banking system last month in October people were taking their money and running this was during the 300 000 troop mobilization of mostly untrained recruits on November November report by the central bank warned that Russia's GDP would face a sharper contraction of 7.1 percent in the fourth quarter of this year after falling four point one and four percent compared to the last year in the previous two quarters so the economy is going the wrong way in Russia last week the economy officially entered into a recession so this war is having an impact on Russia finally the Central Bank chairwoman told the Russian lawmakers that next year the situation will get darker still she said and I quote we really need to look at the situation very soberly and with our eyes open things may get worse we understand that she said I sure hope so I sure hope so that countries around the world see what's happening here and tighten these sanctions for many Russian companies the reality of War sank in with the latest desperate mobilization this is according to the German Institute for security and international affairs I think that's true well there are a lot of Russians who still believe the propaganda and the disinformation from the Kremlin about Ukraine and therefore continue to fight innocent ukrainians their neighbors other Russians Now understand that this battle is not against an enemy this battle is a failed Ploy by Vladimir Putin to achieve his misguided Ambitions to recreate the Russian Empire the Russian Federation that's what it's about it's not about Ukraine I want to take a moment to talk about the aid package that's being developed right now here on the floor to send to Ukraine to continue our help at this crucial moment and to make an important point which is that oversight of our assistance to Ukraine is very important it's important to me it's important to my constituents it's important to my colleagues we need to be sure there are significant accountability measures in place got to know where the Aid's going we need to know exactly where it's going and who's using it and how no one is advocating that we give Ukraine a blank check and by the way they have not gotten a blank check there are spending safeguards in place already president zielinski agrees with that he wants that kind of checks in the system because he knows that that transparency is critical to the continued Aid not just from us but from the 50 other countries around the world that are providing Assistance or more there is an accounting firm from the United States involved that follows all the aid to the government as an example also the World Bank sends a report about all the aid that goes to the state aid the government Aid part and they constantly audit that and report on that so there are mechanisms in place already could they be strengthened probably so with regard to military equipment we put in place unprecedented policies to be able to have what's called end use monitoring of the military weapons that are going to Ukraine I visited with the 101st Airborne in Poland a few weeks ago and talked a lot about how that end use monitoring is going we finally have a military attache in country and some people that can help follow where these various weapons are going and honestly so far so good I got to tell you I'm surprised by this but there has been absolutely no documented instance yet of diversion of U.S supplied weapons to Russia to Belarus to third parties now that may happen in the future but to send use monitoring is carefully ensuring that you get the serial number you find out where the thing is going you check on it and I think that's very important and my colleagues need to know that this is something that the Ukrainian government wants to do and they should want to do it and our military certainly wants to do it Ukrainian government has been transparent in terms of the funding because it's in their interest it's in all of our interests they hear questions about oversight coming from members of Congress and understand the need to provide the accountability so we need to continue the assistance at this crucial time as we've said tonight but we need to be sure it continues to be accountable you know Vladimir Putin when he decided to initiate this Invasion which so many people around the world thought he would never do because it made no sense there was no logic behind it but when he did this he thought it would be a walk in the park he thought the Russian army would roll in and the ukrainians would roll over it turned out to be a walk through hell for his army and his government why because the Ukrainian people showed grit and determination and the military thought more effectively than anybody expected it's because Ukraine's morale and Leadership has not faltered even against overwhelming odds a much larger military many more missiles they have not faltered I've seen this mindset in Ukraine on my visits here I think I've been there eight or ten times since 2014. it goes from president zielinski all the way down to the soldiers we saw in the trenches to the civilians who are doing their part The Wall Street Journal recently reported that during the Russian occupation of kerosol the area we talked about earlier the 68 year old head doctor at the hospital there in Carousel refused to bow down to the Russian Invaders setting the tone for city-wide resistance he told the Russian Invaders and I quote you can shoot me if you want but I'm not going to do what you want I have a responsibility at this hospital and I'm going to carry it out for the citizens of carousel other Ukrainian workers at the hospital were just as heroic and clever the journal reports that their resistance lasted eight months they faked a covet outbreak to keep Russians from stealing their equipment coming into the hospital and taking equipment they spied for Ukrainian forces the fighting Spirit of the ukrainians should come as no surprise they're a proud patriotic and tough people for perhaps one of the best illustrations of this courage I'm reminded of the grandmother who gave sunflower seeds to invading Russian soldiers way back in February when they first started coming in she gave them these sunflowers and she said give these to somebody to plant at your burial place because you're going to die for invading our country and you might want to have something beautiful being grown at your gravesite that was a brave Ukrainian grandmother I remember the photograph of a woman about five feet tall telling this to a Russian soldier a foot or so taller and who can blame the Patriotic Defiance that they've shown today half of Ukraine's energy infrastructure is gone Kiev is operating on scheduled blackouts that lasts four hours this is the capital civilians are being killed every day Ukraine's economy continues to suffer catastrophic consequences war crimes continue to be revealed day after day the actions by the Kremlin to knowingly destroy and attack civilian areas and kill innocent ukrainians of course are meant to dampen Ukrainian resolve but instead these actions encourage fortitude among the ranks of Ukraine Freedom Fighters against the barbaric enemy that has invaded their Homeland that's how they feel when I've come down to the flurry tweet to discuss the status of this war on Ukraine's land I have pointed out that this is where the battle is occurring of Freedom over tyranny of democracy over authoritarianism this is where it's being waged here in our generation now this is why we need to stand up and be counted if we don't join allies throughout the world in condemning it and helping Ukraine defend itself what happens well the world becomes a much more dangerous and volatile place trust me people are watching our enemies and our adversaries Iran is watching China is watching others are watching this is not the time for the United States and the Allies around the world more than 50 of them who have provided military assistance to pull back at a meeting in Romania today the NATO Secretary General reaffirmed that NATO's door to membership remains open to Ukraine it's been open since 2008. I found this to be very welcome news something I've called for for years I don't think Russia would be in Ukraine if it had happened Ukraine is making gains on the battlefield as I said Russian forces and Equipment are being destroyed and depleted Russian war crimes continue to be committed as they punish Ukrainian civilians and the Russian people are beginning to feel the negative effects of this failed War I think frankly that Vladimir Putin believes his supply of missiles will Outlast the patients of the Free World I think it's what he believes that's why he continues this senseless War I think he believes he'll continue to be able to have enough missiles to Outlast the patients of the Western World of us for Freedom loving people I don't think that's accurate but we need to prove him wrong we need to keep the pressure up to end with a resolution to this senseless brutal War I believe with the help of the United States and our allies democracy can and will prevail over tyranny and authoritarianism and that of course would send the right message echoed across the world a message that tyranny and authoritarianism must not Triumph thank you I yield back my time

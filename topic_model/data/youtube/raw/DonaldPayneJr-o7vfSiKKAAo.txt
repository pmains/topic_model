thank you mr speaker i'd like to thank the gentlelady from illinois it has been a labor of love that we have represented the congressional black caucus on the special order hours uh this year and our year is coming to a close and we look back at the issues that we have discussed over the course of this year and been honoring a privilege to work along side my colleague r kelly and tonight's issue we've seen in recent weeks a number of racially charged incidents that have set off protests on college campuses across the country from the university of missouri to yale students have protested the inadequate responses of their schools administrations to racism and harassment against minority students we have seen the failure of many college administrations to promptly address overt racism against minority students on campus adding to the anxiety felt by these students have been the threats of violence against african-american students and faculty in many instances there is a disconnect between students of color and the university leaders in many of these instances administrators have openly acknowledged that their responses to minority students came too late and that their behaviors have failed to take take into account into consideration the concerns of students and the injustices against those students this is an extension of the debate over interactions often deadly between law enforcement and african americans many african americans feel marginalized and unsafe while going about their normal day this year an overarching theme of our special order hours has been equality and justice we have discussed how despite the strides our nation has made on the journey to a move to a more just society minorities are still the subject of racism and racial discrimination and face persistent inadequate inequities across the board from health to income to criminal justice through our conversations and through the ongoing national debate about racial equality we're highlighting how occurrences like those at university of missouri are not isolated incidents of racism they are part of a larger systematic discrimination this is this is a history of racial discrimination inequality and bias that still affects african-american communities across this nation we need to recognize this there are also needs to be recognized of the pain and anxiety and fears that it creates in some of these young americans as we're seeing right now many minority students feel that they do not have a home on campus many minority students are concerned about their safety at school students at the university of missouri were afraid to attend classes following reports of threats on social media all students deserve a safe environment to live and learn we can't discount the fears of these students yet that is exactly what we see happening and it is why so many students across the country are are coalescing in support of racial justice so how can we move forward from here our national conversation about racial justice needs to remain ongoing as a nation we must continue to confront incidents of racism and harassment and bring light to the complacency that too often enables these occurrences in the first place but it has to be more than just a conversation we have to use the voices of our students of our communities to drive concrete action on their behalf schools need to ensure the diversity not only of their student bodies but also their faculty and staff to increase racial understanding and bring a broader perspective to their institutions schools also need to make sure that marginalized marginalized students have access to services that enable them to share their experiences and seek assistance to meet their needs and school administrators need to be held accountable for the failures to make their campuses inclusive and safe for all students there needs to be urgency to their handling of the racial incidents and any hate crimes or civil rights violations need to be investigated internally internally and by law enforcement as appropriate we must never waver in our efforts to address racial disparities and eliminate race amid racism in our country the congressional black caucus is committed to addressing racial disparities by developing initiatives and by working with grassroots and national organizations such as black lives matter the naacp the urban league to ensure that they know that they have someone in their corner and this effort to work together the cbc is also holding a number of forms to bring african-american community resources into the areas of business development small business assistance financial empowerment inequality and education as the caucus as a caucus we will continue to lend our support to those fighting for justice equality and opportunity for all and with that mr speaker i yield back to my colleague robin kelly thank you representative payne for those words one thing about what you talked about um with the university of missouri i thought it was great that when they did protest and sit back that there were other white students and football players and coaches that also sat with them and gave them support they were one so even though it was bad things that happened it was good to see that there were all kind of students and their coaches empathetic with what was going on absolutely to that point um and this is the united states of america and we have to come together as a nation to eradicate this ill that has plagued this nation since its inception and so we need people that understand like-minded people to also join in this is not a one-sided discussion this is a discussion that we need to be having um that encapsulates the entire nation

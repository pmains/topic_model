[Music] to the point with congressman bill Pascrell focusing on the concerns and issues facing the families of New Jersey ninth congressional district hello I'm congressman bill Pascrell I would like to welcome you to this latest edition of to the point it has been a custom for presidents to release their tax returns in the name of transparency custom that was thrown out the window by this president sometimes you forget why customs such as this are in place sometimes the history of such practices is forgotten but my guest today is here to remind us why presidents of both parties have long followed this unwritten rule university of virginia law professor pure gin is here with us today George has been a vocal advocate of congressional review of President Trump's tax returns an act that doesn't need any presidential approval because there's a provision in the US tax code which allows presidents and congressional committees to look into their tax returns House Ways and Means Committee of which I'm a member the Senate Committee on a Finance Committee and the Joint Committee on taxation to request any individuals tax returns for a closed session review serving as chief of staff of the Joint Committee on taxation ironically in 2003 to 2005 I believe George is uniquely qualified to offers opinion on this very very important matter George thank you for being with us today one Thank You congressman so how did you get involved in the subject matter in the first place well it turns out I did some research some few years ago on this subject that the topic that you're describing which you've been very active on and really a leader in the house on is an area of the law that very few people know about I happen to know about it because of my research and when the topic arose early this year with the president's refusal to to reveal his tax returns it seemed to me that that was a good time to explore the issue and you know it's been pretty frustrating I set my first letter February the 1st of this year we've had many conditional privilege resolutions we've had two times within the Ways and Means Committee trying to get congressional inquiry into this and we have failed each one of those times which is in no manner shape or form indicative of my enthusiasm and hasn't been minimized at all let me ask you this question we're trying to find a way to do this a nonpartisan way in fact I asked the Chairman Kevin Brady oyster Means Committee let's do this together because eventually it's going to come out if we don't force it out the inquiries that are going on by congressional committees or the FBI or mr. Muller who's head of the investigation right now overall these are things that they're going to have to look at in order to bring tangible evidence into the play now you know basically what I've done over the past so much which would help a lot of people where have I gone wrong I don't really think you've gone wrong I think you know the reality is you need to get a little bit of Republican support and though we got very little you've gotten a very little bit but not enough yes and but it does seem to me if you look at the background of this this law that that you're referring to was one that was developed when the White House the House and the Senate we're all controlled by Republicans that's right and yet despite that in 1924 when the law was created enough Republicans joined mostly the Democrats then to pass this new law which again gives Congress the ability to exercise its rights as a co-equal branch of government and that was a result of a scandal George Wright the scandal of the teapot dome I talked about it many many many times the nuns found that into my head I didn't see the relevance of into real life when I was doing here but now I do unfortunately well that was a law built into the code the tax code because of what had happened in the executive branch of government at that time people wanted to get their finger at their hand you know the finger is greased people wanted to be part of a public domain which was our oil reserves and so let's bring in the private sector and we'll have a party I'm exaggerating now but maybe I'm not and whether it was Democrat Republican people took a piece of the pie and they wanted to do this the only way that we were able to the government was able to unfold this gamble was to have to look at people's tax returns to see what one day they put into their pockets it wasn't an attempt to make us snoopers to look into into private affairs because your tax returns are private you know there's nothing private with congressmen what can I tell you but that's what the purpose of it was doing it a right way not exposing it unless there was a vote to do that within one of these three committees and that's where we are right now we do have the authority the law is on our side and what happened in that Teapot Dome scandal members of the executive branch of government had direct conflicts of interest these that bought private land public land that made it private so they became part of the oil reserves correct you know that you're exactly right certainly there's conflict of interest well the consulate of interest was that there were some executive branch officials they were alleged to have committed these improprieties and Congress wanted to investigate that and part of the investigation was to examine their tax returns to see in fact what kind of payments they'd received from whom and so forth and up until then they couldn't do that up until then they couldn't do it the only person who could do it in the country up until then was the president right of course these are executive branch officials so the president was not likely to order the disclosure Universal conflict exactly now it turns out there were actually other reasons why this law came about another concern which is directly relevant to our current situation was that the Treasury secretary Andrew Mellon at the time was even wealthier than our current president relative to the country at the time and owned many more business interests that our current president and Congress was interested to know well how are these various proposals including tax proposals that the Treasury was coming up with how would they affect mr. melons business interest and so that was another we think that's an illogical question always an absolute why is that important well it's important why is it important for you to know for me to know if there are any potential conflicts existing in your business practices which may affect your public shutterbug well because the president as well as you and every member of Congress should be acting in the end of behalf of the public interest that's your part of your sworn obligation right and so knowing what your private interests are gives the public a little bit of insurance or a little bit of question of whether you're in fact are acting in the public interest that's the basis well the ethics commissioner mr. shell as you know him we all know him now he recommended when mr. Trump was elected to the presidency he recommended that he divest themselves the president of all business attachments and in George I have in my hands the web of potential conflicts in so many countries 550 over 550 investments what you know we go from Argentina to Brazil to Russia China Saudi Arabia how about how about in the United States so so we have these investments well you know hopefully they're all legal we don't know that but when you look at start to look at each one of them there are questions about who did you do business with who were you partners with at a certain amount of time say well what the heck does that got to do with this gentleman becoming the president of the United he's our president why are you interested in what his investments are well a president has to make decisions does he not George exactly what kind of decisions does the president have to make well all sorts of decisions he just recently announced for example a little bit of a cutback on our relationship with Cuba and the question is well to what extent was that driven by the fact that some of his competitors have business interests in Cuba but he doesn't and so maybe he's kind of tilting the scales a little bit again we don't know those are the kinds of things that I think the public is right to know and why did I have a right to know that well they run out his private business well but again he is now holding an office to represent the public he should be acting in the public's interest now I'm thinking about an example I'm the ranking member on trade on that on the Democratic side okay when the president was campaigning and when he was sworn I talked about really coming down hard for instance in the area of trade on China because China is a currency manipulator maybe a little bit less the last year or so than previous ten years now all of a sudden that's out the window he no longer talking about look chyna Dooney China's help in many areas be it Korea etc they're a trading partner and for better or worse oh but he's already taken a back step could that have anything to do with the trade marks that are available to his family members I mean it's a question I would logically ask wouldn't you yeah absolutely and I mean I can give you another example as you know there's a conflict now going on in the Middle East between Saudi Arabian yeah that's all and as it turns out the president apparently has had some business interest in Saudi Arabia but not in Qatar right and so then the question is well you know I mean to what extent should US policy be dictated by his personal connections and I'll forth why did you refuse to divest himself on this and his family members are doing business I mean a son-in-law Scott is going over to the Middle East to do that some negotiations god bless him is smart guy well but why does that give us get us the pause yeah I you know I would say in his defense some of his interests are hard to divest real estate is notably hard to do best but in fairness he could develop a pretty safe trust blind trust and put his assets in that which most presidents of which most presidents have done and now they haven't had this many investments right all over the world he wouldn't have to just you know yeah sell off all his interest he could put it in a blind trust and just you know ignore them for four years or eight he's not giving it away that's right he's not giving it away and it still is his but he just doesn't know what's in there and he doesn't know how it's doing himself what about the church what about his kids and his in-laws and outlaws the relationship to his business practices and their own business practices they each give me they you got their own little niche how could that be in conflict well obviously you know you close family members they have business private interests and and forth and again it's very complicated because some of them have also are holding positions of public trust and total interest themselves as well as being children of the president so he says that well you guys know what my business interests are on my disclosure 278 whatever to have to end and besides that then 40 but we're talking about thousands of pages of addendums in your tax return we're not seeing that that's not in the disclosure that you've seen that I've seen in anybody scenes and my disclosure as a congressman is public record and these are important factors that give us an idea about where you put your money plus it doesn't tell us about the partnerships or the partnerships that I've gotten out of so that could be affecting my decisions and by the way courage we're going to be talking about we're going to be talking about tax reform we started already in the Ways and Means Committee I want to know what's being proposed how it benefits the president or his close donors I think I have a right to know that don't you yeah those those are again you know the kinds of questions that Congress should should certainly look at to again examine to what extent these proposals are in the public's interest as opposed to be serving some private benefit is it too much for me to ask that a president be free of any obligations to investments or investors or loners I mean he's alone with a lot of money the last disclosure I found was very interesting just a few days ago I don't know if you saw that the disclosure concerning what his net assets are worth a billion seven hundred million something like that did you see that did you see that I haven't taken a closer look at it I did did see the disclosure he may go it's a lot less than he says he has well again I you know I don't I don't know what to read into that because it all depends on how about you how you put the numbers right and I I really don't know whether it reflects the true valuable there's an investigation going on on the ties between the Trump administration and China okay we and then Russia I'm sorry we are looking at that very carefully but the committee's are looking at that very carefully mr. mullahs going to be looking at it because that was the original touchdown here the original touchdown was the Russians were influencing American elections elections they're trying to influence it anyway with every one of the thirteen groups that are dedicated and obligated to protect us in terms of our security came to that conclusion I mean this is not something you dreamt up George or I dreamt up I can assure you now I want to see what the evidence is so that's what I've earrings that's what I have an investigation move the tax returns have much to do about our investigation about those things well they may they may it's hard to say the business returns of mr. Trump might have some important clues that but it is very tricky because especially these these very wealthy business people they tend to do business through so-called intermediaries intermediaries are simply organization set up in any country around the world that may have nothing to do with the country where you're actually doing business right so if one of our to be what I held up before actly so unless one of his businesses is in fact has some kind of connection with Russian lenders and Russian entities or Russian government it may not show up directly it may show indirectly and you'd have to do a lot of investigative work right but the tax returns would at least begin to give you some leads to figure out how to do the image if you're if you're mr. Muller ah are you interested in this tax returns maybe and you know the reality is that that the law is not likely to give much access to mr. Muller in terms of the tax information let's give a little bit of ability his ability to get the kidney subpoena those records well he can subpoena private interest so he could subpoena obviously the president right subpoena the tax return preparer but for the records my guess is that's going to be a hard battle that is if he subpoenas the president they're going to be various privileges that are going to be asserted and they're going to be fighting in court for a while on that one well one other time one of the things that's happened since 1924 was we got President Nixon's tax returns that way did we not yes but that was because your money Congress well Congress used the law that you've been advocating to allow the disclosure of President Nixon's tax information in connection with an investigation and it wound up the old $500,000 about five hundred thousand yeah is it possible in terms of what we do know are from records that have been offered and disclosures that the president's put forth is it possible and I've heard this so many times so let me ask an expert that he paid no taxes over the last ten years I think it's quite possible yes nothing I'm not how would he have done many so I'm not saying yes but you're saying it could certainly possibly have done that well it could done and again I'm not alleging any impropriety on his part necessarily I mean I know he's been filing his taxes in compliance with our law but the law does allow taxpayers especially real estate tax payers a lot of deductions in benefit this is a normal foot as a normal thing right it tends to shelter a good amount of income and then in addition to that mr. Trump my president Trump has had a history of some business failings and when businesses fail usually there are some is that our general and you could cover that folks can be carried you could carry it forward to the point that you may not have to pay no tax exactly but isn't the whole taxes the based upon everybody doing their part and their share yes and look there's it built into the law that there's a lot of loopholes you could go right when most can go left but you're not breaking the law right so we need to review the tax code in and of itself to see if people are paying their fair share I don't think the American people are going to be very happy it's in examining what we do now we find out that the president's paid no taxes are within here yeah because if he if the old money could carry it forward he could do this legally yeah but that doesn't make a right does it yeah well congressman you really hit on it exactly right so the reason the public really deserves the right to look at the tax returns is is certainly to check out all these conflicts we've been talking about but the larger reason is as president he's a tax payer in chief we put so many responsibilities on the President to make decisions on our behalf and everyone you know he shares in filing a tax return an obligation that many Americans have to face and Americans look at that and they understand that this is part of your character part of your integrity they have a right to see how have you been filing your returns as a measure of what kind of person is it that's leading our country that to me is the you know the overriding reason why over the last 40 years presidents of both parties have voluntarily disclose their tax information well I think that's very important I hope folks were listening to what you just said let me ask you a question George what do you want to ask me since I'm a member of Congress I remember where Means Committee I'm going after the president's tax returns I think they're critical right for us to establish and if he's got nothing to hide this is only cleaning the slate for him it would seem to me yeah I want to get it out there so you had some failures we have failures right right so you didn't tell the truth years ago so what you're the president now you better be telling the truth right well I would say two things one is to do exactly what you have been doing which is to keep on pressing the issue pressing it in the committee trying to get Republican support trying to get the chairman on board and so forth and of course there's the Senate side also they have the independent ability to do the same thing so that's one thing the other thing I would say is I think Congress should think about this law that you pointed out as a form of leverage over the president it was created as a way to kind of create a better balance between the two branches and Congress by not using this law is not fully using its ability to leverage against the president just as one example recently you probably know that the president has his office of legal counsel has advised some of the executive branch officials but they don't need to respond to questions over some of them coming from Congress only selected types of questions would be responded to now is my reading is Republicans and Democrats in Congress are all upset about this and it seems to me some of those Republicans should be told to look if you really upset about that practice here's a law that you can inform the president about leak any 103 SEC so and and you know if you don't show a little more cooperation to answer the questions that we have right we might well exercise this what do you expect the other citizens to do then if you're not accountable mr. president why do you want me to be accountable yeah exactly I have to stand by my reports when I hand in a disclosure report now we don't have to as a member of Congress submit our tax returns I did that in an election four years ago all we got to do this so that we build accountability and people trust us but you didn't ask me my question so give me a tough question well well you know I I mean again I think that you've been doing you know you should be doing and I would just keep on pressing it I think that some people have seemed to think that maybe mr. Muller will be able to get the information my reading of the law is kind of pessimistic on that scale I don't think at the end of the day he's going to be able to get very much if anything and if he does get something he may well not be able to disclose to anybody and it probably isn't going to be the type of information that people would like to see so I think that really your effort is critical that's the effort that Congress had designed almost a hundred years ago to give the American people the ability to get this kind of information yeah there's no Democrat a Republican way to do your taxes oh that's exactly right and we are all accountable particularly those of us in elected office and the president is no less accountable to this country and again it was not Cornelius Vanderbilt Act when he was asked a question about well what about the law mr. Vanderbilt you have the law yeah I have the power right right because if that's the anthem here in the background then American citizens may be joking about it but then we lose everybody loses the credibility would seem to make it so we're talking about transparency we're talking about credibility we took at the very basis we cannot act nor be oligarchies we cannot say all the powers at the top this is not a democracy so that we hand down what we feel you can know or what you should be doing we'll tell you this is not the kind of democracy we chose the colonial folks that Kenya this is not what we want and call a democracy so it is a bridge to what we believe in rather than an escape an excuse or living a loophole George mr. Yin thank you professor for being here with us thank you Congress clarify a few more things I say to you I I'm going to continue my fight it's gotten a few people angry uh even some people who like me are angry at me at this I'm going to do this because this is important to be continuing of our Republic there is no democratic or republican way to fill out your taxes or make them transparent when needed and the law is on our side thank you for all of your help thank you thank for watching the addition of to the point I want to thank my desk George Ian truthfully thank you for joining us today your breath of fresh air you have heard our thoughts now I would like to hear what you think about today's show so if you have any comments concerns questions stay tuned or address our phone number website any kind of address you can get all of us we're available thanks again for tuning in and see you again soon on to the point [Music] [Music] you

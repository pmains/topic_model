as we pause to commemorate and celebrate the life and legacy of dr martin luther king jr on what would have been his 93rd birthday let us commit to continuing our thrust towards life liberty and the pursuit of happiness after all those are the cornerstones of our country's founding principles and the foundation upon which our fragile democracy has been built dr king was to my generation one of if not the most admired persons on the planet earth i first met him during the weekend of october 15 1960 at the second official meeting of the student nonviolent coordinating committee i along with several other students from claflin and south carolina state colleges in orangeburg south carolina joined other student leaders from across the country on the campus of mohouse college in atlanta i learned during that meeting which began around 10 p.m and ended around 4 00 a.m and many meetings since that our differences still more from our varied life experiences than any philosophical approaches which in my memoir i call blessed experiences that night i had what i like to call my song to paul transition i have never been the same since that day we marched to integrated lunch counters we marched to get back off the back of the bus we marched for various causes in his admonition from king street south carolina in 1966 dr king said to us finally it was time to march to the ballot boxes if there was ever a time for us to listen to king's plea it is in 2022 the right to vote is the most fundamental thread of our democratic fabric without it our democracy unravels and we can no longer afford to straddle the line between democracy and tyranny while the people's access to the ballot box is repeatedly denied so today on this martin luther king jr day i urge you to keep in mind the true meaning of this celebration this country doesn't have to be made great again this country is already great our challenge is making this country's greatness accessible and affordable to all its people [Music] you

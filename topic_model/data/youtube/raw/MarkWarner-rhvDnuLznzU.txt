so let's do a deal playing for the democrats tonight mark warner democrat from virginia and for the republicans tom coburn of oklahoma good to see you both good to see you good to see you and i know you've both been on this show a lot talking about ideas and compromise gang of six and here you are tonight so let's see what we can do you're right now in the middle of conversations right senator coburn that's correct and how close are you to something that could be significant in your group well i think we're close with the the point is is to get the politics out of it the presidential politics out of it and actually work on the real problems and that still has some influence as we work because there's political jockeying for what's going to happen in november and what we need to do is throw all that out and start thinking about the best long-term position for the country senator waterson both of you have been doing that and and it seems like you've accepted a lot of cuts he's accepted some tax increases revenue increases i mean this is a deal and we we found a plan to get us between four and five trillion dollars over the next 10 years off our debts it's not perfect it wouldn't be exactly what tom wanted exactly what i wanted right but at the end of the day the alternative go back to the lemmings we're going over this cliff there should be no elected official that will have any excuse come the end of this year to say they didn't see it coming so we've got to get out of our foxholes i think there is a majority in this and i think there's even a majority in the house we've got to make it safe for folks to do the right thing and as thomas said that means you're going to probably make some folks mad along the way but the end of the day the value add not just to our economy but just the overall confidence in our institutions would be enormous and do you think that the american people now are ready is one of the things we lack right now in this problem is leadership if the president were to stand up and say folks we have this big problem and here here's the problem and define it accurately and say there's all sorts of solutions what we ought to do is make the process work the reason i voted for bold simpson is i wanted to get it on the floor of the senate so the senate can do his work and then have everybody vote and defend their votes on what they think is the best solution to it but ultimately we can come to an agreement on the senate floor so a bold simpsons start is a wonderful start it's not everything i'd wants not everything market one but we'd have a chance to amend that and come up with what the senate have the house do the same thing put it in conference and let's actually send a signal to the world that we're going to fix our problems it'll change it'll change our economy tomorrow if we did that in terms of growth oh it and it would it would the confidence of the debt rating which would count up we're going to get to 365 days soon since we lost that remember we've got american business is sitting on two and a half trillion dollars in cash on their balance sheets giving them the predictability that we kind of got a rationalized tax code right that we're going to meet our obligations and a tax code that's simpler as well as an entitlement program that can be sustainable over 50 years i think that will be a job generator as much as any single program that either the presidential candidates have are you frustrated and do you think the conversation would be different if the president had come out early and endorsed himself i think the president i would i think the president should have done more to explain the problem he did come out and endorse our gang of six plan yes i think that in the it may be cost some votes i think there are some folks particularly in the house that if the president endorses anything it will be immediately assigned why they can't before i think in many ways it falls then to a group of bipartisan senators who are willing to take the first set of arrows from both sides and both of us have you know to lay out a plan and i hope and i think the president will be supportive of that and i want to ask you all about something this issue of democracy which i brought up with speaker banner today um that you know we've got a payroll tax cut that is important to people right now but once people have these things it becomes hard to take them away the bush tax cut's a great example because it wasn't paid for i did too very well all right so you're on the that's on the same page on that as well i wanted just to play a sound bite though about what president clinton said about the bush tax cuts and get your reaction here yes you could tax me at 100 and you wouldn't balance the budget we we are all going to have to contribute to this and if middle-class people's wages were growing up again and we had some growth in the economy i don't think they would object to going back to the tax rates that obtained when i was president are we eventually going to be able to have those tax rates go away because we've all looked at the numbers if they go away for everybody it's 2.8 trillion dollars that's more than half of the country a half trillion dollars so you know and no one's talking about putting them all back in but i agree with president clinton you know beyond 2x of poverty everybody's going to have to have some skin in the game and even if it's a de minimis amount because this is a national crisis admiral mullen former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff said this debt and deficit issue is a greater threat than terrorism uh i think the approach ought to be is how do you stimulate the economy and have a fair tax system right and i don't think we had it right during the clinton years i don't think we had it right during the bush years but first of all we we passed the bush tax cuts and didn't cut spending pay for it so we widened our deficit right so it's easy to pass a tax cut it's hard to pass the tax cut that you pay for so you know one of the things speaker-based a lot of like in your party some of them tend to believe that a tax cut just pays for itself yeah well sometimes it does especially but the key is how do you create long-term certainty and confidence so that the money that mark talked about sitting on the side actually gets invested and we create wealth if you create jobs without creating wealth you haven't done anything for the economy so you have to do it and my worry even though i'm for let's have the free-for-all let's have the debate if you tax the people who are the job creators you've actually hurt our growth and you've hurt the rise in tax revenues that would come to the government what we know in the reagan years is when you take away a lot of these deductions and a lot of these special things that people have lobbied for and you flattened and and it brought broadened the base what you have is significant increased economic growth 4.6 over over 70 months i mean unbelievable but you get you can actually have both because disproportionately yeah folks at the top end where on that take advantage of the tax breaks than others so you can have a simpler code you can have that predictability and you can maintain the progressivity that i think is important that allows those of us who've done well uh to say all right we're going to chip in to make sure that their next generation doesn't want that all right well thanks to both you i'm going to switch the whole the uh shakespeare line now first thing we do let's kill all the lawyers how about let's just kill all the lobbyists the members of congress are the problem oh and the business community and others who need to step up and say this has to get fixed we all got to have some skin in the game all right thanks to both and ahead out front is president obama

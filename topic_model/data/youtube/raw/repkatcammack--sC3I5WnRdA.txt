foreign [Music] all right well good afternoon everybody my name is congresswoman Kat camack probably representing the gator Nation Florida's third congressional district also the horse capital of the world but we're not here to have a competition about whose district is better we're here to talk about the most popular Bill in Congress today the Reigns Act with 179 co-sponsors this bill has become front and center for the Republican agenda in reigning in this overreaching over burdensome government that has spiraled out of control I like to say that the regulatory regime is quite literally the biggest but the quietest American Dream killer it has an impact on every aspect of Our Lives from the services that we use to the products that we consume so the way we operate our businesses the regulatory regime is out of control and dictating every element of our livelihoods our businesses and Beyond currently there are 1.3 million regulations on the books costing our economy over 2 trillion dollars a year it's pretty simple you start pulling regulations off the books that don't make people safer products safer and they're really there just to find a home and to drive revenue for that agency we can start to see some relief for the American people the Reigns act does just this it takes steps to address regulatory actions by requiring every new major rule proposed by federal agencies to be approved by Congress before going into effect a great example is this week the ATF will publish a rule on stabilizing braces that will have a 1.9 billion dollar impact to the industry but also will make millions of law-abiding citizens felons in the span of 120 days specifically the House and Senate would be required to pass a joint resolution in order for a major rule to be approved by Congress this bill defines a major rule as any federal rule or regulation that may result in an annual effect on the economy of 100 million dollars or more a major increase in cost prices for consumers individual Industries government agencies or geographic regions or significant adverse effects on competition employment investment productivity Innovation or the ability of us-based Enterprises to compete with foreign-based Enterprises this bill also preserves the ability for Congress to disapprove of non-major rules with with that includes all rules that do not qualify as a major rule through a joint resolution of disapproval so Congress is permitted constitutionally to decide major questions of Nationwide policy the reins act would bolster that mandate that Congress has by approving costly executive actions before they go into place Florida for example requires legislative approval of all rules that adversely impact the economy or increase regulatory costs of at least one million dollars over five years seems pretty simple to me lawmakers can prevent agencies from using guidance that they take quite liberally to circumvent the Congressional review process we can protect taxpayers tame inflation increase transparency novel idea and rein in the executive branch in short Congress can fundamentally protect taxpayers and job creators by restoring a constitutional balance of power by reining in the federal bureaucracy for good just for points of reference in my home state of Florida inflation is costing families about 875 dollars a month that's more than ten thousand one hundred and eighty dollars annually I don't know many families in my district that have an extra 10 grand to spare at the end of 2020 groceries were up more than 105 dollars per month for folks that are on fixed income this is real the impact that the regulatory environment is having on us is real and since I don't like bureaucrats in basements all over Washington wasting our tax dollars I'm not going to waste your time you understand the importance of this bill but I want my colleagues to share their experiences and what they are excited about within this bill to take on the regulatory state so with that I would like to introduce my friend our whip Mr Tom emmer from the great state of Minnesota okay hello everyone my name is Tom emmer and I'm proud to represent Minnesota's sixth congressional district and as cat mentioned uh the privilege of serving as the majority whip in the House of Representatives I want to thank congresswoman kamik for inviting me today and uh for her taking the lead on such an important issue we must recognize the statement that she opened with that there are over 140 of our colleagues who sign on as original co-sponsors to the Reigns Act under President Biden a concerning trend has escalated to a catastrophic crisis our economy continues to be weighted down with ever larger regulatory burdens while Americans grapple with 40-year high inflation due to the Biden administration's failed policies uh regulations during the first two years of this Administration have cost our economy almost 309 billion dollars we cannot trust a bloated federal government to hold itself accountable it's time for Congress to Halt the overreach of these federal agencies and hold unelected bureaucrats accountable we are proud to support the Reigns Act and the Republican majority will continue to fight to end the Biden administration's unchecked power grab thank you and I will turn it over to uh Mr Rutherford Mr Rucker thank you thank you Mr Whip and and listen I I have to tell you back six years ago when I first ran for congress the Reigns Act was being talked about back home then and John I want to thank you for bringing this back up we've got to get this done it's a bill whose time has come uh and and I can tell you that I'm I'm very uh happy to be here talking about this bill again because what we've seen over the last several years is more and more of executive branch agencies and this Administration who are literally legislating by Fiat through the rule process when you have a 1200 page rule that's not a rule that's legislation and that that has to be stopped and that's what this bill is all about the fact that uh you know we can have a a hundred million dollars of impact from a rule that nobody nobody uh that was elected by anyone in this country would be involved in that process just bureaucrats that's what has to change look our Founders put Congress in charge of writing laws not these unelected unelected bureaucrats at federal agencies in November House Republicans promised voters that we were going to hold the government accountable this bill will do just that and with that I yield back to uh representative Barr IE thank you thank you representative Rutherford my name is Andy Barr I represent Central Kentucky and the U.S house uh the true horse capital of the world but I do want to thank my good friend from the second most important horse District in America cat kamek for her leadership on this build a bit of History we call it the rains act the regulations from the executive in need of scrutiny act uh but it it comes from originally a Kentucky Congressman Jeff Davis about over a decade ago who played a little bit on that horse theme of reigning in uh the out of control rulemaking and administrative law that's coming out of unaccountable unelected bureaucrats another bit of history is constitutional history it is often said that the rise of the administrative state is a 20th century and 21st century phenomenon to give experts policy making experts the ability to deal with problems of modern society that legislators just simply don't have time to deal with the truth of the matter is this is not a new phenomenon this this is an ancient phenomenon of absolutism and despotism that the framers of our constitution specifically prohibited in the Constitution it's called the non-delegation doctrine the first substantive provision of the U.S Constitution Article 1 Section 1 of the Constitution says that that all legislative power shall be vested in a Congress of the United States a house in the Senate all is the key word meaning no legislative power is given to unaccountable unelected bureaucrats in the executive branch this important bill restores that fundamental constitutional balance and restores legislative prerogatives to to this body the elected representatives of the American people and I'm proud to support this effort and you're back and we'll yield to uh representative Bice from Oklahoma I'm not sure how you follow uh Andy Barr from Kentucky with that uh narrative but I will try um first of all I want to say thank you all for being here and thank my friend classmate uh Kat camack for putting this bill forward the American people deserve a government that they can trust the bind Administration has overstepped the legislative branch to repeatedly tack on burdensome regulations that are the root cause of some of the crises we're seeing today especially in the energy sector which is so important to my home state look no further than the Waters of the U.S rule which greatly increases the number of bodies of water that are subject to Federal Regulation and places an undue burden on farmers and ranchers this is a clear violation of property rights and yet another example of how the government agencies are overreaching into our daily lives similarly the SEC emissions disclosure proposed rule is not only unnecessary but it is also a burden on businesses that will stifle economic growth the SEC is supposed to regulate Securities and protect investors not regulate emissions and focus on environmental concerns the Biden administration's effort to ban gas stoves is the latest attempt to force the green New Deal on all Americans who rely heavily on gas-powered stoves and heaters myself included it's astonishing how out of touch they are with the needs of the American people these rules are just another example of the executive overreach and their attempt to control our aspect of life it is hard-working Oklahomans that are bearing the brunt of these regulations we need to safeguard property rights businesses and the way of life and I am very proud to join my colleagues that stand before you and many others who are not here to support the reins act which will protect Americans and rein in our federal bureaucracy thank you and at this time I would invite rep Hensen up thank you well thank you Stephanie and thank you everybody for coming out today to talk about this very important issue um thank you congresswoman kamak for your leadership here as well um this is not a new problem for years and over several administrations we have seen the executive branch take more and more power for itself empowering those bureaucrats while taking that power away from the American people and circumventing Congress at the same time in just one year the Biden Administration added more than 200 billion dollars in new regulatory costs through their heavy-handed rule making pulling down our economy putting that burden on our small businesses and inserting the government in a place that doesn't belong so one of the most egregious examples which I'm thankful my colleague from Oklahoma brought up is wotus and brought a little uh actual little visual aid here um the bite Administration finalized this rule in December through one of their holiday weekend data dumps uh which we are coming to expect um from this Administration but under this rule take a look at this map 97 of the state of Iowa would be subject to regulation so as you can see just those little my colleagues here all these little white dots right that's the only part of the state of Iowa that would not be subject to this rule from the bite Administration 97 of the land this would be devastating for our Farmers for our producers and our landowners and rather than going through Congress to have this discussion where they would rightfully face some stiff opposition from Representatives like myself and representative nun from Iowa they have decided to forge ahead on their own and RAM these rules and regulations through so that is why we have introduced The reigns act legislation that will force the administration to Reign it in quite literally so any new rule proposed by the administration would be subject to approval by the house and the Senate and this goes for all administrations as well it would hold unelected bureaucrats accountable and it would be making sure that they can stop imposing costly regulations on Iowans and all Americans with simply The Stroke of a pen we need to put a stop to it so again thank you to congresswoman camack for her leadership on this issue and I look forward to working with my colleagues this Congress to make sure we get this bill over the Finish Line Take That Power from the bureaucrats and return it to the people where it rightfully belongs and now it's my honor to introduce my colleague my friend from North Carolina Congressman Dr Murphy good afternoon everybody I want to thank representative Kemet for resurrecting this bill long overdue uh you know we were all elected to come here and drain the swamp right that was what the great moniker was come and drain the swamp and everybody thinks it's always the elected officials we have some elected officials some of which actually have been here 50 years believe it or not one of the most prominent place in the in the city we have other officials that are here just a couple years but what we have is we find out what the true swamp is what is the true swamp they're the unelected individuals the unelected bureaucrats that move agencies at the pace of uh of a large cargo ship and what they do however is they direct rules they direct regulations without ever being elected that affect every American's life we hear examples now the Waters of the U.S I look at CMS that promulgates 11 000 pages of rules every year recently there's another rule by NOAA that allows that permits and it prevents rather any vessel over 35 miles an hour 35 feet in length from traveling faster than 10 miles an hour until they're 20 miles offshore that will literally cost recreational and Commercial Fishing to die overnight these are rules by unelected bureaucrats appointed and pushed and forth and financed by a given Direction by our executive Brands that's not the way our founding fathers had at work so what we're trying to do and it's a perfect moniker Burfict anagram is to pull the reins back on federal on federal spending a hundred million dollars is a lot of money that money is not to be directed by individuals who are not elected by the American populace so this legislation and I'm really really glad that represent representative mccamick has brought this back up is starting to bring Common Sense back to this country and if we're ever going to get this deficit dealt with that's what it deals with it has to deal with common sense so thank you all for attending and thank you for all my colleagues for high date lighting this very important issue and with that I will bring up my my one and dear dear friend representative McLean thank you thank you well thank you all um and first and foremost I want to thank my colleague and my friend um representative kamik what you have done bringing this legislation forth again with your passion around spending and really around putting the the power back into the people's hand you we've got to applaud you so thank you so much for doing that at the end of the day this is common sense legislation last time I read article one of the Constitution I didn't see anything in there about unelected bureaucrats getting to make rules in this country right think of think about that that is the duty and the responsibility of Congress and that Duty and that responsibility was given to us by the people let's put the power back in the people's hands because we are a representative government of the of the people have some trust have some faith in people have some faith in the human race for goodness for goodness sake I mean people will do the right thing let's have a little hope let's have a little positivity the bottom line is the bureaucrats and these federal agencies have way too much power little accountability anyways too and the regulations they create cost taxpayers trillions of dollars but these unelected bureaucrats don't care because it's not their money it's your money we cannot let this continue the government is already too big and too powerful and it's time to put the power back into the people's hands and again I want to thank my dear friend and colleague for bringing this up again and all of the support that you have have a little faith and trust in the American people thank you story [Laughter] up next I'd like to recognize one of our newest freshmen from the great state of Iowa uh from the Third District representative Zac Knight well thank you all for being here today thank you congresswoman uh cat kamick is truly not just a leader in this but she has led the charge for 197 of our colleagues who truly want to see a reign in on what our federal government is doing uh I'm from the Heartland little place called Iowa home to a good friend called John Wayne Uh and Cat hammock has shown True Grit in standing up to the type of overreach that the federal government's attempting to do imagine a situation right now where an Iowan goes to bed on that Family Farm or closes the door on their doctor's office or shuts down their small Insurance firm at the end of the week and only to wake up the next morning and find that they are now liable to an unelected group of bureaucrats who have changed the game for them who've now had an impact on whether they get to open up that business again or whether they potentially face a criminal penalty or even jail time for something that unelected bureaucrats have changed without their say so now as elected officials we would not have the opportunity to do that without answering to those voters on a very direct basis at our next town hall but in Washington you can change the game at night and you can leave it on somebody else's doorstep to have to deal with the tune of trillions of dollars being impacted and additional costs on Family Farms on the single mothers and on small front businesses look you've got a great team up here who has stood up to what's going on in Washington DC and held not only the administration accountable but help those small communities truly have the opportunity to survive in my district alone we had an individual who's audited 27 times over the course of two decades only to find out that it was actually the IRS who owed him money and he put tens of thousands of his own dollars into hiring an attorney look this is the reality we have good people out there who want to do the right thing let's help them do that the Reigns act ensures that Congress the elected officials are going to be the ones who are making those decisions not the bureaucrats and basements in Washington power Twin kamik thank you for taking the lead on this also one of our outstanding freshmen I would like to introduce at this time Mr Mike Collins from the great state of Georgia also a truck driver by trade so he can speak to regulations at length but you get two minutes you know I was back here bouncing around like a Cat on a Hot Tin Roof you know and I and I guess I want to take this into kind of a different uh perspective yeah I've spent the last 30 plus years of my life and probably the one of the most regulated industries that there is in this country and that is the trucking industry as a matter of fact when we uh when we ran um and spoke with a lot of other small businesses we find out that it's the same thing across the country in almost every industry it is just the fact that you have got such an overreach from the federal government from a fourth Grant branch of government called bureaucrats that aren't elected to anything that are out there regulating and sticking more regulations and a lot of times you don't really find out what that regulation is until you get the violation into to the point to where and I'm going to tell you something small businesses are the backbone of this country and the regulations that have been imposed across this country on small businesses are what are putting them out of business to the point where they either have to close shop or sell out to somebody bigger that it can afford to hire enough people just to comply with the crazy regulation that's been imposed on that's what's got to stop that's also the type of things that run businesses off of the shores of America and into other countries because they can't afford to comply with these crazy regulations that we have up here that's going to stop one of the main things we campaigned on was getting involved with the rains act and congresswoman I can't thank you enough for putting that up I hadn't been up here a month and it's been incredible what we've been able to see being accomplished and what's being passed and pushed across to the Senate to get passed over there I look forward to being a part of this and I look forward to supporting this bill and I appreciate the few minutes to get up here and speak about it foreign I'd like to turn it over to another outstanding freshman from New York Mr Langworthy hello thank you so much uh and I really want to Salute You representative kamik for bringing this bill forward uh it's so important it I I had the the privilege of serving on a presidential transition and saw just the fact that only 5 000 faces change from one Administration to the next just what the size and scope of the federal bureaucracy really has become members of Congress on both sides of the aisle are accountable to our constituents and the taxpayers of this country they're overburdened they're over regulated and that has to stop you know the accountability sitting with the members of Congress is what's so important and we have to take action uh in in order to take the powers back that are that our constitution has laid out and and from the founders the executive branch has gotten too big too strong and the bureaucracy is driving the trade so thank you for leading uh this effort and and I look forward to this bill's Passage and going to the other side of the country I'd like to bring up my good friend and our final speaker uh from the great state of California Mr Doug lamalfa yeah thank you in addition to all those oranges and horses he has down there I'm also uh really excited about her uh representation of the original song swamp rat the greatest drag racer ever Don Garlits on her district there so um I come from Northern California we have uh most some of the most craziest regulations there simultaneously and what is the current California we have a drought emergency and we have a flood emergency can you imagine that it's because we've had a lot of rain lately and due to regulation we're not as prepared for it with our levees our water Handling Systems instead we get our water taken away from us in agriculture this in the time where we got seven eight dollar dozen eggs in the west half of the valley I represent 250 000 acres of land were left out because of no water it was indeed directed to other uses due to biological opinions and other things made by bureaucrats that don't really seem to care about what the people need in this country in my home state in agriculture and whatever so Waters the United States is yet another overreach that was pushed back for a while it's alive and kicking once again and going to put people out of business make food less affordable less available for so many people all because they want to regulate every single mud puddle the water coming off your roof into a rain barrel a man-made ditch and a drainage or an Irrigation District they believe it all belongs to them and that's not the case these are property rights that are in Peril and these are the people's needs they're in Peril for their ability to afford what they need to do to put food on the table and for the farmers that we're still going to need unless we want to import all of our food which works really great when we compare that to imported energy so we have to rein these people back because a lot of times when you're trying to get answers from them on how to deal with this regulation they're not even at work they're going to even answer the phone so we can figure out what the blank we're supposed to do with these people I appreciate the time Kat thanks so much for taking the reins on this issue I knew at some point that was going to be said so folks you've heard today the regulatory regime is impacting everyday Americans Regulators across the basements all around Washington DC you are now on notice you may be The Regulators but this is the deregulation team and there's 179 of us today tomorrow there will be more and we will keep going until we dismantle this bureaucratic state that has absolutely started the process of killing the American dream

i would i would like to direct the attention of the panel to a proposal senator wyden has been working on bipartisan proposal i'd be interested dr cutler are you familiar with what senator wyden has been working on yes i am sir uh dr nichols are you familiar mr caprara if i could ask each of you in turn your opinions of what senator wyden has been working on pros cons what could be done to tweak it to make it better start with you dr cutler um so first let me say that i think senator wyden has shown enormous amount of leadership on this and i i as someone who studies this for quite a lengthy period of time i'm really extremely encouraged to see that the um i think where senator wyden started in his question is exactly right which is that what we need to think about is how to structure the guarantee for seniors citizens that is something that they can rely upon and that's also um something that's going to be associated with um with cost savings for us and i guess there are two components to that one is setting up a functioning market for individuals to choose as we know as this committee knows the medicare advantage program has been a mess over time and so some of what senator wyden is doing is trying to replace the mess with something that actually works for people and for the taxpayers and that's enormously important i would then couple that with a management of the traditional fee for service program that turns that from a mess into something that works and it comes back the thought i was having as senator thumb was asking his question is we need a way to manage that program that doesn't make every single change be an impossibly high hurdle because as we need to adjust rapidly as the private sector does we need to be able to adjust rapidly in the medicare program as well and so and so where i go with senator wyden's proposal is to say absolutely make the make the competitive part work do the risk adjustment and the other sorts of things and then couple that with a very aggressive look at the traditional program to make that work and then and then really really play it out so one doesn't have to choose either an entirely uh traditional program or a or an entire program without um any uh traditional program thank you dr nichols well the first thing i have to say in relation to senator wyden's proposal is i applaud the very instinct of bipartisanship you know senator conrad and senator wyden ii how much time i personally spent in trying to make our last conversation more bipartisan as a nation so i just think the more you all do that the better and we'll all applaud second what i like about the principles the senator laid out and his comments this morning and what's there you define a benefit package none of this voucher coupon stuff you make sure you're really going to make the government contribution to the fair competition between fee for service and the medicare advantage type plans that competition the payment is based upon the competitive bidding of the process and and i think we all would agree uh competitive bidding's way better than any kind of administrative fiat it's going to work and it has the virtue of reflecting the cost and the efficiencies achievable in different parts of our country i know i don't have to tell y'all it's a big country it's very diverse you're going to have very different levels of what's what's actually achievable and and third i like the way that the risk adjustment and the consumer protections are emphasized when the senator talks about it and i think that is absolutely essential to going forward how i would tweak it is a little bit along the lines david just said i would really encourage you all to think hard about reflecting the regional variation that's out there and think about what if you could grant discretion to a piece of oregon or maybe the whole state i know the governor there is actually pretty creative about these matters as well are corners of colorado corners of new york where there are people ready to do essentially what i would call real competitive action but they need medicare to be free of the rules that have been encumbered upon them and so one of the steps is to have data available but another step is to let medicare actually structure something that might be different in one part of the world as long as they're hitting the the goals you set for the program i think that's the hallmark senator we want to move to a world in which you all set the targets you let the real world determine how to reach the targets and you keep the beneficiaries protected that's what you do mr caprada uh thank you uh mr chairman i uh hope what i'm about to say doesn't hurt senator wyden his efforts uh but uh uh i i i very much applaud what you're doing i think it's exactly the right direction to go okay you're killing them yeah exactly dead on arrival from here on out um the key in medicare to the thing to understand remember there was a famous study about mcallen texas that atul gawande put out in the new yorker and it was president read it and it was passed around and it was very interesting article very insightful and it was all about the overbuilt system in mcallen texas basically you know procedure-based heavy overbuilt system and the question is why was it the question that the article didn't address is why in mcallen texas was it so overbuilt and a subsequent analysis later on basically pinpointed it on medicare fee for service the medicare fever service financed and underwrote the overbuilt system in mcallen texas if you have a competitive system where someone can offer the medicare package benefits on a competitive basis you won't have that happen anymore because people will have to pay a much higher premium to stay in an overbuilt fee-for-service driven system like that competitive bidding will have the ability to weed that out of the system and i think so in based on many versions of this this goes all the way back to bro thomas in the late 90s and various versions since on a bipartisan basis i think there's general agreement that the best place to start in medicare is a bidded system with fee for service participating because that's the only way we'll ever really figure out what the right price is if we try to figure it out on our own we're going to either underpay or overpay or probably both well i think there is enormous wisdom in your last observation i've been here 25 years and i'm personally convinced of what you just described

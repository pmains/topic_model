Mr Speaker I rise in strong support of the Choice Act and I thank chairman Hensarling for his strong leadership imposing regulations meant for large transnational firms on community banks and credit unions may make sense to bureaucrats in Washington but the hard-working families on Long Island it means you can't buy that first home or queue you can't get that small business loan today we have the opportunity to remove the barriers to job creation and prosperity they have given us the weakest economic recovery in American history the Choice Act will end taxpayer-funded bailouts restore accountability and jumpstart innovation and job creation I strongly support this legislation and I urge its adoption thank you and I yield back

thank our witnesses for being here our Gulf partners have proven invaluable in opposing Iran's destabilizing agenda fighting terrorism and recognizing Israel's right to exist and I believe we must continue holding our allies to a high ethical and humanitarian standard I appreciate the opportunity to learn more about US efforts to prevent civilian casualties and foster respect for human rights in the Arabian Peninsula when Canada's Foreign Minister criticized egregious human rights abuses the Saudi government expelled the Canadian ambassador withdrew its own ambassador to Canada and froze pending trade and investment deals the Saudis have engaged in similar disputes with Germany and I believe Sweden also mr.singh our Canada Germany and Sweden coordinating a response to the latest diplomatic feud and how can we support our Canadian partners Thank You congresswoman I don't know that they are coordinating a response if so I it's not something I've heard about but I do think that the episode you cite is an example of the kind of frankly reckless actions by the Saudis that are concerning to us that are troubling to us because it was a valid criticism and their response was in my view totally out of proportion to what the Canadians had done I would have liked to see us back up our Canadian allies in their criticism of the Saudis because I don't think this goes to what mr. Sullivan was saying I don't think it's good for us or frankly good for the Saudis that they feel as though they can kind of intimidate other countries into not criticizing them from my point of view this is not just a matter of values or morals or those those things are important when human rights abuses are allowed to go forward unchecked I think it also in dangers the stability of these countries and encourages extremism thank you increasing access to affordable food fuel and medicine is key to restoring stability in Yemen but hoody rebels have disrupted the movement of imports by targeting commercial and military vessels transiting the Red Sea and Saudi Arabia has imposed periodic blockades dr. Carlin how can the international community support freedom of navigation in the Red Sea and facilitate the movement of necessities to yemeni ports thank you for that question I think the US military can be helpful as can regional militaries and facilitating freedom of navigation through these areas whether it's assisting and transporting whether it's helping regional navies through exercising by showing them how they might responsibly operate in that area all of all of which can be useful mister saying preventing civilian casualties in the Yemen conflict is a primary goal of the us-saudi military cooperation can you describe how the United States is working with the coalition to end the killing of civilians how effective have these efforts been well congressman obviously this is I think a top concern for our military officials and also our diplomatic officials who are dealing with this issue as has been discussed here a little bit we've done a number of things one is by providing precision munitions to our allies we have especially in the wake of particular incidents worked on the training of pilots we've tried to help the Saudis in terms of investigating incidents to determine exactly what occurred and we've also worked with them on questions of intelligence and these sort of do not target lists and so forth as far as I understand it and obviously you'd want a full briefing from our military officials that's what we have done I think that my impression is that the I haven't heard any US officials let's put it that way say that they feel as though the Saudis are deliberately targeting civilians if we felt that way I think we would have to end our cooperation with them but I think we need to appreciate that the level of care and precision that the US military brings these conflicts is simply you know frankly unmatched on right almost anywhere else in the world and that's why these kinds of long-term efforts are bringing up the abilities and capabilities of our allies is so important mr. Sullivan UN agencies and international NGOs are struggling to access areas in desperate need of humanitarian assistance how can we work with our allies to do more to increase access for the UN and international NGOs and any points of leverage that can be used to achieve this with the Saudis and the Emirates I defer to the expertise of mr. Harden who I think has made a couple of really important points today one is that a lot of this rests with the Houthis over whom we don't have influence but who we should be sure to be shining a spotlight on the extent to which they are blocking access through who data but with the Saudis and Emiratis I do think that we have influence and leverage both to open corridors across the Saudi border as mr. Harden said earlier and in respect to the Stockholm agreement which is fragile and sort of quasi holding working to restrain the Saudis and Emiratis so that more channels coming out of who data can be opened beyond the basically the one road that's coming out right now so those are those are available to us but it's an imperfect set of tools because so much of this rests on making sure the hootie step up to do their part thank you very much mr.

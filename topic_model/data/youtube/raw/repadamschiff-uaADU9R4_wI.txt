member democratic congressman adam schiff of california has admitted to a more aggressive approach when it comes to issuing those subpoenas saying that the committee is going to forgo some of the time-consuming steps that have dogged previous investigations when it comes to shoring up what schiff has called fault lines in america's democracy he did not stop there separate from the work of the committee congressman schiff introduced a bill today along with other members of congress that aims to set new limits on presidential power and congressman adam schiff joins me now um congressman first tell me what this bill would do and why it's necessary in the wake of what we've experienced well this bill is really modeled after what congress did post-watergate when they enacted a whole series of reforms designed to address the abuses that took place during the nix administration this current package of reforms enforces and expedites congressional subpoenas so that we can't have a new administration essentially ties him in court for year after year after year uh it strengthens penalties for violating the hatch act so that the white house can't hold a political convention on white house grounds or dragoon federal employees into campaign workers it protects against abuse of the parliament from power it tolls the statute of limitations for presidents who commit crimes so they can't simply avoid prosecution because they're in office and escape prosecution after they leave because the statute of limitations expires it protects inspector generals it protects whistleblowers it strengthens the independence of the justice department and chris that's just a partial list well it seems to me that you can imagine a world in which this would be bipartisan insofar as like on congressional subpoenas right i mean you know there's there's a partisan interest here and then there's a there's a different branches of government interest you know much of what trump did one could say has rendered congressional subpoenas particularly executive pretty empty i imagine republicans are going to want to use that power again but i i i think i know my answer to the question but do you have republicans interested in this as well well chris i hope that we will you know of course they live in fear so many of them live in fear of an errand statement of the former president criticizing them or supporting pro-democracy efforts if it's viewed as a criticism of his conduct of office so we have to get over that fear factor in terms of the republicans but many of the reforms the individual reforms in this bill uh had republican support in the past uh heck i mean some of the republicans were leaders of efforts to protect inspector generals and whistleblowers some republicans introduced legislation in the past to expedite enforcement of congressional subpoenas and i would hope that they would recognize look these are things that they should want no matter who the president of the united states is they ought to be defending their own institution if we can't do oversight we can't be effective i want to play for you something i just said on that question which is the secretary of state of georgia i asked him about compliance and cooperation with the january 6 committee this is what he had to say the vice president in the meeting i had in the oval office with him and the president on january 4th specifically asked me do you think i have the authority to simply unilaterally decide that certain of these electoral votes are invalid and i said that's an open question this is a direct quote but whether or not you have that authority the fact that the legislatures have not certified the alternate slate of electors would make it foolish to exercise it and that's why at the end of the day what we were asking is simply that he accede to requests from a number of the state legislatures legislators to delay things so that they were now coming back into formal session their governors refused to call them into special session to deal with this they were now back in the normal session and they wanted to look at it i was obviously not the secretary of state of georgia that was uh the conservative lawyer john eastman who has been advising the former president about essentially how to get mike pence to overturn the election unilaterally through a very tortured reading of his constitutional duties it seems to me to relate to the project that you're engaged in insofar as the ultimate power is using the power of the office to stay in office which is what was contemplated here and what it seems to me there needs to be a firewall against well absolutely and look whether it was the right clip or not both are very pertinent to what we're doing on the january 6 select committee we're going to be making a series of recommendations uh on how to protect our democracy going forward from efforts like the one that you just heard described where they would flout the spirit of the law and put our country into a constitutional crisis by trying to overturn the clear election results the clear will of the voters so we'll be addressing that on the january 6th select committee in terms of what the georgia secretary of state said and i did hear that where he talked about how he might cooperate with the select committee now that we have republican staff as well as democratic staff look our committee is bipartisan uh our members are bipartisan our staff is bipartisan and our work is nonpartisan but and there's no reason that the secretary should not cooperate with us i think he's got an important story to tell the american people but i will say this you don't get to pick and decide i like this committee i don't like this committee i like this competition right now when you get a congressional subpoena you have to comply with it when you get a request for information we would hope we would do so voluntarily yeah i guess that's the question right and what is the lesson you've learned from the the i mean you've got a sort of statutory fix here in the legislation you proposed today that would strengthen congressional subpoenas but what's the lesson you've learned about tactics or approach with those document requests from subpoenas from all the stonewalling that in some ways ended up being partially successful from the trump folks well it was all too successful and you know except for the fact that we impeach the president over his obstruction of congress but the lesson we learned is that number one we need statutory changes to expedite enforcement so another president can't simply play rope-a-dope in the courts uh in the interim in the meanwhile we do have a mechanism we didn't have over the last four years which is someone who flouts our subpoenas we can hold in contempt and make a referral to the justice department and it won't be ignored by a bill bar crony of the president so people who do flout our subpoenas will understand that they could face criminal exposure if they do so and that's not a worry that i think any of the trump people have all right congressman adam schiff thanks for making time tonight thank you

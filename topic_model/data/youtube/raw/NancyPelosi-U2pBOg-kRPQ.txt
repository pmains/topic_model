we now on a busy Sunday morning House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi it's very good to see you good morning I want to talk about presidential leadership here you know growing up it was always the leader of the Western world and now we're the world's only superpower and yet the president is taking a lot of criticism at this point for seeming to be sitting on the sidelines he's out fundraising and the whole world seems to be blowing up and I know you were with him in a couple of these fundraisers so you know the optics of this and you know photo ops matter optics matter have the heir to the White House on this first of all let me disagree with the when we were growing up you after me but we were in a bipolar world with the Soviet Union and the United States it's a much more complicated situation now and the president's leadership has been very strong in the issues that you're dealing with this morning the president was in the lead on supporting Iron Dome and asking for more resources now to help Israel defend itself which it has a right to do in the lead for asking for humanitarian assistance for the Palestinian people 40 something like 47 million dollars to go through the UN to help that was calling upon others to help negotiate not only a ceasefire but a peace there the president and secretary Kerry's presence there as a as a manifestation of the president's but because of a sustained high-level commitment of the Secretary of State representing the administration when it came to the Ukraine the president early on called for sanctions and then West Wednesday before the plane was even shot down the president asked for sector sanctions even stronger ones but the notion is a notion that Putin sort of sized up President Obama and said he backed off on Syria he's flipped playing footsie with Iran he's a softy he's not gonna stop me has anything happened that should dissuade Putin from that Putin is going to do what Putin is going to do it won't add up in terms of statement statesmanship or leadership as the president has said Russia is now a regional power some of what we see it comes from insecurity Putin for all of his is an institute is then secure about Russia's role in the world now what's happened in in eastern Ukraine with shooting to begin with the aggression and then the complicity and by the way the administration early on getting out there and saying we had the intelligence to say that these Rockets had a provenance in Russia as well as the ability to launch them so nobody's missing in action on all of this and as far as Putin is concerned he's a KGB guy who happens to be the president of Russia and he's going to do what he is going to do no matter who else is in charge any other place in the world so I would not judge his actions or his motivations by anything other than he is rooted in the KGB insecure about Russia's diminished role in the world and certainly causing waves globally at this point I want to move you to the Middle East and ask you your comfort level with what you're seeing on television again the headlines versus the ground well again as we all have said any country has a right to defend itself but when it is under assault and so too does Israel you've been there you know the proximity everything is very very close to each other and so a threat is a approximate threat it's right there again a repeat that thank God for Iron Dome which has diminished the casualties that would have been caused if these are Rockets work missiles were coming and not too far does it look as though Israel has gone too far you heard Ben Rosa from the president's national deputy national security adviser who said well we've told them we think they could be doing more well sure these will be doing more to protect civilians in Gaza well we are the more is that as is a deadly thing and I have many Palestinians who live in my district and I'm hearing from them regularly about how their families are affected who live in the region it's a terrible thing but let me just say that any missile that comes from someplace has a return address and if Israel is responding to that address then that's a shame that the Palestinians are using a rumor to be using children and families as shields for their for their missiles should we all try to you know first of all avoid conflict the Hamas initiated this so again this this has to be something where we try to have the two-state solution that we have to support we have to support Abbas and his role as leader there we have to support Iron Dome to protect the Israelis from the missiles we have to support the Palestinians what they need and we have to confer with the Qataris who have told me over and over again that Hamas is a humanitarian organization maybe they could use their influence to terrorist organizations on crack for you we've had that discussion mm-hmm I have to leave it there we will come back and we will talk politics and mid-term and all kinds of things going on I think it's important to note though that through all of this the Republicans are trying to sue the President on a path to impeach the president while we're trying to create jobs and and have stability in our country and in the world and I was I'm sorry that we didn't get a chance to talk more about that we will do that the next time I promise thank you so much appreciate it clattering Putin's approval is sky-high and Russia does that make him immune to the effects of Western sanctions Senator Lindsey Graham is that

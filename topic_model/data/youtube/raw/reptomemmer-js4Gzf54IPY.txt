Etc House Majority Whip is Tom Emma and he joins me now Carlson your party is taking uh is is said to be taking the country hostage what's your response to that well it's another false narrative by left-wing media Stuart thanks for having me bottom line is Kevin McCarthy and the new Republican majority in the house are doing nothing more than what the American voters elected us to do that is to work with the administration not to default on the U.S debt but to make sure that if we're going to protect the the debt by raising the debt ceiling that we put in place uh some reasonable some sensible responsible fiscal uh changes so that we can not only ensure the prosperity that this country is supposed to provide to this current generation but for generations to come uh I've had several people on the show suggesting that the Republicans in the house will cut waste dramatically okay cut waste dramatically would that be enough cuts to do what you really want to do with this budget can you can you get can you just eliminate waste and that that does your job for you no I think it's going to be more than that this has to be one of those things where we sit down with the administration which Kevin McCarthy did for the first time last week as you know uh Stuart when this started the president said absolutely no negotiation not going to sit down and talk to anybody you're doing it my way or the highway and that changed last Wednesday when the president said to Kevin McCarthy come on in let's talk you show me your budget I'll show you mine well at by rule I believe of the house Stuart the administration President Biden supposed to have his budget out today and under that same rule then Republicans in the house have six weeks with window with wind which to produce ours the president has said he's not going to put a budget out there till March we will follow suit and follow the rules and six weeks later you'll see the proposal but the focus seems to be on cuts it should be about efficiencies it should be about looking at waste it should also be looking at the future when we talk about the programs that matter most let's put this thing on a path to sustainability when you're spending a dollar twenty nine Stewart for every dollar you're bringing in that's not sustainable and it's not responsible the president's State of the Union Address is tomorrow night is this going to serve as the president's re-election campaign launch is not terribly popular with Democrats at this moment well I mean first off I don't think he's running again I think he's desperately trying to avoid being the lame duck president that he already is but let's assume for in it for a second that he is planning on running uh what's he going to run on Stuart double digit inflation that we haven't seen in 40 years uh gas prices that are still up 50 percent over what they were when he took office uh the grocery prices you just reported on I mean I've decided I'm going to buy my wife a uh eggs for Valentine's Day it's the most expensive thing I can find so what is he going to run on a two years of failure uh so far Republicans again are poised to work with this president on the debt ceiling and spending reforms to put this country in a much better place okay that might be a win for all of us constant Tom Emma thank you very much for being with us this morning sir don't be a stranger thank you come back soon see you again later we'll do

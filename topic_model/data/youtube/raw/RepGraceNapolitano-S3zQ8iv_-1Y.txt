health community and supporters and advocates we're here to spread the word and to be sure that everybody understands that may is mental health month and mental health awareness is what we're trying to promote we want to recognize it that we're expecting the White House to send a proclamation and that should be forthcoming because we've had in the last couple of years we're pleased to join our advocates to have them join us and to be able to be with us today to d stigmatize the issue of course as you know it affects millions of Americans it is the invisible illness it ranges from depression anxiety to bipolar the schizophrenia excuse me right yeah I get excited month of May draws attention to us wearing lime green lime green is to promote mental health please do not be afraid to speak up to be able to ask for help to be able to understand that this is something that you could get some assistance in being able to address it is all right to ask for help we started a program back in 2001 as a pilot program on placing clinicians in school so it's now in 26 goals we have a bill HR 1211 it is a bipartisan bill that provides on-site mental health clinicians in schools we must start addressing mental health issues at an early age because that's the future I'm sorry you got a sore throat yo come on okay I'm gonna be starting sorry about that you want me to read this at your school we must educate parents administrators families and communities we must learn the warning signs extreme change in behavior and verbal cues society must work together to eliminate the stigma including the media we have to share mental health resources and use the national crisis hotline 1 800 273 talk 24-hour confidential hotline and it could also assist veterans thank you so much I'm sorry it's just a heavy sword thank you my dear thank you now I did a pleasure to introduce some of the mental health task force the members who share the message of hope we want to reach a larger audience and including especially our youth but we have collaborated with mental health advocates through the years to bring more attention and 2d stigmatize the issue first I'd like to introduce you just saw her move up and fill in for me Jill diamond multiple Emmy winner chair of World Boxing Council cares were Boxing Council championship committee the naf BF female championship committee who has helped us tremendously in the last few years I helped secure promotion and mental health and WBC matches including mayweather-pacquiao know and if you'll notice during the spice they're wearing the green ribbon because of the work she's been doing to help us out so Jill thank you so much and and thank you for being here Jill it's a privilege for the World Boxing Council to be a part of this many of our boxers come from disadvantaged backgrounds and we are so appreciative of the work that grace and the people behind me do I don't think any of us have not witnessed friends and loved ones whose the quality of life has deteriorated they've lost their lives themselves because they were ashamed or afraid to come forward we have to stop the stigma mental illness is a brain disorder just like diabetes or anything else that needs treatment our children they kill themselves they kill each other because they were afraid of the rejection and the shame coming forward and saying that they don't fit in or they don't feel normal I personally think we need to define redefine the word normal I don't know what that means anymore but what we can do is try and break the stigma because we can't cure everyone but we can change our perception of mental illness so that people are not silenced in gratitude the World Boxing Council would like to thank grace and present her with this plaque to show our appreciation I was wondering what you were thank you my friend thank you to Jill she's been excellent in helping us promote more mental health awareness and distinct meditation so Linda a Gargan executive director of the National Federation for families for children mental health she provided all our green ribbons today and will provide reminder for a group photo will be for having a blue photo at following the discomfort so Linda please Thank You congresswoman thank you on behalf of the National Federation I would like to thank each of you for helping us to raise awareness about this very important issue of children's mental health for 25 years the mission of the Federation has been to advocate for services and supports for children with behavioral health challenges and their families we believe that every child has deserves the right to reach their maximum potential and to mature into fully productive citizens in their communities through the creation of evidence-based practices that are accessible to all children and the elimination of the stigma that is often associated with behavioral health challenges we believe that we can unleash the potential of these children and their families we simply cannot allow the correctional system to continue to be our largest mental health provider in this country I would like to publicly thank congresswoman grace Napolitano who continues to be a child a tireless champion of children with behavioral mental health problems and their families she serves as true inspiration her leadership helps us to highlight the message that there is no health without mental health and now I will introduce to you debbie plotnick who is the vice president for mental health and systems advocacy for mental health america good morning everybody and add great thanks to congresswoman Napolitano it's my pleasure to be here today representing Mental Health America Mental Health America is the nation's oldest advocacy organization we're celebrating our hundred and sixth birthday this year and we come from the voice of lived experience meaning people with mental health conditions speaking out about recovery and Mental Health America stands for some very simple things we stand for prevention from mental health conditions for all people we stand for early intervention at the earliest signs because we know that mental health conditions are conditions of childhood all mental major mental health conditions start having symptoms in childhood at the latest by adolescents or very early adulthood which is why we're so grateful for the congresswoman for the mental health in schools act Mental Health America also stands for treatment for all people who need it a continuum of care in the community and we know that recovery can be a goal for everyone so it's my privilege and pleasure today to work with all of the wonderful people standing behind me the mental health advocates our communities is united and we invite all you to join with us in support of getting the word out about helping people to identify early to come forward and to up we urge the members of Congress to support the passage of the mental health and Schools Act it's where the kids are and that's how we get to them so again Thank You congresswoman I'll excuse me and it's my privilege I've got to introduce Darcy Garcia Gucci ro is the director of nominees Child and Adolescent Health Center thank you thank you very much and i am with nami the National Alliance on Mental Illness and we would like to thank congresswoman to paula tano as my colleagues have for her leadership and her continued support of children and adolescents with mental health conditions we know that one in five children and youth are impacted by a mental health condition we know these conditions start early we know research shows us research supported by niamh shows us that fifty percent of lifetime cases of mental health conditions start by age 14 so to not recognize in a supportive way the critical role that schools play is extremely extremely important and an overlooked opportunity we know that less than half of children and youth that live with mental health conditions are identified and schools can play a critical role in that early identification and early intervention so we need to support schools as all of you know schools have a tremendous amount on their plates they have a tremendous amount of activity that they're required to address but we can create partnerships between schools and community mental health providers to really make a difference so that children are identified so that we don't see them end up dropping out and failing in school and becoming entangled with law enforcement and unfortunately having contact with the juvenile justice system so nommy stands firmly behind the mental health and Schools Act we learned a lot after the tragedy in Newtown about the important role that schools play now we need some serious action to really support schools so they can play a bigger role so Thank You congresswoman Napolitano for introducing the mental health and Schools Act and Nami will work with these colleague organizations to see that legislation passed I stand here now and introduce my colleague who's also been a tremendous champion for children's mental health Bethenny Lilly with a Bazelon Center for mental health law thank you Darcy I really appreciate it and as Darcy said my name is Bethany lily and I'm with the Bazelon Center for mental health law Darcy really kind of highlighted how important identification is but just to follow on and why we support the mental health and Schools Act is that services are such a fundamental part of this I mean once we've identified children they need accesses to the right kind of evidence-based practices that we discussed in the bill and we just want to extend our greatest thanks to representative Napolitano and all of the advocates behind us this is one of those issues that everyone should be behind thanks so much I'll now be introducing Trevor summerfield Trevor thank you well good morning everybody it's a pleasure to be here today and thank you so much congresswoman on grace Napolitano you've proven today that you speak so much about mental health is sometimes you can lose your voice because we have it we have a lot to talk about I'm here representing the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention the nation's leading nonprofit dedicated to preventing suicide through education research and advocacy on as I'm reminded today with all of the school children walking around how important it is to raise awareness about mental illness on as quickly as we can especially as people continue to grow I was thinking about this this morning and the NFL I think has really done a great thing on with educating youth on about mental illness on concussions on and I think as we continue to educate more and more youth and they grow up they're really going to be the next generation of people on who can identify early and prevent mental illness which ultimately leads to suicide unfortunately our organization represents one of the worst case outcomes when it comes to untreated mental illness on but when we look at suicide ninety percent of those on that are completed take place on with people that have a treatable diagnosable mental illness and it's events like this on that we're having today and also through the month of May on and again thank you so much to congresswoman grace Napolitano for highlighting the importance of mental health awareness thank you so very much and as you can see we have some heavy duty advocates but I can't tell you that this is not an easy task because it is something that people don't want to talk about they don't want to recognize it because of the stigma but I my head soft to the World Boxing Council to the all the organizations and if you said see the green ribbon on the fighters you know that they are with us World Boxing Council cares it is a tremendous of assistance to all of us unfortunately it is not something that is quite popular here in Washington to be able to fund it to be able to recognize it and I think we need to continue working this is just the beginning we've been doing this for at least a decade which may be if it takes another decade but we're going to be successful in making sure that our children and our adults have the proper assistance when they need it where they need it in the appropriate language unfortunately it's not something that is easy to do budget requirements are always in the way but we would want to thank all our advocates those that are here those that are not here to continue working with us to try two distinct eyes and try to provide more funding forth a provision of those services that our children are veterans especially our veterans because we're still fits have been told it is still 22 suicides a day and that's infected but we which is intolerable our children are important to us they're our future and they're our future leaders and somehow we must continue to fight on for them and for our future so with that I thank you so very much if there's anybody that has any questions of our group here they're more than welcome to ask if anybody has a any comment any question well thank you so very much there will be a picture of our advocates and some folk stuff on those steps if you want to join us you're more than welcome so I thank you all thank you to my friends and we we keep the fight going thank you so very much

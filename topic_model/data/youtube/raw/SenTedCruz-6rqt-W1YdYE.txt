Texas Republican senator Ted Cruz a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee who actually worked at one time for Robert Muller at the Justice Department thank you so much for joining me this morning first question is do you think the public should see the full Mulla report absolutely I think the report needs to be made public it needs to be released to the Congress and it needs to be released to the American people this has consumed two years of the American people's time and we need to have full transparency we needed we didn't know the special counsels conclusions okay and the president has continued to unleash attacks on the Special Counsel investigation even in the probes final hours calling it a big hoax a witch hunt do you agree with the president that the Moller investigation was a witch hunt I think the Muller investigation went on far too long and I think Bob Muller made a serious mistake when he brought together the team of investigators and lawyers and selected so many partisan Democrats who had been longtime Democratic donors I think that was unfortunate because by doing that it undermined the the credibility and impartiality of the special counsels office do you think it went that being said we're being go ahead I'm sorry do you think would you go as far though as the president has in calling it a witch hunt I you know I'll leave that language to the president I will say I'm concerned that it may have become a fishing expedition we'll see when we see the report we'll see what's in the report but but I do think it's striking that that at least the early indications are there are no further indictments which means as you pointed out at the top of the show that not a single person was indicted for colluding with the Russians to influence the 2016 election if that's right that that there are no indictments for collusion with the Russians that's that's good news for the American people those were serious charges when they were raised two years ago and if the Special Counsel concluded that there there is not evidence that that occurred that would be very good news so as you mentioned a senior Justice Department official is telling CNN that he's not recommending any further indictments but we do know that there are other investigations going on elsewhere in the Justice Department into the president's businesses his inaugural committee is Charitable Foundation are Republicans right to be popping the champagne right now I'm not saying you are but others are or is it premature listen if anyone thinks that the Muller report being concluded is is the end of the Democrats attempt to take down President Trump they haven't been paying attention the last two years yet you know it was striking as I listened to your interview with congressman Nadler that he was immediately committing away okay find it yet you know yesterday the Moller report was the end all and be all it was going to be the salvation for the Democrats and destroy President Trump now you can already see the Democrats pivoting away say okay well we need to do other investigations it's got to be someone else it's got to be the southern district leader he's got to be the New York Attorney General it's got to become Senator it is the Justice and man it's just presidents Justice Department that is continuing to best investigate those other things that I just mentioned Democrats are one thing but I'm talking about but good but but dad about my point is you asked congressman Nadler whether the house is is going to impeach the president I'll answer that for you yes they fully intend to impeach the president and and and they don't care about the basis you know twice congressman Nadler said something remarkable he said listen the special counsels focused on crimes we're not all that concerned with crimes are focused this is Democrats in the house is much broader than crimes but what they're basically saying is they're going to impeach the president for being Donald Trump and then they don't care about the evidence they don't care about this you know much better than a president it's it's against their guidelines so it is that a bit of a red herring well we'll see what's in the report and and as a member of the Judiciary Committee I'm gonna read the report I want to give it a fair consideration and and I hope and expect the American people to have the chance to do the same thing but my point is the extreme left and the democratic party that they have so much anger and hatred directed at the president that we're going to see the Democrats moving forward with impeachment whatever the evidence that's why you're seeing crafts like congressman Nadler say don't worry about crimes our focus is not crimes that's just that Bob Miller's focus our focus is broader what their focus is is politics and they need to set aside the rage and anger listen I disagreed with Barack Obama on a host of issues but I didn't believe he should be impeached that the dream ISM that we're seeing in the Democratic Party their focus is obsessively on trying to destroy the president this administration that's not good for the American people we ought to be coming together and solving the real problems in this country not just engage in relentless political war okay senator I want to turn to a couple of other topics I know that you'd like to talk about one of them is the Middle East because the president made headlines by tweeting that it's time for the u.s. to fully recognize Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights it seems like the president is really putting his thumb on the scale for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the final weeks of the elections over there what would you do if a democratic president made a move that helped a Labour Prime Minister in Israel well III think your focus is it is off slightly listen what the president did this week was tremendous he recognized that the Golan Heights is legitimately now part of Israel as you don't think doing that weeks before an election in Israel puts his thumb on the scale regardless of the substance of it talking about the timing I think it is good foreign policy for Israel and it's good foreign policy for the United States in December I introduced a resolution for Congress to recognize the Golan Heights was part of Israel just a couple of months ago I introduced legislation for Congress to recognize the Golan Heights as part of Israel and indeed that legislation a number of Democrats at the house in the House have spoken out in favor of that legislation there's bipartisan agreement to do this and and the reason is simple the Golan Heights were taken in 1967 during the six-day war a defensive war where Israel was attacked if you look at what's happening in the Middle East no one in their right mind would want to see the Golan Heights go to Bashar Assad go to Syria or go to Iranian proxies or the Russian it is legitimately part of it part of Israel I'm glad the president took my counsel and the counsel of others and recognized this and indeed I hope that cops will take up the legislation I've introduced and put the president's determination into US law because that is in the security interest of Israel and critically it's in the security interest of the United States the president did the right thing here senator one last important question we learned this week that the Justice Department issued subpoenas in a criminal investigation two into two Boeing plane crashes you chair the Senate Subcommittee on aviation you are going to have a hearing this coming week on Wednesday do you think that Boeing is criminally liable and also do you think the FAA was negligent here well the first question is going to be a determination initially for the Justice Department and ultimately for the criminal justice system I like everybody else I'm deeply concerned about these two crashers that that took over 300 lives and and so I'm chairing a hearing this week with with the acting head of the FAA and the relevant government officials to inquire really what went on here what we knew when did we know it and and what caused this crash there early indications that a system on the plane called the M caste system which adjusted adjusted the the altitude of the plane may have contributed to the crash we don't know that we shouldn't jump to conclusions but when you have over 300 people whose lives have been taken it was the right thing to do to ground the planes I called for them to be grounded early on and the FAA ultimately agreed with that determination but but our priority has to be the safety of the flying public you know you and I were on planes all the time our families are on planes all the time in Texas Texans are on planes all the time we need to have the confidence when we get on a plane that that there is not a problem mechanical system or software system that endangers the lives of passengers and so this hearing this week is going to be the first step for the Senate to begin inquiring what are the facts here and what do we need to know to be confident that the flying public will say that's our responsibility is and we look forward to seeing that both on the side of Boeing and on the side of the FAA and whether the oversight

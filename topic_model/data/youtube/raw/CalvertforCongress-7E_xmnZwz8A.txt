I have a lot of veteran friends at the American Legion, my Rotary Club, and I've yet to speak to anyone who had anything negative to say regarding Ken. He's very support of veterans, he's supportive of the American Legion, he's supportive of what goes on at March Air Base he's a proponent for maintaining the Navy base in Norco.  There was discussion about potentially closing the Naval base and Ken was very proactive in terms of making sure that the Naval base stayed here. So, yes, Ken is pro-military.

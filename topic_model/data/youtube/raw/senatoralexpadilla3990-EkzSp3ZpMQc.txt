thank you Mr chair Mr Garcia I know this topic of not just some of the clients you've had in private practice but some of the pro bono work that you've taken on as a become a bit of a theme here this morning and so let me allow me to do a couple things just for the record and to be abundantly clear with folks who are observing this hearing you spent about 500 hours per year it's about 25 percent of your time providing pro bono Legal Services that's a significant amount of time resources that you're providing to clients and causes that could not otherwise afford the hourly fees of a Major law firm let alone billable hours for yourself and possibly more income for the firm I think that's commendable and honorable but because of the clients that have been referenced by my Republican colleagues here on the committee you've advocated pro bono basis for women for voters for immigrants for incarcerated individuals ensuring their due process rights if they seem to be trying to twist uh the honor of your work because of who you've chosen to represent on a pro bono basis now I know you know full well the difference between having been an advocate and the work that it would how you would need to approach your work uh From the Bench if you're fortunate to be confirmed so just to clear up any misconceptions any misperceptions for anybody following these proceedings can you in your own words describe those differences between being an advocate being a judge and dispel any concern somebody may have that your prior advocacy or pro bono work would inappropriately bias any case you may hear absolutely thank you Senator um as you mentioned the roles of an advocate and a judge are very very different as an advocate my job was to generate the best possible argument for every client that retained my law firm and I was honored to do that in my paid and pro bono cases and I'm proud of the work that I've done over the course of my career the role of a judge of course is very different the Constitution calls for an independent Judiciary and impartial judges and that's why every judge takes an oath to fairly and impartially apply the law I have great respect for that principle and for this court the DC circuit having clerked there and worked there with many folks that I respect and I would bring that impartiality and dedication to the rule of law if I'm fortunate enough to be confirmed great now uh my next question is actually for both of you let's see here brief answers uh to the following I mean if in preparation for this moment you've had a chance to observe any of the prior Judiciary Committee hearings on uh nominees to the district court to the Circuit Court even a hearing we had on the Supreme Court uh justice nominee you've heard me talk about the importance of diversity uh diversity not just on the federal bench but at all levels and not just folks who sit on the bench but for law clerks as well I think as both of you have observed and uh can share a clerkship with a federal judge for many can serve as a springboard to a tremendously successful legal career either as a future judge or in private practice but too few women in minority law students are given the opportunity to clerk especially at the federal level and at the upper levels of the federal Judiciary despite having comparable or Superior credentials I'm not going to be shy about this now Mr Garcia You've spoken about this issue in the context of your own clerkship experience when you noted that during your time clerking at the Supreme Court you were one of only two latino clerks at the time and no black law clerks were there at the time so the question is this if you're fortunate enough to be confirmed number one do you agree that diversity at all levels of the Judiciary including staff and law clerks is important and if so what would you intentionally do to advance diversity in the Judiciary we'll start with you Miss Douglas thank you for the question Senator I have been a sitting Magistrate Judge for the past um almost four years I have um interviewed and um reviewed the qualifications for law clerks from all various backgrounds backgrounds in their diversity in ways such as uh you know geographically where they were from whether or not it was race or gender interest that they have whether or not it's pro bono or corporate law after leaving their clerkship I have had three law clerks since I have been present as as a United States Magistrate Judge and they've all been from various diverse backgrounds and if I am so fortunate to be elevated to the fifth circuit I would continue in that same thing thank you Mr Garcia thank you Senator I very much share those sentiments and if I am confirmed uh I do value the importance of having folks with different backgrounds and perspectives on the law and one thing among others I would try to do is to hire from a range of law schools very good very good um thank you Mr

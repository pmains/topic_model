I'm worried that the GOP is losing the fiscal High Ground here the attacks on big spending and inflation are not going to work because of the support for these bills I'm especially especially worried about this 250 billion dollar semiconductor monstrosity but it's not only that as you know anyway what do you think about this are you as concerned as I am yeah Larry I am concerned about it and there's two issues here one is the spending the other one is the brand the Republican brand that you're talking about and this this is really bad timing for this semiconductor Bill if you will listen the goal is Noble there is no question that supply chain issues whether it's food whether it's you know minerals whether it's uh you know semiconductors Pharmaceuticals we are vulnerable to China way too vulnerable and we ought to be doing more to be competitive or or just put them out of business altogether because that's what their job is that's what they're committed to but trying to out China China is not the way to do that the way to do it is reopen our free market system eliminate the regulations and the taxes that get in the way of the innovators and and we can attract our own businesses back here the tax cuts and jobs act that you talked about during the Trump era did exactly that we we've had many many of our corporations repatriate overseas dollars back into the United States when the incentives were turned to to Ben benefit the United States as opposed to other countries so there are ways to do it but we don't have to spend taxpayer dollars necessarily to do it now I'm all for epscore funding I like you know basic research I do think that the federal government has a role in some of this in the early stages where where there might not be dollars spent but we're well beyond that particularly with the 52 billion plus the 24 billion in tax credits specifically for corporate citizens who aren't even under the law obligated to to build or to manufacture these semiconductors in the United States that's a key point you know uh we had Senator Tom Cotton On the other day there are no uh guard rails as far as I can tell incidentally for China but also like Intel which is you know foaming at the mouth to get this 50 billion dollars from Uncle Sam Intel's got plans to build a plant in Germany I think they've already started to build plan Germany I got nothing against the Germans I just don't think I have to have taxpayers give money to Intel for that so your point let's go back to your book your Point's exactly right I always thought the Republican way which was the free market capitalist way was to reduce tax and Regulatory burdens and therefore make America the most hospitable investment home in the world we win the global race for Capital companies come here that's the Republican way whereas the Democratic way is to spend and spend and regulate and regulate in tax and tax so that government is driving the economy rather than um you know private investment or entrepreneurs but I think there's some confusion among some of our friends well to be fair um the semiconductor industry is viewed by many and not completely and appropriately Larry as a national security issue okay I understand that but again our advantage is our openness and when we become the subsidizer you know trying to out-subsidize our competitors around the world we give up some of that Advantage for sure and and let's be Hospital hospitable to business every now and then we're going to have to take on China but I think again president Trump tied us the way lower taxes lower regulations create the appropriate natural incentives to invest in the United States and when necessary add you know put tariffs on things coming in from China as opposed to you know subsidizing their own companies who in again in this bill the guardrails that you and Tom talked about that's exactly right there are very loose definitions here and again if we didn't learn anything from the Trump years it's that we need to be more prescriptive at the legislative level and not not turn over the details to the bureaucracy because they will only add to the burden they will not make it better yeah that's very important sir you know um look at I know semiconductors are important I had dinner the other night uh with Wilbur Ross and our wives and we talked about that um but you know what Pharmaceuticals are important steel is important yes energy is important you follow in other words lower taxes for all businesses or r d credit that could be expensed immediately for all businesses or 100 immediate write-offs to appreciate for all businesses or deregulate for all you see what I'm saying I hate to see us go back to picking winners and losers I mean this goofy bill as you probably know they've got more solyndra cash cow hedge funds all right we're going to go through this whole thing that they did with Obama the energy Department gets its boondoggles the Commerce Department the transportation department I mean this is crazy this is like all that what is it scratching all the Democratic issues this is just political handouts that's all this is well there's a there's a lot of corporate welfare in it there's no question about it again with noble goals but there's no end to the good things government can do if we had all the money in the world but we don't instead we have inflation we have a recession looming and now we have this idea that Democrats have to tax not big corporations but rather pass through businesses Larry I mean it's hard to come up with a dumber formula than what they've come than what they've come up with no you're quite right that small business tax would be an absolute killer Senator just before we we leave you the last minute or so um there's this good headlines now the Chinese Communist Party land grab in the U.S and we went through some of this I was in a breathtaking National Security presentation once that showed how Huawei had their little connectors you know on the on the on the posts on the telephone poles right near our military bases where they could spy basically and that had to be stopped and it looks like the Chinese are back Governor DeSantis took a rip at them I think correctly with Florida you've had some purchases going on in North Dakota as I read I mean this Chinese land grab I think all they they're not interested investment they're certainly not going to help the U.S I think it's just a spy mission that's all it is well the spine's a big part of it as you know they don't go anywhere but that they don't use some passive spine to collect data on people um you know steal in intellectual property Force technology transfer obviously if you're doing business with them but in addition to that Larry if you just set that aside for a minute the land grab itself you just talked about all the supply chain vulnerabilities well food is one of them and we learned during the pandemic that China's ownership of much of the meat packing in the United States made us vulnerable to price increases it hurt our Ranchers but it helped the Packers and and then now they want to buy up other farmland and when they get a supply chain they they'll make some money with it for sure and they'll use that money for nefarious things including Hypersonic missiles and building out a Navy but in addition to that again they capture more of our food supply chain which we ought to be protecting with everything we have I'm glad to sell a lot of food to China and to anybody else that wants to buy it we grow more than we need exporting as a part of the free market Market but what we ought not do is let them come in and buy it all up and then they control who gets it in a crisis you know they don't let us U.S investors just buy up their land willy-nilly they don't no I bet you you and Wilbur I should have dinner again and talk about buying up some land there in China next to a military base see how it goes yeah see how that works right see we're going to get Wilbur on the show to talk a little bit about it he's more sympathetic look I'm just saying I'm not saying that uh semiconductors aren't important but of course Senator less I just saying that all these industries are important and so on a Level Playing Field you know lower their tax rates improve their depreciation write-offs uh get them back to repatriate so we have onshoring deregulate stop this insane climate act you know for everybody like everybody not winners and losers that that used to be the Republican way that was called pardon the phrase free market capitalism it still is Larry it really still is there are a few outliers every now and then but it's still we are I'll take your word for it Senator Kevin Kramer the best of the best as always

Thank You mr. chairman let me ambassador lighthouse are good to see again I mean first of all add my voice to to my colleagues one I completely agree with Senator Bennet that the president's language about our allies Mexico candidate EU there are serious repercussions here and I know you don't probably have access to his tweed egde but some restraint would be terribly appropriate and I also agree with the senator Cantwell that you said you support the export-import bank let's get it functioning the sooner the better what I'm going to talk about is is something that falls in your lane but not entirely in your lane and that is I think the incredible growing threat of China you outlined some aspects of the China 2025 plan what I didn't hear you outline or the areas the ranking member and I serve on the Intelligence Committee the China has an extraordinarily organized plan around investment in artificial intelligence machine learning quantum computing where their goal is to leapfrog ahead of today's technologies and not be are equal but bypass us we've talked a lot and I think again for many administrations we've allowed China to steal our intellectual property with virtually no pushback we now have an unprecedented organized effort on Chinese Chinese investors to invest actually in early-stage companies that we've never seen before and is organized a way and companies are not aware of of the concerns I believe they should have I think we see in an unprecedented way Chinese use their students who come over to this country and then again come back often times with intellectual property and again an organized way that didn't exist two or three years ago I have huge concerns about the number of American companies frankly that have been so anxious to access the Chinese market that they give up their intellectual property they give up their source codes in ways they would never do entering into any other nation and you made announcement yesterday administration did about some air areas they were gonna try to concentrate on and trying to take on IP I'd like you to spell that out a little bit more but what I'm concerned about is quietly in some of these companies like wall way and all the Bob but people may be aware of but there are 20-plus Chinese tech companies all with valuations north of twenty billion dollars so no corn and trying to work with them as well we're trying to reform some of the Cepheus process but the savea's process alone will not get us there where some of these companies have such breadth and scope they can enter into our american market directly now again this is a little bit outside of your lane but I would hope rather than simply focusing on aluminum steel that you would look in a much more organized way about the national security concerns the protection of our intellectual property visa V China and how we can have a not just trade policy but a whole of government policy to frankly warm in ways American companies before they allow I believe some of these Chinese tech companies to take over our markets in ways that they operate on totally different principles than any true market-based economy they have a market plan they have industrial planning in ways that is exponentially greater not something we should repeat but how is the administration and how is your language on this issue well I would say first of all that I'm it is very encouraging to hear your description of the problem I totally agree with it I think in the final analysis if you say what keeps me awake at night that's what keeps me awake at night if you say what's gonna define whether or not I've done my job or you've done yours it's going to be how we deal with this issue so I'm I'm it's very encouraging whenever I hear I always think why doesn't the Intelligence Committee take so many of these other senators who were not on it and make them sit in the skiff and say here look at this stuff and I think if you did we'd have a lot more people are interested in and and sympathetic to your view it strikes me it's almost impossible to be exposed for a smart person to be exposed to what you're exposed to and that other committee and not conclude the way you conclude so I completely agree with it I would say it's because of that that we focus is our first major thing we hadn't after we of course the steel thing is what it is we have cases that were brought but from my point of view the most important single thing was this 301 on IP and it was because exactly I start and end precisely where you are and I agree with you on this issue I hope that senators spend time on it this issue of putting a million dollars into ten little things and have one of them pop up and now you're in a position where it's likely a joint used technology it's going to have whatever the military effect is but it's going to have all these effects in terms of our economy going forward develop in the United States and gone from the United States so our our remedy will in the 301 will deal with that I believe in ways that you'll find helpful and as we announce it and move forward I hope that you'll engage with the Secretary of Treasury specifically just person-to-person on this issue the issue this issue of investment that you just mentioned mr. chairman let me just have one quick comment just some of the low-hanging fruit in this is outside of your lane we had a 700 thousand person backlog on security clearances yet what ought to be one of our top priorities is making sure the chief security officer of every fortune 1000 company has a security clearance so we can share the vulnerabilities that are out there and some of the nefarious means that some of these Chinese tech companies are going to use

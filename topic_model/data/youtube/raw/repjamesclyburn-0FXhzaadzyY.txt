gentleman is recognized for four minutes thank you madam Speaker and I thank the gentleman for yielding me at the time the model of my home state of South Carolina is dum spiro spero that's a Latin phrase for a while I breathe I hope today as a house prepares to vote on the historic George florid justice in policing heart those words take on a new meaning and a very special meaning for me in this moment of the haunting words of this legislations namesake I can't breathe echo in the street daily he mr. Flores case his breath was literally being snuffed out as he cried out for his dead mother but for so many blocks in our country today I can't breathe it's just another way of saying I have no hope today this august body is going to pass a piece of legislation that will begin the process of restoring hope hope to many whose ancestors for four centuries to be included in the nation's vision of live liberty and justice for all this legislation gives us an opportunity to live up to what Alexis de Tocqueville observe about America's greatness he wrote America is not great because it is more enlightened than any other nation but rather because it has always been able to repair its faults today we are seeking to repair some folks in our policing system a police's system whose foundation was built upon two pillows of experiences one by a group of Americans who came to America of their own free will in search of freedom the other by a group of America who came to America against their will and were enslaved for 244 years visitors of that system are still evident in today is law enforcement culture chuckholes on black arrestees no bra not interest into black residences militarized police forces in black communities qualified immunity for all intended to preserve rather than serve intended to protect perpetrators of excessive uses of force rather than improve conditions and communities today House Democrats and I hope some of our Republican colleagues will say about their votes enough is enough that it's time to apply the greatness of America equitably and to all our citizens but we cannot stop here recent occurrences have exposed in short a spotlight on an equities in our health care system inadequacy in our educational system and interpro penis puffiness in our electoral system liberty and justice for all remains a deferred dream for far too many job losses challenges in health care eviction threats people are trying to catch their breath if they can't breathe they can't hope is he proud South Carolinian I believe in and try to live by that principle while I breathe I hope and with the passage the Georges flora justice in policing Act we will all breathe a little freer and gain a little more hope are you back

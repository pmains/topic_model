they have created newly re-elected Republican congresswoman Kat kamek of Florida a member of the House Homeland Security committee joins me now thank you so much for coming here to talk to us today you accompanied McCarthy on this border trip he says that when the GOP takes majority he wants to hold these hearings literally right there on the border to force Democrats to go there what do you say the White House calling this a publicity stunt it's absolutely absurd coming from an Administration that they have done absolutely nothing but facilitate the trafficking of children and drugs across our Southern border their plan is they have no plan and to criticize Republicans who have not only put forward a plan through the commitment to America but we have offered legislation time and time again for the past 23 months of which Nancy Pelosi has soundly rejected and refused to have a vote on the house floor I think it's incredibly disingenuous that the Democrats are saying oh well you know I think we can work together on a couple of these issues we have tried they have rejected every single attempt that we have put forward to secure the Border support our agents to stop the trafficking of children to stop the flow of Narcotics they have done absolutely nothing and now they're going to reap what they sow I think that we need to be very aggressive in immediately securing the border and supporting our agents because they have not received one ounce of support from this Administration since Biden took office absolutely and speaking of disingenuous and she just brought up that word I mean talk about the lack of sympathy to those border patrol agents and in fact just four uh recently committing suicide the morale is at an all-time low the illegal immigrants crossing our border at an all-time high and then you've got the DHS secretary majorcus testifying under oath last week that the border is secure and that he's also claiming the border is closed and clearly that is not true if you check out the number of Migrant encounters for fiscal year we've got them there were over 1.7 million in 2021 over 2.3 million in 2022 and 2023 fiscal year already not looking any better with more than 230 thousand migrants Encounters in October that's the highest number for October in years so either majorcus is lying or he is absolutely clueless about what's happening on the border and that is why the GOP wants to start holding news conferences there to show them what really is reality absolutely I have had the opportunity to question Alejandro my orcas myself in front of the household land security committee multiple times I think about five or six and each time he has lied outright and when I press him on the very numbers that his Department publishes he says that they're inaccurate when I confronted him on the 1.4 million illegals who have been quote unquote paroled into the United States on a five-year temporary system where they in five years are supposed to turn themselves in and so they can be deported which is just laughable he says oh that's not happening that's wrong and then he presents this righteous indignation uh front where he just says oh you know you're disrespectful of the agents no you know what's disrespectful not allowing these agents to do their job they're not babysitters they're not processors they need to get back on the line and what I saw in El Paso firsthand was just 12 miles of border that unpatrolled a single agent I want to think of the National Security I want to talk about this legal letter that's coming out that's basically stating that more than a dozen Republican attorneys generals are urging a judge to keep fight title 42 in place which has been used to expel migrants to mitigate the coveted pandemic the judge ruled this month that the Biden Administration must end the uh the policy in late December giving them the time to prepare for an expedited or expected influx of illegal immigrants title 42 was obviously a trump-era policy those states that are now urging to keep it in place include Arizona Louisiana Alabama Alaska Kansas Kentucky Mississippi Nebraska Ohio Oklahoma South Carolina Texas Virginia West Virginia and Wyoming these are Republican states that are desperately trying to make a change and this Administration is pushing them tooth and nail to make no difference whatsoever do you think they'll have any luck with this by this letter that they just sent to a D.C judge yeah I think so what we've seen as a result of the open border policies that Biden has allowed to continue and facilitate is that every state in the United States is a border state every town in America is a Border Town and these Governors have a responsibility to protect their citizens of their state they can't do that when you have gang members terrorists uh fentanyl killing 300 people a day in the country you can't protect your citizens when you have an open border with anyone who wants to come across from over 151 different countries is coming across yeah so I think they will be successful but the other thing that I'll add on title 42 is that it was never designed to be permanent but it was the only tool left in the toolbox that our agents have in order to stop this flow

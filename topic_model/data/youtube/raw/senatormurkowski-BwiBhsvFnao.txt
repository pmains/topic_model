so as we gather to celebrate independence day whether that's cheering on the mount marathon runners or or watching one of alaska's many fourth of july parades or really just getting together in the backyard with family and friends for a barbecue i think we need to make sure that we stop and we remember the freedoms and the liberties that we enjoy as americans because we know freedom is not free we must not forget that america is a pretty exceptional place and that living here is really a blessing but we also recognize that our experience is not the standard for the world where there are far too many fighting for their freedom daily and we here in this country should certainly not take our democracy for granted today and every day i am grateful for those who served our nation under the flag in the name of freedom we thank them for their service and their sacrifice and that of their families so from my family to yours happy independence day take care be safe out there

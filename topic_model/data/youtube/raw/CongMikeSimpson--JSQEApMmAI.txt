each will control 30 minutes the chair recognizes the gentleman from Idaho Thank You mr. speaker mr. Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume about objections order mr. speaker before I get into the substance of this motion to instruct I want to thank chairman dicks and his staff for listening to the views of minority during our pre conference deliberations while we may not agree on everything in this interior appropriations conference agreement our staff discussions have been very productive the most I'm offering today is very straightforward it does two things first it would insist on section 425 of the House bill regarding a prohibition on funds to implement any rule requiring mandatory reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from manure management systems secondly it would require that the interior appropriations conference report be available to 72 hours prior to the house consideration for the for the public and for members to read this motion to instruct us simply insists upon House passed the House passed bills positioned relating to the latham amendment the latham amendment simply says that the EPA cannot implement a rule that requires mandatory reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from cow pig and chicken manure the latham amendment was offered in full committee as well n was one of the very few amendments passed this year was strong bipartisan support every Democrat on the Appropriations Committee with agricultural interests in his district supported it and no one made an effort to strike the language on the House floor now of course anyone could have done that excuse me I was wrong we didn't consider this bill under an open rule so they would have had to go to the Rules Committee but no one did go to the Rules Committee to get an amendment approved so that they could offer it on the floor it was part of the house-passed interior procreation bill and should be a part of the Interior proprie Asians conference agreement according to the EPA livestock manure management systems account for less than one percent of all human induced greenhouse gas emissions in the United States over eighty-five percent that's eighty-five percent of greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture in total come from sources other than manure management system and these verses are not subject to the reporting rule by the EPA's own admission regulating these sources would be overly expensive and burdensome members of the Agriculture Committee have been warning us for years of the danger of climate change rulemaking outside of the legislative process this EPA rule is clear evidence that the chickens have finally come home to roost as have the cows and pigs if you have livestock or a family farm in your congressional district you will want to support this motion to instruct the simple truth is that the livestock industry is being hammered by the downturn in our national economy if you are raising animals for food you are either losing your shirt or you are going out of business that's the truth it's not an exaggeration frozen credit markets have left farmers and ranchers without the credit they need to run their day-to-day operations and many have been forced to sell their land or declare bankruptcy it was only a few weeks ago that we added 350 million dollars to the Agri procreation conference report to bail out the dairy industry which is collapsing under the strain of the credit crisis and lobel crisis and in the interior conference report were not only making it more difficult for farmers to succeed we're setting them up to fail there's another irony here worth noting the interior appropriations conference agreement is likely to include an exemption to the clean air rule affecting ships on the Great Lakes chairman OB recognized that the excesses of the EPA would place additional hardships upon an economy already devastated by the recession so the chairman has done what anyone in his position would do to help his constituents he took action I happen to agree with him that's no different from what Tom Latham was trying to do to help farmers ranchers and livestock producers in Iowa and across the country the only difference is that mr. Latham's amendment was in the original House bill and chairman Obie's writer was air dropped at the last minute so we're going to protect the Great Lakes on the one hand while we regulate farmers out of business on the other hand if the EPA had existed in biblical times there is no question in my mind that it would have regulated greenhouse gas emissions from Noah's Ark poor noah and his livestock they could withstand a 40-day flood but they would never have survived the EPA I encourage members on both sides it takes to take a step back and think about this let's use a little common sense here I urge members especially if you support agriculture farming in the livestock industry to support this motion and I reserve the balance of my time my deho reserves the balance of his time

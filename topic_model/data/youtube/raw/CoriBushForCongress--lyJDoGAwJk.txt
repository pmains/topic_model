I'm Cori Bush. Nurse. Pastor. Single Mom. Like you I've wondered where's our justice these last 20 years? I've struggled paycheck to paycheck asking where's our progress? And as a Black Mom, I'm sick of having to say "Just make it home safely." I'm Cori Bush, and I approve this message. Because Lacy Clay hasn't risen to meet this moment. He's presided over 20 years of decline. It's time for a change. For new leadership that works for you. It's our time to make history.

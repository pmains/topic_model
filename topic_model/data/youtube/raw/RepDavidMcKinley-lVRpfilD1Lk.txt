uh thank you mr chairman uh the drug abuse epidemic didn't go away with a virus arrived from china so america has been fighting two epidemics in fact covet made the overdose epidemic even worse before the virus before the virus arrived opioid deaths in america already increased by 18 percent nationwide over the previous year and emergency business were up almost 30 percent now fast forward to today just 12 months later overdose rates are now up nearly 30 percent more over last year allegheny county in maryland is up 111 since last year you heard gus belarus in florida referred to one of his counties is up 71 and for miss rochester last spring in delaware they were up 11 but since that time last year they're up 47 in one year's time my own county in west virginia is up 51 in the past year so in fact until a surge of the virus at the end of last year west virginia was experiencing more deaths from opioids than from covin so congress seems to be unable to handle two epidemics at the same time according to a harvard economist covet is going to cost the american economy over 16 trillion dollars but congress has committed over 6 trillion to address the issue that means congress has invested about 35 percent of the cost of the the the virus to fight it that's impressive that investment will hopefully put this pandemic in the rearview mirror but the opioid crisis will continue to be a scourge on communities now let's put this in perspective according to the nih drug abuse costs the american economy approximately 750 270 billion dollars a year but last year we allocated just nearly eight billion dollars to fight it so but when you so when you calculate that that's less than three percent of what the disease costs the american economy so three percent with opioids first with three percent of the opioids versus 35 with covet does that seem fair let me let me try framing another way from an engineering perspective coveted deaths are five times that of overdoses with drugs five times but we're spending 750 times more money to battle that over drug abuse so what i'm asking should that overdose epidemic be taken more seriously by congress since states have not necessarily followed the intent of congress my amendment calls for an additional three billion dollars to samsha that would be dedicated dedicated for treating substance abuse congress can fund it for example from the 350 billion dollars allocated to state and local governments that amount is less than one percent of the funds that we would be giving to state and local governments a decrease of one percent will not hurt their efforts but a one percent will make a huge difference for communities and families suffering from this pain of addiction i urge this committee to balance the funding better between these two epidemics accepting this amendment will not hold up passage of this bill just think about it 35 for one virus versus three percent for another crisis i don't know about you but i don't know any economist would think that that's a fair tradeoff i yield back

uh mr president i arise today uh really for one reason i rise today make crystal clear that we are profoundly grateful to every american who has answered our nation's call to serve in uniform to risk their lives in too many instances to lay down their lives so that we might remain a free people we are profoundly grateful to their families who have sacrificed so much while their loved ones are away fighting to protect the rest of us and making this a better and more just world and we're especially indebted to those families whose loved ones left for war and never came home it's a sacrifice that many americans can barely imagine but one that has been all too real for millions of families since the founding of our nation madam mr president one of those families was my mother's family never got to meet my mom's younger brother his name was bob kidd patton my mom was a patton and bobby as he was known was the youngest of five children born near coal mining town beckley west virginia to my grandparents ray and effie may patton a gold star mother bobby was killed in action on october 26 1944 during a kamikaze attack in the western pacific on his aircraft carrier the uss sawani among the bodies of the ship's crew who were never recovered was that of our uncle bob on the day of that attack he was get this 19 years six months 23 days old my grandparents were never able to see their son again or say goodbye my sister and i along with our cousins would never meet him neither bob patton or his sowani shipmates who also perished that day were suckers or losers as president trump has characterized others who answered our nation's call to uniform they were and remain heroes i was fortunate enough to make it home after serving three tours in southeast asia during the vietnam war but 58 000 of my brothers and sisters never did their names are inscribed in a black granite wall not far from here so that americans will remember their sacrifice and let me add those 58 000 americans were not suckers or losers either as president trump has described john mccain they were patriots unlike john unlike donald trump they answered the call of duty my squadron and i were deployed to southeast asia as part of the seventh fleet for several of the years that john mccain was held as a prisoner of war in the hanoi hilton along with hundreds of other pows his plane had been shot down in 1967 over hanoi both his arms and one of his legs were broken during the ensuing crash he was taken a prisoner of war for five and a half years john mccain was held captive beaten tortured despite this he refused the early release that was offered to him by his captors far from being the loser that president trump refers to him john mccain was the embodiment of courage and my colleagues know it he proved it again and again and again in uniform and right here in this chamber standing right over there mr president a number of us in this body have been blessed to serve alongside other true patriots both during our time in congress and in uniform the late dan inouye lost an army earned the medal of honor while serving in the legendary 442nd the most decorated army unit of world war ii they're all japanese-americans they were despised by many americans they were heroes too and then there's former senator bob dole another highly decorated world war ii hero who nearly paralyzed lost the arm of use of one arm after being hit by enemy fire while while helping to save the life of a fellow soldier and then there's of course our amazing friend our amazing colleague tammy duckworth god loves her tammy thank you for bring us to this bring us to the floor today but for any american to disparage heroes like them who gave their life and limb of our country would be despicable but to hear that contempt from a man now our commander-in-chief who chose not to serve in the vietnam war allegedly because of bone spurs in his foot is worse than despicable it is abhorrent what is most surprising and really disappointing to me though is not that donald trump would use words like loser and sucker to describe heroes like john mccain and others what is most surprising and disappointing is that there are only democrats on this floor today condemning the utter contempt that donald trump has shown for our service members over too many years there should be 100 senators on this floor today 100 saying in no uncertain terms that we have nothing but respect and admiration for those who have served and we will not allow that allow them to be marked or ridiculed by anyone including the president of the united states honoring those who have served this country and risk their lives for this country is among the most sacred obligations any of us have if we can't stand up and defend those men and women that we have no business being here let me close with this to millions of soldiers sailors airmen and women marines and coast guard members who are risking their lives right now around the world and who have done so for generations listen to this we salute you we thank you we thank your families from the bottom of our hearts god bless you stay home stay safe come home with that i yield the floor mr president

well thank you mr chairman and uh good to be back in the committee in person uh as well as ranking member lada i appreciate you having today's hearing and bringing up uh the piece of legislation that i drafted along with congresswoman eshu and i know she's here as well i want to thank congresswoman essue for partnering with me on this important piece of legislation our bill h.r 3919 which is the securing equipment act stops the threat of china from infiltrating our networks by prohibiting the fcc from issuing equipment licenses to chinese companies that are identified as national security threat not all companies but companies that have made that distinction that the fbi's fcc is now identified as national security threats in 2019 our committee worked in a bipartisan manner to help address the threat of china by passing the secure and trusted communications network act of 2019. that landmark act instructed the fcc to do a few things among those publish a list of telecommunication equipment deemed to be a national security threat prohibit the use of federal funds for purchasing equipment made by those companies authorized funding for u.s carriers to rip and replace equipment that was made by those companies so earlier this year the fcc did what that was they were instructed to do and in fact published this list this is the first list that's come out it lists five different companies that are on this national security threat list every company on this list has ties to the chinese communist party with the chinese government having ownership in many of them clearly you can see why that was a concern that the fcc identified we also know all too well that the ccp wastes no opportunity to expose our vulnerabilities and to undermine our national security while the 2019 law took a major step in getting compromised tech out of u.s networks u.s carriers can still provide privately purchased equipment from these listed companies on the open market so these companies can still sell to american companies where that data can be controlled by the chinese communist party since all of those companies are subject to chinese national security laws at any point the chinese government can choose to exploit them for espionage tapping into their access in u.s networks to gain critical information on individuals and sensitive government information as we expand our 5g networks and heavy data flows and the critical technologies that rely on these networks such as driverless cars and the internet of things any existence of compromised technology poses a grave threat to our national security our bill seeks to further improve on the 2019 law or prohibiting the fcc from issuing any equipment license to these companies our bill adds an extra layer of security and puts a full stop to chinese equipment from these threatening companies that are threats to our network i look forward to having a full markup on this bill and moving it to the floor so we can better protect our networks and i also want to ask mr chairman uh i'll start with you mr johnson as we look at the 2019 law that among other things directed the fcc to create this list which they now have done these companies have have had to do some things that are very very alarming to be included on this national security threat list when you look at this proposed legislation by myself and congressman eschew uh do you think this gives an extra layer of protection to the fcc as we know lawsuits are going to come as lawsuits have come by companies from other protective measures that our committee has passed so that the fcc has the ability to back up their actions to back up this list by then following through and saying you're not going to be able to sell companies that are threats are not going to be able to sell in the united states these uh these jeopardized products thank you congressman i really appreciate that question and i think it's it is uh it has been no the cognitive dissonance uh of of of the ban on huawei and zte uh for subsidized usf uh networks but the legal availability of huawei and zte everywhere else in the in the u.s market has been noted um we see huawei and zte challenging some of those laws as well and a note the fifth circuit i've upheld the dismissal of uh of huawei's suit uh i think last week um so probably on pretty sound legal ground as of now certainly uh uh a statute backing up the fcc's authority would bolster that uh that authority um and especially for something that is such this is a very profound uh power that the fcc would have through this i love all my on my friends in the equipment authorization world but it's somewhat obscure radio frequency interference based uh administrative law process and so the power for the fcc to be able to block major companies all together from the market is profound and uh and i think that underscores the importance of having fulsome processes from elsewhere in the government that feed into those designations as has happened with the five companies uh that are that they're mentioned first in in the in the ndaa thanks i know what gentleman's expired hopefully by passing the securing equipment act we can address this problem and others and again thank you mr chairman for allowing us to come up yield back

the veterans who served offshore during the Vietnam War could have been exposed to Agent Orange but the current Veterans Administration policy does not offer any help but as our Andy Logano reports tonight a new proposed bill could bring benefits to those veterans Tuesday night the US House of Representatives approved a proposed HR 299 that's a bill that provides benefits for those Navy veterans who served offshore during the Vietnam War and could have been exposed to Agent Orange that's a herbicide used by the US military during the Vietnam War advocates of HR 299 have argued that veterans who served offshore were susceptible to Agent Orange due to runoff into water that veterans on offshore carriers used for basic needs like drinking bathing and cooking district 27 Representative Michael cloud co-sponsored this bill up until now only only those who've served on land have been automatically eligible to receive care and so with the blue water bill does is a extends that to those who serve in the region just offshore many of them drank the water that had the runoff or have handled it on the ships so who exactly would be eligible for these benefits well first of all veterans who served no more than 12 nautical miles from the shores of Vietnam between January 952 through May 7th of 75 and veterans who served in or near the Korean Demilitarized Zone between September 1st of 67 through August 31st of 71 children of veterans who served in Nam from January of 62 to May of 75 and suffer from spina bifida veterans must prove they have experienced one of the diseases resulting from Agent Orange and they have to be able to list where they served Angeles Connell Action 10 News and a footnote here HR 299 is not law yet the House voted on it last night but it still has to go before the Senate however once they pass it president Trump has to sign it before benefits would be extended beginning January 1st 2020 coming up the new heart

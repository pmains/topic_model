thank you Karine Uh Kevin McCarthy says that he invited President Biden down to the Border how does the president RSVP [Laughter] two we know we know the president's never been down to the border the possible next speaker says that he wants him to go with him so is he going to so look uh he's been there he's been to the Border uh and since he took office when did he go to the board since he took office the President Biden has been taking action to fix our immigration system and secure our border and that's why on day one he put forward an immigration immigration reform a piece of legislation to deal with what is currently happening at the border does President Biden want more migrants to come to Delaware I don't even understand that question but I'll move on she doesn't understand that's a theme with Kareem Jean-Pierre in the Biden White House as a whole so let me help her out according to analysis from the Federation of American Immigration Reform since Biden took office over 5.5 million illegals have crossed our border including countless felons and dozens of people on the terror watch list so yeah it's a big problem and someone needs to tackle it but will the new GOP House Majority be up to the task joining me now is Florida congresswoman Kat kamek congresswoman thank you so much for being with me and you know just going back to that lovely sound bite there I don't know how that she can stand there and just lie as we all know Joe Biden has not been to the Border he has no plans to go to the border and to me that's really a dereliction of Duty that he refuses to go to our border as a sitting congresswoman what do you think about that from our president oh my gosh well I mean that sound clip that y'all just played I don't think I've ever heard a bigger load of crap from one person I mean totally divorced from reality and she just can't seem to get out of her own way no Joe Biden has not been to the border and let's be clear he is not the commander-in-chief he is the trafficker in Chief and that's evidenced by the fact to your point that we have over five and a half million illegals who have come across the border and what my orcas has continually pushed back and saying oh those are just encounters and repeat encounters no that's nonsense the data from their own Department shows that we have a crisis on our hands and so not only are we seeing the facilitation of trafficking of children and women by the by an Administration but our national security has been at risk since oh Biden took office and they have no desire whatsoever to even address it in a policy format or even go give it lip service at the border it's ridiculous it's dangerous and we are going to pay the price sport every single day until that border is secured oh we certainly are and we're already paying a hefty price for it and that 5.5 million that's the ones that they've actually been able to counter to estimate that doesn't include all the gotaways God knows how many are of those are in our country and that puts a lot of stress on our infrastructure our Police Department our schools I mean even if these people are just good people coming to the United States to work which is a noble reason to come you know they're still stressing everything that we have in this country and it's unfair to Americans who are paying taxes and working hard every day and they deserve to know how many legal immigrants are in this country but I wonder with Kevin McCarthy saying that impeaching mayorcas is is coming down the pike what do we think that's going to do and do we think it's going to be successful what have you heard and what is the plan well I think it's important one that we show that we're serious about accountability I can't tell you how many politicians have given lip service to oh we're going to hold them accountable we're going to drain the swamp well we're actually at that point where it's time to put up or shut up and so we have to go through the investigative process I can tell you firsthand I serve on the house Homeland Security committee and Alejandro mayorkas has lied to my face six times so he needs to be held accountable just for lying to Congress alone then you factor in the 98 individuals on the international terrorist watch list over 600 000 got aways just this year the the countless women and children who have been raped and assaulted on my desk I have a a jar of wristbands thousands of wristbands that are used by the cartels to put on humans and treat them like cattle we are seeing the trafficking of people at our Southwest border then you take it one step further you have all these folks that are actively seeking to get away from border patrol agents they're not not trying to be apprehended which means they are either violent criminals gang members or they are peddling drugs or other bad uh you know anything like a bomb or uh anything that is a risk to National Security when you have fentanyl as the number one killer of people between the ages of 18 and 45 it's not climate change it's not coveted it is fentanyl and that is all coming from the Southwest border yeah someone needs to be held accountable so that investigation is going to go through the process we're going to put it all on the table because I think the American people particularly Democrats need to understand just how dangerous this game is that they're playing and then when we remove him whoever steps up they're put on notice immediately that we will not tolerate the line the deception the negligence we will not tolerate the abuse that our border patrol agents have endured under this regime that is why it's so important that we go through the process of investigating and then ultimately in teaching we have such an issue at our Southern border and what I can't figure out is how that issue didn't sway more midterm voters because it's a big issue our border is as bad as it has ever been the Democrats have no plan to secure it they don't even want to see it you know I think the one of the only successful leaders to really Hammer home the point of how important the border is of course Donald Trump and then a lot of Republicans followed his lead as you are doing but I wonder do the American people at large not care that our border is being invaded we know that hardcore Republicans do but the independence the fence Riders out there do you think that they're just not realizing how bad the situation is where are we losing these people you know it's a great point because like you I was hoping that the Border issue would move more people into getting out and voting during the midterms but the thing that I have really discovered over the last two years is until you make it a kitchen table issue for everyday Americans and Ohio New York Wisconsin Michigan if you don't make it an issue that's real to them then they're not going to care because we as a as a species we are very self-involved we think that we're the most important people on the planet and we have jobs and families and all these things going on so while we absolutely I think care about our national security As Americans I think it has to really hit you home so for the parents that I've had the opportunity to meet that have lost their children to fentanyl poisoning to the families that are now angel families because they have lost loved ones at the hands of illegals who are in our country committing crimes and continue to evade Justice uh for those people it's a real issue but the thing that I think is going to really drive it home is when we can put put the kitchen table issue in the Border as one that's why I was so passionate about the baby formula issue you know we turned baby formula into a baseball bat when you've got moms and dads struggling to find basic necessities formula especially specialty formula for their kids that is a real panic and then they see the videos that we posted of baby formula being stopped at the border that hits home we need to be exposing this over and over and over again particularly as we're facing this economic crisis 40-year High inflation unemployment starting to go up all these issues people are starting to feel the squeeze why don't you show them the warehouses that are stocked full of clothing and items and toys where everyday Americans are going without that's going to hit home much greater than any data or number of Statistics that we can throw at them oh I agree with you and another thing bringing up our national security not just those individuals that are coming into our country whether they're apprehended on the watch list or whether they're coming through as gotaways and we have no idea who they are and what they're doing here another issue that's been brought to our attention over the last several weeks is Air Marshals that are now instead of being on our flights they're now being sent to the border to essentially be Babysitters a job that they are not trained for a job that is not their Duty so this is going to be a whole other can of worms for the American people and until something horrible happens I don't think they're going to realize it but I really hope it doesn't come to that no it's absolutely insane the fact that they have an all call out for volunteers not just across Homeland Security but across the dod that you can come down and volunteer for three weeks since and process paperwork oh and you can also run errands and go pick up prescriptions for illegals give me a break this is absolutely a slap in the face to every single man and woman who has actually taken the oath they've gone through the process you become an agent to become an air marshal and really what are they what are they going to fight for there's not a policy that the bite Administration is allowing them to uphold and when I talk to these agents and it's virtually every day I hear from these Agents from their families they say the the technology will be great the the resource will be great the more manpower that'll be great but the thing that we need most is a policy give us a policy that allows us to do our damn jobs that's what we need to do at the end of the day and I just I I can't say enough about why we need to keep hammering this issue you know we are in a position in the Tucson sector for example instead of sending more manpower they're pulling people off the line and they're processing and babysitting Tucson has more gotaways which are the violent criminals people with drugs than any other sector it makes absolutely no sense and we have to step back and say this isn't a Republican or a Democrat issue this is an American issue and it's time to give a damn because a lot is on the line and it's only going to take one dirty bomb one terrorist that comes in illegally and destroys people's lives and communities you know we hear a lot about Arizona and Texas of course with our border issue we don't hear as much about California and that's because large portions of our California border have fencing and double wall so that is a big deterrent and it allows the agents to really double their Force there because they do have those physical barriers just another Testament to Donald Trump's old adage of build the freaking wall the last thing I want to ask you about is other GOP house priorities you know there's been a lot of talk about investigations and I got to be honest with you I go both ways on that one part of me says we need to investigate Hunter bind we need to investigate the origins of covid we need to investigate fauci all those things we deserve answers for we deserve answers about big Tech collusion but then the other part of Migos do we need to pay more attention to inflation and the border is that where the priority needs to be or can we do both at the same time you're the best person to ask what do you think I think we can walk and chew gum at the same time I mean and we have to we're kidding ourselves if we think that just doing investigations is going to prove that we deserve to lead it's absolutely a key part of our job as members of Congress we have the oversight requirements of our daily job but we also have to legislate and that means we've got to fire the 87 000 IRS agents we've got to get our economy back on track we've got to support our local law enforcement we've got to get rid of these liberal DA's we have got to restore the Constitutional freedoms that the Dems have been chipping away at for years if we don't show that we can legislate and hold people accountable at the same time we're not going to win elections because then at that point we're governing for one party rather than for all Americans and at the end of the day going into the 24 election people are going to say is my life better or worse now that Republicans have the house and I am hoping and I'm going to work my ass off every single day to make sure that they say you know what it's better they brought down the price of gas they got things back on track I'm not feeling the squeeze the way that I was they're actually holding people accountable and doing what they said they were going to do that's what it's going to take but we have got to stop the circus of thinking that we can only do one thing at a time and if we ignore the rest it's at our own Peril no it certainly is and I'm glad that you said that because I know that there are a lot of Voters who did vote Republican maybe for the first time because of the bite Administration and the buyer's remorse they had with voting and Democrats in 2020 so we have to show them that even though we just have a majority in that one chamber that you guys can get to work and you can do something if not anything else just stop some of the horrible tyrannical communist BS that this administration's administration's been pulling for the last couple of years congresswoman thank you so much for everything that you're doing for keeping the heat on the border and other issues that are so important to Americans and we hope to have you back anytime hey thanks so much Tommy congratulations on the nuptials again thank you so much [Music]

mr. chairman and miss McCabe in terms of complexity the rules contain hundreds of pages regarding variations in state plans and emissions trading the for example you could turn to page 65 of the proposed federal plan / model trading rule beginning at the top of the page EPA states and I quote in the final emissions guidelines the EPA also discussed the concern that co2 emissions reductions would be eroded in situations for an effective dgu in a rate based eight counts the megawatt hours for measures located in a mass bay state but the generation from that major act solely to serve load in the massbay state in that scenario expected co2 emissions reduction actions in the rate based state or foregone as a result of countering of counting megawatt hours that resulted in co2 emissions reductions and a mass bay state can you decipher that for me III think you're reflecting that there is some complexity in this rule it's partly because of the choices and the flexibility that that we provided in response to people's requests on it but that's reflecting particular situations where states have been asking how do we deal with one another because power does flow across state borders well what what does that have to do with standards a performance of a power plant I mean how does that relate the state's trying to work together what how does this relate it's all about it's all about the flexibility and it's a reflection that the power sector works as an integrated system and so a system that demanded that each individual unit meet a specific rate would be more costly would be more difficult would would have more of a liability implications than a system that that affords a lot of flexibility across the system in recognizing the way it actually works okay I've got another question here and this has been reflected today by other members that have used coal to supply a lot of their electricity but in my home state Missouri we rely on coal for eighty-three percent of our energy generation and I know that's not true in the east coast in the west coast but in Missouri it is and that's what the folks I represent are concerned about the clean power plan places a huge burden on coal-fired power plants and this rule also restricts and I don't understand this the construction of new natural gas plants as a compliance major could you explain to me why the EPA restricts the construction of natural gas-fired power plants as a compliance major so so new generation to meet new load is subject to its own set of rules this particular rule which which addresses existing facilities is intended to manage that existing fleet of power plants and bring those emissions down so so there's some provisions in there too to make sure that that that's what the rule is focused on and those plans are actually delivering the reductions from that existing fleet I still don't understand the restriction on new construction of natural gas-fired plans well we'd be happy to follow up with you or your staff and walk through it a little bit in more detail congressman okay my staff's here today so if we can do that I'd be greatly appreciated and the final rules interim and final goals for Missouri are even more stringent than the proposed rules what factors to the EPA consider when reaching this adjustment so in the final rule there was there was a just meant across the board across all states and some of the state's targets went up and some of them went down it's a reflection of a couple of things one is that as I mentioned earlier today in the final rule we set a uniform emission rate for all coal plants across the country that's not the way the proposal was designed and another key feature was information that we got from commenters from states and utilities and others really suggesting that the appropriate way to look at this was on a regional basis because that's the way the power system worked so so when you when you look at it across a regional basis States have and utilities in those states have more opportunities to invest in renewables and cleaner energy than if they were restricted to looking within their state borders which is an artificial boundary when it comes to the way the industry works okay so we end up with more stringent rules in flyover country so we're used to that mr. Chairman I yield back thing tear this town recognized

and nancy mace who's part of the new conservative climate caucus um nancy what what do you make of the politics of this it seems to me that the democrats have just run away with this they've defined the issue um and the and the republicans have been slow to push back back but it seems to me that that's changing now and you're part of the change right and democrats do a very good job of pulling on the emotional heartstrings of everyday americans and they use extremism and scare tactics and i want to add one more note to your monologue which is great i couldn't have said it better myself but it was president trump that in his last few months of his presidency he banned drilling off the coast of south carolina georgia and florida because that's what the states demanded and wanted and he did it it's republicans that are finding ways to be innovative here and look you know private innovation in the environment today we saw a private citizen go to space and if we allow businesses to be innovative we can do the same thing find the same kind of solutions um for the environment as well so tell us a bit about what you're hoping to achieve with the with the climate caucus what are the kinds of things we we might expect there well we want we might expect republicans to have a larger stronger voice on the environment there are a lot of young republicans that vote on this issue they care about this issue i represent the coast of south carolina as do many republicans and our entire economy rests on a beautiful pristine and clean environment our economy is tourism and hospitality and so our lifestyle demands it if we want to be successful but having a stronger voice on the republican side bringing free market solutions recognizing that over regulation has actually hurt the environment as you stated earlier in your monologue places like new york or california where they have over-regulated oil and gas they have they have to import it from other countries and in new york they're getting it from russia not an ally of the united states it does it's mind-boggling how dumb some of these regulations are and it's bad for the environment exactly that's what i think we've got to you know not just set out the the argument the positive argument as you've been doing but to really call them out for this madness and how can they call themselves um the party of climate fighting climate change and carbon emissions when they're when they're literally shutting down nuclear power which as i said is the most reliable carbon free energy source we have yeah it's the cleanest and it's not like the november elections team was a mandate on the green new deal and they've been trying to shove the green new deal and every single single spending package that the biden administration has had to pass or get through congress i mean it's insane what they're trying to do right now on every level but most americans they want common sense pragmatic solutions that just make sense to their wallets their environment and their businesses and we can see innovation when we lower taxes businesses in the private sector have the ability the money and the resources to invest in pro-environment policy exactly well i'm so pleased you're out there putting this message out and developing that agenda i think it's as you say it's going to be increasingly important and it's a real political opportunity as well congresswoman nancy mays thank you so much

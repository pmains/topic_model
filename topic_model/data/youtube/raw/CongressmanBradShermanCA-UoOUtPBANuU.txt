Thank You mr. chairman I'm told that the Ambassador from Bangladesh is here thank you sir for being here but more importantly thank you for what's your country one of the poorest countries in the world is doing to take care of hundreds of thousands of refugees I'd also like to introduce the ambassador of Burma but unfortunately I can't because that ambassador is not here if that ambassador were here that ambassador could find out what the world thinks of the policy of the Burmese government toward hundreds of thousands of its own citizens a humanitarian tragedy is unfolding in Burma which is also referred to as Maya and Mar the Burma's military that taught Mahad taught madhai moved against the Rohingya population after an August 25th attack by Roe hanga militants on Burmese security forces and nearly half a million Rohingya Muslim refugees have fled their homeland in the rockiness state following Burmese military operations against them the UN High Commission for Human Rights noted that this situation seems to be a textbook example of ethnic cleansing late last year something similar occurred on a smaller scale when an estimated 60,000 and 90,000 rangas fled to Bangladesh as a result of Burmese military operations that have followed on October 2016 running a militant attack on border police the vast majority of those who fled to bling Gladish which is point as I pointed out already impoverished and overcrowded though the so the vast majority have fled there or roughly 40,000 fled in to India unfortunately media reports indicate that India's Border Security Force are attempting to prevent ranga from entering india through bangladesh amidst the ongoing exodus from burma including the reported use of stun guns and pepper grenades however I should point out that the international law is different for Bangladesh which is the first resting place of those fleeing once the people are in Bangladesh they're not being oppressed although they are not economically viable at the present time and so whether India has an obligation to accept them from Bangladesh is a subject that perhaps our witnesses can get into the United States has led an international response to protect them we've led the international response to protect Muslims in Kosovo and in Bosnia against serb aggression we need to play a role along with others in brick protecting the Rohingya and dealing with the humanitarian needs and we also need to make sure that the Muslim world realizes that we are the only country to bomb a a Christian nation Serbia for the defence of Muslims something that is not widely focused on in the Muslim world the administration should work to ensure that the physical needs of hundreds of thousands of refugees are provided for secure a halt to Burmese military operations against the Rohingya secure a safe return of the Rohingya population back to Burma demand that Burma in decades of discrimination against the Rohingya including addressing cases of appropriated land citizenship rights political representation the lack of free movement and economic improvements this is especially necessary is citizenship rights the idea that a people could live in a country generation after generation and still be called foreigners under that country's laws is simply outrageous we are to urge the United Nations Security Council to establish a UN Security Council probe Commission on Burmese ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya and urge the United Nations Security Council to establish a UN monitored safe zone for the Rohingya in Rakhine State to protect it from future mass killings the Burmese government says it will allow the return of these refugees catch-22 when they provide proof of nationality but since 1982 the Burmese government has stripped thorough hanga of their citizenship making it impossible for them to prove Burmese nationality this is outrageous every group of people on the earth has emigrated to where they live from somewhere else since we all came from apparently Eastern Africa and to say that you are not a citizen of a country because you cannot prove that your most ancient ancestors were born there would make us all citizens perhaps of Ethiopia and no citizens of any other country in the world it is say that just to show how absurd the position is to deny citizenship for people not only born in a country but whose parents and even grandparents were born in that country the United States who was closely involved in bringing democracy to Burma a process that included elections in 2010 and 2015 the release of political prisoners the formation of a civilian government and the lifting of UN sanctions the United States should also take the lead and upholding democratic practices and democracy goes with fair treatment of minorities and a protection of minorities it must press the Burmese government and military operations against the Rohingya accept the refugees back and grant them citizenship I think they're already legally citizens get recognized that citizenship and a in September of last year I along with other members of this subcommittee met with Ang's on su Qi as the former administration decided to lift a number of economic sanctions on Burma it's clear after the mass massacres and cleansing of October 2016 and the recent actions that we need to reevaluate that policy last week the State Department as the u.s. is providing an additional 32 million in humanitarian assistance I look forward to hearing from our witnesses whether that's sufficient and I yield back I thank the ranking

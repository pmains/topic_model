Wells Fargo's new CEO Charlie Sharpe he's on the hot seat yesterday admitting before Congress that the Bank engaged in deeply disturbing conduct he said under his leadership the company needs to run fundamentally different the Bank under fire since the scandal involving fake accounts joining us right now is Texas congressman member of the House Financial Services Committee lads good and who was at the hearing good to see you congressman thanks for being here good morning tell us about that hearing and and and how you see this unfolding well you know Democrats hate Wells Fargo they have for a while chairwoman waters called several years ago for Wells Fargo to be broken up they had their CEO Tim Sloan come in last year before our committee he did not do a very convincing job resigned soon thereafter and Charles Scharf has come in and he testified before I come into yesterday I was very impressed with him I think Wells Fargo is headed in the right direction I think it will be difficult for Democrats to ever give them any credit if they do turn things around but I believe after yesterday that things are moving in the right direction the CEO admitted that things were bad that they had been dishonest with the American people with their customers but it seems as if the ship is being righted and they're moving in the right direction Congressman Steve Forbes here what's the mood is still an anti bank mood in Congress because we're coming to a point in the crisis we're going to be putting pressure on the banks to help out to struggling industry struggling individuals what's the state of the psychology right now well you know before the last few weeks when all this coronavirus really got bad I think there was more of an anti Bank mood at least among Democrats in our committee one of the points that I made yesterday in my conversations with the CEO were that these problems were limited to Wells Fargo they're not problems that all big banks in the United States are facing and I think Democrats were a little less hard on big banks as a whole than perhaps they would have been because they know that big banks can really make or break their customers in these months ahead yeah and banks cooperating and the big banks meeting at the White House this morning I want to ask you about this negotiating going on with Congress ways to bolster the US economy paychecks amid the corona virus outbreak Treasury Secretary Stevie minuchin met with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi yesterday characterizing the meeting as more of a discussion than a negotiation and then there was National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow commenting on the president's proposed payroll tax he says it's a bold move but let's listen to what Kudlow said watch this I think there'll be a big a big growth payoff I think it'll help deal with whatever challenges occur in the next few months I think beyond that ameliorating the tax burden on the middle class the so-called blue-collar boom that I talked quite a bit about that's what this is aim for that's really what the payroll tax is principally about so what do you think I know you've raised concern for Americans who can't work from home like truck drivers farmers ranchers maybe they won't get impacted by this what kind of stimulus is needed right now well you know I spoke with Steve anujan last night I saw him at dinner he had a great meeting with Speaker Pelosi she I may get in trouble for saying this but she likes him she likes dealing with him and the president trusts him and I feel as if they will come to an agreement I'm hearing from Democrats a willingness to work with Republicans that I haven't heard before speaker Pelosi said yesterday that she has no intentions to shut down the house and cancel votes in the coming weeks which i think is important I think it sends a good message to the American people that their Congress is at work it's something I agree with her on of course her motivations are perhaps a little different as well she doesn't want to leave town and leave the White House in charge of everything without her here but I think you'll see in the coming days some meaningful talk about perhaps the stimulus perhaps a payroll tax cut Democrats want child care things that perhaps are going to be a little more Democrat minded in the coming days use this opportunity to just start adding stuff on this like a Christmas tree light it up with all this extra stuff if you're just trying to stimulate the economy at a very important critical time you you and I both know that I think Democrats will learn that but we're about to leave town for ten days after Thursday this week so March 23rd is the next week that Congress everyone is back in session I think over the next 10 days is when the meaningful discussions will really take place then if the 23rd will get something done I'm sure we'll be looking at it and watching thank you so much for joining us for tea Lance good and joining us there

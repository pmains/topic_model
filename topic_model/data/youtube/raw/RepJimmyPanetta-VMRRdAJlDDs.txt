madam Speaker I rise today to express my continued disappointment with president Trump's anti-immigrant stance especially based on his joint session remarks last night I admit I was very honored to attend my first joint session as a Congress member but as a Congress member as an American and as a grandson of an Italian immigrant I was disheartened that the president doubled down on his divisive and dangerous rhetoric against immigrants and continued to create fear by focusing on the worst of people before I came to Congress I was a prosecutor and I understand and believe that those who commit serious and violent felonies should be prosecuted and deported but I also grew up on the Central Coast of California and I realize and I appreciate how much immigrants contribute to our community that is why I want to ask president Trump to come down from his gold tower to come out of the White House and come to the green and fertile Salinas san juan and pajaro Valerie valleys he will see that immigrants are the reason why my district is called the salad bowl of the world he will see that immigrants are the cornerstone are the foundation not only of that economy the community but of our country Thank You Jay

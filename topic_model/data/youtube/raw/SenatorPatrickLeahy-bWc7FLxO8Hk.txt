thank you for inviting me to speak with you today let me offer congratulations on 12 years of organizing advocacy as members of the Professional Firefighters of Vermont let me thank all of you for the extraordinary service you provided our communities throughout Vermont you know not a day goes by when we do not call upon brave first responders like you to put your lives on the line to help others in need often total strangers to and the lifelong bond with first responders that I was able to form back when I was a prosecutor in Vermont continues to inform my work at United States Senate and what you taught me then we'll always stay with me since state and local first responders are full partners in preventing investigative responding to emergency situations of all kinds you need and deserve the full support of the federal government to meet these national security responsibilities I know that and that's why I fight for you in the Senate I continue working to protect and strengthen programs that you and I both recognized as high priorities like the fire at Gran's with the safer grant state Homeland Security grants the public safety officers benefits program these are important federal programs but you know what they've made our neighborhood safer they made our communities better prepared but mostly I hope that they'll make your jobs easier our task is much more difficult during these trying budget times but without the continued support I've had from all of you on many of these legislative initiatives few of them would ever become law they wouldn't get the critical funding they need your organization has made great progress raising the profile of your profession by highlighting the important role the firefighters playing their communities each and every day and you could take a huge amount of credit for that now I promise to continue to fight on your behalf and those issues are important to you because you make a real difference in the lives of so many people every day so thank you again for all your good work and your dedication and your service your true professionals and true heroes this / monitor thanks you

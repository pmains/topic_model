i come to the floor today to discuss the crisis that's hitting all americans it's a crisis caused by the democrats it's a crisis of inflation and a crisis of the recession which we're living now right now it looks like democrats want to take a victory lap i've heard the president give his speeches and he seems to want to do this because the democrats have passed one of the largest tax and spend bills in the history of the country and they crammed it through congress in just a matter of days it's partisan it was a liberal wish list and for some it seemed like it was a green-haired liberal's dream come true the bill includes hundreds of billions of dollars for the radical climate agenda that so many of the democrats have been talking about they're going to double the size of the internal revenue service audits will be up it's going to raise taxes on the middle class by tens and tens of billions of dollars now democrats of course passed this bill on a party-line vote not a single republican voted for it in the house or in the senate joe biden signed it into law ever since then the liberals in the press have been singing joe biden's praises and yet here's a recent headline that i saw from nbc news it said democrats reluctant to campaign with biden reluctant to campaign with biden and then the headline goes on despite the recent winning streak winning streak there's nothing winning about this this is a losing streak hitting the american people all of this democrat celebration just shows how out of touch today's democrat party really is working families aren't celebrating right now no they're struggling struggling in this age of inflation economic crisis here's the reality we're in a recession just last week the government confirmed the economy has now shrunk for six months in a row it's been the definition of a recession for decade upon decade no matter what the white house wants to say about how they want to redefine recession inflation remains at a 40 year high people can't keep up they're falling behind just this morning a new gallup poll came out and what did it show today's gallup poll showed a majority of americans saying inflation is causing them personally them financial hardship who's struggling that's who's hurting most american families trying to make ends meet for low-income americans according to this poll by cal about today three out of four are facing financial hardship from the inflation that has been brought on to this country by the democrats reckless spending for the middle class it's two-thirds two out of three members of the middle class so the american people aren't celebrating now they're having to cut back on their spending because they can't afford to keep up and they're falling further and further behind so it's astonishing that democrats think they're on a winning streak it's fascinating to watch joe biden and democrats pat themselves on the back because gas prices are now a dollar and a half more a gallon than they were the day joe biden took office some places they're less than four dollars a gallon but not in nevada and washington state just to name a few no celebrating in my opinion when gas prices are a dollar fifty a gallon more today than they were the day joe biden took office and then a day after saudi arabia announces that they're going to cut back on production of oil even though joe biden went hat in hand on bended knee and said please saudi arabia produce more oil and sell it to the united states because even though we have it here we're not going to let the american people get it out of the ground democrats haven't lifted a finger to produce one more drop of american oil or american energy supplies down from the pre-pandemic peak prices are down right now a little because demand is down because people can't afford to drive at the high prices that gasoline went up to because of joe biden's policies and the democrats commitment to keeping the oil in the ground the american people are driving less than the summer of 2022 than they were in the summer of 2020 and that was the year of the pandemic when the country was in a shutdown that's what really high prices of energy will do in terms of demand to using oil increasingly people not only can't leave home because of the cost of gas they can't afford to stay home either can't afford to heat their home or cool their home half of american homes are powered by natural gas but biden's position is keep that gas in the ground right now 20 million americans have fallen behind on paying their electric bills that's a record and totally american people owe more than 16 billion dollars in unpaid electric bills it's double the amount before the pandemic and 20 million people may be facing what's been described as a tsunumi of shutoffs it's all because of democrats out of touch policies at the grocery store prices are up 13 cents on the dollar in the last 12 months that means a hundred dollar grocery bill last year would be 113 dollars this year's at the grocery store woman had two bags and she said does this look like a hundred dollars worth of groceries week after week this adds up this is the fastest increase in grocery prices in 43 years we're talking about meat and milk and eggs and vegetables talking about fruit things people buy when they go to the grocery store higher costs for gas and groceries steadily eating away the finances of the american people total prices have gone up more than 12 percent since joe biden took office and last week we learned that prices have increased faster than wages what people have to pay going up faster than what people are earning for 16 months in a row as a result the american family today can afford a lot less than they could the day joe biden took office wages can't keep up so people are turning to their savings and today one out of three americans has taken an average of 600 out of their savings this year just to pay the bills to keep up just so they don't stall further behind household debt has never been higher than it is right now and it's only going up half of american families say expect to add even more to their debt by the end of the year so what are democrats offering working families people who are out there struggling trying to get by well the secretary of energy has this to offer she says hey a 30 discount on solar panels under the new spending bill the taxpayer will pay for 30 percent of the cost of those new solar panels taxpayers across the country for people who want to get the 30 percent discount people can't afford basic groceries like milk and eggs right now let alone solar panels does secretary granholm really think middle class families are running out to buy solar panels not a chance they're not the american people are saying to the climate extremists thanks but no thanks democrats inflation is not going away anytime soon the effects are going to be with us for a long long time and the american people know it that's why they think the country is heading in the wrong direction may actually we may see inflation getting worse that's because democrats have now poured jet fuel in the fire of inflation they did it twice this past month first they passed this incredibly expensive spending bill then a few days later joe biden announced a very unfair 500 billion dollar taxpayer-funded handout to people with college loans it's a one-two punch to families who work pay their taxes and pay their bills when they sign their name to a loan expect to pay it back it's not what we're getting with joe biden no we're getting is in actions that are going to cause more inflation according to the wharton school of business and their budget model democrat spending bill is going to increase inflation not just for a week not just for a month not just for a year but for at least two years and that's something apparently joe biden is proud of even the democratic economists admit the student loan giveaway is going to increase inflation so let's name names former obama economic adviser jason furman called this gasoline on the inflationary fire that is already burning this is obama's economic advisor called it reckless former obama and clinton economic adviser larry summers said student loan debt relief increases inflation it will also tend to raise tuition raise tuition is that what the democrats are for hey let's raise tuition we're for that that's what larry summers is going to happen as a result of these positions by the democrats in this chamber and in the white house joe biden continues to make life more expensive more unaffordable and more painful for american families to bring down costs republicans propose doing the exact opposite of what the democrats are doing today we need to produce more and spend less we need to produce more lots of things energy is part of it we need to unleash american energy we need to lower costs all across the country by producing more american energy right here in the united states not going hand in hand to saudi arabia not going hat in hand as joe biden did just a year ago to russia to vladimir putin's russia just a year ago joe biden was saying please send us more oil oh and he wants the same from iran and venezuela we have it here in the united states we need to unleash it for the last 20 months democrats have waged an all-out war against american energy we need more energy not less what we need less of is less washington red tape so far joe biden has issued more than 200 billion dollars in punishing regulations in just 20 months makes it more expensive to create jobs here at home finally we need to stop this reckless washington spending the biden inflation crisis started the month after democrats passed their first spending bill the first spending bill added two trillion dollars to the debt the college loan giveaway another half trillion it's all going to make inflation worse and people at home are furious so despite what the liberal pundits may say democrats have nothing to celebrate a poll from writers last week showed joe biden still has an approval rating below 40 percent three out of four americans say this country is on the wrong track under joe biden and the democrats according to one poll a full majority of americans say america's best days are behind us it's a record record high people think the best days are behind us america is in a crisis right now from our economy to our border to crime in our communities joe biden's liberal policies have failed working families across america so i disagree with those who say our best days are behind us i believe the best days for america are always ahead of us it is the control of washington that needs to be put behind us you know joe biden gave a political speech the other day flanked by marines in philadelphia he told the american public it was a policy speech it was not he intentionally misled the american people and tried to lie to the american people because if it had been a policy speech he would have actually addressed the issues that are keeping americans awake at night the issues that they care about the pain that they're suffering he never mentioned once the word prices inflation gas the border crime cartel fentanyl or dead never mention those no the president closed his eyes to all of those things that he's done that is causing massive pain to the american people but he looked down the nose his nose at tens and tens of millions americans who are struggling to get by in the american economy that this president and the democrats have intentionally undermined mr president i yield the floor

senator what do you think of some of these picks would they pass muster with you well you know we've had a democrat at the helm at the treasury for four years anyway so i'm not sure that'll make much difference um you know if the standard is whether or not you spend money like a drunken sailor we've been doing that anyway so i'm not sure that uh yelling could be much worse but i would say that uh with regard to foreign policy that would be steve you're not a fan of his leadership of the treasury i i see him as trying to shovel money out the door and just give away free money to people and that's not a conservative notion that's a democrat notion i think he is a democrat with the blessing of the president right he wouldn't do anything the president didn't want to do my comments directed specifically towards him in his negotiations with pelosi but i would say that on foreign policy i am very worried about that there will be a big shift and it's back to those who believe that we should militarily intervene abroad in a big way you have neoconservatives on the right who want to intervene for geopolitical reasons but then you have liberals like blinken and samantha powers and others who want to intervene for humanitarian reasons but nevertheless they want to send our armies and our young men and women around the world and i think lincoln's a bad choice uh i'm going to ask him if he's going to apologize for his support of the iraq war and what lessons he learned from it whether he still believes regime change in the middle east is a good idea which it was not a good idea it was not a good idea in libya either or in syria and i don't think biden or blinken have really fully understood that and i actually do think president trump really did get that that regime change in the middle east hasn't made us stronger senator um john kerry is going to be like a climate change czar envoy i don't know how you describe it but it comes with cabinet level status and i'm just wondering does it also come with it approval in the united states senate you know i'm not really in favor of czars or aristocracy so i hope we don't call it czar i think they were calling him envoy in the paper today um i think it's worth having a discussion about approval do you know if it means said approval because i'm showing my ignorance here i don't know if it does i know the constitution doesn't refer to czar so i don't know uh on some of the envoys they do have to be approved and some don't so um i think a lot of the special envoys don't have to be approved like when you send them to certain nations they're not approved so i'm not sure if it will be or won't be but the main thing is we shouldn't have anybody directing policy creating policy or creating rules we have to live by who's not been elected or approved by the senate so really most things that are involve legislation or legislative ideas that are being put forward they really need to be legislation and not done by uh individuals senator uh as you know the gsa has given the go ahead here to get the transition process going that probably could not have happened without donald trump's blessing which seems to be greasing the skids for joe biden uh and abiding presidency beginning on january 20th you had said uh that the vast majority of voting though must still be done in person to mitigate the potential for fraud in the future so are you saying here that the issues the president raised were legitimate and they did tip the election in joe biden's favor and that the president was robbed of victory because of it i think if we put our heads in the sand and say oh no big deal this was like any other election we're not being honest and we're not being uh good at pouring over the details to get to the truth in every election we've ever held in this country really literally every election 99 of the votes or more have been cast in person they're pretty easy to verify that the person showing up is voting you have a republican and democrat sitting at the desk no one can sort of stuff the ballot or it's much more difficult to do when they're written and sent in there is much more potential for fraud i'm concerned about what professor williams has looked at professor miller from williams college has looked at where they did a random sampling of 2600 republicans and what they found is that a significant percentage of them said they did not request a ballot and yet somebody counted a vote for them and another significant percentage said they did request a vote they did vote but their vote was counted for someone else so i think there is a something that has to be looked at because if you extrapolate his numbers he says as much as a hundred thousand ballots could have been counted incorrectly either through fraud or error and that ought to be looked at we had millions of ballots we've never had millions of absentee ballots and it is a mistake just to slough over this i don't know what the conclusion would be but i think people who say there's no evidence there are being biased in the sense that they don't want to look to see if there is evidence there so some of your colleagues who were pressing moving chris christie and others who have been saying uh it's time to move on mr president are you in their camp or or do you think you should still fight this i'm in the camp if we push this under the rug we'll never know about this election but we also will in the future have elections just like this where the lack of legitimacy will trouble half of the country or more i'm worried about the election january 5th in georgia i think that you have to see now they're saying we can't even check absentee votes because they throw away all the envelopes i think they're saying that in pennsylvania in michigan so they've separated evidence of whether the vote is valid by throwing away the contents if it doesn't have a postmark on it how did it get there that would make you question that it came from somebody's uh you know lock box or or somebody's storage unit but if there's no postmark or signature the signatures apparently on another document so if we can't check all of those things how can we check for the validity of things it's why we need to have in-person voting you can have early voting but it needs to be in person look when i voted here in bowling green we had a big huge gymnasium i was in there for three minutes everybody in the country is going into some place for three minutes or more there is no risk to doing it in person i fear that we're transforming the election to something that will be very hard to please for fraud both this time and in the future real quickly senator the pleasure to talk to you and your wife uh last week we're talking about the initial attack on on you guys leaving the white house last weekend it was on the heels of attack a lot of trump supporters over the weekend a couple of weekends ago um now i i come to learn that you're relaying that a u.s attorney is not going to investigate who might have funded these protesters who confronted you and your wife how do you feel about that you know i think that uh if our cities are going to be livable if you want people to try travel to our nation's capital you have to make them safe if the people throwing firecrackers in there people coming into the restaurant taking your food are not punished then who will want to travel right now they've said we can't eat inside because of the virus and we can't eat outside because the riders but yes they have to have law and order they have to arrest these people but i think they should check the finances what disturbed me most when i spoke to the assistant u.s attorney in dc yesterday was that basically she said there was not going to be any investigation pursuit of the people who attacked my wife and i and i asked specifically did you look at their finances to see who was paying for their trip to washington and who was paying for them to stay in fancy hotels and she wouldn't indicate whether there was an investigation or not she just said nothing was being pursued at the moment um so this does trouble me and i think it leads to more chaos and many people online have responded look if you're not even going to investigate people attacking a senator what about ordinary citizens do they care at all do they care that anybody goes to restaurants anymore our big cities have to have law and order where they're going to be ruined all right senator we'll see what happens hopefully something does to address this but it looks like an uphill battle now uh rand paul thank you have a safe thanksgiving sir

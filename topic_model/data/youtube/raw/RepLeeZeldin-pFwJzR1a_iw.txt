Thank You mr. speaker thank you to chairman Royce I rise in support of his legislation prohibiting future ransom payments to Iran Act which I co-sponsored to prohibit ransom payments to Iran the largest state sponsor of Terror Iran calls America the Great Satan and pledges death to America Iran is illegally test-firing ICBMs they financed Assad in Syria Hezbollah Hamas and other terror groups Iran recently detained and embarrassed publicly US Navy sailors Iran currently is threatening US Navy warships Iran leaders do not respect American weakness they prey upon it and the u.s. is feeding into it like the unsigned political commitment otherwise known as the Iran nuclear deal purchasing Iran's heavy water didn't help speaker Ryan has aptly pointed out secretary Kerry has been a shill for Iran as if he is the president of the Tehran Chamber of Commerce I am deeply troubled at earlier this year the Obama administration airlifted a cash ransom payment at the exact same moment as the release of four unjustly detained American hostages some people blindly loyal to this president will say that this was iran's money no it wasn't this was a disputed claim for decades and for very good reason in the late 70s Ron fell behind in their payments under the foreign military sales program Iran canceled their orders over took our embassy and then repudiated all foreign obligations not only have we been disputing Iran's claim for 400 million we had counterclaims against Iran including one for eight hundred and seventeen million in fact a federal law from two thousand details a very specific requirement requiring regarding payments to Iran from the FMS account which was directly violated by the ransom payment to Iran between the 1979 Iranian Revolution and the two thousand law us victims of Iranian sponsor terrorism sued the Iranian Iranian government in US Court with claims caused by terrorism the claims were paid by the US government these claims were subrogated to the u.s. meaning that their claims against Iran became the USS claims against Iran the 2000 law clearly states that quote no funds shall be paid to Iran or released to Iran from the foreign military sales fund until such subrogated claims have been dealt with to the satisfaction of the United States end quote yet President Obama paid her on the full 400 million dollar amount from the FMS fund plus more than three times that amount and interest a total of 1.7 billion dollars in cash in violation of the 2,000 law you can call a ransom payment leverage but guess what folks still ransom and why don't we pay ransom because now with the price paid on American hostages Iran has now captured new unjustly imprisoned American hostages passage of this bill is critically important and I thank chairman Royce for his unyielding inspiring leadership on this issue to hold Iran accountable I yield back

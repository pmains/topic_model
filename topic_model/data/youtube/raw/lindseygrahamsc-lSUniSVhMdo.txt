well it's been a busy week here in Washington with new developments and several scandals and the president announcing a major shift in the war on terror join joining us to talk about all of it as the number two Democrat in the Senate dick Durbin who's in Springfield Illinois and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham from Columbia South Carolina senators I want to start with the Justice Department targeting reporters and national security leaks here is what Attorney General Holder told a congressional committee a few days ago the focus should be on those people who break their oath and put the American people at risk not reporters who gather this information that should not be the focus of these met of the of these investigations but it turns out that holders signed off on an affidavit for a search warrant in one leak case and I want to bring that up with you here's what that affidavit said there is probable cause to believe the reporter in this case Fox News's James Rosen has committed a violation of the Espionage Act either as an aider a better and/or co-conspirator and yet senator Graham despite that clear contradiction between what Holder said and what he actually did President Obama is asking the attorney general to investigate his own actions well this would be a good time to have a special counsel come forward or some independent group to look at it change Rosen is a lot of things but a criminal co-conspirator conspirator he is not we're beginning to criminalize journalism and I think that should bori us all but having said that when classified information is leaked out in the public that they can put our operations or American operatives in harm's way we got to find a way to pursue that too but this is clearly an overreach senator durbin how can we expect Attorney General Holder to honestly review but in effect or his own actions isn't that by definition a conflict of interest well it's interesting that the Attorney General recused himself from the other case involving Associated Press because he believed there was some conflict inherent and it may raise the same in this case but let's not forget Chris on Memorial Day weekend what this is really all about it is a question of classified information someone working for our government on our side violated their oath and disclose that information to the press and it happens with some frequency I might add but having done that what is the government to do if in fact that disclosure could endanger our military forces are those who are cooperating with us to fight terrorism it is a constant tension between the government and our freedoms under the civil right under the Bill of Rights that we see playing out in both the Associated Press case and this Fox case but you talk about memorial day weekend it's also about the First Amendment and the role the very important role that the media play honestly are you comfortable with the idea that the president has asked the Attorney General to review the Attorney General's own actions well you've raised them an important point I heard senator Graham call for special counsel I'm not ready to do this at this moment I'd like to know if holder has any conflict in here beyond what we've heard when it comes to the Fox case but but here's the bottom line the media shield law which I am prepared to support and I know senator Graham supports still leaves an unanswered question which I've raised many times what is a journalist today in 2013 we know it's someone who works for fox or AP but does it include a blogger does it include someone who's tweeting are these people journalists and entitled to constitutional protection we need to ask 21st century questions about a provision and our Constitution that was written over 200 years ago gentlemen let's turn to the IRS scandal as I said we got a lot of ground to cover here senator Graham you say that President Obama may not have directly ordered the IRS to target conservative groups with that there was a culture of political manipulation that filtered down from the White House explain what you mean well I think the president has basically told some of his supporters you know the best way to get back at somebody is is to win sort of talking about revenge this you know take note prisoners attitude there's clearly an organized effort within to RS to target political opponents of the president that's undeniable how does such a culture come about how bass was it who is involved this really does call for a special counsel the DOJ guidelines about dealing with journalists leaks or leaks of classified information goes back to the 70s we need to review that but my belief about the IRS scandal is it this culture of going after tea party groups that were you know on the president's case about Obamacare did you just I accidentally happen I think it comes from the top in terms of tone senator durbin I want to pick up on this culture starting in twenty ten a number of Democratic senators Democratic senators sent letters to the IRS asking them to investigate various groups that they said were seeking tax-exempt status but were improperly involved in politics now in October of 2010 you sent a letter to the IRS in which you talked about going after groups but you only mentioned one specifically by name and I want to put up this from the october twenty ten letter that you wrote to the IRS one organization whose activities appear to be inconsistent with its tax status as Crossroads GPS that of course the group co-founded by Karl Rove question senator why single out crossroads when you didn't mention a single liberal group and there were a bunch that were applying for tax-exempt status that exactly that point with the name progress in their names I could you I could just tell you flat out why I did it because that crossroads organization was boasting about how much money they were raising as a 501 C 4 let's get back to the basics Citizens United really unleashed hundreds if not thousands of organizations seeking tax-exempt status to play in political campaigns the law we wrote as Congress said that they had to exclusively be engaged in social welfare and not politics and campaigning and so here is the IRS trying to decide whether or not these organizations really comply with the law crossroads was exhibit a they were boastful about women democrat senator german just briefly why not because we're now in the mess that we're in because of political targeting why not send a letter that says go after any group of any political persuasion why not refrain from singling out a conservative group and never mention any liberal groups well I explained that once Chris but you know Karl Rove was making these posts and saying he was going to raise so much money millions of dollars and I knew that if they went in to investigate this group every other group will be put on notice I've also said for the beginning Chris there is no basis for targeting within the IRS what we basically need to say is all groups need to have the law applied to them equally and in this situation karl rove was front and center and proud of it and that's why i mentioned his organization all right let's talk about the president's big speech this week in which he said that we are entering a new phase and the war on terror take a look at the president's comments I beyond Afghanistan we must define our effort not as a boundless Global War on Terror but rather as a series of persistent targeted efforts to dismantle specific networks of violent extremists that threaten America senator durbin the president said wars must end but the fact is the Cold War lasted for 40 years isn't there a danger of declaring an end to this war too soon you know James Madison was quoted by the president he basically said if you want to preserve freedom it's difficult to do if you have a continuous war what the president is saying to us would you obscenity more later well I can tell you that we had to stop and think many times during the Cold War can I go back to the McCarthy era and talk about the witch hunts for those who were thought to be communist you just find in a warlike atmosphere that you end up compromising some basic values and basic freedoms and liberties that's what the president reminded us now I'm not going to take lightly the terrorism threat against the United States but if we are constantly thinking this thinking of this in the context of war we stand the very real risk of doing things which compromise our values and freedoms senator Graham what is your biggest practical worry about the president saying that we are in a new phase and in some sense laying out an exit strategy for the Global War on Terror at a time we need resolve the most we're sounding retreat our enemies are embolden all over the planet al-qaeda and Iraq is coming back with vengeance and Libby saw al Qaeda groups and Yemen and Libya working together our friends are in certain Syria's falling apart we're talking about helping the rebels but doing nothing about it Iran is marching toward a nuclear weapon the challenge of our time is to keep weapons of mass destruction out of the hands of radical Islamist and we're failing in my view Syria's about to fall apart the chemical weapons there enough to kill thousands if not millions of Americans can be compromised Israel is very threatened by what's happening in Syria Iran is marching toward a nuclear weapon and we show this lack of resolve talking about the war being over what do you think the Iranians are thinking at the end of the day this is the most tone deaf president I've ever could imagine and making such a speech at a time when our homeland is trying to be attacked literally every day changing the standards of when you can go after somebody with a drone it has to be a continuing imminent threat to the American people with no chance of civilian casualties virtually no chances of being casualties I think we're diminishing our national security infrastructure sequestration is dismantling the military at a time we need it the most I've never seen I've never been more worried about our national security of them I am right now this speech did not help gentlemen we got about a minute left I'm going to ask you to play well with others as they say in kindergarten and share the time equally the President and defense secretary Hagel both this week went to service academies Annapolis in West Point and spoke about the the really serious problem of sexual assault inside the military and a Pentagon study that is just out estimates that 26,000 members of the armed forces face sexual assault last year twenty-six thousand members specifically each of your 30 seconds start with you senator durbin what can and should Congress do to try to get a handle on and stop this problem well there are several things we need to do but I want to salute the women of the Senate both Democrats and Republicans who are stepping up on this issue and in a determined effort to stop what is truly a scourge on the military we need to make certain that those who are victims step forward knowing they'll be protected and have a chance to have their day in court a court they can trust we need to make a new culture when it comes to the command structure within the military so that this is unacceptable intolerable and those who are engaged in it will pay a price that I think we understand the future the military is a military with both men and women in leadership senator Graham I want to salute the women who serve and are putting up with way too much crap this needs to end when a victim comes for they should have an advocate to walk them through the military justice system and commanders who allow this to continue to the flourish quite frankly should be fired and the president spoke well of this problem it is a disgrace to the United States military and the women in our military are needed now more than ever and they're putting up with way too much and it needs to end senator Graham senator durbin we want to thank you both for coming in and joining us on this Memorial Day weekend thank you gentlemen thank you thank you

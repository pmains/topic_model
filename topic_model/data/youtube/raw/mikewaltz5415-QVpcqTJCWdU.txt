joining me right now is florida congressman michael waltz he's a member of the house armed services committee and a former green beret commander congressman it's always a pleasure to see you thanks so much for being here this morning look if they admit if joe biden admits that his decisions to cancel the xl pipeline to cancel drilling on federal lands uh was the wrong move and that is why we're in this situation the whole climate agenda goes up in smoke isn't that right i mean they're going to just dig in which is what they're doing now that that's right maria and and look i don't even call it gaffs anymore i think they're just moments of of brutal honesty from the president and especially from his energy secretary jennifer granholm deep down in their little progressive hearts they believe that these high gas prices are a good thing because if it gets painful enough and it gets expensive enough maria you will you know at seven eight dollars a gallon you will go and trade in and get rid of your gas guzzling carbon emitting f-150 pickup truck and trade it in for a prius or trade it in for an electric vehicle uh even though electric vehicles uh exceed the the median income of families in the united states i think deep down that's what they believe and to the extent they need to put a band-aid on it politically for political reasons because they know how unpopular these prices are they're going to turn to dictatorships like iran or venezuela and maria to see the president of the united states going on bended knee as a supplicant you know practically begging the saudis is just yet another blow to american credibility around the world it's pathetic uh but that's you know that's where these misguided policies have taken us and you've said this you called this right from the beginning when the afghanistan withdrawal was clearly botched up and we left friends and allies behind you said it's going to trigger our adversary this is exactly what it uh has done there is a now we understand a possible call between joe biden and chinese president xi jinping reportedly it's in the works for this summer congressman this after china has threatened demise for taiwan if the country were to fight uh in a potential takeover the communist country also says that any attempt by taiwan to declare independence and anyone who gets in the way of that of china's acquisition would be on a path to death over the weekend taiwan warned china it had a missile capable of striking beijing congressman where is this going well maria look i i think this is sadly uh and and this isn't just my opinion or yours this is our intelligence community's opinion is heading towards some type of of conflict uh chairman z of of china is telling his country to prepare for war uh he is telling his military to be ready to defeat the united states military by 2027 and they are putting the place pieces in place namely out building us and ships five to one uh while the the bite administration retires more ships uh than it then it's building uh and as long as he is determined he sees it as a key part of his legacy and his defense minister just said this week that china will fight to the bitter end it will never stop until it takes taiwan we have to be ready and the first thing we have to do is you and i have talked about is stop funding our own demise through wall street academia sports industries uh investment firms like blackrock and larry fink and on down the road we are literally sending our tax dollars to their military buildup so that they can take over the world in line with their vision for the china dream well look you've got to talk about policy in that regard because right now there's this wide open window for mutual funds uh for the thrift fund the 401k for government employees uh to acquire chinese stocks and you know the policies are are this administration's policies allowing individuals to buy chinese stocks even our military men and women those companies are very well the companies are going to turn around and be part of the chinese communist party overtaking the united states and then you've got the china initiative going away you've got this administration wanting to alleviate china of the tariffs that trump put in place so you know no matter how much we talk about the behavior of the ccp you've got to look at this white house to see how they react to the ccp and it's just a constant doing what china wants why yeah well that that's great yeah i mean you're absolutely right maria that's a great rundown but they that the chinese communist party have a policy that they call elite capture uh and that's whether that is the suns which in china are called the princelings of the rulers uh in this case the princeling would be hunter biden whether it's key university heads sports figures but basically they are all drunk maria on chinese money they have corrupted so many elements of our society we've got to take the case to the american people conservatives and patriots have to start voting with their wallets and that's why uh for every group that i talk to i tell them when you see made in china put it down made in america it's not just a jobs issue it's a humans rights issue but it's a national security issue we have to bring those supply chains back home before it's too late congressman real quick before you go on iran there is a growing protest movement here the people are upset and they are taking to the streets the other day another general told me that he thinks this is going to be the next crisis that we're dealing with any thoughts on what's going on in iran as this administration is still trying to get us into the iran deal again well so part of this marine it's twofold it's the ongoing mismanagement of the iranian regime dictatorship but layered on top of that is the massive food insecurity that's coming out of ukraine uh with huge swaths of grain corn fertilizer uh that are now literally held hostage uh in the port of uh uh in the port of odessa so the question is will the administration support the iranian people or will they abandon the iranian people like the obama administration did with the green movement in 2009 and i think the jury's out on that one sadly it's a great point yeah it's a great point uh we're gonna be talking about uh we're gonna talk about the food shortages uh with vladimir klitschko live from ukraine coming up but congressman it's always a pleasure to see you thanks very much for weighing in on all of that

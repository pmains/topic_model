please welcome our friend of the program Congressman Ken Buck always great to have you sir thank you definitely it's great to be with you and even better to be with Jimmy [Music] well grab your do I need to take this over from you Stefan I'm happy to conduct the interview just fine I I got my stitches out yesterday I'm gonna go Leroy and I are gonna go eat now Ken it's great to have you on and um we're gonna talk about this the rest of this hour but I I let we've got to start with last night just overview your thoughts my thoughts are that there are a whole lot of people that are wondering why President Biden didn't talk more about the Border why didn't more about how much uh parents have to spend uh families have to spend to buy food while he didn't talk about our our failing location system after covid and how his response to covet has caused so many of the problems in our education system he didn't talk about uh the rising costs across the board um uh you know uh I don't even expect them to talk about the balloon but he could certainly talk about what's going on in Europe and what's going on uh in the Middle East and what's going on in in uh China and Taiwan so I think he left out a whole lot of things that that were important uh that people wanted to hear about boy didn't he Our Guest Congressman Ken Buck speaking of the Wayward balloon I'm committed to work with China where we can advance American interest and benefit the world but make no mistake about it as we made clear last week if China threatens our sovereignty we will act to protect our country and we did well there I would say that was a tepid response by just a few on one side of the aisle Ken Buck since I last saw you in person or we spoke there was a Chinese spy balloon flying over the United States of America for the better part of a week how in God's name was that allowed to stay up so long in your opinion well I I don't know you know it's it's it's fascinating to me why they think that a spy balloon is going to give them more information than uh the satellites they have over this country I I think it's uh kind of silly not to just shoot it down over uh Montana when it's first seen um but to take it down over the ocean and and to lose any part of it is is kind of ridiculous I I I don't think we were risking human life um I've been to Montana the chances of hitting a human being in Montana are about 1 in 10 million so uh they they had a lot of opportunity to shoot it down over very rural areas and and should have done that this uh this is one of them and I believe I have the right one uh Congressman kenbach as we recap and we're going to also talk about last week um uh you and congresswoman bobert or maybe it was a couple of weeks ago but talking about the DirecTV uh removal of Newsmax this is censorship and that's all it is I want to talk about that and uh you've got a new book out so I certainly want to give you the opportunity to talk about that but how about this Ken in in this state uh and we every state we should value and respect and honor the Second Amendment there was this they add up to hundreds of dollars a month they make it harder for you to pay your bills and afford that family trip I know how unfair it feels when a company overcharges you and gets away with it banned assault weapons now ban them now once and for all ban assault weapons Ken Buck last night we had Let's see we were talking about Resort fees credit card fees cable TV overcharging cable and internet um the junk fee prevention act and fraud and then there's that ban assault weapon I mean it was all over the place but uh to that specific sound bite of ban assault weapons your reaction well all he had to do was was uh you know go go about 150 yards down the hall and um he could have uh picked up my AR-15 so I'm not sure why he uh thinks we need to ban assault weapons uh his idea of assault weapon and most Americans idea of an assault weapon is completely different um he is really trying to start this uh idea of banning all guns and registering all guns and vilifying gun owners and and it's just not going to fly in in America constitutional there are millions of AR-15s in circulation and I know they consider an a you know an AR-15 in the salt level most of us don't but uh the idea that he's going to ban something with uh it is in such common usage is just uh just not constitutional you have been obviously a supporter as uh this radio station has been as I have been as Jimmy has been at you know we we have we we support the oil and gas industry in Colorado and look again I say all the time tongue-in-cheek but it's as if some of our friends on the left they're as if uh you know you look at those in oil and gas and go they should all lose their jobs today uh they did go to work today and they did everything they could to kill our children and pollute our water and you and I and everybody else we know that that is not true I want to play this for you when he talks about oil and gas and and these big profits and corporations and all of that um your reaction to this I'm proud of how the how America at last is stepping up to the challenge we're still going to need oil and gas for a while but guess what no we do but there's so much more to do the job and we pay for these investments in our future by finally making the wealthiest and biggest corporations begin to pay their fair share [Applause] look I'm a capitalist I'm a capitalist but pay your fair share I think a lot of you at home a lot of you at home agree with me and many people that you know the tax system is not fair it is not fair all right I've heard enough on that but then he also said well we're going to need oil and gas for like the next 10 years I could only imagine at least certain members of the Colorado Congressional Delegation would have been summarized as follows the eye roll Emoji what did you think when he said that about the debt well we may need gas and oil and gas for the next decade yeah yeah um I I don't know what cave these folks plan on living in where they don't need light and and uh electricity and and heat and um but it's it's amazing to me that they think that uh the the world can survive 10 years from now with uh Renewables if you look at what's going on in Europe you see the dependence that some of our liberal European friends have on Russian natural gas and we need to increase the amount of natural gas here as a matter of geopolitical uh security it's it is absolutely necessary that we uh produce more oil today than we did yesterday more natural gas today than we did yesterday and and that we make sure we get it to our allies uh in Europe as well as driving down the price here at home if we're going to stay competitive in manufacturing in any way shape or form it's going to be with lower energy costs and that's not what's happened with this Administration Congressman kenbach joining us as we recap the State of the Union final final Sound by from from the state of the union last night and then I want to ask you about the DirecTV and at T decision to drop Newsmax which I I know I'm in lockstep with you that this is is censorship and I know congresswoman bobert was very heated over the last 10 days on the house uh floor but but this I wonder this this really sure sounded like a man that you knew or know the former president named Donald Trump boy it's just funny how when when you know things are convenient you kind of go back to an old Playbook where is it written that America can't lead the world in manufacturing I don't know where that's written for too many decades we imported projects and exported jobs now thanks to what you've all done we're exporting American products and creating American jobs I'm going to go ahead and stop it there Ken because look all of a sudden now it's after after Donald Trump was a racist because you know make America great again or or what have you comes the build back better that of course just a infinitesimal the amount of money that really went to Broad roads and bridges but now it's okay for a Democrat president like Joe Biden to talk about how we need to keep things in America and make our own chips and and do all of that I I mean these are the same people aren't they and tell me if I'm wrong but these are the same people that vilified Donald Trump for four years because he wanted to keep things here well and not just uh you know over four years but but even in this speech President Biden is talking about the the Maga uh insurrectionism and magidus and Maga that and and uh yeah he's he's stealing a pie from president Trump president Trump got it right we we do need to bring manufacturing back here we bring it back with lower corporate taxes not higher corporate taxes we bring manufacturing back here um because we have a quality a labor force and equality uh uh energy Supply um and he's ruining the energy Supply and he's disincentivizing the so that his idea of of manufacturing in America um you know he he has an open border and he has uh the the um infrastructure um all backwards in terms of of how we actually manufacture products in this country yeah uh just a few more minutes with you couple couple different topics uh first and foremost uh last week and I think it was a lot early last week I mean I thought the sound bites if you will I played congresswoman bobert's comments um as she was fired up and I was so glad she was talking about DirecTV dropping Newsmax can I said for the better part of every show last week how this is nothing more than censorship do not do not buy the oh well Newsmax is charging us too much um your thoughts because I know you really you were the reason that whole thing happened yeah I hosted the the special order hour uh on the floor and and invited the 18 members uh who came and joined me to to speak about that and and I agree I think that um you know when you look at the pattern of conduct uh from a t and DirecTV you've got uh they dropped uh one America news um and then they drop Newsmax and uh Newsmax is an important both of them are important voices but but certainly Newsmax has the viewership that uh exceeds the some of the liberal uh stations that are on DirecTV that DirecTV pays and uh it's unfair for them to discriminate against conservative voices and so it was important um and and I I've said this all along about big tech and and I know we're going to talk about the book in a minute but um in the book crushed I talk about one of the things Americans can is to take uh action and and to use their economic power to to punish those that discriminate against conservatives and so um you don't need to use these big tech companies and you don't DirecTV there are alternatives uh to getting the the quality TV that you want and you should use those Alternatives president Trump has Trump white thought of DirecTV no I I I just I I think uh you would have been you would have given me a fist bump because I was I just went off on this this is nothing more than censorship and and if you ever have a question of whether or not you as a congressman or me as a talk show host if we're talking you know at our rear ends or not just remember this does a company like ATT a t slash DirecTV um do they ever take it in the shorts no what they do if they really wanted Newsmax or oan and those companies wanted to charge more the company doesn't eat it they pass that along to the consumer and your bill goes up so I think we're in agreement on that it's a perfect segue into your book crushed Big Tex war on Free Speech it's uh the forward is by Senator Ted Cruz quick example of of why I agree with you lockstep earlier uh it was last month earlier in January I posted or maybe it was earlier this month I posted the picture of former Denver Bronco Derek Wolfe holding a mountain lion that he had harvested he used with a bow and he took this thing down that got Ken on our Facebook page more than one hundred thousand Impressions not days later I posted a critical comment of Jared Polis commenting on uh Memphis Police and The Tyree Nichols case saying that this this shows you hypocrisy that here the governor of Colorado says nothing during Colorado's summer of Hell 2020 and what happened in Denver and yet he's commenting on something out of Memphis Tennessee my point of bringing this example up Derek Wolfe dead mountain lion more than a hundred thousand Impressions when I posted something critical of our governor using his words we had fewer than 300 Impressions Ken this is an algorithm this is censorship and let me tell you from my Show's perspective we were crushed so please talk about the book we know that you can Google are our monopolies we know that 94 of searches occur on Google online searches and so what you end up with is Google changing their algorithm in June of 2020 to harm president Trump and to benefit Joe Biden and uh it influences elections and and it's one thing to have a monopoly over oil or steel or um that's that's dangerous it's inefficient it costs consumers more when you have a monopoly over speech the dissemination of information in the Democracy you are truly threatening our our way of living your our way of life you're threatening um our elections and the Integrity of our elections and that's why we cannot tolerate this and that's why individuals have to act on their own as well as having Congress Act the book again crushed big text war on Free Speech I gotta ask you obviously about Tick Tock what what if if you had to tell somebody for the very first time you don't need to explain what Tick Tock is but why should we be concerned right now well so one tick tock's a great competitor for Instagram but two uh Tick Tock is uh uh owned and controlled by the Chinese Communist party and I'm not making that up they they are a Chinese company and every Chinese company has a Communist Party Board member and every Chinese company is monitored and in this case where they are uh gathering information on Americans it will be used in in a cyber War we know that you know the any future war will have a land component a a c component an air component it will also have a cyber component and as Trace components and we cannot give them an advantage by allowing Americans to get on Tick Tock and to give information to the Chinese that will be used against us final question my friend and I always appreciate your time Congressman Ken Buck yeah we are in the 118th Congress um what do you expect I mean last night he gave a couple of nods to thanking his Republican counterparts Etc but I mean we we all heard with our feet on the ground out here in Good Old Colorado and in the good old USA outside of the Beltway we heard what he said and you know I thought it was a I thought it was terrible it's nothing there was nothing groundbreaking I thought he was an idiot most of the time but I just what do you see for this Congress ahead well I could tell you uh I I sat through the inauguration it was cold uh and uh being really popular with the Democrats I was you know in the back row somewhere near the Washington Monument and I can tell you that he uh kept talking about unifying America he has not unified America nope and if we don't deal with the Border we have a very serious crisis on our hands and and it has to be addressed uh he needs to get rid of my orcas um and he and he needs to make sure he follows some of the Trump policies that he doesn't like necessarily but are effective uh there are other things that I believe we can do in terms of oversight and making sure that we let the public know how bad and how far left this Administration is so that they can take that into account when making a decision on the president on the president's race in in 2024. the book is crushed Big Tex war on Free Speech its author our friend of the program Colorado Congressman Ken Buck again crushed Big Tex war on Free Speech as always thank you for going multiple different ways with us and um it's always good to have you on the Ken Buck show thank you

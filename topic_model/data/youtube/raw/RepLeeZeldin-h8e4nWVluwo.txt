Thank You mr. chairman secretary Carson is there anything that you would like to say using my time oh well thank you very much I appreciate that you know sometimes I get a little bit tired of people ascribing to me things that people have said that I believe and I appreciate it an opportunity just to say this when I say that poverty is largely a state of mine what I am saying is that the way that people approach things has a lot to do with what happens to them if your mindset is one that I'm a victim and that everybody else is in control of my life and I just need to sit here and wait for them to do something for me you gotta approach life very differently from somebody who says I am going to take this issue into my own hands what's one of the things that I learned from my mother you know she came from a very large rural family got married when she was 13 later on discovered her husband was a bigamist had only a third-grade education worked three jobs at a time but the one thing about my mother she was never a victim and she never allowed us to be victims and that was very important and she did that for other members of our family too who were in a very bad situation and she convinced them that they didn't have to be there and they came out of that situation she was really quite an interesting person now I realized that not everybody has a mother like mine but I also recognized that we as a society would do much better if we stopped sitting around trying to tear each other apart and start saying what can we do to change the attitudes and to create different outcomes from people and there are those who allow themselves to be manipulated and to just creating dissension rather than trying to figure out a way that we can actually solve the problems isn't that what this whole government was supposed to be about representatives who can help us solve the problems not people who simply sit there and try to tear things down and try to create dissension and try to create victims but we don't need that we can do much better than that this is America the United States of America a place that rose from nowhere to the pinnacle of the world in record time why because we created an atmosphere of innovation where their mistakes made were their problems absolutely are we a perfect society we are not because we are we consist of human beings that's why that's why we need a savior but you know we really can do much better than what we're doing if we stop fighting each other and start figuring out how we're going to solve these problems Thank You mr. secretary for being here for your service you are someone who wants to lift people up and provide a more opportunity not to keep them struggling but to have all the abilities all the tools necessary to be able to rise up out of that situation for a better life I feel like our country is blessed to have you as serving as our secretary of HUD it is a calling that hopefully will provide great opportunity for you to empower many Americans desperate for your leadership to help them have that opportunity thank you I wanted to speak briefly about veteran homelessness on any given night with HUD numbers 40,000 veterans in the United States are struggling with homelessness any veteran who raises their hand willing to serve our country should have a roof over their head they should have shoes on their feet they should have food on their table so the ultimate goal for that number will always be pursuing the permanent solution of zero we know that voucher programs which give flexibility to Americans struggling from affordable housing has been shown to be more effective than a traditional housing project programs I applaud your efforts to move more to a voucher model at HUD for all housing programs earlier you noted that the agency is making progress but that the the HUD Veterans Affairs supportive housing program is in need of more flexibility to get the vouchers in the right hands and in the right place additionally you spoke about the expansion of public/private partnerships and increasing the collaboration of your agency with local nonprofits to assist in veteran housing I stand eager to work with you I'm sure many of my colleagues are as well with the ultimate goal of getting to zero veteran housing homelessness one day I thank you again for your leadership I yield back thank you

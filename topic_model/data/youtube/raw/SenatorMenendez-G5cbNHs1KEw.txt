thank you mr chairman um sharon power i want to start on the issue of diversity at the fed i have a letter that we sent you yesterday and signed by nine senators including five members of this committee urging you to undertake a number of simple reforms to the process for selecting bank presidents and class b directors that process has to include meaningful transparency and public engagement if we are ever going to have fed leadership that truly represents the public as required by the federal reserve act so i'll wait for your written response because we just sent that letter on the details of those proposed reforms but for now can i have your commitment that you'll provide us with a substantive response by july the 22nd yes thank you and and also will you uh commit to work with me to put in place real meaningful changes to the process so we can have a broader array of voices to the fed leadership i'll commit to to having a frank discussion with you about that and and what what could be we're open to ideas to how to improve as you point out in your letter we've you know it's not like we haven't made tremendous strides as it relates to the b and c directors in the course of the last 10 years we really have and the the diversity numbers are are i think quite impressive for the bnc directors the a directors as you point out in your letter less so but those are appointed by the bankers in the district uh but we can have this conversation i look forward to it less so but uh it's not it's worse than less so i mean you don't have one bank president in the history of the federal reserve who's been hispanic that's that's that that's far worse than less so i was talking about directors but you're right about you're right about about that and there was a tremendous opportunity and it didn't happen uh i just continue uh you know i i feel like i'm the lone effort on this but 62 million hispanic americans who represent two trillion dollars of domestic uh purchasing power uh deserve a seat at where some of the most important economic decisions are being made so we look forward to the engagement that you've uh said that you're willing to engage in now uh i and trying to find out as others have raised with you there's no question that painfully high inflation is affecting every family in america but in order to develop the right response we need to understand the underlying factors that are driving price increases uh i think you've said here today that uh russia's invasion of ukraine pandemic related supply chain issues are perhaps uh and the energy issues that flow from russia's invasion of uk and perhaps some of the biggest factors in driving inflation but the question is how is it that raising interest rates on those underlying causes of today's inflation uh ultimately are going to change it you know energy is still energy supply chain is still supply chain uh russia's invasion of ukraine is a continuing challenge for uh for the world but there's nothing about uh interest rates that's going to affect any of that no but but notwithstanding that there there is there are major parts of the economy where the demand exceeds supply meaningfully and that's where our tools have a job to do where we can moderate demand and give supply time to recover so that supply and demand get back into better balance and inflation comes down well it seems to me that we can all recognize that raising interest rates is a blunt tool at the end of the day but i'm looking going back to the beginning of my questioning [Music] it's essential i believe to be mindful of the effects that your actions you're meeting the federal reserve will have on unemployment particularly for those groups that were hit hardest by the pandemic the fed's latest monetary policy report states that quote employment for blacks and hispanics not only declined by more than that for whites and asians early in the pandemic but also recovered more quickly since the end of last year now that we're potentially entering a period of larger and more frequent interest rate increases what do you expect will happen to the unemployment rates of black and hispanic workers relative to the population as a whole it'll depend on the on what happens to the overall unemployment rate and you know our goal is to achieve two percent inflation while still keeping the labor market strong that's that's our intention with this well i i appreciate what your intention is but i would venture to say that what we will see is what we have seen in the past that crisis after crisis disproportionately harms americans of color so i hope the fed's response to inflation doesn't continue that trend because it is woefully wrong that one group of americans disproportionately faces consequences of policy decisions versus the rest of america and this is another reason to have people at the federal reserve who represent this community to share those insights with the fed as you determine these macro policies that are going to affect our communities disproportionately thank you sir

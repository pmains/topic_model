the gentlelady from Ohio is fudge thank you very much mr. chairman and thank you madam secretary for being here today Madam Secretary you just helped me out five minutes is a very short period of time so if you could just be more concise with your answers that appreciate it Madam Secretary do you realize that it is your responsibility to educate every child in the United States it's my responsibility to just say yes or no madam chair madam protector it's my responsibility it is that again sir is that an area of Education okay you're very good at evading that's a really simple question so we'll move on but my concern is that you spend so much of your time focused on vouchers how do we fund religious and private schools and then you come up with something called the education freedom scholarship which by any other name is a voucher we are once again picking winners and losers which is something that my colleagues complained about for years and years about Democrats you in fact are trying to pick winners and losers now I've never been aware of a tax credit that is a $1 to 1 die 100% credit so now we have already decided that we're going to make rich people richer with the tax cuts we're gonna make poor people about the same middle class we're gonna hurt with more taxes so now it's like you guys weren't smart enough to take care to take advantage of all these tax credits let me give you another bite at this Apple let me let you give money to school so that you can take a hundred percent tax credit it's the most ridiculous thing that I have ever heard but once again by any other name it is a voucher and it is something to benefit the rich Madam Secretary are you aware that Alabama and Florida have state tuition tax programs and they have shown no improvement in academic achievement for students I'm aware they have programs and you're wrong they have shown improvement for student I'd love you to send me that data please I would be happy to you talk you say in your remarks as well as in your testimony written testimony that this proposal takes not one cent from local public school students or public school teachers you did that in your own budget by cutting the education budget 10% that's something that you did but let me also suggest to you that in fact it is hurting taxpayers if you give a one-to-one tax credit it's going to create a five billion dollar a year hole in the federal treasury so that's five billion dollars that could be spent on education and other things so indeed it does hurt students you talk about freedom which is just so it's so enlightening for me that it's freedom do you know that freedom is not free this freedom is gonna cost us five billion dollars a year fifty billion dollars over ten years freedom is not free we learned that in the civil and during the civil rights movement these are voluntary contributions that individuals are claiming my time this is my time freedom is not free we have experienced it over and over again there is a cost to everything we do yours just happens to be fifty billion dollars to the Treasury I wish that at some point we would just be honest with what we are doing and we would just tell the American people that what we are doing with this is creating a shell game to fund private and religious schools and their providers using taxpayers as the middleman that is what we are doing it is nothing more than another attempt to disinvest in public education and that is why I ask you the first question which you couldn't even answer do you represent all of the children of the United States is it not your job to educate all of the children it is the most it wasn't a trick question it's a very simple question so I just hope that the next time you come in front of us that you would stop the evasion and just give us a simple answer mr. Chairman I yield back

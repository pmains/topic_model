thank you speaker Pro Tem Mr Speaker America and the world have been shocked by the deadly earthquake in Tokyo and Syria on February 6 which killed more than 50 000 people and injured more than a hundred thousand people entire cities and towns near the epicenter in Tokyo have been wiped off the map five million people are homeless and over 20 million are in need now we're grateful to see such a generous and compassionate American response many brave men and women both inside turkey or Syria and others from around the globe spring into action to work relentlessly at search and rescue operations in providing relief to the people impacted on the ground at Interlake Air Base a very strategic American Air Base in turkey at just 125 miles from the earthquake epicenter the 728th air Mobility Squadron and the 39th Operational Support Squadron have worked quickly to coordinate with the United States agency for International Development to deliver Aid to those impacted on the ground who are in need American families offer sincere sympathies to the families who are mourning loved ones and nursing others back to health the Republic of Turkey for over 70 years has been a valued NATO Ally in its co-chair of the Congressional caucus on U.S turkey relations and Turkish Americans I'm particularly supportive of their efforts to meet to the needs of the impacted earthquake victims the entrepreneurial Turkish American and Syrian American communities have been mobilized such as Vinnie and Nestle's centuric owners of Hidden Valley Tavern and sapphire in North Carolina represented by Congressman Chuck Edwards who are raising funds to help the people in Turkey the civil defense better known as the white helmets Have Been instrumental in the search and rescue efforts in addition to clearing rubble and opening roads to facilitate the district distribution of relief Aid by local non-government organizations their efforts saved at least three thousand lives despite being left alone and receiving no material international support through the critical and crucial first days of the response impressive assistance by Ryan Eid al-salaya and all the other white helmets which are which he leads has been achieved to help the people who are so desperately needed to Advocate and provide real assistance to make this devastating tragedy worse serious brutal dictator Assad is stealing humanitarian Aid and even worse his continued bombing the affected areas at least 10 times since the earthquake they've already been videos of the Assad regime Soldier stealing Aid that is attempting to reach Syrian communities in need the United Nations has been stopped to provide critical Aid into Northwest Syria because of war criminal Putin's veto on the border crossing assistance in the United Nations security Council this is after the Assad regime initially refused to permit humanitarian Aid through Northern points of Entry that are controlled by the opposition groups the United Nations should not politicize humanitarian assistance even further the U.N should circumvent the obstructions of Assad and more criminal Putin which denies humanitarian Aid to earthquake victims it is significant that this resolution calls on President Biden to use all diplomatic means to push the U.N to get Aid to those in need Natasha Hall from the center for strategic and International Studies has said it clearly quote the Syrian government has perfected the politization and weaponization of humanitarian Aid through the Civil War in some cases is far more effective than the military offensive end of quote yet Assad to add insult to injury continues to lie and blame U.S sanctions for causing delays in Aid this is simply not true as this resolution makes clear Mr Speaker sanctions on war criminals like Assad which passed on a bipartisan basis prevent the regime from obtaining the resources to further brutalize the people of Syria and do not inhibit humanitarian assistance I am deeply saddened that there has been a weakening of sanctions by the Biden Administration on the Assad regime through permitting direct transactions with the Assad regime this will do nothing to help the earthquake relief and will only endanger Syria's Syrian civilians by enriching the regime we are already seeing the result of Biden's weak policy this week with Arab countries beginning to normalize relations with the regime in ignoring the Caesar act which threatens the consequences for normalization despite this let it be known that Congress will continue to stand with the secret Caesar act on bipartisan basis and strengthen sanctions on Assad and those who engage this barbaric regime it is gruesomely clear that there is no solution to the problems in Syria so long as the brutal Assad regime remains in power terrorism refugees war crimes Iranian influence chemical weapons Norco trafficking genocide Assad is the driver of all of these the earthquake proves the point yet again American families prayers and sincere condolences go to the people of Tokyo and Syria to the brutal Assad regime backers war criminal Putin the authoritarian Ayatollah and Iran there will be a message your diversion of humanitarian Aid during an earthquake is Despicable you are not fooling anyone with your lies about sanctions the U.S Congress stands united we will never normalize with you we will hold all those who attempt to normalize with you accountable and we will not stop supporting the people of Syria to have a government they deserve based on Democracy with rule of law not authoritarians with rule of gun it is bipartisan in America to support freedom for the people of Syria and Iran in Victory for the people of Ukraine seeking to defend their country from authoritarian governments again our prayers go to those affected by the earthquake God Bless the people of Tokyo Syria and the United States of America I yield

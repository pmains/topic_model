today has been a great day going through the massachusetts fifth district looking at some of the sites where i just was able to secure community project funding in our house appropriations bill so we started off in revere [Music] and welcome to revere i want to thank the assistant speaker catherine clark and her staff for being here this morning and really making this event possible i have to say that the advocacy of assistant speaker clark has already produced a transformational impact for our infrastructure in our community we started having conversations about this new opportunity for community project funding i came to the mayor to the senator and others in the community and asked them what investments could we make that would make a difference in the lives of families here in revere winthrop and the region and the wonderland multimodal project was the common refrain a potential for a new commuter stop that would really connect our commuter rail and the team and open up more economic development address some environmental justice issues and really be a link for the region as well as the city then we were in malden and looking at funding i was able to obtain over three million dollars so that we can make sure everyone in malden has clean drinking water mauldin over a quarter of its connections uh to water involve lead pipe one of the highest rates of lead pipes in the nation and in the commonwealth and so that funding is going to be critical to making sure we improve the quality of drinking water for all meldonians malden deserves it and now i am here in the city of medford where we have obtained funding to put in a path right here and complete the wellington greenway project i this is the first time i've ever been over here on my bicycle honestly because i've been afraid to cross over here so i'm thrilled to be able to bike over here people protect what they love and they love what they know so bringing people to the edge of the river is really important so it is a great day in ma5 and we are continuing to pull together the pieces to make sure that we meet this moment of economic and climate justice you

thanks to so many of you we made history in 2016 I became Delaware's first woman and first person of color to represent us in Congress it was an incredible evening and I remember a lot of people asking me what does it feel like to make history I really didn't think about it we were just doing the work but then on the day that I was sworn in that I stood on that House floor and raised my hand to take the oath I carried with me a scarf that my sister created that was an oath that allowed our great-great great-grandfather to have the right to vote and at that moment it really hit me that we are here because we're standing on the shoulders of those who came before us I've spent my entire career working to ensure that all delawarians have the opportunities they deserve and that didn't stop when I went to Congress lisa has been working hard to help the businesses up and down the state find the capital they need to help them succeed in Delaware she believes in engaging people of all ages and all backgrounds in the democratic process and she's working to ensure all voices are heard she listens to the young people of today and empowers them to be leaders of tomorrow she understands that in order to be successful we need a safe learning environment she recognizes that the keys to enriching our children's futures and unleashing their innovative and creative spirit are equality education and the arts she believes that love is love and that discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity has no place in our society she knows that if we're going to leave the world a better place for our daughters we have much more work to do to ensure that they have equal opportunity so that they can reach their full potential I'm running for re-election because there is still more work to be done more for us to accomplish to truly leave our mark on history this year every voice must be heard so I'm asking for your vote and your participation in our journey to reelection and remember when Lisa goes to Washington we all go we all go we all go we all go we all go we all go to Washington I'm Lisa blunt Rochester and I approve this message

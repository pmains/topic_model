thank you very much i want to thank the gentleman from Maryland and the gentlelady from Washington for your tremendous leadership you've hit the ground running here in Congress in defense of our nation's immigrants and refugees and for all who just seek to live the American dream so thank you very much for your leadership and for colonists together tonight mr. speaker in his first week as President Donald Trump issued an executive order essentially banning immigrants and refugees from the United States on the basis of religion this action effectively shuts our gates to some of the most vulnerable people in the world flea in danger and death this man flies in the face of our fundamental values as Americans it is yes morally reprehensible and will only serve to make the United States less safe this executive order is also a direct threat to our national security banning Muslim immigrants and refugees only fuels Isis propaganda by promoting the false idea that the United States is at war with Islam and this hateful ban is felt in our communities across the nation in my district one Iranian student at the University of California at Berkeley was not allowed to board the plane to return to the United States she is now forced to withdraw from the semester this yes this is a disgrace mr. speaker this nation is and has been it will always be a nation of immigrants disband president and his executive orders they do not reflect our values this is not who we are as the president's divisive ban was implemented we witnessed thousands of Americans bring what I call street heat men women and children across the country stood up to the President and declared with one voice not on our watch these protests the voice of the American people they give me hope if we stand together and resist we will prevail and while the president continues his attack on immigrants refugees and Muslims I vowed to stand up for our communities with my colleagues with a clear message fan once again this is not who we are this Muslim ban is hateful it's unconstitutional and it's downright wrong fighting let me just say februari is Black History Month and as an african-american woman I'm reminded of the bands and exclusions of african-americans and my ancestors and the legacy of slavery where my ancestors were brought here in Chains built this country and continue to fight for freedom and justice as an african-american there is no way there is no way I can tolerate any ban on anyone seeking refuge in this great country finally and in conclusion as a member of the Appropriations Committee I just want to say I'm going to fight tooth and nail to prevent funding for these misguided anti-immigrant and anti refugees policies anti-refugee policies thank you again and I yield back and thank you for giving me time

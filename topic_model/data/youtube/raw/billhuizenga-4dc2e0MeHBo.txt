if you could congressmen bring us up to speed if you will on what is happening right now in Washington yeah and actually Leon good to be with you we are literally in a conference right now I just stepped out to to make this call with you debating and internally on the Republican side what what our response needs to be and as you pointed out our our Majority Leader Eric Cantor had said that he opposed the bill as it is currently written out of the Senate I'm I agree with that I concur with that you know this is this is a very bad situation because the bottom line is there's 640 s billion dollars in new revenue with only 15 billion dollars in cuts and at the end of the day we're looking at three hundred and thirty billion dollars in new spending this isn't we're going the wrong direction and obviously when the president that he was looking for two or even three dollars in in cuts for every dollar in revenue that is the case were actually going the wrong direction congressman if you could please talk to us about the tenor of this meeting with the Republican leaders because we know even on the Republican side you're all not on the same page is this a tense meeting it's I would say it's it's business life it's certainly in fenton defense time everybody's out there I wouldn't say it's hostile or anything it's just for dealing with some very tough difficult issues and now we've we've been told just as we're in this meeting that the Senate's threatening on not coming back at all and you know and it it's so classic these guys take their ball and want to go home as soon as they don't get get their way every turn and at the end of the day we we're racking up this will be our fifth year of trillion-dollar deficit and we can't suspend the laws of mathematics here and we've got to stop doing business this way in Washington DC where we're going to you know where we're going to end up spending more and adding to the deficit even more and then somehow calling it a victory congressman I think you'd agree there is a lot in the balance here what happens if this doesn't pass so there's a lot that we're going to be waiting for yes there is and obviously you know this is a thing described as a cliff but many others have described this is more of a fiscal slope obviously challenges as we are looking at revenues and tax increases on everybody if if we're not able to to work out an accommodation here and and I don't want to do that I've been very clear i have voted to extend all of the current tax provisions in the tax rates as they are I think that's the proper thing to do but the question is at some point when do we have people have to pay for the government that they keep that they keep voting for and we we have to realize that you can't get something for nothing and we we have got to stop this just binge of spending that's going on all right representative I know you're the thick of it out there in Washington thank you so much for keeping us up to speed and we'll be in touch with you have a happy new year all right you too thanks for thanks for having me on like em take care

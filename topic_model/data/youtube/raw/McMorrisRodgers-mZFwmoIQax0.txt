Thank You mr. chairman and I appreciate the work that's been done and to my colleague mr. McKinley as well as mr. Tonko and loebsack I appreciate the work that you're doing on this legislation and it's good to know that someone was listening to me all these years right but I would just highlight to this committee that hydropower is the largest renewable in America and as mr. McKinley's pointed out there is huge capacity to expand hydro electricity which is a clean renewable reliable source of electricity we could double hydro power without even building a new dam because only 3% of the dams actually produce hydroelectricity it's it would create a lot of jobs and what it would help us reach these important goals clearly hydropower need is an essential component to any clean energy plan and just yesterday we saw where the majority laid out their quote 100 by 50 goal there's no way you we will be able to reach that kind of a goal and reduce carbon emissions without embracing what hydropower is contributing and the potential of it to even do more while this bill reauthorizes important incentives for hydropower I want to highlight to the committee that funding is not the roadblock to increasing output we need to be addressing the relicensing and the licensing of these these projects the the licensing currently takes on average ten years and a lot and you compare that to a natural gas facility in America that takes on average 18 months so we are dealing with a regulatory process that is that needs to be addressed we all agree that more needs to be done to increase clean energy reducing emissions and combat climate change hydropower is a solution and it's not just in the Pacific Northwest I'm amazed there's hydropower all over this country almost every state utilizes some form of hydro and their energy portfolios so in previous years I've introduced and worked with members on this committee bipartisan on legislation around hydropower policy modernization Act which would provide relief from these costly and time-consuming regulations and encourage more incentive in hydropower last Congress this legislation was passed with overwhelming bipartisan support I would in this committee to continue to look at how do we how do we promote hydropower in America combating climate change cannot continue to be a partisan issue there will be no progress and unless we put political messaging aside and work on real bipartisan solutions I know our lead the lead Republican former chairman of this committee Greg Walden has highlighted many times bipartisan bills that we could pass today that would make a real impact and hydropower relicensing reform is one of them so I urge continued focus and commitment to including hydropower Thank You mr. chairman

a proposed new law could make it easier for terminally ill patients to get access to potentially life-saving drugs it is a process called compassionate use an issue we've been investigating for more than a year in Washington DC central texas congressman Michael McCaul discussed the need to reform the compassionate use system as part of the annual childhood cancer summit this year the summit took on the topic after several high-profile cases including Austin attorney Andrea Sloan who was denied compassionate use for months and ultimately lost her battle to ovarian cancer mccall is now working on federal legislation in her honor she was a friend of mine and it was very tragic to watch that experience but I know that she would want us to move forward with a bill like this in the Congress the Andrea Sloan cure act would help terminally ill patients find clinical trials and require pharmaceutical companies to have compassionate use policies

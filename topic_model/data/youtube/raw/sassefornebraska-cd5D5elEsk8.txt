hi I'm Ben Sasse let's talk about the crisis on our southern border and let's just forget about all the politics of Democrats and Republicans for a second and first call this what it is a horrible human tragedy everyone in DC and the DC obsessed national media is talking constantly about the politics of all this which party wins and losses whose legislative agenda will be advanced because of this as though any of that should matter now as though any of that is what we should be talking about meanwhile little kids are leaving their parents every day and being handed over to human traffickers the stories coming from our border are just heart-rending children apparently tortured and occasionally murdered there have even been reports that parents are now actually giving their daughters birth control before they leave home because they expect that some of them are likely going to be raped by their Coyotes along the way I have three little kids one of my preteen daughter's had a birthday just a few days ago the only two questions that should matter to Americans to human parents everywhere at this moment are these why is this happening and how do we stop it well according to the US El Paso Intelligence Center report ninety-four percent of these kids and their families who are coming to our border say they're doing it because they believe that President Obama is currently giving amnesty and citizenship to all Central American kids and then subsequently their families if they show up at our southern border now President Obama whether deliberately or not has let this belief take hold and it is the reason that we have this crisis today fortunately there's a common-sense solution here President Obama needs to go to Central America this week and make a major speech he needs to say to the people of Latin America the United States borders are not open and we are not going to have amnesty please keep your babies with you don't break up your families don't load your kids onto trains the level and then activity by the president here is just stunning I've been talking to a lot of Nebraskans the last few days and they want to say this to him mr. president you are not a passive actor here you're not primarily a partisan fundraiser you're not just an observer along for a ride you are the leader of the free world get on a plane and go solve this problem these are little kids many of them barely out of diapers and they're being loaded onto the rooftops of trains as we speak today and some of them are likely going to die trying to get here because of a false impression that the president could fix every day that this is allowed to continue more little kids are going to get hurt more human trafficking more assault more grief we don't need to complicate this more than is necessary the central problem here isn't the 50,000 kids who've already survived the journey we can solve that we can figure out how to expedite their processing the real problem is the untold millions that be good be coming this way in the coming weeks and months risking the same fate as some of those who have already been lost how many more kids are going to be put on the top of trains half a million a million five million does anybody really know how many more will be hurt and lost on their way north this problem should already have been fixed mr. president the time to act is now not out of a political motive but because it's the right thing to do and because you're a dad too let's fix the problem this is actually one of those places where your pen and your phone actually your megaphone is needed use it the American people are sick and tired of political gamesmanship go to Central America and stop the bleeding

thank you mr chairman this manager's amendment makes minor technical changes to the improving mental health access from the emergency department act as a result of agency technical assistance which does not have any opposition uh in terms of the underlying bill thank you for bringing this bill up for a vote mr chairman it is very important that we address the emergency department boarding of behavioral health mental health patients simply because they cannot get good coordinated follow-on care in their communities hr 2519 the improving mental health access from the emergency department act will decrease barriers to mental health treatments for patients getting released from the emergency department by giving resources to emergency departments to arrange for that ideal quick warm handoff between emergency providers and mental health providers access to mental health treatment was already unacceptably low throughout our country when the pandemic hit and the pandemic has put an additional strain on the system in fact it just in march the disaster distressed helpline supported by the substance abuse and mental health service administration saw an 891 percent increase in calls compared to march of the previous year so it is important more than ever to do what we can to help expand access to mental health treatment so the patients can get the treatments that they need and we need to do so by removing any unnecessary barriers that might get in the way in the emergency department i can tell you from first-hand experience mr chairman that sometimes i've i've seen patients who oftentimes come in either due to a psychosis they're hallucinating uh they're or they have uh their first psychosis of an unrevealed schizophrenia or they have major severe mania or very severe depression sometimes suicidal ideation or even suicidal attempts and they need to be evaluated by psychiatric services and provided long-term mental health care but oftentimes the coordination and the transfer of that care is delayed it is not uncommon that they're delayed three or four days and they're just simply being boarded and watched over in the emergency department adding to the overcrowding adding to the uh lowering of resources for emerging for uh strokes and heart attacks and other type of acute emergencies while simply waiting to be seen by a psychiatrist in a long-term care mental health facility i saw a patient once that stayed in the emergency department for eight days sometimes they stay for 10 12 days and every day i go back and i saw that same patient and the status was where we have an observer there 24 7 making sure that patient doesn't harm themselves uh while in in the care in the emergency department but we're simply waiting to to transfer the patient either due to the lack of availability the lack of transportation and others but emergency departments across our country are finding innovative ways to overcome those barriers despite the budgeting and the staffing shortages they're looking at creating transportation programs they're tracking regional inpatient bed capacities to more quickly and efficiently place their their patients where they're needed uh and they're also using coordinated systems communication systems between primary care between mental health between emergency departments to better arrange a more effective and efficient transfer of patients to where they need to go but oftentimes they don't always have the resources to fund these types of practices so this bill addresses this by creating a competitive grant program for emergency departments to develop and implement processes and programs to transition and transfer their patients into more appropriate care for longer term treatments emergency physicians want to help their patients find the next provider quickly and safely and they want to make sure that they physically get there not just leave them to navigate a confusing mental health system alone so i urge everyone to support this important piece of legislation which is supported by emergency department physicians hospitals mental health providers to help patients get the mental health treatment where and when they need it so thank you and i yield back

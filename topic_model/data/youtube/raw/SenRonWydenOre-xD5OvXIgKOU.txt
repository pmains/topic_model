Sherman thank you would you also in our tradition like to give our guests the opportunity to welcome their family I'm going to introduce them oh I see alright after my opening statement ok very good I too would like to welcome our nominees we're going to be considering the nomination of Justin Zinn it to be deputy secretary of the Treasury and mr. Michael Desmond to be chief counsel at the Internal Revenue Service here's where I think things are now the committee has faced unprecedented levels of stonewalling from the administration on letters and policy issues that I never expected I would see we would get similar answers from the Treasury if we posed our questions to the statue of Alexander Hamilton outside the department's headquarters it does go back to secretary minuchin 'he's very first appearance before the committee i asked them that he worked with me to crack down on the abuse of shell companies a magnet for all manner of shadowy illicit conduct mr. minuchin told me the Treasury would get right on it but a year and a half has passed and it is business as usual at Treasury on shell companies and let's be clear this is not something that's a partisan issue I've written bipartisan legislation on this matter with senator Rubio obviously an influential Republican today we're going to ask mr. muth music what he's going to do to end the Treasury stonewalling if he's confirmed now I enjoyed our visit a few days ago and I was particularly struck when you said that you saw yourself as being a building man Deputy Secretary and so I went and read the newspaper articles about you these glowing articles praising your financial expertise previewing your expensive role on tax policy debt management and more it's clear that people quote in the building have a different perspective their accounts suggest to me that calling the nominee mr. Musil niche the building manager is a little bit like saying an NBA all-star is gonna be a nice role player off the bench it's clear to me that the secretary if confirmed excuse me if the nominee if confirmed would be the Secretary's right-hand man and that's why we expect answers to how he's gonna fix these long-running problems bottom line on the stonewalling matter committee members and I are not firing off nasty Graham's demanding the resignation of everybody who's come within 25 feet of Paul Manafort we're not asking for anybody's highschool diaries what we're trying to do is get information that is key to uncovering corruption and protecting our democracy from foreign interference this includes working to determine the existence the extent of the relationship between Alexander tortion a Russian national with close ties to Vladimir Putin and the NRA it includes a request for information that would help determine the extent of Michael Cohen's influence peddling and because the president refuses even though all of his predecessors for a full 40 years did so the president won't release his root ax returns so we have also had a request for information that would help shed light on questionable Trump real estate deals with Russian individuals the list goes on from there at some point this ceases to be a case of the Treasury Department being slow to respond and it looks more like actively abetting the cover-up of corruption and illegal activity the committee also needs to know whether mr. Messina CH agrees with the recent decision opened the floodgates for more dark money into American politics this was a significant tax policy change and our nominee says he's a tax policy guy so there can be an effort to downplay the significance of the decision maybe again will hurt it's fun as a harmless pub policy update but let's be real clear what this is going to mean if you're dark money policy gives Oleg arcs in Moscow reason to throw back celebrit ory vodkas and if they're friends at the NRA have a green light to flood the airwaves with even more election secrecy you made the wrong call last Monday night the Trump administration rested even more control of our democracy from the hands of the American people furthermore if the Trump White House is ordering hasty changes to tax administration policies without public debate in ways that threaten the legitimacy of our elections are those changes going to send after all mr. Desmond as IRS chief counsel is gonna be responsible for carrying out this decision and any proposed changes to IRS rules will have to go through him mr. Desmond must demonstrate to this committee that he will remain independent and unswayed by political pressure from the Trump White House on this and other issues in closing one final tax policy matter that I discussed with mr. Pinnock a year ago members of this committee on this side of the aisle said loud and clear our preference is to have a bipartisan tax reform bill every single member on this side of the dais said that was their preference we put it in writing as I talked to you I wrote to full bipartisan bills one of them with a member of the Trump administration who used to sit right down there senator dan coats but what we got from the administration is that they didn't want to work on tax reform in a bipartisan way people like Bill Bradley sat over here when he was in the Senate so all over the country trying to work with Republicans on a bipartisan bill and in this case a year ago Republicans wouldn't even walk down the hall to work with these Democrats who said that they wanted to have a bipartisan tax plan now we're hearing that there's a new effort for yet another tax bill that would once again be completely partisan House is working on it apparently uninterested in learning from the consequences of strictly partisan tax policy and you and I talked about that you do it partisan you don't get certainty you don't get predictability and it makes it harder for middle-class people to get those jobs to pay higher wages for the long term trump tax law has been in place for months and the quarterly numbers from the bureau of labor statistics have shown that real wages fell over the first half of this year so now it looks like we're just gonna do a repeat of what was done last year a big windfall for the high flyers even more goodies for the most important fortunate while so many typical families are just trying to figure out how to get ahead to me looks like once again the administration is taking a tax code and continuing to split it into people who work for a wage no special deals for them their taxes come right out you're a high flier you can almost figure out what you want to pay and when you want to pay it so our view is going down the partisan route is not the way to go and once again I think you're gonna hear from my colleagues that their preference is to pursue serious tax policy in a bipartisan way and as I told you I put years and years of my own time into this cause so this is an important hearing senator Grassley acting chairman and glad you're going to have the introduction of our nominees and we'll get on with it this is the way we'll do

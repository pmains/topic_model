comedian Pete Davidson made fun of Republican congressional nominee Dan Crenshaw's eyepatch on Saturday Crenshaw lost his eye from an AED blast while serving with the Navy SEALs in Afghanistan but Crenshaw says he does not want an apology here's how he responded I want us to get away from this culture where we demand apologies every time someone miss speaks I think that would be very healthy for our nation to go in that direction you know we don't need to be do we don't need to be outwardly outraged I don't need to demand apologies from them they can do whatever they want you know it's the they're feeling the heat from around the country right now and that's that's fine but I would like him and Saturday Night Live to recognize something which is that veterans across the country probably don't feel as though their wounds they received in battle should be the subject of a bad punchline for a bad joke and eaten and here's the real atrocity than all this it wasn't even funny and

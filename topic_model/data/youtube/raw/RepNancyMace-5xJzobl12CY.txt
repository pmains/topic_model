let's go to congresswoman nancy base of south carolina she's concerned about some of the tax hikes in that infrastructure plan so many she says that they could reverse the job gains that we have been seeing maybe stop them all together congresswoman very good to have you thank you good morning neil thank you for having me on this morning so let's talk a little bit about what of those tax hikes bothers you the most or is it collectively all of them well the two trillion dollar infrastructure package that they're talking about that they're proposing to the american people um you know has very little to do with transportation and infrastructure and to do it this will be the largest tax hike in american history in the middle of a pandemic i can't think of a worse idea than that right now this time and unemployment is at six percent is is not a bad place to be where we are in the pandemic but if we had some of these blue states safely reopen their economies it could be much much better well you know a lot of the democrats and those pushing the president going further on tax hikes congresswoman said this is the exact time to push raising taxes because the economy is so strong and it could absorb those body blows what do you say well they're going to be taking money from the job creators which is going to mean fewer jobs for fewer people at lower pay and this is not what we need to do for the american people we still have millions of people who are out of work that are desperate to get a job here in the state of south carolina our unemployment rates been hovering just over four percent we have employers that are desperately looking for employees right now but because the federal government has incentivized unemployment through larger federal unemployment checks they don't want to go back to work because they're making more money at home so we've got to incentivize you could never you could never actually get away with this in the private sector because in business we reward hard work and we incentivize hard work you know i'm congress when i have you if you don't mind the switching gears just to get your thoughts on yesterday's scary incident on the hill um you were there and spoke out very forcefully after the january sixth storming of the capital uh so there must have been a sense of eerie deja vu here very different i grant you but what did you think what are you thinking now even when it comes to how guarded the capital should be or cordoned off to traffic it might have to be what do you think well the vehicle barriers did work yesterday and this horrific incident i was very concerned when it happened the capital went into immediate lockdown and i was worried about my staff that were in the office and all the staff everyone working on the hill yesterday um is very scary but these right now and i think we're seeing it in many places but this appears to be and we're learning information every single hour right now but it appears to be someone who was who was who had some mental health issues was mentally ill his family and friends worried about him and you know covet 19 is exacerbated mental health issues in this country and we really need to focus on those issues so we can prevent these things from happening get people the help that they need and one of the reasons that i co-sponsored a letter after january 6 also is making sure that folks on the hill got mental health counseling and we didn't exacerbate that issue but my hearts my heart is with the u.s capitol police and the the family of those who who fell the gentleman uh billy billy adams uh the capitol police yesterday that that passed away um the capitol hill police have had a really tough start to this year and we need to be supportive of them i just can't imagine any more tragedy in our u.s capitol hill police family i am wondering whether the guard troops that are still there congresswoman should remain there do you think that that should be the case i don't i don't think that should be the case and the fencing i believe i still believe that the fencing can come down we have lots of trained capitol hill police that are there the vehicle barrier did work yesterday unfortunately in the united states right now not only are members of congress under constant threat but our capital has threats and i think we can take measures that keep people safe and we saw that yesterday with the vehicle barrier that was working we're the freest nation in the world or supposedly and we have open borders but a closed capital that doesn't that doesn't work for the american people when we want to protect our freedoms in this country the best thing that we can do when there are tough times and there is tragedy is to come together is to unite find some common sense measures learn about how yesterday happened and how we can prevent that in the future it's not the first time that a vehicle has hit one of those barriers and that's what they were built for you're right congresswoman well put thank you for coming in on sunday we do appreciate it uh have a safe and very nice holy weekend

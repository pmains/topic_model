really excited to have federal agencies national organizations and state level organizations are you giving presentations today the special thank you to represent midnight urge house key for helping to put this together your staffs have been really great to work with and we dragged a really great job I just had a quick formatting note and then we can get going presentations each of our presenters will be given a ton of Katinas to give their presentations will never have five minutes of Q&A take place after this we're going to try to limit each Q&A to about five minutes and I will be moderate in fact aside please everyone out of here on time but with that we can get going our first presenter is Susie when you choose a director of initiatives for Portland the other work with forefront you are in luck forefront is these nation's only statewide membership Association for nonprofits grant makers public agencies advisors in our allies by education advocacy thought leadership and facilitate left action around the nonprofit sector online so I I hate you art service is to build a vibrant social impact sector where all the people of Illinois and what that really means is you want to make sure that our nonprofits are strong our foundations are strong they have a chance to talk to each other and we all have a chance to complete the missions that we see best work so today are you talking to only nonprofit Friends but some of the resources we have at Portland that are available to everyone as well as ours all right so we are at a library the big fan of libraries and I still have my first library card I got nervous tic writing completely illegible but I still hang on to it we and our friend also have a library much much smaller but still a good library and it is open Monday through Friday noon five and it is open to the public so if you are able to come see us downtown here at 2:08 doubtless out now my great place is Republic and you can access all of our foundation research all of our con and guidebook those are all available to you and we have a lovely front you like rainy please Sarah so I wanted to let folks know you're not able to get there in person number forty-one one my court might not work that's how to get in touch with our library can't make it there in person you can find out what resources are available some of them you can access online and some of them you might be able to get copies up so we have a friendly staff that's always willing to help we also have been up offer private research appointments to the public so you have an idea of what you're looking for or you just have an idea of what you want to do you can make an appointment at no cost with our librarians and really dig into your grant opportunities that are available work front members also have the opportunity to have what we call well profiles those can be a profile of a foundation of a corporate giving entity or also of individuals that give frequently you can request a 20 profile per week if you are a member up front all right so other resources we have computers available that are at links to foundation directory online this is a really powerful tool to see state federal and local foundation that if to causes like what you're working on so you can give really specific searches to find out what you're doing and how it matches we also have these funny geared things that we call folks some people still use them sometimes very good how to turn your present you were sort of sorting through thought which one looks like absolutely the most relevant to this topic I really couldn't get more relevant than that but we have hundreds and then it happens of folks that are available on grant writing on starting a non-profit all of the best practices and again those are open to the public so we had that collection and notebooks in case you don't have anything to take those notes with our library does not circulate but we do have three books that are available all the time so we have changed philanthropy you can see listed listed there give smart and lots of other resources that are available to take so I hope I can keep to your interest in our library and I'm going to talk a little bit more about grant process itself so after this presentation the staff that we spend around a twenty four th yet a lot of great details in it about basics of grant writing where to find a grant how to tell if the grant application is a good match for your organization in here but so I'm gonna highlight for you which pages in that 24 th document are the most important so the first page is when they talk to you about our pages 8 and 9 so when you get your hands on it take a note 8 9 is what we call the prospect worksheet and it sort of goes through all of these things listed here and it breaks it down into a section of the that you're looking at and the organization that you represent and you can talk about okay what are the three main focuses of the foundation and write those down and then the three main focus organization in your work and just quickly see if your alignment or is there not alignment that was a enormous amount of time when you're figuring out which these are the best fit for you so the prospect virtually will also go through Geographic limits that foundations might have types of support and schedule and they offer letters interest and grant proposals when those are open and deadlines so all up in the PDF packet definitely take a look at pages 10 12 so on those we have a sample letter inquiry three years ago a very kind and generous supervisor that I had said always work smarter and harder and what they meant by that was find really good resources and use those so we wanted to cut out a couple of middle steps for all of you and we included a sample letter of inquiry they can get you started on sort of what those look like is what the best things to include are we have a sample need statement and a sample cover letter all right so when you found a branch that's a good match a foundation that's a good match for your organization preliminary research you know where you're going then you want to make sure that you know exactly the guidelines that they're asking for in the previous role that I kind of actually was working enough to afford grant and I can't tell you how many times I received an application from wonderful people doing wonderful work and then nothing to do with the grant funds that I was giving out so that is really unfortunate on both ends that the person that the ladakh spent probably a lot of time on that application and I spent a fair amount of time reading that application but there really was no way for us to come together so again prioritizing your project when you use the worksheets that are yeah you can really figure out which foundations are the best match find those connections and find introductions so we really encourage folks to use your network it's broader than it might be on Facebook on LinkedIn and find someone you know that knows someone at the foundation an organization that's giving that grant introduction even is not the person that is giving out the grant starting that conversation and building a personal relationship is a great way to build towards one day getting everything this is a comic I like to use just to sort of highlight again when I was reading grant proposals in the previous position there were a lot of them that were long and beautifully written into those here it was delightful it was witty it was compelling a proposal but at some point it must ask for money so be really clear about what you need existing the upfront about what your app is and again refresh Becky yep we have a couple of what she said we'll go through what is that your organization is addressing anything more importantly than talking about problems in the feed is how your organization is a part of the solution what are you measuring how are you interacting with the community what does it work it actually makes the change so make sure you have the conditions of the situation the purpose the goal and what your organization does actually make that change alright another cartoon of disparate center we're going to find them all of the proposals that have three identities or left great what this really means that there are often times when folks will attach lots of supporting documents and that is great most people say what attachments they need often those are financial documents strongly for do not anything else alright so I promise to keep this short again a PDF with 24 pages of nominal information there one more actually zoom on highlight before and give this no bunch of questions there is a negotiation tactic often it very much like folks when you're negotiating for a salary and an organization you might be tempted to just take the first offer and everyone says this is similar the process yes no or even if you get questions it's really important to have two backup options already in mind and so we have this negotiated ask worksheet that talks about at okay the the equipment is too expensive here are a couple of alternatives it kind of walks you through what that back-up plan you need so that you're already ready to go because most organizations that are awarding grants it isn't just the desk for an O for conversation so he's prepared as possible [Applause]

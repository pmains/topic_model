if you want to limit government the best way to do it is take the power from Washington from the bureaucrats and fish fruits and send it back to the the American people if we do that across the board we're going to limit the mischief they can do up there in Washington and some of the some of the prices and the cost and so forth associated with that take away their power all of a sudden some of the some of the costs come down into taxpayers in better shape and you're making moral decisions in this area a limiting government also as you do it you're going to expand the economy they're going to create high weights jump weight this went through a lot of what when I support with farmers but on tax reform yes it shouldn't be the IRS bureaucrats and the politicians on the Ways and Means Committee and the interest groups that go into the Congress people's office and try to get special deals they're not the ones that should be deciding how you said spend save invest your own money your money then you should be you and the more we can flatten the code and eliminate the deductions and give that power back to you with lower rates the better now what's going on right now in Washington with the tax reform initiative I generally support because it's a step in the right direction and it's something that's long overdue and I know how these people that thinks and you know what the only way we can reform taxes is if we wait every 20 or 30 years no we'll do this and then we need to keep going back ultimately a flat tax were very few deductions something like a fair tax you know radical tax reform in the long haul is what we need to get to maybe that needs to be transitioned to but that's what I support because that gives the power back to the people in the other areas embrittle Asians we talked about the reins Act we talked about you know when you take the power away from the regulatory agencies and give back to the states you're in good shape you know you look at the waters of the United States a regulation that Obama tried to put out there it's as a stir you know in the last question I didn't get to but there's a war on agriculture in this country and we saw during the Obama administration we see it from the Democrat Party still today waters that the United States was a great example of that you give the EPA and the federal government the power to come up on farmer's land or small businesses like and say oh you know you're shut down go ahead and go to administrative court and try to get your land back good luck you know not every farmers thirty or forty or fifty thousand dollars to do that it would take the power unfortunately and give it to the federal government instead of the person so that's that's an example here's another one work for welfare you know when I was working for congressman staying one in the eighties we carried that bill for the House Republicans and then Newt Gingrich and the Republicans picked it up that's an excellent way in order to limit power and and promote self-sufficiency and drive down cost of government when I I had a job at one time as the director of legislative and public affairs for the Treasury agency of the Financial Management Service it was that agency of governments and nonpartisan part of the government that takes government receipts and makes government expenditures and we were making like you know billion payments half of them were by cheque at forty five cents apiece half of them would buy electronics and I said to my boss why would just make them all electronic and save the government some money he says well Hagedorn we need a bill to get that done if you get it done more power to you so we went to the Clinton administration went to the Congress I got that bill introduced and then we got it through the heavy carry on it passed the house three times the Senate kept kicking it out finally it was enacted in what's called the EFT electronic funds transfer ninety nine and what we were able to do is save about two billion dollars we closed for government check writing centers we have an eighty five percent of our workforce and we improve service to the taxpayers of the United States that's draining the swamp that's what you're looking for in a representative that's my record and when I had an opportunity to use influence and power in Washington I put it to good use for you in the taxpayers and that's what I would do as your Congress

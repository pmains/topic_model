the new Republican majority formed a committee to investigate whether government is used as a political weapon joining us now is a member of the Judiciary Committee as a whole and a former state and federal prosecutor Congressman Ken Buck from the great state of Colorado Congressman government is a weapon when it comes to war when it comes to fighting crime I mean government's not just a weapon it's the weapon but government should not play favorites based on politics is that the gist of this new committee absolutely government shouldn't be involved in partisan politics and and promoting one side of the partisan debate over another and that's what we see frankly with the FBI in in uh recent years you know Congressman uh you and I serve together and the interest of full disclosure we we work together it to me it's almost as if it began in Earnest with a former FBI agent named Peter strzok and former FBI lawyer named Lisa Page I mean I I do remain stunned and it takes a lot to stun me but I remained stunned that the FBI put people with so much political animus in charge of investigating a presidential campaign and rather than admit that it was a terrible thing to do um they said well maybe he was biased but it didn't impact his work which is just a ridiculous standard where do you see the origins of using government as a weap as a political weapon where did it start for you well I I think you can go back a long ways uh Trey if you want to look at FDR using the IRS to investigate his political opponents LBJ used the CIA to gather information on Barry Goldwater actually had a plant inside Barry goldwater's campaign feeding Barry goldwater's speeches to the White House and and the Democrat National Committee um so so the use of government as a political tool has a long history in this country but every time we have held hearings we have tried to stamp it down we have tried to do our best to make sure that we return to government being a neutral player in our partisan politics but I agree with you I would change one of the things that you said though I don't know that the FBI did it as much as James Comey the director of the FBI pulled it out of the Washington field office the case that we're talking about involving president Trump and even the investigation of Hillary Clinton's emails pulled it out of the Washington field office and put it in the headquarters so that the director could directly oversee this this matter and in so doing chose people who were definitely biased one of the people who worked with Jim Comey I believe was was Jim Baker who was counsel for the FBI and then resurfaced at Twitter you've developed an expertise and an interest in big Tech and social media what's the standard for when Congress should get involved with the Googles and the twitters and the Facebooks of the world well I've been on the antitrust subcommittee and so obviously we're looking at competition and we're looking at a monopoly over uh the flow of information in this country and whether that information uh has been biased and as as uh aided one side or the other but I think there are legitimate reasons for government to communicate with big Tech uh certainly if there's a hurricane coming or if there's a series of tornadoes or national natural disasters um and and other instances that that government might have a legitimate reason uh to communicate with big tech and and Twitter Facebook and others what we see here though is a really a much different animal we see government trying to impact policy discussions that sometimes are partisan and when you get involved in trying to suppress that kind of information you're getting into the marketplace of ideas you're getting outside of the the area of natural disasters and other other issues that that governments should be communicating with media former state and federal prosecutor Ken Buck will be on the Judiciary Committee with access to subpoenas and investigating for the next two years so we'll have you back I'm sure there's a lot of work to be done Congressman we'll have you back thank you for joining us on a Sunday night thank you Trey

congressional leaders flocked to the upstate today to talk about the affordable health care act and let's just say they didn't have anything good to say about it yeah senator lindsey graham and congressman both stopped by greenville today to describe their proposed changes to the president's health care plan they think states should have the option to opt out and said why they think the new health care mandate just isn't the answer anytime you pass a law that rewards a company for reducing hours for their workforce it is bad for america anytime you promise that a law will reduce the deficit and it adds a trillion dollars to the deficit is bad for america i think when people see that they were misled or lied to about their coverage and their doctor there's going to be a growing sense that we can do better and we ought to do better

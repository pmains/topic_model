well the people of Kansas really don't need my thoughts or advice on Jerry Moran you know him and like him and have affirmed him in election after election but I got to tell you he's one of my favorites he is a man of integrity principle dedication hard work and he never forgets who it is he represents he is not seduced by Washington he knows that he is the spokesperson for the people of Kansas who elected him and I've watched that over the years and really respected and I think is too little seen in your nation's capital you know we've had a lot of battles one of the things that was the most decisive in the last few years was that our Republican Conference elected Jerry to our leadership he was given the toughest job of the cycle he was given the job of leading our re-election effort to bring more Republican senators to Washington and to in effect fire Harry Reid as a majority leader and that he did we had the biggest victory in almost a hundred years in the United States Senate adding nine new senators last time to allow us now to have every committee chaired by a good solid Republican and not a left wing Democrat Jerry is just a popular leader in in the entire Republican Conference and on the question of immigration we've had a big battle over there for a number of years he stood with me and others to insist that we need a lawful system of immigration to end the lawlessness to create a policy that serves the people's interest the national interest to preserve our integrity and sovereignty at the border what we have now is just totally unacceptable and the big gang of eight bill he opposed it and cast a key vote in opposition to it he opposed the problem of us this huge funding bill that funded President Obama's executive amnesty he opposed that too 11 Republicans did so and I admired that greatly Jerry also on is a leader in a lot of different areas he and I talk on occasion about key votes over the years and he's cast a number a number of votes that o wise and long as a result of his thinking ahead and opposing just the spirit of the moment and asking the right questions in preserving America's heritage of limited government and lower taxes in a lawful system of operation constitutionally for our country so I am pleased to be able to say to you thank you for sending Jerry if he has opponent this time I hope he will stand with Jerry we need him in Washington he is an important part of the effort to make America great to take us on the right path on to adhere to the traditional principles that we as a nation have advanced thank you all for this opportunity god bless and keep sending Jerry to us

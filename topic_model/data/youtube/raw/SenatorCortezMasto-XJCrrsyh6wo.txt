thank you so let me try from a different tactic I'm we asked three of you if you can help me understand the administration's strategy towards Russia's election interference what theory of behavioral change is the administration pursuing that entails Treasury designating a series of Russian entities and individuals on the one hand and has president Trump standing next to Putin and saying Russia's not targeting US elections on the other what what's the thinking that links those two actions can any of you answer that senator I think the president later corrected what he had said during that press conference but the bottom line is that we have been and are you getting clear direction from the president I and in in addressing the concern that I'm hearing from all of my colleagues in a bipartisan manner to address what Russia is in doing and interfering with our election process absolutely senator there so what additional sanctions can Treasury impose again this morning we imposed additional sanctions it's a very active program for us as I've already mentioned we have designated some of the biggest companies in Russia we've designated some of the Putin closest allies who have an enormous amount of wealth which was seriously impacted by our sanctions the impact of our sanctions has also had a worldwide impact for Russia as that it has had a chilling effect on individuals and companies and countries who are considering doing business with Russia because they understand that this mantle there are always nobody come to me Aster's I know I appreciate that and we've had this conversation in the confidential briefing as well which I was not impressed with there is evidence through the Panama papers or Russian Forbes suggesting that several childhood friends of President Putin have come into enormous financial windfalls that raise strong suspicions of corruption these men are just a few of the Russian individuals and entities that experts have suggested should be designated under qotsa Authority does Treasury have the authority under qotsa to pursue these individuals and argue showing them I can't speak to any particular individuals without knowing that their names and circumstances but absolutely we have very broad but you're not aware of those individuals and the evidence through the Panama papers or the Russian Forbes so you're not familiar with what I'm talking about senator we have as you're aware we have conducted with the interagency a very extensive report under qotsa which detailed a number of oligarchs and senior foreign officials who are close to Putin we have a great deal of information about those individuals and and we have we have and we'll have designated a number of them so my colleague just referred to the deter Act do you support it senator I know the administration is happy to work with the Senate on the datura act or any other particular there any language and legislation you have concerns about we're happy to sit down and and provide that kind of guidance I think those discussions have already been well underway mr. Krebs you identified there were five states without paper ballots are you currently working with those states to shore up the integrity of their election yes ma'am we work with all 50 states and you're currently working with those five yes ma'am is there anything that we can do in Congress to continue to support shoring up the election integrity in all of those states and what you're doing in working with them absolutely I think I've already mentioned that when you do go back to your jurisdictions when you go back to your districts please encourage your state and local officials to work with us we hit you know we hit them up every day but I think the more voices they hear we do have I you know I don't want on undersell the the level of work and partnership we're seeing but we can always do more so there was an opportunity to supply or appropriate 250 million dollars to the state's addition on top of the 380 million that was appropriated for the states that the states have utilized are you hearing from those states that additional dollars of the 250 million would have been helpful to help shore up the integrity of their election process oh yeah as we under as I understand it they're in the process of implementing that 380 million dollars which wasn't much needed infusion going forward there will be a requirement for additional funding what what we are trying to help States with is refine what the ask is and really get to the bottom of what is it that they need and how are they going to use it there have been investments at the state level because ultimately this is a state and local respond bility to administer federal elections we are in a supporting role the question going forward is is there money needed how much where is it going to come from and then how are we going to if it is a federal spend how are we going to ensure the appropriate risk-based security outcomes so and besides paper ballots is there anything else that ability yes ma'am audit ability okay thank you I know my time is running out thank you very much

over the past year i am and other members in both parties have received hundreds of requests for assistance from federal retirees who expressed who have experienced significant delays in obtaining their full retirement benefits delays that oftentimes exceed 12 months sometimes as much as 18 months and more in the meantime these federal retirees and no one questions that they deserve and and should receive these benefits but since they're slow processing and antiquated technology they're not getting these earned retirement benefits these retirees face inordinate hardships trying to pay their bills and survive on partial payments while the requirement paperwork moves through the system remarkably in 2012 our whole retirement system is still a paper-based system opm reply also relies upon every other federal agency like the post office and others where federal employee works to assemble and submit the retirees paperwork in a timely and efficient manner but as we've seen with the occasional snapshots that have been taken some agencies literally have a 30 to 50 percent error rate in submitting the background materials uh for the retiree so that opm can appropriately process this process their paperwork and part of the goal of this postal reform i know is going to be to encourage some of the voluntary retirements in the postal system again why this amendment is so timely meanwhile the retirees wait and wait for benefits benefits that they've earned and unfortunately benefits that they can't get access to we continue to hear from recent federal retirees who literally spend eight or ten hours a day trying to get through on the customer service line to find out where their benefits are i'd like to share a few examples of what we're hearing we recently heard from a retired colonel from williamsburg virginia who wrote quote when i retired in march 2011 and at the time of this writing opm has still not figured out my full retirement pay my savings are getting low from here in northern virginia in dumfries virginia we heard from a federal employee retiree who said i've been subjected to superior financial hardship because of not getting my full benefits i was recently told that the bank is repossessing my auto because i cannot afford to make the payments and they're not able to make the payments because this retiree was not getting her benefits she was existing on partial benefits until opm could deal with the processing from warrenton i am seeking assistance from my with obtaining my husband's health insurance which was canceled unexpectedly he worked for dod i notified opm with the appropriate forms and a copy of his death certificate all of which was apparently lost by opm i tried to obtain new forms but was told that would take up to six weeks i am 80 years old and need my health insurance now my husband and i were married for 60 years this is just unacceptable we've been told that the newest opm technology is 12 years old that's pretty remarkable it's simply no longer feasible to expect that manual data entry for retirement and benefits claims makes sense when we have technology that can dramatically lower processing time and increase accuracy opm needs to modernize this technology in the long run but in 2012 they need to at least start taking some short-term steps it is just unacceptable that they rely upon paper processing in 2012. david opm as i mentioned has made some progress but ultimately they still want to remain committed to a paper processing system doesn't make any sense and the kicker is this problem is not new as indicated by this press story federal agencies have routinely point their finger of blame at opm for causing these delays while opm points a finger back at the individual agencies for not getting the information to opm in a timely manner now you might think that this story was written just in the last few weeks there have been actually stories written in the post in the last few weeks about this subject but today i'm quoting from on this story actually may 19 1988 that's 24 years ago ronald reagan was president when this was written and we've had four presidents since then yet opm continues to offer the same excuses and the same kind of back and forth finger pointing between agencies we've seen this show before and it needs to be taken off the air you

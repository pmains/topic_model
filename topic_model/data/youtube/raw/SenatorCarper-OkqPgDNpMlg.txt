I think the president has acknowledged and calls on us to acknowledge the mess that they've inherited is not at their own making it is what it is and what we have to do is to figure out Democrats and Republicans Congress president working together how do we get out of this mess as it turns out one of the ways we get out of is the stimulus package that we passed the key is are we going to implement it in a timely way we implement it well to the extent that we do we're going to put a lot of people to work a lot of folks are gonna get tax cuts will help them increase their spending power we the other thing that's important here is we begin to restore the confidence of Americans and restore the confidence of consumers and I thought the president's message tonight was a good start toward the in that direction we believe that somewhere between 3 to 4 million jobs will be created for the most part this this year in addition to that there people start feeling within a couple of months tax tax costs the effect of the tax cuts four hundred dollars for individuals this year about eight hundred dollars for for families and and there are a lot of other tax cuts that are designed to incentivize for example building offshore wind farms off the coast of of the the United States including off the coast of Delaware to build create that batteries will be able to provide electricity electric batteries electric cars going for there's all kind of stimulus including an attack site as well as on its on the spending side I see the similar package is the first think I like to think of a four legged stool one of the four legs is not just a stimulus package with a successful timely implementation of the stimulus package in a way that provides plenty of oversight accountability transparency so we get it right the second piece is the president's proposed I think very well received in very sound ideas for mitigating against home foreclosures reducing the number of families will end up in home foreclosures a little by several millions of families and that's a very positive thing to third thing that we need to do and we're done a fair amount of work on this we need to continue the work because it's an incomplete right now but we banks need to have liquidity to be lending money back to families for their needs to businesses for for their needs and I would give us an incomplete on that front the third the fourth one is long-term policy approach and and that is what are we going to do to restructure a banking system to restructure of your instructor a regulatory system so when getting this mess again so there's four things successful implementation of the stimulus package to following up in a timely way to reduce the number of foreclosures that would otherwise occur three fix the banking system so that we get the liquidity flowing through your banking system to meet the borrowing needs of families and businesses and lastly how do we make sure this doesn't happen again by a major restructuring of our financial services system but also by restructuring our regulatory system the good news is they're great job our job creation opportunities that come out of cleaning up are reducing emissions of harmful stuff into our hair reducing emissions of carbon dioxide which contributes to to global warming we can put people to work addressing those problems coming up with developing new technologies developing new products to clean up our air clean up or water and so forth and the open dolly put people to work but give us products and ideas that we can sell around the world it just works on a lot of different a lot of different levels we spend more in money and health care by far than any other nation in the world we don't get better results than any other nations in some case we get or poor results we need to find ways to save money save lives make health care providers more productive and there any number of ways to do that one of the many ways the Veterans Administration is Dinah said was harness information technology for the delivery of healthcare saves lives saves costs makes their health care providers weren't productive we can do that not just for the v8 the folks they serve we do that in Delaware we're beginning to do that in Delaware we could do that in other other states as well there are if we don't find a way to rein in the growth of health care costs it'll kill us on the budget side not just federal government but on states through the funding of I was like Medicare and Medicaid the other thing if we don't figure out how to rein in the growth of our health care costs and provide good outcomes good healthcare outcomes we're going to continue to have a competitive disadvantage against other businesses and other countries around the world we've got to fix this with the administration says is top priority it needs to be

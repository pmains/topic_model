report joining us and Congressman Bruce Westerman from house natural resources and Steeples Chief Economist Lindsey pieza thank you so much for joining us tonight it's good to see you both Congressman the president ran away from reporters today after they asked some questions about his Armageddon comment that basically the U.S and by the world faces potential Armageddon similar to the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis over Putin and Ukraine he seems to be saying incendiary comments to donors just like going after Maga voters what did you think of this remark well I think the president needs to stop running away and start facing the problems that he and his administration and Democrats in Congress are creating you know one reason Putin's in Ukraine is because of Biden's weak foreign policies uh the one tool we have to push back on Putin is our domestic energy and natural resources but one is this Administration and Democrats in Congress want to do they want to lock it up and throw away the key and depend on China and Russia for the things that we need and you know running to OPEC for energy when we have it right here at home if we would only develop it yeah I mean two the congressman's point Lindsay by the way Russia invaded Crimea and Georgia under Obama they didn't do that under Trump that's been the argument but Lindsay we keep hearing that five dollar gas is headed our way gas is popping for nearly two weeks straight what do you think well I think right now that is a risk and for the consumer this is a sizable risk when we're talking about negative real income growth we're talking about waning momentum for the broader economy businesses pulling back if we see price increases return particularly at the pump well we know the fastest way to derail the American Consumer is a sustained heightened Energy prices and so this is a very large concern not just for the broader health of the consumer but as we look out to that very key holiday spending season if we're spending more just to fill up the family car there's less discretionary income to spend on other goods and services for the holidays that's an important Point Lindsay just made you know Congressman the White House is now saying yes we need more Supply but just not from U.S energy watch this yes despite being a hydrocarbon is a good thing not a bad thing and the more of it we produce the better we're going to be the more secure we're going to be and actually because it will often replace coal the less hydrocarbons and carbon dioxide we will be emitting into the air okay that's Larry Summers we're going to play the deputy treasury secretary Sam bite later in the hit Congressman so Larry Summers Obama and Clinton official says we need natural gas supplies now we had energy Independence now we have energy insecurity you look at what's happening in Paris France Paris is running out of gas right now because of Refinery strikes right I think Larry gets it unfortunately the administration doesn't get it and it's been an all-out attack on all forms of domestic energy produced here in the United States you know that the main problem with the Biden energy policy comes down to two things it's physics and math this isn't based on science and meeting the needs and the growing energy demand demands globally or even cutting Global emissions this is more based on political science and social engineering rather than physics and actual engineering and then they can't do the math because the programs they're pushing that they say is going to help stop climate change is actually going to do little to nothing or even make climate change worse put more carbon in the atmosphere you know Biden is turning to Venezuela Chevron cannot immediately immediately restart Venezuela's damaged oil fields from communist Miss rural Lindsay let's listen to the deputy treasury secretary on Supply watch this Sandra uh I agree that what happened that OPEC did was short-sighted short-sighted because one of the primary goals is to make sure that energy markets remain well supplied so we're calling on those who own those gas stations to bring down the price rather than celebrating American Roughnecks they go to Communists in Venezuela or they go to radical ayatollahs in Iran hat in hand and a humiliating display begging them to produce just a little more oil what do you think Lindsay well I think this just highlights the broader position that America has found itself in Reliant on International providers be that for energy be that for chips be that for uh important materials in terms of PPE or Pharmaceuticals antibiotics the list goes on and on and I do think that in the aftermath of covet and still facing these very stringent supply chain dislocations this should be at least the beginning a wake-up call to return at least some production back to U.S Shores again be that energy or production of other key Goods for the economy now globalization obviously does have its positives but at some point we do have to at least from a national security standpoint secure the American economy and secure the American public yeah I mean this is Lindsay's point the White House is not ringing the Wake answering the ringing wake-up call that's been you know off the hook right now the White House congressman is now considering having the president declare it again try to do this a climate change emergency so we can enact more climate change policies via his executive powers but we've got the circular turnstile world of Biden the Democrats Biden packed his white house with climate change recruits he and the Democrats got more than 55 million dollars in political donations 30 million this past year from Green groups then they do hundreds of billions of dollars in new green energy spending that goes right back to those climate groups and taxpayers have to pay for all that spending you look at BlackRock led by CEO Larry Fink four former BlackRock officials now work in the White House BlackRock is big on environmental and social policies like you know people like Brian deese or etawal arayama who we just heard from earlier what do you say Congressman yeah um you get the nail on the head and you know I can't wait I hope Republicans gain the majority in November so that we can have oversight hearings on this Administration that's out of control I can't wait to bring ceq officials and before the resources committee and ask them these questions uh there's way too close of a bed fellas there with Wall Street and the bureaucracy especially at the White House and this is causing harm to the American taxpayer it's not accomplishing any of the so-called climate goals that the administration States they want to achieve what it's doing is funneling taxpayer money into investment funds that are used to attack American industry you know Venezuela really thought about Texas and Alaska and Louisiana and what about U.S energy workers final word Lindsey pigs this is at the heart of the story it's about you know Garden variety corruption it's about you know unchecked no strings attached climate change spending going to Grease the palms of their climate donors final word Lindsay well I think it's broadly speaking about the continued expansion of the government balance sheet continued government expenditures that do nothing to support the economy but create long-term barriers to getting the U.S economy back on track something that the Federal Reserve is certainly trying to contend with as we Face a four-decade high in inflation and the economy is still trending for negative growth Lindsey pigs said Congressman Westerman thanks for joining us tonight okay America's crime crisis we've got this

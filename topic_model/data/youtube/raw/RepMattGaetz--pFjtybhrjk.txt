Democrats are fighting for illegal aliens for upgrades to the Kennedy Center and for bailouts for blue states I think is a big difference with the state that lost money because of kovat and the state has been run very badly for 25 years I don't understand why New York can't collect bail money from their own criminals but they expect to be able to collect for non coronavirus expenses from the people of Florida maybe out there in California Gavin Newsom would think about not giving free health insurance to illegal aliens before asking the rest of the country let me ask you though for California's budget deficits that they add well before coronavirus I think sanctuary cities is something has to be brought up it would really have to be kovaydin lated not related for mismanagement over a long time republicans were actually trying to leverage the strength of this economy for our people for our workers for our businesses [Music]

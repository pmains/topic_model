thank you chairman pappas and i also want to thank all of our witnesses both noon returning for participating today and chairman thank you for hosting this joint hearing here um i'm also glad that we're joined by our colleagues from the technology modernization subcommittee good to see you chairman marvel and ranking member rosendale the oversight and investigation subcommittee started this year with a hearing on va's medical supply chain it is fitting that we should return to this subject today the good news is the investments made last year have dramatically improved the availability of medical supplies throughout the country the terrible shortage of n95 mass surgical gloves and other personal protective equipment no longer exist unfortunately lockdowns and hits to the labor market have caused supply chain blockages to develop in other sectors of the economy the bad news is the goal posts for all of va's big ticket supply chain initiatives have moved farther away implementation of demos the regional readiness centers and the medical surgical prime vendor contracts are all further delayed or stalled altogether and based on the new information we've gathered since the hearing in march i'm skeptical these programs business cases still stand scrutiny as oig has reported va fully implemented the demo system in north chicago in august of 2020 after almost a year's delay and the results are not encouraging nimble's failed to satisfy nearly half of the medical center's business requirements and solutions are in the works for only a handful of these gaps this should come as no surprise a study the va commission from mitre corporation in 2018 predicted this it scored demos and logical behind four commercial supply chain management systems it also estimated the cost of demos higher than two of these commercial systems in our previous hearing i urge va witnesses to consider waiting for logical to become available rather than pressing forward with demos only to replace it later and drive up the cost that it was rejected and we now know that logical is delayed until 2025. va's present course appears destined to produce more disappointing results until va can demonstrate the demo system suitability we would be negligent to allow more than a limited deployment i still believe va has a compelling need for a modern inventory management system i encourage our witnesses to re-examine the most compelling options that were apparently ignored and buried in 2018. turning to the regional readiness centers i do not think anyone would dispute that va has an extreme imbalance of warehouse space to inventory and demand for that inventory over the past year va seems to have tumbled from temporary warehouses to temporary warehouse moving into facilities that were available on short notice rather than facilities that necessarily meet the need i understand the va has spent roughly 180 million dollars on the temporary warehouse in chambersburg pennsylvania it spans over 860 000 square feet but va is only using about 10 percent of that space va also has three other warehouses two nearby in pennsylvania and one in california that handle a minuscule amount of inventory what concerns me the most is the very low level of demand for the medical centers for the personal protective equipment stored in the regional readiness centers i have previously expressed my apprehensions that's regional readiness centers would turn out to be places where inventory sat unused just like the supply depot's va abolished 30 years ago that may not be the plan but it clearly seems to be what's happening now ranking member boss chairman pappas and i put forward hr 28 2082 the supply chain resiliency act that would allow the va to partner with dod to gain access to its war stopper program our goal is to use vendor managed inventories to reduce some of the risk of physical inventories in va warehouses we've been extremely patient with the regional readiness centers and waited nearly six months for va to answer our questions about the war stopper program it's disappointing to me that our requests have been repeatedly ignored i think the time has come to pass the legislation with or without va's cooperation finally i'd like to mention the medical surgical prime vendor contracts va struggles managing the program are well documented by gao and others i can't understand why witnesses sought to use dod's mspb contracts and phase out their own however the quarter federal claims ruling leaves no doubt that unless the va comes up with a completely different way of achieving its goal it violates the law i've never heard of a judge before who was so exasperated by a case that he had to quote a poem to express his frustration he wrote in his decision and i quote if there can be a literary analogy to this government procurement it would be long fellows the wreck of the hesperesque which chronicles the prideful sea captain's avoidable downfall on the rocks of norman's well i think it's appropriate to extend the analogy va leaders need to change course before the whole medical supply chain crashes on the rocks it is not too late to do this but time is running out and it's of the essence if they will not i fear the va supply chain will become more expensive but not more resilient we cannot allow it to fail again when veterans and employees are relying on a bus with that mr chairman i yield back

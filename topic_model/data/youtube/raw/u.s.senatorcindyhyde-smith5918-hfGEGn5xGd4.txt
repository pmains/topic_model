sarah hi smith thank you madam chairman mr ruffin is the cattle producer in south mississippi will you please share your perspective on how the cattle price discovery and transparency act will address the three main trends that are negatively impacting the us cattle industry thinning negotiated trade decreasing accuracy of price discovery and diminishing competition in negotiated trade thank you senator hyde smith i think if this bill is passed i think pure and simple is going to create some competition back among among the the bidders on cattle for people like me who have uh either feeder cattle or stockers as we call them and and cow calf and the reason that i think that is because if the packers do have to buy some cattle off the negotiated uh cash market then then it's going to cause more feed yards who may be on the verge independent feed yards are on the verge of bankruptcy now to be back in the market and if i get more bids i just get a better price that's what i've experienced all my life and i haven't been experiencing that thank you for that answer very much thank you madam chairman

day Minnesota's first congressional district spans a southern third of Minnesota from South Dakota to Wisconsin and it's full of farmland DFL congressman Tim Walz has represented the first district since 2007 but he's not running for re-election in a stead running for governor leaving the seat open dan Fein is the DFL endorsed candidate in the first two Republicans are in a primary battle for the GOP slot on the November ballot they are Republican state senator Carla Nelson of Rochester and Jim Hagedorn of Blue Earth Jim Hagedorn is on the line from Blue Earth Carla Nelson was not available to be on the show Jim thanks a lot for coming on this morning Marc it's a pleasure how are you I'm wonderful I want to ask you you are all over southern Minnesota what are you hearing about the tariffs yeah we criss cross southern Minnesota and shake hands with all sorts of folks including some great farmers and agribusinesses I can tell you this about the state of Agriculture down here and frankly we're running on one of our key planks to sustain agriculture in our rural way of life farmers in many respects have been in recession for about four years going back to the middle of the Obama administration production costs were still high commodity prices were low so they just like your previous guests that some farmers have been in a tough spot and getting squeezed as far as what's going on right now with the trade negotiations in the back and forth and I personally don't believe that tariffs are are that productive I think usually they they benefit the governments that impose them and the businesses or the industries that are tried that they try to protect but that's only on a temporary basis in the long run what we want our exports global markets a place for especially our finest agricultural products in all the world to be to be exported to so we can have stable commodity prices and I think it's going I'm sorry go ahead Mike you go ahead please well I think what's going on right now with the what President Trump is up to us that he campaigned on this issue and he said that China and some other countries like Mexico and even Canada had had kind of unfair deals with us over time and that was hurting our overall economy he wants to get this straight I think these in the middle of negotiations there's some crossfire you know coming back at us and I I do believe that the president in the long run wants to work this out so it's going to help all of America you know farmers steel workers consumers all of us alike and I trust that he and his administration are working towards that name you're a big supporter a president Trump we know from our reporting that plenty of farmers are upset about the tariffs is that going to cost you support as you look for you know for support to win the primary election well I don't I don't think so there are plenty of farmers that get that these said that the United States has been taken advantage of by especially China for the last two presidents and even more they want to see this reset and fixed because in the long run if we can have the frequent lower tariffs and barriers it's going to be great for agriculture it's going to be awesome for our economy which today it looks like is growing at a four percent or more clip the the rural areas of our country they need to be supported as well and I think in the long run that'll get done but farmers you know who supported President Trump and wanted a change of direction did so for a number of reasons there are three aspects to farm policy that the federal government can can do to help farmers in agriculture one is to keep production costs low and during the Obama administration we had a war on agriculture you know regulations were costing farmers Obamacare was crushing farmers energy prices that were high tough on farmers you know 40-plus percent of the cost of a bushel of corn is energy so you know we're working on that the Trump administration and people like me want to get in there and help them keep those prices low by reforming government in those areas and then we have the farm bill and the farm bills put together to sustain agriculture in tough times to make sure we have effectively bridge loans to producers so that they don't get run out of business you know when a small farmer gets run out of business a bigger farmer usually swoops in and buys up the land they're not bad people they're not bad operators but that means fewer people in our rural communities holding the land working the land living in our rural communities purchasing things on Main Street and that's what this is all about in the end I think we're going to get all put get put back together and we're going to do the best we can for our farmers and agribusinesses in our rural communities we're gonna take a break in just a minute here but real quickly what do you make of the big aid package the president announced there are some Republicans and are very publicly expressing concerns about it where are you honor I think what that is this a it's an understanding that as the president is negotiating to try to get better deals for for all that there's going to be some crossfire there's going to be some turbulence and he doesn't want to see farmers get run out of business for something that wasn't their fault and I think this would be again the equivalent of a bridge loan to try to get them from this point to the next when things are going to be better and that we have we have deals and rules in place that are going to be good for all of our economy including agriculture Jim this is the third time you've run for this seat why are you the best choice for Republicans well yeah you're right this is the third time in a row just like Newt Gingrich John Klein Kellan Peterson and some others in big districts and I think the reason that we won our party's endorsement was 76 percent of the vote on the first ballot is because they know that we worked very hard in the last election to get our name out there we did it without spending much money on advertising we came within four tenths of a point at forty nine point six percent against congressman Walz in 2016 we kept running we didn't know what the congressman was going to do he's out there running for governor now so the seats open it's the best pickup opportunity in the nation for the Republican Party and we kept going there's been 21 straight months of working the district will walk a hundred parades I'll go to forty two of the possible 42 county fairs over two years we're going to shake hundreds of thousands of hands over these last five years of steady campaigning and I think the other reason is that we stand for what the people believe we reflect the views and values of the folks here in southern Minnesota and and I wasn't afraid to say before that last election if President Trump didn't win that election I felt like we were going to lose the country the way the forefathers put it together and I stood with them then and I'm standing with them now because we need to keep moving our country in the right direction how valuable is that endorsement proving as you near the end of the primary campaign oh the endorsement down here is everything only one time in the history of the first District Republican Party has somebody not sieved endorsement and won the primary and that was actually me four years ago and I when I beat the endorsed candidate but you know we've we built up a very strong grassroots organization in all 21 counties we've been campaigning with County chairs state legislators people in the district to attach to the Republican Party who have been just incredibly supportive and wonderful to help us get our message out you can go on Facebook you know and look at our accounts and you see the sometimes you know 40 or 50 people that come out to help us walk parades and get our message out so we're we're excited about it it's a team effort we run as a team we're running with the Republicans in the district we have an awesome organization led by Dave Fitzsimmons it was chief of staff to Tom Emmer we have incredible support from people like congressman Emmer Rudy Boschwitz the icon of the party Gilt Groupe back who I saw last night at the Olmstead County Fair the former congressman supports us so we're excited about the race and we're looking forward to it alright president Trump was up in Duluth a little more than a month ago trying to help Republican pete sauber do you have any indication that he'll make an appearance in your neck of the woods to try to help your campaign well I travelled to Duluth to go to that event for pete sauber who i think will make a fine member of congress i went up there to shake hands with the people who are supportive of our conservative policies and ask them for support and I'm hopeful that President Trump will come in our district and campaign I invited him two years ago it's an open invitation not that I need to to deliver that to him but we would welcome and it would be a great boost to our campaign and the people would love to see it all right well good luck with your campaign and thanks a lot for being here thank you Mark have a great day appreciate the opportunity you too that's Jim Hagedorn who's running in the Republican primary for Congress

>> Brennan: DAVID MARTIN, GREAT INSIGHTS AND REPORTING. THANK YOU. >> Reporter: SURE THING. >> Brennan: WE GO NOW TO SENATOR TIM KAINE WHO JOINS  FROM RICHMOND, VIRGINIA. GOOD MORNING TU, SENATOR. >> GREAT TO BE WITH YOU, MARGARET. THANK YOU. >> Brennan: WE WOKE UP TO THE IMAGES OF SPEAKER PELOSI AND TOP CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS WALKING AROUND DOWNTOWN KYIV. IT IS A STATEMENT OF SUPPORT. I KNOW PRESIDENT BIDEN HAS ASKED FOR THAT STATEMENT TO BE BACKED UP WITH $33 BILLION OF FUNDING FROM CONGRESS. HOW QUICKLY DO YOU THINK THIS WILL GET DONE? >> UM, MARGARET, WE'LL TURN TO IT AS SOON AS WE GET BACK TO THE SENATE TOMORROW. AND I THINK WE NEED TO PUSH IT VERY, VERY QUICKLY. OBVIOUSLY WE JUST SENT AN AID PACKAGE FOR UKRAINE ABOUT A MONTH AGO THAT WAS ABOUT $13 BILLION, THUNDER IS A DRAMATIC ESCALATION OVER WHAT WE DID IN 2021 AND EVEN BEFORE THAT. BUT THIS ADDITIONAL AID IS NECESSARY TO HELP UKRAINE WIN AND BEAT RUSSIA'S ILLEGAL INVASION OF THEIR COUNTRY. >> Brennan: WELL, WHEN THAT LAST $13 BILLIONON PACKAGE WAS PASSED, REPUBLICAN LEADER MITCH McCONNELL WAS ON THIS PROGRAM, AND HE SAID IF THE UKRAINIANS WANT MORE MONEY, WE'LL GIVE IT TO THEM. YOU DON'T HEAR REPUBLICAN LEADERS SAYING, ASK ME TO SPEND MORE, BUT THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE. SO FOR DEMOCRATS, WHEN YOU TRY TO PUSH THIS THROUGH, CAN THERE BE A COMMITMENT TO JUST HAVING THIS BE A STAND-ALONE AID PACKAGE TO UKRAINE OR DOES IT HAVE TO BE PAIRED WITH THINGS LIKE COVID FUNDING? >> I DON'T THINK IT DOES, MARGARET. YOU FOLLOW THE HELP PRETTY CAREFULLY, AND THE PROCEDURE WHERE YOU PUT BILLS TOGETHER AND WHERE YOU SEPARATE THEM IS QUIRKY AND SOMETIMES UNPREDICTABLE. BUT WE NEED COVID AID, WE NEED UKRAINE AID, AND WE SHOULD DO THEM TOGETHER OR SEPARATELY, BUT WE SHOULDN'T WAIT AROUND. WE NEED TO GET BOTH OF THOSE DONE. I THINK THOSE THREE BIG BILLS, UKRAINE AID, COVID AID, AND THE COMPETITIVENESS BILL ARE THE THREE BIG TASKS AHEAD OF US IN MAY. >> Brennan: BUT THE BIGGER IT GETS, THE SLOWER IT GOES. UKRAINE SAYS THEY DON'T HAVE TIME. SO WHY NOT MAKE THIS A STAND-ALONE BILL? AND IF IT IS JUST A DEFENSE-ORIENTED BILL, DO YOU NEED TO HAVE FOOD SECURITY FUNDING IN THERE AND GLOBAL VACCINE FUNDING IN THERE AS WELL? >> AGAIN, WE CAN BREAK IT INTO SMALLER PIECES OR LARGER PIECES. WE DO NEED TO DO THIS QUICKLY, BUT REMEMBER, MARGARET, IN THE AID PACKAGE THAT WE PUT IN A MONTH OR SO AGO, IT WAS ABOUT $6.8 BILLION FOR FOR MEDICAL AID.IVALENT VIRTUAY Y EVERY WEEK, PRESIDENT BIDEN IS RELEASING 500 MILLION, 800 MILLION OF THE AID. AND WE STILL HAVE MORE OF THAT FIRST PACKAGE TO RELEASE TO UKRAINE. WE NEED TO GET IT WHEN THEY NEED IT WITH THE WEAPONS THEY NEED. AND WE STILL HAVE SOME TIME TO ASK FOR THIS NEXT PACKAGE. I THINK MY COLLEAGUES IN CONGRESS ON BOTH SIDES, WITH VERY FEW EXCEPTIONS, THEY UNDERSTAND HOW SIGNIFICANT THIS IS. THERE IS QUITE A BIT OF PIPE RESOLVE ON THE UKRAINE AID PACKAGE. >> Brennan: SENATOR COONS WAS ON THIS PROGRAM A FEW WEEKS AGO, AND HE SAID THERE AT LEAST NEEDS TO BE A CONVERSATION ABOUT WHEN THE UNITED STATES WOULD USE FORCE, POTENTIALLY, IN UKRAINE. DO YOU THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE A DISCUSSION OF AUTHORIZATION OF USE OF FORCE? >> I THINK THAT WOULD BE PRE-MATURE, MARGARET. I THINK THERE IS A SHARED SENSE FIRST IF RUSSIA WERE TO TAKE ACTION AGAINST ANY NATO ALLY -- >> Presi >> Brennan: WHY WOULD BE IT PREMATURE IF PRESIDENT BIDEN ALREADY SAID HE WON'T SEND TROOPS -- >> BUT HE ALSO SAID THAT USE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS OR NUCLEAR WEAPONS COULD ALTER THAT. WE ARE PROVIDING MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF AID TO UKE, BOTH THE U.S. AND NATO ALLIES AND OTHERS. IF THERE WERE TO BE AN INVASION OF A NATO COUNTRY, OR EVEN A CYBER ATTACK OR THE USE OF CHEMICAL OR NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN UKRAINE, THAT WOULD CHANGE THE EQUATION. FOR NOW, I THINK THE RIGHT PLAN IS TO FLOOD THE ZONE WITH HUMANITARIAN AND HILL MILITARY AID. >> Brennan: THIS HAS GOTTEN FAIRLY TANGLED, BUT WHAT MAY HAPPEN AT THE U.S. BORDER, AND THE END OF TITLE ARTICLE 42, WHICH ALLOWS FOR ASYLUM EKING MIGRANTS TO BE DENIED IMMEDIATE ENTRY -- IS THERE A WAY AROUND THIS ROADBLOCK? DO YOU SEE IT INEVITABLE THERE WILL BE A VOTE ON TITLE 42? >> I THINK IT WILL, MARGARET. WE NEED A VOTE ON THE COVID AID PACKAGE, AND REPUBLICANS HAD MADE CLAIM THEY WANT TO VOT ON TITLE 42 AS PART OF A DISCUSSION ABOUT COVID AID. I AM A STRONGER BELIEVER, WHETHER I'M IN THE MATURITY OR MINORITY, THAT THERE OUGHT TO BE AMENDMENTS AND WE OUGHT TO ALLOW VOTES ON AMENDMENTS ON THE FLOOR. I WORRY A LITTLE BIT THAT SOMETIMES MAJORITY PARTIES, DEMOCRATIC OR REPUBLICAN, SLOW-WALK LEGISLATION TO TRY TO AVOID CONTROVERSIAL AMENDMENT VOTES. BUT I'M ELECTED BY VIRGINIANS TO VOTE ON THINGS, CONTROVERSIAL OR OTHERWISE. AND AFTER 28 YEARS IN OFFICE IF I CAN'T EXPLAIN A VOTE ON SOMETHING, I'M NOT VERY GOOD AT WHAT I'M DOING. I THINK WE'LL HAVE A COVID AID PACKAGE VOTE SOON IN MAY. AND I THINK THE REPUBLICANS WILL ASK FOR A TITLE 42 AMENDMENT VOTE AS PART OF IT. AND WE OUGHT TO SEE WHAT THE AMENDMENT IS AND VOTE IT UP OR DOWN BASED UPON WHETHER IT IS A GOOD AMENDMENT OR NOT. >> Brennan: BUT YOU'VE ALSO BEEN SOMEWHAT CRITICAL OF THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN TO ALLOW FOR THAT BORDER HEALTH RESTRICTION TO EXPIRE AT . WHEN IS THE RIGHT DATE? >> MARGARET, WHAT I'VE SAI IS THIS: TITLE 42 NEEDS TO EXPIRE. IT IS AN EMERGENCY REGULATION. IT NEEDS TO BE REPLACED BY MORE PERMANENT PROCEDURES AND PLANS TO DO A BETTER JOB AT THE BORDER. SO I WAS CONFUSED ABOUT THE TIMING. WE WERE GOING TO HAVE TITLE 42 EXPIRE ON MAY 3, AND HAVE NEW RULES GO INTO PLACE ON MAY 31. I WAS JUST CONFUSED WITH THE ADMINISTRATION'S MESSAGING ABOUT THIS -- >> Brenn: IS IT CLEAR NOW? >> D.H.S. LAID OUT A PRETTY COMPREHENSIVE PLAN, WITH PERSONNEL FLOODING THE BORDER, WHICH THEY'RE DOING ALREADY, PREPARING FOR USE OF EXPEDITED REMOVAL OF INDIVIDUALS WHO CAN'T MAKE A CREDIBLE CLAIM FOR ASYLUM, FOR EXAMPLE. MORE WORK IN CENTRAL AMERICANS AND HELP THEIR ECONOMIES GROW SO THAT THE PUSH OF POOR ECONOMICS LEADING TO MIGRATION WILL AB BAD ABADE. THE RIGHT ANSWER IS PERMANENT FIXES THAT WILL HELP. THAT WAS PART OF OUR IMMIGRATION BILL IN 2013 THAT PASSED THE SENATE IN A BIPARTISAN WAY THAT THE REPUBLICAN HOUSE REFUSED TO TAKE UP. >> Brennan: I KNOW YOU SUFFER FROM LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF YOUR COVID INFECTION. THERE HAS ALREADY BEEN ABOUT A BILLION DOLLAR EFFORT UNDER WAY TO STUDY IT AT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH. WHY IS THAT NOT ENOUGH AND HOW MUCH MORE MONEY IS NEEDED? >> MARGARET, I WOULD SAY I'M EXPERIENCING LONG COVID. THERE ARE PEOPLE REALLY SUFFERING FROM IT. I WOULDN'T CALL MYSELF A SUFFERER. I HAVE A BIZARRE TINGLING SENSATION THAT FEELS LIKE MY SKIN IS DIP IN  ALKA SELTZER. WE PUT A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY IN THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN, AND WE'RE BEGINNING TO DO MAJOR RESEARCH AT THE N.I.H. AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS. BUT WE NEED TO DO MORE RESEARCH, SPREAD THE RESULTS OF THE RESEARCH, AND PROVIDE INFORMATION TO PATIENTS, FAMILIES, PROVIDERS AND EMPLOYERS, AND PROBABLY WE NEED TO

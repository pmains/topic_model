now they told me that i could debut and sing and this would be my debut and sing if i was good enough i could get in the kentucky hall of fame is it right neal but but if you've heard me sing you know my chances are not really good so no so when we heard we were coming here we uh heard all about the story of the lair family and and lair henderson and thought well this would be a good opportunity to talk a little bit about and to give an award and this is an award basically a copy of the words that we put into the senate record talking about and henderson and her family and how they donated the land and helped get this started and how she's been active through the years you know in making this a success so miss henderson if you want to come up i will give this to you there's a there's a cord here all right go around all right good all right and then if you give me your arm maybe we can get a picture with this and if you'd like do you want to give us a word or two no sir you sure i'll bring it over to your chair all right one down 999 000 to go yeah um i'm thinking about see if i can take this off all right i'm gonna be singing i need to be able to roam the stage a little bit well thanks everybody for coming it's good to be here it's been a while since i've been here because nobody's been traveling much and we've sort of held off the last year or so because you know everybody who've been worried about you know getting the virus i think it's getting to the point that where most people have been able to get the vaccine if they want it i saw a statistic today that 85 of people over 65 have gotten the vaccine so that's a pretty good pretty good number and uh i think we're actually heading towards a point where we're going to get beyond this um about a third of the country has had it 32 million people are recorded to have had it but the cdc says about twice as many people actually probably have had it because a lot of young people have it they don't know that they've had it so probably about 100 million people have had the disease and over 100 million have been vaccinated now so we're well on our way our numbers are doing very well as far as daily incidents down dramatically from january the deaths are down dramatically there still are a few things though if you know people who get it that i think are worth stating because they haven't i don't think done a very good job on television and a few people we won't name any names dr fauci but a couple of people there's some important things they could tell us and really probably more important than some of the things he's been saying is that if you get sick with kovid there is a treatment and you have to get the treatment within a window of time and you're probably you can watch tv all day and you'll never hear everybody saying this but this is absolutely without question true you have a window of time as you start to get some people don't get in their lungs so they get achiness and fever and they never really get a cough if you get a cough and your cough's getting a little worse like an early bronchitis you don't even need a doctor to tell you this you're getting a cough you're not feeling that well in the early stages you go in they give you monoclonal antibodies and this is what president trump had chris christie had it uh giuliani got it all of them had both age and maybe a few extra pounds and they all got better and uh that's the other thing you need to know that a risk factor is weight so i had uh somebody that i know that was uh early 40's but was overweight and got in and got very sick so weight's a big risk factor it's age first and then weight and if you've got both age and weight you've got the double whammy but if you get sick there is something the other good news that isn't reported enough about this is actually the death rate's gone down dramatically so back in march of last year when we had the worst time of this we were getting like 30 000 people a day diagnosed with it in january this year we're getting 300 000 people diagnosed with it so 10 times more people but about the same amount of people per day dying what does that mean it means the death rate is about 10 of what it was last march when it first got here new york new jersey it just was just ran rampant and there were some mistakes made putting people back in the nursing home probably not a good idea it turns out that in a group setting the thing spreads like like crazy but the good news i think we are getting beyond this for the sake of music i think it's time to start having performances for goodness sakes we got pretty good weather there shouldn't be any restriction on outside i think the chance of catching something outside is virtually zero and even the cdc which has been a little slow to recognize these things is starting to recognize that so are there are there still rules in place that say you can't have outside performances or well why don't you just say that why don't you say your capacity is twice what you think it is then when you get 50 you're getting a hundred percent of what you normally get there's got to be a way around it so who's the uh probably the most famous person that's come and sung in the area yeah is uh is chris stapleton in the kentucky hall of fame he is not what we're working on what do you have to do i mean you elect him in with your board then he has to accept to be in or what has to all right yeah i'll send a note to him until he's one of you if you guys are because i'm a big fan of chris stapleton that'd be awesome i'll come and listen if you can get him to come sick so maybe we could make it a campaign event too if we get chris stapleton maybe yes now where is he from any from like paintsville wait what say again okay from kentucky though and johnson paintsville is johnson county right somewhere close but anyway uh state chris abelson's good another one that my kids like a lot is a guy named tyler childers embarrassed of him he's from summer up in the mountains too but um as far as the state of the country you know you find that uh if you turn on the television it seems like we're not getting along that well uh i used to say that the television over reported that and that really we were getting along much better than they showed you on the tv now i think we get along less well that they show you on the tv just really we're going in opposite directions and some of it's honest differences of opinion um one side thinks that we should raise taxes the other side thinks we should lower taxes one side thinks we move more regulations the other side needs less regulations both sides well one side says the debt doesn't matter the other side says debt does matter but even those who say the debt matters on my side only about 10 of them actually really believe it so the debt gets worse and worse and worse last year was a big year we had like four trillion dollars extra in debt last year now normally we have about a trillion dollars in debt and it's it's sort of what i call institutional debt you get it every year the main things that government spends money on are medicare medicaid social security food stamps and military and then some other welfare programs but just that spending every year if we have no special spending we're a trillion dollars more in spending than what comes in but last year we added an extra 3 trillion in covid spending and i've always said the answer really should have been should we close the economy down completely or do this but if by doing this the money came from the federal reserve it came out of nothing it's basically we spent all the money we sent checks to everybody but we didn't really have the money the money was created as an accounting trick a leisure domain a sleight of hand and all of a sudden here's money and it works sort of you all got 1400 or whatever went out you get the money you can spend it but then ultimately you discover that as there's more money in circulation the prices rise and and sometimes the erosion of your purchasing power shows that it really wasn't in the end and it kind of makes common sense when you think about this can we create wealth by giving you money well you can at first but at some point there is a point at which people discover there's a lot more money out there and prices rise they do anyway even though they say inflation's not bad inflation's about 1.7 percent a year averaged over the last decade but still means you lost 17 of the value of your salary over the last decade so let's say you made 30 000 10 years ago and now you make 31 000 you probably are behind actually even with minor inflation but now that we've borrowed like 7 trillion in the last year what if inflation goes to 5 or 10 there are people that are squeezed and so when you say they're going to give you free money realize it there is no such thing as a free lunch basically you will pay for it by the diminishing value of your paycheck and it's it's sort of an insidious tax it's a tax that you don't see then the other question people say is well we just need to get the rich rich are not paying their fair share but sort of it's just without question untrue the rich pay almost all of the income tax the top one percent in our country pay 40 of the income tax so it's just not true that they're not paying their fair share they pay most of the income tax the top 10 percent which is about 200 000 and up pay about 75 80 of the income tax and then interestingly people don't know this but it's absolutely true 50 000 and under pay very little income tax they in some ways some people get back money through earned income tax credit or child tax credits and we're expanding that so it's really just not true people say well we want to be like sweden and denmark everything's free and everybody's happy and they're all smiling but the thing is is they do something completely the opposite of what we do so when bernie sanders says i'm going to give you all this free stuff but we're just going to tax the rich that's not what they do in sweden they have all the free stuff all the welfare state but it's done by taxing the middle class and the poor they have a 25 vat a value-added tax which is basically a sales tax so what are we eight percent in kentucky so six to eight six so we're we're we're six percent and so you know imagine that going to 25 and what that would do and what that you know for a working class people would that would mean that's what they do in denmark and sweden so they can pass out free stuff they tax the hack out of everybody the income tax in denmark is 60 at 60 000. so at 60 000 we're just barely getting into the income tax for them because you know you i think what's the standard deductions like 12 000 a person now you have mother father and two kids you're up to like 48 000 of exemption you're not paying much you're paying if you make 60 you're paying on 12 000 whereas you're paying 60 in denmark so really nothing's free is the point you know we want free college the question isn't do you want free college the question is do you want a mountain of debt that you pass to your kids and grandkids and that we maybe destroy the currency in the process or you want to you know see if we can figure out a better way to pay for college so one of the things i propose is why don't we make college tax deductible a lot of people go to college and that's supposed to be for their career so if college cost eighty thousand dollars for four years to go to college and you said well you know i want to deduct that against my income that sounds reasonable and then what it would be is basically if your parents help save for you they would do it with uh pre-tax dollars you know so they put 80 000 in an account it would be 80 000. now you got to probably earn 160 000 to save 80 000 to put 80 000 in an account but if you made it tax deductible that's a reasonable way and it's not free it is helping you a little bit but it's helping you actually with an incentive to work more to keep more of your money it's not money being given to you it only comes from your effort and your work so there are ways of looking at it and thinking about this if we look at the outlook though for the economy i think we're doing pretty darn well considering that we close down every restaurant every hotel all of that unemployment right now is 5.7 statewide it's not good but it's also compared to the eight years of president obama it's actually lower than we were in seven of eight years so we aren't looking at a cataclysmic thing where we all the sudden need to borrow two or three or four trillion dollars more but we just did anyway the covid bill that passed recently was 2 trillion more they're talking about another 2 trillion but it's basically to give free stuff to people and they do surveys on tv and people say well the stimulus checks are really popular well yeah who would have guessed that somebody sending you a check was not popular and i'm not saying anybody sends it back i wouldn't send it back but at the same time i know that when i think a lot of us know that overall it's probably not good for the country why would we do it all the time some people are arguing that when we do 1400 a month for everybody forever wasn't there a point at which we destroy the currency in the country so i think we do need to be worried about that but as far as how good the country's doing i like to put it in perspective when the industrial revolution started like in around 1820 they measured unemployment and poverty and they measured extreme poverty as living on less than two dollars a day and about 1820 95 of the world 98 of the world lived in extreme poverty subsistence level people could barely get enough food you know you never saw anybody overweight the only people overweight like henry viii you know you had to be royalty to be overweight nobody had enough food everybody worked their butt off 98 of people living extreme poverty worldwide by the time you get to where when i'm born in constant dollars in the early 1960s we're down to a third of the world not just the u.s we went from 98 to a third a third live in extreme poverty when i'm born you fast forward to today less than 10 percent of the world and if you watch the evening news you'd never get that they would say racism worse everyone's killing each other and violence is worth actually all the statistics if you look at them are actually better even gun violence as bad as it is and the horrific things you hear overall violent deaths are down but you would never guess it by the news overall opulence and wealth is up so there's a lot of things that have happened in the modern era that we ought to be proud of but putting that all into perspective we need to know where it came from president trump used to say make america great again and my response is you need to know what made america great if you want to make america great you need to know what made us great and what made us great was largely being left alone freedom to contract the government didn't get involved in your affairs of business we had to pay some taxes but we tried to keep them small enough that for the most part you could keep most of the fruits of your labor it was a pretty simple sort of thing but we recognized what adam smith said that trade division of labor you know these were the things productivity freedom of contract these are the things that made america great and i think we still can but we need to remember that my wife and i wrote a book a year or so ago called the case against socialism and who would have thought that you'd need a book saying how bad socialism was because you know they've been writing books for 100 years talking about how bad it is all we have are examples of the disasters of socialism and yet the other side says oh no no that's not what we meant you know stalin is not what we meant that was an aberration he was just a bad guy mal same thing you know that's not the social media he's kind of a bad art castro no that's not what we want pol pot you know the list goes on we get to maduro and chavez you know in venezuela bernie and most of the guys loved him at first you can read all their accolades until things sort of went south but the idea that you can have democratic or voluntary socialism is um not not a well thought out thing and i don't think it's a possibility typically they have elections but it's sort of like playing freshman basketball uk it's one and done you have one election and you're done sort of limiting their their ability to accumulate power but if we don't recognize that we think there's some sort of kind or general socialism we're ignoring history and the scary thing is the polls of young people are now finding that over half of young people think that socialism would be a good thing to try but in our book we start out with the stories of venezuela and we start out with a story of a 16 year old girl who's in a gang and there's four people in the gang but their job is to defend their turf which is for dumpsters besides restaurants so they can get the food thrown out that's what they're eating there are people eating their pets in venezuela because socialism doesn't work but venezuela sits atop more oil than saudi arabia they were the richest country for a hundred years in in south america and yet they've gone to to to chaos inflation thousandfold a month you know nobody can predict prices the money's worthless no freedom of speech so i think we we do need to make sure our young people know that just passing out free stuff and socialism is is so great well then show us where it's worked they all say sweden and denmark and i say well no no it doesn't work they're taxing the rich people it works there because they tax everybody so you want free stuff realize there's no such thing as a free lunch you're going to pay for it through taxes if you want to be like sweden and denmark but i'm optimistic for the future i think things in kentucky can get a lot better we have to use some common sense and get beyond i think anybody who's doing the fear-mongering towards the disease it is a real disease i lost two friends to it it is a real disease we should be careful and cautious of it but we shouldn't uh come up with rules and ideas that have nothing to do with the facts and so we're gonna have a really big vote coming up in the supreme court in june it's going to be about whether or not the state legislature can restrict the emergency powers the governor has he basically has said he has the ability to determine concert venues restaurant venues hotels all these things the legislature came in abbreviated his powers and he said i'm going to sue you so he's suing the legislature right now and that case is going to come to the kentucky supreme court he's arguing and josh will tell you this he's arguing that he has inherent powers that god anointed him with powers that are not in the constitution but that are his and cannot be abbreviated by the by the legislature this goes against every fundamental precept of the division of power of checks and balances and so this case is incredibly important if you know people in the supreme court there's not many of them there's seven of them if you see them in the grocery store you tell them this is about the most important thing that you can think about it's going to be the most important decision in a generation and we can't have a country that has no checks and balances or a state that has no checks and balances so i think you all have done a great job but it worries me you know and people should watch this case because the supreme court decides they cannot they gave him the power they gave the governor these powers in the 1990s and all they did was amend their own statute and the supreme court says they can't do that we've got a real problem you know people want to accuse president trump of being an authoritarian what is more authoritarian than a governor saying he doesn't take any um restrictions by the state legislature and that he's going to make up all the rules on how many people can be in a hotel or restaurant forever that that is unbounded power that we have to do something about so i would definitely talk to your state representatives about this and watch this case because this is going to be before the kentucky supreme court in june but overall i am optimistic towards the future i think that as we move forward there's a lot of great things about the country and we shouldn't let people tear down the country we need to be talking about what a great country we have and where we go in the future thank you all for coming out you need assistance with federal agencies please contact our bowling green office or visit our website

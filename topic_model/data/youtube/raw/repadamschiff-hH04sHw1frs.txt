MIGHT ADDRESS SOME OF THE  THINGS WHICH HAVE HAPPENED IN  THE PAST, WHAT MIGHT BE DONE  TO PROTECT POTENTIAL  VIOLATIONS OF OUR DEMOCRACY IN  THE FUTURE. FOR MORE ON THAT  FRONT, I AM JOINED BY  CONGRESSMAN ADAM SCHIFF, ONE  OF THE SPONSORS OF THE  PROTECTING OUR DEMOCRACY ACT.  CONGRESSMAN, WELCOME BACK TO  INSIDE THE SHOES. THANK YOU.  IT'S GREAT TO BE WITH YOU.  WHEN PEOPLE HEAR YOU AND YOUR  COLLEAGUES MAKE THE CASE THAT  OUR DEMOCRACY EASE IN DANGER,  SOME MIGHT THINK, OH, I'VE  HEARD THIS BEFORE. THIS IS  POLITICAL POSTURING. THIS IS  HYPERBOLE. I KNOW THAT YOU'RE  QUITE SINCERE AND PASSIONATE  ABOUT THIS. CAN YOU EXPLAIN  THE CURRENT THREAT AS YOU SEE  IT AND WHY THIS LEGISLATION IS  NECESSARY? YES, THANK YOU  KNOW, I SEE HAS REALLY BEEN AT  RISK OVER THE LAST 4 YEARS AND  WE'VE BEEN MOVING IN THE WRONG  DIRECTION. THE BILL THAT I  INTRODUCED IN TECH AND  DEMOCRACY ACT AIMS TO  REINSTATE THE GUARDRAILS THAT  PROTECT DEMOCRACY IN THE PAST.  SO, FOR EXAMPLE, IS THE  PROBLEM OF THE PRESIDENT TO  SIMPLY SAYS I'M GOING IGNORE  ALSO I'M GOING TO FIND  CONGRESS IN VIOLATION OF THE  SEPARATION OF POWERS. THIS  EXPEDITE COURT ENFORCEMENT OF  CONGRESSIONAL SO THAT WE CAN  GET ANSWERS FROM  ADMINISTRATION. SO THE CUMRU  WE CAN REVEAL CORRUPTION OR  WRONGDOING, IT WOULD ALSO  PREVENT PRESIDENT FROM USING  THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AS  THEIR OWN PERSONAL LAW OR TO  PERSECUTE PROSECUTE THEIR  POLITICAL LIST. IT PROTECTIONS  TO PROTECTIONS FOR INSPECTOR  TO BE FIRED. ONLY IF THERE'S  GOOD CAUSE, IT HAS PROTECTIONS  FOR WHISTLEBLOWERS. IT  PREVENTS ABUSE OF THE PARDON  POWER. IT PREVENTS A PERSON  FROM COMMITTING A CRIME. WHILE  I'M IN OFFICE AND AVOIDING  ACCOUNTABILITY BECAUSE THE  CAMPIAGN TIME WHILE THEY'RE IN  OFFICE AND ESSENTIAL IMITATION  MONTHS BEFORE THEY GET OUT OF  THESE PROBABLY A DOZEN OR  REFORMS. MAKE NECESSARY BY THE  ABUSES OF THE LAST 4 YEARS.  THOSE ABUSES QUE MENTALLY  ALONG WITH OTHERS THAT ARE  GOING ON NOW TO TRY ERODE  PEOPLE'S RIGHT TO VOTE,  JEOPARDIZED OUR DEMOCRACY. IT  OUT TO MARC SAYS, COME TO AN  YOU HAVE NOT MENTIONED HIS  NAME SPECIFICALLY, BUT HEARING  THIS LONG LIST OF PROVISIONS  IN THIS LEGISLATION. AS YOU  MENTION THE PAST 4 YEARS, IT  REALLY SEEMS IN MANY WAYS LIKE  THIS ACT IS IS TAILOR MADE FOR  DONALD TRUMP AND YET ON THE  PROTECTING OUR DEMOCRACY  WEBSITE TO YOU AND YOUR  COLLEAGUES CLEARLY STATE THAT  THE FORMER PRESIDENT IS A  SYMPTOM AND NOT A CAUSE. CAN  YOU EXPLAIN WHAT YOU MEAN BY  THAT? YES, YOU KNOW WHAT, WHAT  TRUMP DID HIS REVEAL SO MANY  OF THE WEAKNESSES IN OUR  SYSTEM CRACKS IN THE  FOUNDATION OF OUR DEMOCRACY  THAT COULD BE EXPLOITED BY AND  UNETHICAL. PRESIDENT AND AND  IT'S IN THE INTEREST, I THINK  OF BOTH PARTIES FOR US TO  CLOSE THOSE FISSURES IN OUR  SYSTEM TO MAKE SURE THAT  WHOEVER COMES IN THE FUTURE,  WHETHER IT'S A DEMOCRAT PERSON  TO REPUBLICAN, ONE, IF TO  CORRUPT THAT OFFICE AND ABUSE  THEIR POWER AND TRYING STAY IN  POWER EVEN WHEN THEY LOSE. AND  WE SAW THE LAST PRESIDENT TO  PLAY A CLIP FROM THIS AND 10,  2 OVER THROUGH THE RESULTS OF  POPULAR ELECTION THAT HE LOST.  WE NEED TO PUT IN PLACE  PROTECTIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT  CAN HAPPEN BECAUSE IT ALMOST  HAPPENED. AND SO FOR THOSE WHO  THINK, YOU KNOW, ISN'T  HYPERBOLE TO SAY THAT OUR  DEMOCRACY IS RISK. IT'S NOT AT  ALL ON HER DEMOCRACIES  GENERALLY COME NOT THROUGH  VIOLENT THROUGH THE SLOW A  DIMINUTION DEMOCRATIC THROUGH  CAUSEY LEGAL MEANS THAT THE  ROAD A DEMOCRACY AND THAT'S  WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GUARD  AGAINST. YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF  COLLEAGUES FROM ALL OVER THE  COUNTRY WHO SUPPORT THE  PROTECTING OUR DEMOCRACY ACT,  BUT THEY ARE ALL DEMOCRATS.  I'M CURIOUS WHAT THE RESPONSE  HAS BEEN FROM YOUR COLLEAGUES  ACROSS THE AISLE TO DATE AND  GIVEN HOW WE TALKED EARLIER IN  THE PROGRAM ABOUT THE GEORGE  FLOYD JUSTICE IN POLICING ACT,  WHICH THINGS THAT COME TO AN  IMPASSE THERE. ARE YOU  CONCERNED THAT THIS  LEGISLATION MIGHT FIND A  SIMILAR FATE OF THE BILL HAS  VERY STRONG BIPARTISAN SUPPORT  IN THE COUNTRY. THESE ARE ALL  GOOD GOVERNMENT REFORMS THAT  ENJOY THE SUPPORT OF DEMOCRATS  AND A GREAT MANY REPUBLICANS.  FACT, THERE ARE NOW 150 GOOD  GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS, BOTH  LIBERAL AND CONSERVATIVE THAT  ARE URGING CONGRESS TO PASS  THIS LEGISLATION IN THE  CONGRESS. SO MANY REPUBLICAN  MEMBERS THAT LIVE IN FEAR,  RETRIBUTION FROM DONALD TRUMP  AND TO THE DEGREE THAT THEY  VIEW THIS BILL AS AN  CRITICISM, ABUSE OF POWER LAST  4 YEARS, THEY MAY BE TOO  INTIMIDATED BY FORMER  PRESIDENT TO TO SUPPORT THE  BILL. I HOPE THAT'S NOT THE  CASE OUT THE US TO SHUN THEIR  FEAR OF DONALD TRUMP. BUT TIME  WILL TELL. ANY PROVISIONS IN  THE BILL, I'M NOT ONLY A  REPUBLICAN SUPPORT IN THE  PAST. THEY HAVE A REPUBLICAN  SPONSORS OF THESE PROVISIONS  IN THE PAST. SO IF THEY'RE  REALLY TRUE TO ANY IDEA AT  ALL, THEY SHOULD SUPPORT THIS  MAKE SURE THAT THE PRESIDENT  TO BE A PARTY CAN'T ABUSE OF  POWER. CONGRESSMAN SCHIFF JUST  A FEW MOMENTS, WE'RE GOING TO  TAKE A LOOK AT THE SITUATION  THAT'S BEEN DEVELOPING ON THE  BORDER IN TEXAS AND THE  RESPONSE TO HAITIAN IMMIGRANTS  WHO HAVE BEEN SEEKING III  IMAGES OF WHITE BORDER PATROL  OFFICERS ON HORSES ROUNDING UP  THESE IMMIGRANTS HAVE REALLY  BEEN DISTURBING TO A LOT OF  PEOPLE WHO'VE SEEN THEM. YOU  RECENTLY TWEETED AND I'M  QUOTING HERE, REPORTS OF THEIR  MISTREATMENT ARE A STAIN ON  OUR LEGACY. THOSE RESPONSIBLE  MUST BE HELD TO ACCOUNT AND  CURIOUS. WHAT DO YOU ENVISION  IN TERMS OF BEING HELD  RESPONSIBLE AND TO WHAT EXTENT  SHOULD THE CURRENT PRESIDENT  JOE BIDEN, WHO, OF COURSE,  PROMISED A FAIR AND HUMANE  IMMIGRATION SYSTEM BE HELD  ACCOUNTABLE FOR WHAT'S BEEN  HAPPENING IN RECENT DAYS. I  THINK WE NEED A THOROUGH  INVESTIGATION OF WHAT TOOK  PLACE AT AND THOSE WHO ARE ON  HORSEBACK AND WERE MISTREATING  PEOPLE IN. THOSE IMAGES ARE  REVOLT THEY NEED TO BE HELD  ACCOUNTABLE IN EVERY WAY THEY  CAN UNDER THE LAW. I CERTAINLY  THINK THAT THOSE THAT ENGAGE  IN THAT KIND OF MISTREATMENT  TO LOSE THEIR JOBS. BUT  DEPENDING ON WHAT THOSE  ACTIONS READY, BROUGHT ABOUT  INJURY TO OTHER HUMAN BEINGS  MAY GO BEYOND IN TERMS THE  PRESIDENT, THE PRESIDENT, THE  BUCK ALWAYS STOPS WITH AT THE  SAME TIME, WE DON'T EXPECT THE  PRESIDENT TO AT THE BORDER ALL  THE AND OVERSEE EVERY ACTUALLY  SO MANY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS,  INDEED, MILLIONS TO WORK FOR  THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. BUT IT  CERTAINLY RESPONSIBILITY MAKE  SURE THAT THE INVESTIGATIONS  ON INTERFERE WITH THAT  OBJECTIVE AND THAT WE TREAT  PEOPLE HUMANELY. BOOST IN THE  CONTINUING SITUATION WITH  THESE MIGRANTS, BUT ALSO IN  OUR IMMIGRATION POLICY.  OVERALL. ADAM SCHIFF  REPR

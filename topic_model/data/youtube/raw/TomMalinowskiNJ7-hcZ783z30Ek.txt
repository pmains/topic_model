now is new jersey congressman tom balinowski a democratic member of the house foreign affairs transportation and infrastructure and homeland security committees welcome back to the broadcast it's good to see you so let's get into this with president biden who as you know heads to brussels this week to meet with the nato leader so what is the goal of this trip in your eyes and what do you want to see come out of it it's all about unity nato is more united today i think than it has ever been in a national security crisis and that's been essential to our success but nato is going to be tested we are all going to be tested in in the coming weeks so i think job one here is making sure that all of our allies are prepared for anything that putin might do including testing article 5 the nato defense commitment including use of unconventional warfare that might be designed to to terrify us into making concessions to him so that's number one number two uh continuing the effort that is already underway to deliver weapons to the ukrainians from particularly our eastern european allies that have air defense systems like the s 300 and other systems that the ukrainians can use right away effectively to beat back the russians and then i think number three is talking about energy independence about helping the european countries break free of their dependence on russian gas and oil because that's the the last thing that's keeping the russian economy going yeah uh otherwise very strict sanctions point well taken uh certainly that third point as well relative to europe so let's talk about white house press secretary jen saki who tweeted today that there are no plans for the president to travel into ukraine during his trip on the face of it do you think or maybe you would think perhaps that if the us is not sending troops into ukraine why would we put the president in that situation so would you agree with this decision i mean is this the right move keeping the president out of ukraine i i used to i worked at the white house i traveled the world with the president i i know uh the the the multiple layers of security that go with that and so you know i i would not want to be the the secret service officer planning that trip you know that said um this is this is a war of symbols and gestures as much as it is a war of steel and um one way or another i i would be advising the president uh to think about um symbols and gestures that demonstrate our commitment and and our support and our strength so i i won't go beyond that uh because i don't i do not want to be providing security advice to the president of the united states i can about imagine that said though i mean given the the end of your statement if the president were to go could that also be viewed as a provocative move you know i i think we're making a little bit too much of uh of of the provocation arguments and and and i say that as somebody who does not support any direct military involvement by the united states in this conflict i think a no-fly zone would be a bad idea for ukraine as well as for us for example but but i i i i wouldn't go too far in the direction of allowing putin to make uh our decisions for us okay so one more question on this vein if you could guarantee the security if you weren't the guy in the secret service planning the president's trip would you want to see him go to ukraine i i would want to see the president standing with ukraine in every way possible let me just put it that way so would you like to see him go to ukraine yes of course but but that's but you're asking me to uh not take into account the president's security which in the real world you have to take into account um but beyond that yes anything you know i i'm more i'm more focused on the practical support this is a war and i want those brave ukrainian soldiers and civilians not just to survive but to triumph but you know we are also trying to rally the american people and the people of the world in defense of freedom and symbols do matter so um [Music] but i can't set aside the security issue in advising joe biden what to do so understandably uh let's talk about reuters reports which is that turkey's foreign minister says that russia and ukraine are nearing agreement on critical issues he's hopeful for a ceasefire on the diplomatic side of this we have also seen countries like france and germany they're making frequent calls with vladimir putin so do you think it would help or hurt to add the u.s to these diplomatic efforts direct diplomatic efforts i should say direct yeah well i i don't look i i think we got to have a ceasefire we need to see uh the russians stop shelling these ukrainian cities and stop killing ukrainian civilians uh president biden uh had multiple conversations with putin before the war we told putin exactly what we would do if he made this mistake we're now doing it i think uh you know i know the administration is in touch with third countries that have been talking uh to the russians i don't think there's much to be gained by having some sort of putin biden summit uh without any realistic expectation without any sense from the russians that they are prepared uh to stop this daily bombardment if we get to that point then yeah of course i'd support any diplomatic effort that that would lead to the result that we want but right now we've got to focus on beating them in the field so that they feel like they've got an incentive to have that kind of conversation and and to that extent congress has pushed the president has signed a lot of military funding for ukraine is there any sense among your colleagues that there's room for more diplomatic considerations from the u.s side that all this military aid somewhat overshadows even modest discussions of diplomacy talking about diplomacy we need to support the ukrainians here um we can all have our own opinions about how this war might end how this war should end they are the ones doing the fighting they are the ones doing the dying we should not be telling them what to do in any negotiations with russia we should support whatever they end up doing um and so you know that that should be that should be our message right now if the ukrainians ask for our help uh in negotiations we should provide it but they've got to be in the lead uh where where we need to make a decision ultimately and this would be a good problem to have is what to do with the sanctions that we have imposed uh you know do we if there is some sort of ceasefire or diplomatic agreement do we lift some of the sanctions um do we do we continue to put sanctions in place and to leave the sanctions in place until uh there's some accountability for what uh putin has done until um russia for example contributes to the reconstruction of ukraine those are going to be the decisions we have to make only the ukrainians can decide how this ends because they are the ones on the front lines well another variable in in whether or not sanctions get reduced to any degree or removed amid this war what is your assessment of threats to the u.s homeland there's a new article you may have seen in box and it asks is russia holding back from cyber war russia's military losses may have impacted its cyber tactics since the invasion started sir we've heard warnings of retaliatory cyber attacks against the west is this still a threat or have russia's cyber capabilities been either impacted or overestimated i think it's still a threat it's interesting that it hasn't happened i would say that one of the uh really important things that the biden administration did here was to warn the american people american industry and people all around the world that this invasion was likely to happen we used that time to strengthen our cyber defenses we've also info you know the russians understand very well that we also have very strong cyber offense so that if they were to hit us if they were to hit a critical utility or a pipeline or something important in the united states we could and i believe would do exactly the same thing to them so i'm only speculating here but perhaps putin has decided that he does not want to absorb that pain on top of all the other pain that we are inflicting on his economy new jersey congressman tom malinowski thank you so much for your

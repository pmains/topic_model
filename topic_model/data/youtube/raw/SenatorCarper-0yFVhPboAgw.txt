seventy-five years ago President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed into law one of the most significant pieces of legislation in our nation's history the servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944 better known to all of us as the GI Bill the GI Bill changed the lives of millions of veterans including my own father world war ii veteran by spurring economic opportunity and helping to create the middle class as we know it today that's why this week I'm proud to reintroduce bipartisan resolution here in the Senate along side my colleague senator Johnny Isakson and John tester that recognized the historical significance of the GI Bill and designates this week as national GI Bill commemoration week there's good reason why the GI Bill is often referred to as the greatest legislation after World War two millions of returning veterans flooded our nation's colleges and universities and vocational schools it was the GI Bill that made financial support education and home loan programs available to those 16 million veterans returning home and helped to usher in an era of unprecedented economic expansion according to a 1988 report from the Joint Economic Committee it was estimated that for every dollar the United States invested in the GI Bill about seven dollars were returned in a economic vote for our country those big returns on a worthy investment but thanks the original GI Bill four hundred fifty thousand engineers 240 thousand accountants 238 thousand teachers 91 thousand scientists 67 thousand doctors 122 thousand dentists and thousands of other professionals entered our country's workforce my own life was also changed because of the GI Bill and after returning from three tours of duty in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War I was able to use my GI Bill benefits at the University of Delaware to pursue a master's degree in Business Administration and two years later I emerged with my MBA was long before that the people of Delaware elected me State Treasurer at the tender age of 29 like many veterans my career wouldn't have been possible without the GI Bill it's part of the reason why I worked so hard in the Senate to help military and veteran students and their families today's veterans can take advantage of the post 9/11 GI bill an incredible benefit that pays the full constituition of public colleges and universities a generous housing allowance book stipend and even be transferred to the veteran spouse or children if the veteran doesn't use it this week we celebrate the importance of the GI bill over the past 75 years which has enabled hundreds of thousands of veterans including me and my dad to pursue our dreams and contribute to our economy and we reaffirm our commitment to make sure every veteran today as a similar experience and gets the most out of their hard-earned GI Bill benefits so please join me in wishing the GI Bill a happy 75th birthday and here's to another 75 years of improving the lives of our nation's veterans for years to come thank you

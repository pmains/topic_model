john and i are here because after a long dark night in which we've lost over half a million americans and our economy has suffered such great loss there is finally light at the end of this long and dark tunnel we just wanted to take a moment to thank the people of georgia for giving us an opportunity to represent you in the united states senate and early this morning we were able to deliver on our promise to georgia to pass historic covet 19 relief and georgia in a very real sense as delivering relief to the whole country 8 billion dollars uh to our state and local governments right here in georgia some four billion dollars to reopen schools five billion dollars nationally for farmers of color two billion dollars here in the state to help us finally expand medicaid and so uh help is on the way relief is right around the corner and it's because of what georgia stood up and did on january 5th and for that we're so grateful thank you senator and as senator warnock mentioned this morning the united states senate passed historic covid relief the united states is turning the corner in this long pandemic this bill when it becomes law will deliver thousands of dollars of economic relief to working families here in georgia more than four billion dollars to safely reopen schools right here in georgia this legislation when it becomes law will ensure every georgian can get a covid19 vaccine for free light is indeed at the end of the tunnel we have turned a corner and had georgia voters not stood up in record numbers in january this legislation could not have been passed and so the whole country owes a debt of gratitude to georgia voters for empowering the united states senate to pass this historic covid relief and with that we're happy to take any questions you have you can go ahead can you talk about some of the changes that you guys decided on and now it goes back to the house and whether or not you know there's some concern they'll accept those changes well listen there is no question that this legislation will pass and so it'll go back to the house they'll pass our version we'll go to the president he will sign it but i want you to think about some of what's going to happen um we are about to cut child poverty in this country in half this is historic legislation and um the process is what it is but the result uh is what we were after and we got results this morning can you talk about the minimum wage were you disappointed that that didn't go through we're going to continue to fight uh john and i have been in the fight with 15 for years as activists and now that we're united states senators that won't change america deserves a living wage workers deserve a raise it's the right thing to do for workers because when they get relief they buy you know food baby diapers coats it's the right thing to do for workers but it's also the smart thing to do for the economy and we won't rest until we get fifteen dollars minimum wage we're gonna we're let me just say we're gonna keep fighting for that 15 minimum wage and this is the most substantial economic relief package for working class and middle class americans ever passed thousands of dollars of direct economic relief and tax credits for georgia families more than four billion dollars to reopen schools safely here in georgia we secured two billion dollars for medicaid expansion in this state that will transform public health in georgia obviously this was made possible by a huge voter turnout from january currently in the georgia legislature there is a law that some think is going to secure voting others think it's going to disenfranchise people that are trying to vote do you have any comment on that bill there is no question that certain politicians under the gold dome are engaged in voter suppression that's what passed a few days ago it's a voter suppression bill it's unfortunate that politicians who didn't like the outcome of what happened in november and in january instead of adjusting their message to where the voters are they're trying to cherry-pick their voters it will not stand which is why we're going to pass the for the people act which will expand voting not restrict voting we're going to pass the john lewis voting rights act and the stakes on that are so large that for us to get that done in the senate all options are on the table the amount of money that families are slated to get do you think it's enough this is again the most substantial economic relief for working class and middle class families ever passed in legislation and this bill will become law thousands of dollars for working in middle class families in direct economic relief and tax credits and we held the line on that to ensure that georgia families get what they need we fought hard to ensure the georgia families get what they need and georgia families will get the economic relief that they need to stay on their feet in this crisis and we have turned the corner with this legislation in this pandemic we passed this legislation because georgia voters elected us to do so and we secured the senate majority but we do encourage everybody to continue to wear masks to practice social distancing to follow cdc guidelines as we continue to battle this pandemic and when it is your opportunity to do so by all means get the vaccine that's all the time thank you so much thank you so much thank you

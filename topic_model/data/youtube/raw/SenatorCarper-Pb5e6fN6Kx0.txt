some people wonder what though what cap-and-trade legislation climate change legislation mean in terms of energy costs for household think for the most part the most expensive increase for for some of us will be about a price of 44 cents a day it's about the price of a postage stamp about 170 dollars in the course of the year for that cough costs would be offset by a number of things one far more energy-efficient appliances and right there just with a lot of conservation and energy efficiency watching use less but if you use not no less and continue to be an energy inefficient advice would be for for some some of us about the 44 cents a day for the low-income my folks that costs will be fully fully offset but what's going to happen is we'll find ways to be more energy efficient will buy more energy efficient air conditioner motor energy-efficient dryers or clothes more energy-efficient and refrigerators as well

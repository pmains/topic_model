representatives from the company Facebook met with the Senate Intelligence Committee staff last week as of yesterday the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee Senator Mark Warner Virginia said that as far as he's aware Facebook didn't disclose to his committee this new information that's sent by The Daily Beast that in addition to buying ads on Facebook to try to influence the election Russian operatives also used Facebook to try to organize in-person protests across the United States during the 2016 campaign joining us now for the interview is Senator Mark Warner he's vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee senator Warner really appreciate your time tonight thank you so much for being here thank you Rachel so let me ask you first I have a few questions about this Facebook issue sure did Facebook disclose to your committee the fact that in addition to Russia funding ads related to the election they also used Facebook to try to organize real events did they disclose that they've they've confirmed that when they met with your committee no they did not Facebook we'd made a request they sent a team in and remember we're talking about Facebook where which over half of Americans use every day we've made these enquiries back last winter saying that we heard and we thought that Facebook was both being manipulated by some of the Russians as were fake accounts they were using this to in effect geo target ads at certain communities to try to depress vote in the election and Facebook's initial reaction was now that's crazy there's nothing there well we now come to find again Facebook that half the Americans used to get their news from every day that everything we said and more was true they came in made a presentation said there was a hundred thousand dollars plus of paid advertising there were 3,000 plus ads purchased and in that presentation I they showed the staff certain of that certain of those ads but they didn't allow the staff to keep any of that material and I went back I figured you'd ask this question and to my knowledge they made no reference to this effort to try to bring about protesters to an anti-muslim anti-immigrant rally it's why I think that we're still at the tip of the but the fact is I don't think that the resources the time and I think there's a lot more they discovered one of the troll farms that came out of Saint Petersburg my understanding is they didn't even go back and check all those accounts to see if they had put out put out other ads we know from past reporting that there are a number of these troll and other efforts internet-based efforts that came out of other countries in Eastern Europe that Russia was known to organize we've not had any evidence that they investigated those efforts as well so I think there's a lot more questions I believe we I have more questions coming out of their staff interview than got answered but clearly there's a lot more questions that need to be asked and answered and in terms of their willingness to answer those questions and your ability to to compel them to I was interested to see Facebook's response to Bloomberg news today Bloomberg was reporting on this controversy over whether or not Facebook is essentially part of the crime scene here needs to be available to investigators and what Facebook told Bloomberg today was that they weren't going to share any more details about their how their platforms used during the campaign quote for operational and security reasons and I don't know what that means they're also citing the Electronic Communications Privacy Act is saying that some of the information that you guys want access to may be protected by that Privacy Act given the way they are sort of being resistant so far do you feel like you and your committee have the ability to compel them to give you access to that data if they're not inclined as a company to do it well Facebook is a company that's a remarkable American success story lots and lots of people rely on Facebook not only for news but for other information and communication a lot of that is based on trust I would think that Facebook would want to cooperate with us they've indicated another releases that they would cooperate I'll acknowledge that they wear it's kind of the Wild Wild West and and there may be need for additional rules but let's go through two or three facts that we do know one clearly there were Russians paying for ads on Facebook and we'll see if the same is the case with Twitter when they come in and talk to us and to me that appears to be inappropriate we have prohibitions against somebody putting a foreign based TV ad on MSNBC I believe those same rules should apply on social media sites we also know as well that there is this inability to kind of look at the content there may be some ad that runs on your show that I just will dislike or disregard but as an American citizen I've got a right to look at that content what I think Facebook is saying is we have no right as Americans to look at the content that's being used to affect our political dialogue and third you know the question of the number of these fake accounts they said they've identified I believe four hundred and seventy fake accounts that might have been tied to Russia in with this one troll farm to me I look think back and say well Facebook didn't take this seriously in our election but by the time the French elections came in in the spring Facebook themselves have reported they took down fifty thousand accounts Oh fifty thousand in France and four hundred and seventy in America to me I believe that the Russian effort to interfere in our elections both using Facebook and Twitter but also attacking 21 states electoral systems hacking into both political parties releasing information only against one to me it seems that the Russian intervention in the American election was extensive coordinated and frankly unprecedented I got to believe if they took that much on there's probably more if to be discovered if they took down fifty thousand sites in France I would think they'd see equivalent number American elections but that's why they need to be a little more transparent and come forward and the transparency obviously applies not just to them policing their own platform and understanding what's going on and being transparent about it but also helping investigate pieced together what may have happened there right there Facebook wants the ones our trust as as we go through this site and they don't have any of the same rules that apply to broadcasting stations but as more and more Americans and folks around the world will lie upon them there I think it does raise a host of new questions about who's going to curate the information what kind of validity do we feel like the information that's coming over some of this sometimes the ads are only a piece if you've got a series of false accounts liking certain groups or certain pages that may drive those groups higher on the algorithms that would then appear on your Facebook newsfeed so a lot more questions to ask and again my hope would be they'd work with us because this is increasingly is going to be the way that people communicate in the political world

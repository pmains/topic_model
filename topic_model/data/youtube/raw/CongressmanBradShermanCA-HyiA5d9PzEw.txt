I'm from Wisconsin and the chair of the Fed for their comments about insurance and I'll probably disagree with many other things thank you once again for returning where you will be independent and accountable tall and short fed plays an interesting role first is to crypto currencies you and we should have the courage to ban them as an investment they're an investment with no investor protection and they take the animal spirits the willing tunas to invest divert them from the real economy and instead engage in what is basically gambling many jurisdictions support gambling only if there is local taxation but crypto currencies don't pay gambling taxes as a medium of exchange crypto currencies offer no advantages over regular currencies unless you're a terrorist a narcotics dealer or a tax evader there is no positive role for us for crypto currencies a lot of discussion in here about who deserves credit for the good economy let me point out since dodd-frank 17 million jobs have been created 15 million of them under Obama to milli a million under Trump that's 15 million 2 million that's the right ratio now the Trump administration claims credit for the last three months of the Obama presidency but Obama was actually president until January 20 2017 but his policies remained in force all through 2017 dodd-frank Janet yellen's balance sheet and Obama tax policies were enforced until the beginning of this year and in fact the Fed policies and the securities regulation remain pretty much unchanged since the Obama administration the chairman of this committee urges you to abandon all of the unconventional tools while taking credit for the good economy that is in part a result of your unconventional tools I would say keep your balance sheet as big as it was when we achieved the objective economic growth that is so good that Democrats and Republicans are fighting over who gets credit and certainly do not cut your balance sheet until chairman Hensarling tells you how he's gonna increase taxes to replace the 80 billion dollars a profit you gave us last year because she had a big balance sheet the chair talks about the inflation rate of chair of this committee it ought to be you ought to have a goal of two and a half percent not two percent the law that we passed in 1978 draws a three percent objective or maximum for inflation and for unemployment so unemployment is still too high inflation is too low and if we have a looser economic policy maybe we'll get somewhat higher inflation and the labor shortage necessary to increase increase wages he puts forward the idea that somebody would save for their college their daughter's college education by putting money aside but he in a mattress where its value would decline by 30% by the time his young girl got to college I'd say if you're smart enough to save for college education once your daughter is born you're probably smart enough to invest the money in something that grows faster than inflation as to trade my party suffers from Trump derangement syndrome which is whatever Trump does we have to be the opposite the fact is China launched this trade war against us in the year 2000 right after 2/3 of Democrats voted against giving China most favored nation status we were right then we shouldn't change now and if there are those who say that trade deficits don't have a harm they lead to hollowed-out manufacturing which leads to manufacturing towns where you have opioids alcoholism and votes for Donald Trump three terrible scourge --is that hit the Midwest as to your your testimony mr. chairman you say that wages are growing a little faster than they did a few years ago that's nominal wages real wages if anything have stagnated over the last year depending upon your measure of inflation one more reason for a looser monetary policy faster economic growth and believe it or not I have a question that is LIBOR with state by scandal you've got the alternative reference rates committee most of the LIBOR referenced debt is is derivatives but what really matters to people is mortgages and what are you gonna do to make sure that the new benchmark does an increase mortgage bargaining Crosstour disrupt the mortgage market so that's the one question that's great that's great question so you're right many many mortgages reference LIBOR LIBOR is a rate that's under a lot of pressure it may not be there in in three or four years so there's a big move to find a good backup we've identified a backup and it's not designed to represent an increase at all in people's mortgage costs rather it's designed to represent just a more sustainable rate that'll always be there and less volatile and and more predictable more reliable and it'll be as good for mortgages as as it is for derivatives yes good the gentleman's time has expired the chair now

Today the United States Supreme Court is hearing
a case about Dreamers. That case could affect hundreds of DACA recipients
here in the Northwest, and thousands across the country. Here in Oregon, people like Gustavo, Brenda,
Miriam, and Annicia. Oregon, the United States, that's their home,
and they shouldn't have to live in fear. This is the country they know. This is the country they love. This is the country they deserve to live in. The Senate should vote on the Dream and Promise
Act that the House passed months ago. I will continue to do all I can to help Dreamers
live their lives without fear, here in the country they know and love, the United States
of America.

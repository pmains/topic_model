the Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton joins us now Senator good morning it's great to have you on it's not just Republicans that are criticizing this speech you have a lease slotkin in Michigan she she said no one in her district is talking about the threat to democracy issues so what was the logic and having the president do this so close to the midterms yeah you know Carly Joe Biden and the Democrats talk a lot about threats to democracy I think they worry more about threats from democracy because they are fearful of the verdict that the voters are about to deliver on their failed ideological agenda you know as I travel around the country and this weekend I'll be out west in Washington and Arizona and Nevada campaigning for our great Senate candidates you hear the same thing over and over again we can't afford our food even if we could we can't find baby formula our kids are being indoctrinated at school the streets are not safe our borders wide open we have a drug death epidemic and we can't even produce energy here in America that's all the direct result of Joe Biden and the Democrats policies and those policies and Joe Biden are going to get repudiated on Tuesday night Senators should be abundantly clear to everyone by now that Joe Biden despite what he said on January 20th of 2021 has no intention of uniting the country and in fact his policies and his Orthodoxy do exactly the opposite yeah Todd unfortunately that's right you know I've got a new book account called Only the Strong when I explain how ideological Barack Obama is understudied Joe Biden have been and that it's not accidental it's not unintentional it's not the result of bad luck it's an intentional effort to undermine the sources of American power like a strong and prosperous economy like a strong military and like American Energy Independence those are the things that voters want that's why we're going to win big majorities on Tuesday Senator if Republicans regain control of the House and Senate what can they do because the president still has veto power what will the agenda be right well first off currently we'll just put a stop to the madness no more trillion dollars of spending bills that the economy doesn't need at a time we have record high inflation second there'll be accountability for the Biden Administration abuses like sicking the feds on parents who wanted to protest their kids education at school boards third we can take steps to begin to turn around some of these problems for instance I think we should pursue an energy Independence agenda we have a lot of Democrats up for reelection 2024 from States like New Mexico and Montana and Ohio Pennsylvania and West Virginia who might want to think twice about continuing this war on fossil fuels so we can't stop at all of the problems of the Biden Administration as long as he's president but we can begin to reverse the damage Tuesday night well you have a new book out like you mentioned earlier that gives a road map to that it is called you can see it right here Only the Strong reversing the left's plot to sabotage American power available in bookstores now but Senator can we actually undo the damage that the left has done to our country not just in the last two years but over the course of the last few decades yeah Todd I'm confident we can you know one thing that really became clear to me as I was writing Only the Strong is just how badly the progressive left in the Vietnam era and the Carter presidency had damaged American power I mean we had record high inflation Soviet communism was rampaging around the world our streets were unsafe a lot of similarities today that you had back then when Joe Biden was a young Senator helping Jimmy Carter enact his disastrous agenda it only took one strong leader Ronald Reagan to help reverse that damage not only make America prosperous again but literally beat our chief adversary so badly the Soviet Union that it ceased to exist so I'm confident that the American people electing the right leaders can help turn this around yeah we just had Brian uh Brian Kilmeade on the show and he was in the studio and he said that he's already reading your book and he said it's great and everybody should pick up a copy so you have that endorsement an endorsement from us as well with a book you also say it's declined by Design I mean uh Biden and Obama the way they handled um you know being the leader of America remember the apology tours you say it's declined by Design what does that mean so going back 100 years to Woodrow Wilson in the beginning of the Progressive Movement it you know the progressive left like Wilson explicitly repudiates America's founding principles by the Vietnam era they were blaming America First and ex repudiating America itself and when the progressive left is at best ambivalent about America and our history and our role in the world they are therefore openly hostile to the sources of American power like a strong military or a prosperous economy they don't much especially Barack Obama but every now and then the mass slips when he said he wanted to fundamentally transform America right who wants to fundamentally transform something America sounds like an important book to me Senator thank you thank you Fox and Friends starts right now

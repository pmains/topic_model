H.R. 2615 IS A SIMPLE BILL THAT  AUTHORIZES THE LAND EXCHANGE   BETWEEN THE NATIONAL PARK  SERVICE AND THE VETERANS OF  FOREIGN WARS POST 5699 IN OCEAN  SPRINGS, MISSISSIPPI.  THE BILL PASSED THE HOUSE IN   THE 114TH CONGRESS AND WE  PASSED IT AGAIN NEARLY A YEAR  AGO. THE VETERANS OF POST 5699 IN   MR. PALAZZO'S DISTRICT HAVE  BEEN WAITING A LONG TIME FOR   THIS EXCHANGE. SO I AM PLEASED THAT WE HAVE AN  OPPORTUNITY TO AGREE TO THE  CHANGES PROPOSED BY THE SENATE   AND ADVANCE THIS MEASURE TO THE  PRESIDENT'S DESK.  THIS EXCHANGE IS SUPPORTED BY  THE V.F.W.

THE GULF ALLENS NATIONAL   SEASHORE -- ISLANDS NATIONAL   SEASHORE INCLUDES THE  MISSISSIPPI BARRIER ISLANDS AND  CAT AS WELL AS THE DAVIS BAYOU   AREA.  I AM PROUD TO HAVE THIS  IMPORTANT PARK AND THIS NATURAL  BEACH AS HISTORIC SITES AND  WILDLIFE SANCTUARIES WITHIN MY   DISTRICT.  THE GULF ISLANDS NATIONAL  SEASHORE HAS BEEN A PART OF THE  MISSISSIPPI GULF COAST   COMMUNITY SINCE CONGRESS   ESTABLISHED THE PARK IN 1971.  SINCE THAT ESTABLISHMENT, THE  GULF ISLAND NATIONAL SEASHORE  HAS WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE  MARK SEA MORE VETERANS OF  FOREIGN WARS V.F.W. POST.  THE POST HAS SHARED A ROAD WITH  THE SEASHORE FOR THE BETTER  PART OF THE LAST 30 YEARS. THE GULF ISLANDS NATIONAL  SEASHORE LAND EXCHANGE ACT   WOULD MAKE PERMANENT A 30-YEAR   EASEMENT THAT'S PROVIDED AN  ACCESS ROAD AND DRIVEWAY FOR   THE V.F.W. IN EXCHANGE, THE V.F.W. WILL   GIVE THE GULF ISLAND NATIONAL  SEASHORE SOME OF ITS ACREAGE,  WHICH INCLUDES VALUABLE  WETLANDS.  THE GULF ISLAND NATIONAL   SEASHORE AND THE V.F.W. BOTH   STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS LAND   EXCHANGE, BUT THE DEPARTMENT OF  INTERIOR NEEDS CONGRESSIONAL   APPROVAL BEFORE IT CAN MAKE THE  LAND EXCHANGE OFFICIAL.  THAT'S WHY, MR. SPEAKER, I   ENCOURAGE THE HOUSE TO PASS  THIS BILLED A AZARENKA A   SUSPENSION VOTE -- AS A  SUSPENSION VOTE. I'D ALSO LIKE TO THANK THE   MEMBERS FOR THEIR SUPPORT AND  HELP IN BRINGING THIS BILL TO  THE FLOOR. I YIELD BACK.  THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE   GENTLEMAN YIELDS BACK THE  BALANCE OF HIS TIME. THE GENTLEMAN FROM ARIZONA.  MR. GOSAR: I YIELD BACK THE  BALANCE OF MY TIME.  THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE   GENTLEMAN YIELDS BACK THE  BALANCE OF HIS TIME.

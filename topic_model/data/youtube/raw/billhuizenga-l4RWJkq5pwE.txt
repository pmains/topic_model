matt is right in joining us money to talk about a variety of issues is representative bill heisting a bill good to see you buddy and good morning good seeing you guys thanks for waking up with us we appreciate it happy to probably I had chained our little rains not so great as you're trying to make that drive in front so there's a cat fur in the morning favorite play it all right well there's a lot of issues out there that we wanted to talk about number one that we want to hit today is the student loan interest rates because I know a lot of folks have loans out there that are wondering what's going to happen well here's what's going to happen the House passed a bill and there's a lot of disinformation out there this was not a case where if it expired people that are currently paying them would have an increase it actually was only four people moving forward not those students that currently have them very difficult decision but here's here's a situation we are dealing with artificially low interest rates on everything whether it's home loans car loans business loans and the same thing with our student loans and at some point those have to start coming back up and five years ago when they pass this original bill actually led by Nancy Pelosi in the house they put this five-year cliff and as a way to bring them back to to what they normally had been but it's a very very tough time out there and we don't think we want to do anything that's going to harm that now I voted against it because I felt very important to make that statement not because I don't like students and not because we don't want to see kids going out there and getting education but again it's not anybody who currently has a student loan it was going forward and another is kind of a two-pronged concern because the next question is okay how are we going to pay for this and this is now coming out of part of Obama's health care law for the preventative care for women right yeah and that's at well no it's not that's what much the preventive care for women it's a actually a piece where the president had had proposed in his last budget taking some of that money out the debate is are we going to offset or pay for quote unquote pay for these things or are we just going to put them on the credit card and I think that is also very problematic now here's here's the most important thing that can do for a student get them an opportunity to go get a job that is really the key on this is how are we going to make sure that we have an economy that's clicking along that these students aren't going to have to just keep going back to school or or or struggling to make these loan payments get them a job is the best possible payment method all right now let's talk about postal service a lot of talk about what saturday is going to be a possibility of going to lose Saturday's were you singing up in Congress yeah unknown exactly the Senate the Senate has passed a bill but they've kind of gone back on themselves a little bit regarding wanting to slow down any of those post office closings and and frankly we still have a situation where we're not allowing the post office to act like any other business would and so we can we keep telling them hey we're not going to give you any more money or we're not going to tell you how to do business oh but by the way you can't close this post office down and out you have to make sure you continue to do saturday delivery and all those other things so and I think I just wish Congress would actually walk the talk and and allow them to function and figure out how to make that work they are talking about reduction in staff through attrition and retirements and that kind of thing and in all likelihood that is definitely a direction that has to go it's losing millions of dollars every day and it's it's not sustainable as it is so and we still have to deal with their pensions and a number of other things too we had a question from a viewer of regarding the farm bill for 2012 what is what is that how is that doing yeah actually there is a Senate farm bill that has been drafted and proposed has not passed yet same thing in the house there they're working on that the lead is coming out of the Senate though and that is that is going to be a revamping of how we're dealing with things like crop insurance and whether their subsidies are not going to be subsidies and and some farm youth labor issues right that's what i was going to think of us like the kids wouldn't be able to work on their own farms right well this is just on we'll bring me that you know we are going to so fundamentally change the the way that farms operate that these kids that are currently are there and this is a separate actually separate Department of Agriculture ruling that had been proposed they just withdrew it laughs late last week because of the outrage I mean it just X absolutely makes no sense here you here you are you've got kids that that under normal circumstances would be learning how to work on their family farm and nobody wants to put kids into danger I certainly don't as a parent but at the same time it's this is this is a way of life and teaching kids how to work and work hard and run the business the family business exactly right that's exactly right all right

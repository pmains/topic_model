dan crenshaw is no stranger to adversity frankly he thrives on it but when you're facing potential irreversible blindness that prospect can rattle even the most steely resolve nine years ago while serving the nation with the navy seals in afghanistan a blast from an improvised explosive destroyed one of dan crenshaw's eyes and quite nearly took the other he says they think i just have a normal eye and i've never had a normal eye i've always had a severely damaged eye you know i wake up in the morning i can't see anything that's my normal state over time scar tissue from the wound slowly pushed beneath his retina causing it to detach a crisis made more serious as the now congressman is quick to point out because he has no backup it's terrifying when you've only got one left uh and uh you know i had to make peace with just going going and living in blackness after a full week spit lying face down to allow a gas bubble to press his tattered but surgically repaired retina in place congressman dan crenshaw is slowly steadily returning to duty albeit with sight that's still extremely impaired it's like wearing a dive mask and you put a bunch of bubble bath solution in it and then you rub some vaseline on the on the outside of the dive mask that's kind of what i see it's it's very annoying to say the least while the prognosis is still uncertain healing continues and crenshaw's surgeon cautiously optimistic told me over and over again i should not be able to see because of these injuries it doesn't make any sense to them and so um i'm lucky it's a true miracle and maybe part of that is the good positive vibes and prayers around me it's still tough territory to navigate even when you've served with others who've suffered worse or didn't make it home at all that said dan crenshaw is deeply practiced in perseverance you know perspective is important everybody likes to think that their problem is the biggest problem in the world and i assure you it is not the congressman tells me during the critical first weeks of his recovery he forced himself to disengage completely from politics his replacement audio books ranging from mystery novels to theoretical physics in the newsroom greg grogan fox 26 news

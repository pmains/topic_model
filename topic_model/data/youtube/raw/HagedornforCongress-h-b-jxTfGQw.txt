come back to Newstalk III Oh WCCO I'm bliss Olsen joining me now Republican candidate in the first congressional district the open seat Tim Wallace is vacated is Jim Hagedorn Jim thanks for joining us today well Blois it's a pleasure to be with you well the president's coming in tomorrow to campaign in Rochester with you I assume you'll be there tomorrow we'll be there I think pretty much every good Republican in the whole state that wants to be there I'll try to be there that's for sure are you suggesting that if if you're not there and you're a Republican you're a bad Republican oh I didn't mean to say that oh well I just you know I thought I could catch you on something there well you're quick you're quick this morning plays well thanks well we're looking forward to it it's going to be a galvanizing event the president come in delivers message let people know about the accomplishments the administration has vision moving forward and you know I'm somebody it's always been supportive of not just his policies but he as president because I felt like yes he didn't win in 2016 we were going to lose the country Hillary Clinton was going to stack the court with radicals the Supreme Court and take away our basic liberties and we had a clear choice in that election and now we have another clear choice in this election you know you you have been supportive of the president but you also have been honest that some of his tariffs especially how they impact agriculture were very concerning to you where do you think we are now and what would you tell the president that you're hearing from farmers right now well yeah I'm not a big fan of tariffs I think they're good for the governments that impose them and the industries they try to protect and that's usually on a temporary basis but what the president was trying to do is try and do and it's been successful I think so far is to bring everyone to the table and he said that China was ripping us off he wanted to renegotiate some things with Mexico and Canada and lo and behold Mexico and Canada and the United States have a new agreement and so far from the American Farm Bureau on down the farm groups are looking at that saying that that's a good thing ultimately the goal is to drop down the barriers to expand global markets so we can export the finest agricultural products in all the world many of them produced right here in southern Minnesota and to have trade policies that are going to help the steelworkers helped us farmers the consumers and everyone and I think he's on track and frankly out if I get the chance I'll let the president know that the farmers down here had his back they they all know that China has been ripping us off for twenty years that they've taken advantage of the country that something needed to be done they knew it was going to be a little bit turbulent but in the end they trusted that he was going to do the right thing for the country and for them you know mr. Hagedorn I hear what you're saying there but you and I were both had farm fest and farmers they may have had his back but they were pretty upset they wrote petitions the part of the mood of farmers was hanging in the balance on that and if some of that doesn't get figured out before Election Day farmers might it might have a different view of this administration don't you think but not the farmers I speak with honestly I think there's always going to be a few liberal farmers out there but there are fewer and fewer them there they're leaving the s and the DFL every day but the reason I think that they're not going to abandon the President and Republicans is pretty simple before there was this so-called trade war that the Democrats want to talk about there was a war against agriculture and it was it was executed by Barack Obama in the Democrat Party massive regulations coming out of the EPA in Washington DC that was driving up farmers costs and making them have to spend lots of money on compliance Obamacare was the biggest issue in agriculture these last five years it was crushing farmers who were having a tough time with low commodity prices and high input costs including Obama care and then you had restrictive energy policies driving up the cost of energy needlessly and that's very important because you know 40 percent of the cost of producing a bushel of corn is energy and when energy prices go up farmers have a tough time so you know the Democrat Party in their policies are very anti agriculture anti farmer anti rural America and I think that's why they voted overwhelmingly for president Trump and they they got me to 49.6% in the last election we're going to finish the job here in this one so as you look at that and you you think about that in the tone and obviously you're a strident supporter of the president did you hear his comments last night about Christine Blasi Ford and her testimony last week actually I haven't I've just been we had to two events last night man kita one with Colonel John Kline former congressman who came in for us I was exciting and then we had a big Republican rally there to get our volunteers out to do the door-to-door and phone banking but no I haven't seen any reports yet okay so one of the things he did is you know he's he suggested he kind of mocked Christine Blasi Ford that she couldn't remember some of the specific details after just one beer and I think it's it's a contrast to what he said last week when he thought she had very credible testimony and I think you know part of his style as president is that you know he can be very diplomatic one moment and then when it's in a political situation he does stuff to rally the base and and just noticing your comments here about kind of you know going after Democrats on health care costs and things like that it's the truth well no no I hate look I understand and I know that farmers the last few years have been very worried concerned and crushed by health care costs I have no doubt and you know what we're gonna talk later this show about how the fact that health care costs now for farmers are going to go down ten to twenty seven percent in the next round so I get it but one of the things that that strikes me is that you you say what you think kind of like the president you've blogged what you thought kind of like the president but you continued you used the word radical earlier when talking about the court and he used the word radical when talking about Dan feein does that tone help you govern once you're there and might have to work with a Democrat or - well when I you know I've spent time out in Washington and I had major bills get through the Congress that I managed that and I worked with both Republicans and Democrats it all comes down to your you know your worldview and what you want to get done and right now the two parties are diametrically opposed and I mean I sense the election in 2016 the Democrat Party has moved way to the left I mean look at what they are outwardly talking about Tim Walz wants to make Minnesota a sanctuary state all right Amy Klobuchar has gone to control Tina Smith played tournament or dancing who wants to represent the Mayo Clinic in the first District Minnesota openly out there for socialized medicine that is far to the left stuff they have the same positions as keith ellison on virtually every issue i okay we're not going to talk about that I'm talking about you if you get elected does this tone that you're taking in the campaign help you govern well sure because the House of Representatives is an institution built on power the one vote more than half you control the bills to committees and you control the agenda and what we're trying to do is keep moving the country and what I say is the right direction the Democrats want to take us radically left that's just that that's just a fact and so if we get there and I serve on the Agriculture Committee one of my goals would be to work with all members of the Agriculture Committee to help all facets of Agriculture and that would include people from different regions people from different parties and I'd work with with all the groups in order to make sure that America's agriculture was moving the right direction so I certainly am going to be able to to work cooperatively with other folks one of the but but the choice in the election is are we going to go you know keep moving where we're going or are we going the other direction it is a clear choice and our election in southern Minnesota is a miniature national election it you know the control of the house may hinge on this one seat no I understand that's the critical and that's the critical choice but before the American people before the people said in Minnesota when you talk about sanctuary state sanctuary City that is one kind of outlier issue out there but you know and I know that farmers and AG producers and AG agribusiness in your district need more workers what's the solution sure well there's several solutions and one of it is that we should have transition wages from people going from welfare back to the workforce and right now people lose benefits sometimes and they're worse off if they work and we can't have that I'm also one of those people that believes and work for welfare if you're on the welfare system and you're able-bodied you should work for it and that gives people an incentive to get back into the to the private sector but I have also set all along for a work program a verifiable work program to allow people to come from foreign nations into the United States to fill needed jobs but we have to do that in a verifiable way and it has to make sense and then on top of that we have to have border security so when we do to poor people they don't run back over the border or fly into the country and overstay visas and we have to move to a system of merit-based immigration so the people coming to the United States we feel will assimilate fill the jobs needed contribute to our economy we're the most generous country in all the world we we we allow in almost a million or more people every year I think that's more than almost everybody else around the world combined I mean we're very generous but we should know who's coming here and we have something like 50 or 60 million foreign-born people in the country now and it's getting tougher and tougher for everyone to assimilate the last thing those we have to be careful we can't be importing a whole bunch of jobs you know people to fill jobs when they say robots are coming in five ten years from now those jobs are going to disappear what will the people do if they're not fully skilled or fully able to assimilate got it Jim Hagedorn Republican running in the first District thanks for joining us this morning and tell President Trump that I'd love to have him on the air will do thanks for the opportunity police hope you have a great day

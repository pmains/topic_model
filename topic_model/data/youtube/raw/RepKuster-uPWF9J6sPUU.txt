miss bliss your testimony addressing how medicare advantage organizations delayed or denied beneficiaries access to medical services even in cases where the care was medically necessary studies find there's often confusion on who's responsible for handling appeals how can medicare advantage plans better support beneficiaries seeking to appeal a prior authorization decision in order to receive care thank you that's an important question and we have found previously that beneficiaries and providers appeal only about one percent of medicare advantage denials of prior authorization and payment denials as well and so that's a just a tiny fraction of the denials actually get appealed i think typically a beneficiary would work with their provider to go through that process but we have heard and are concerned about both the delays in care and the administrative burden for all involved in trying to correct inappropriate denials you

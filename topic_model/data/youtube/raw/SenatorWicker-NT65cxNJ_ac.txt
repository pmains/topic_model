very very much right this is if your Republican senator Senate rules committee member Roger wicker op Center very good to have you thanks for taking the time well I'm glad to be here do you think that's a possibility that the ill will between senators corker flake and the president that it translates into no votes on this thing I don't think that's very much of a possibility and I think Blake was was right on point there these three senators and the rest office are going to vote for what we believe is best for the country and clearly our tax system is out of date it doesn't serve the purpose of of economic growth or job creation and and I think we're on the verge with a good vote in the house probably tomorrow to move with our Senate passed budget I think that'll save us three weeks and put us on a fast track toward getting a tax cut for job creators and more take-home pay for American workers you know one of the things that interested me what Senator flake said is he said he stated what a lot of you and your colleagues are thinking that that this president worries you does he well he didn't say what what I'm thinking and and of course I'm like a lot of folks that have been on your show I'm very result-oriented and and I'm I'm very pleased actually that the president spent so much time yesterday talking about the results that this administration with the help of this Congress has gotten in in the first nine months and this includes of course of a whole sea change on the federal courts including the corker said of that meeting sir that tax cuts actually didn't come up that much is that true that it's not true no we had a discussion and and actually Pat Toomey who is going to be very much involved in writing the specifics of the tax bill had a great exchange with the president so no I I think maybe the senator missed that part of the discussion or maybe forgot it was there any friction at that meeting sir between those two senators anyone else for that matter there was absolutely no friction whatsoever so you're all yesterday it was it was a great meeting I thought it was great to revisit what we've been able to accomplish together and there's a sort of a popular misconception out there that that we haven't done a lot even talked about the 70 bills and yeah and actually we went back to the Truman administration and said we haven't we haven't had so many bills passed by a new president and son by a new administration since the Truman days so we've got a lot more to do and we've had disappointments with health with health care and and we need to get back to repeal and replace of Obamacare but we are about to deliver some real tax reform some real tax cuts to the average American middle class worker and and and if we do this we're going to give a jolt to the economy the likes of which we haven't seen in in eight or ten years it could be a dicey road to that point as you know senator the house right now will vote on this Senate but you're the ones that you craft it and some of them are concerned about deductions that are in the duct shion's that should be out and there's no guarantee that that that passes with that are you worried I'm not worried I'm mindful that there's a lot of ways to trip and a lot of banana peels to slip on but but I think we're going to see a great indication tomorrow with an overwhelming Republican majority for this budget and that will save us weeks in the process and move us more toward tax cuts on president Trump's desk about Thanksgiving that's giving that's what I'm gearing for yes sir okay I believe we can do it and I believe we will do it and we ought to do it all right then lastly sir there's some of the ways to arrive at the numbers to pay for these tax cuts of unit campuses you have to is phasing out deductions for state local taxes for the upper income at least Wilbur Ross the Commerce Secretary is open to that there's been talk as well about phasing out deductibility as well for 401k plans the president originally opposed to that but I understand the House Ways and Means chief Kevin Brady is not your thoughts well okay Kevin Brady did come back and make some suggestions publicly today to the president what I'm going to decline to do if you don't mind is negotiate the deals that the details of this tax bill in the media I just think could you whistles just whisper it publicly okay I tell you what I'll give you a call about 11:45 tonight if I picked up anything okay but finally serve all these comments that the Senators Corcoran flake had made in Senator flakes case continued to make on the president that he's not stable that that he's a danger you don't agree with that I don't agree with that and I don't see how that's helpful to the process I know these senators realize we need tax reform and tax cuts for American workers this bill would be a good bill for American workers and I just don't see how those comments are helpful when we have such a narrow margin and we're so close to a really really outstanding victory for American workers all right senator thank you very much for taking the time I always thank you for having me

turn now recognize the gentleman from Florida mr. Posey Thank You mr. chairman and mr. secretary thank you for appearing today and thank you for the for the character and the integrity the heart and the class and the aspirations that that you bring to your position many people would say that you had maybe one of the best opportunities in the world to become a failure to be dependent on government you proved all the critics wrong and you became the model of success of achieving the American dream and proved that anyone can do it and I applaud you that I think a lot of people applaud you for that and I applaud you for trying to help others do that too thank you you know unfortunately there's a lot of people that somehow benefit from people being dependent on government because they think it keeps them beat being elected I think self-sufficiency is the way to go and you obviously do too and and thank you for your efforts to transfer people from dependency to self-sufficiency I want to apologize for some of the meat and nasty comments made towards you today they're undeserving there are attempts to shame you while they criticize the government for attempting to shame somebody the president for attempting to shame somebody that may be logical to some people but I'm sure it's probably forward to you and you're probably wondering about that I'm used to it yeah most intelligent people would but we all have the same people in our districts they hate the President and they hate anybody that doesn't hate the president so we're gonna they're gonna be around for a while so we just get used to it and do the right thing for the right reasons which you have a history of doing your forward initiative to reimagine how HUD works to restore the American Dream and to rethink American communities is an awesome plan and and my question to you this morning you know how can we become more engaged in helping you achieve those goals well thank you very much for your comments and for that question you know I I will be coming back to you particularly as we continue to to analyze what works because in order to be efficient we need the ability to be flexible and to be able to address things quickly so that we don't have to go through so many different channels we're not just going to come to you vaguely with something like that we're going to say specifically we need to do x and y so we can get to Z quickly so just be open to that we want to work with you we want to benefit from your collective knowledge experience and the fact that you represent the people and we are public servants that means we work for the people they don't work for us and therefore we need to know through you how we can best serve them but we want to work with you to do things in a Vectis way well thank you mr. secretary clearly you have a card of a servant and you can always count on me I know and probably most of the people here for our support thank you LSU

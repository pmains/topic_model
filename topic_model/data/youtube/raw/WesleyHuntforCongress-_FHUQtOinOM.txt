hi everyone my name is Wesley hunt running for Congress here in the seventh District here in Texas I am very fortunate and pleased to be here today with Senator Bill Cassidy he is the current senator from our neighbor Louisiana he has served in the Senate since 2015 prior to that he served in the house for presenting Louisiana's sixth District in 2009 for 2015 or perhaps they were more prevalent given today's discussion senator Cassidy is a medical doctor and he received his MD of LSU and co-founded the greater Baton Rouge Community Clinic so obviously his expertise right now is very pertinent to these very trying times so thank you for joining us sir hey Wesley thank you by the way thank you for running people ask why as a doctor I'd go into politics and I say that it is serving people but just by another means first it was in the public Charity Hospital system where I worked for 25 years now it's in politics but it shout out to you you served our country having attended West Point than in the military and now you attempt to continue to serve in Congress and I just want to really give you a shout out and thank you for continuing that ethic of service to the benefit is a benefit of us all thank you sir couldn't means a lot coming from you thank you very much I appreciate that so our first question for you is I know we've had a very busy last few weeks and I think that the voters here in the seventh District to hear from a sitting senator would be would be wonderful so thank you for taking time to discuss these issues with us I will start by asking you to address a few of the frequently asked questions surrounding the health aspects of the corona virus yeah the corona virus is again a virus that we breathe in and we breathe in it goes into our lungs and in some people not all but some it will cause a severe pneumonia as well as other parts in your body to have a problem there's ways that we can prevent it again we get if we can prevent it from spreading if we happen to have it by sneezing into our sleeve using this often if you happen to touch your face and you forget and when you go to the grocery store I put some of these in a little baggie and I wiped down the handle of the cart and then I continue to use this during the store and as you do that you'll keep either from being infected infecting others there's also people Wesley who are more at risk so if you have diabetes or high blood pressure heart disease lung disease you are at particular risk and should take particular care not to be exposed so for example my daughter's go shopping they love to shop I hate shop so they go out to the store they wear a mask if you have diabetes or high blood pressure and if you can it'll be wise for you to ask someone to shop for you but if you go out to wear that mask and when someone shops for you if they live with you again to wear a mask and continue to use this and this we can keep from getting infected by and large we just have to be very careful to do everything we need to do Wow well awesome thank you very much for that appreciate that and uh and it kind of it kind of piggyback that sir I'm kind of wondering you know outside of that you know key can talk about what it means to kind of shelter in place how that's affecting you know flattening the curve and kind of talk about what that means from a societal standpoint yeah so if you look at it we're afraid that we're gonna have a whole lot of people going to the hospital at once including not just those with coded virus but the people who normally go from car wrecks and heart attacks and whatever else and so here you have this big bump of people going to the hospital as it turns out though you only have this many beds are this many ICU beds and this many ventilators and so if your curve is way up it overwhelms the hospital system and people die unnecessarily because we run out of ventilators and hospital beds etc if you flatten the curve it may be as many people get infected over time but because you flatten the curve you have enough hospital beds ventilators I see use ICU beds to handle everybody that come in that comes in and so so we're trying to again make sure that we have capacity to care for those who are ill that's why governors are suggesting that you shelter in place stay away six feet from folks sneeze into your sleeve use your Purell and use your Clorox wipes if you do that we again flatten the curb kicking more people alive fantastic fantastic thank you and then can you kind of talk briefly about what stuff that the Senate has taken to relieve Americans are struggling right now small businesses also this kind of outside the health perspective yeah so Western you mentioned I'm a doctor I worked in Louisiana's Charity Hospital system for 25 years kind of like Houston's Ben Taub Hospital at Ben Taub is still up and running and and and so I learned that people's physical growth is as important as their financial goals if somebody can't pay their bills they oftentimes their physical health suffers but if they're so sick they can't work then their financial health suffers so you got to balance those two physical and financial and so what the Senate did is acknowledge that it gave lots of money to help the physical but it also gave money to help the financial there will be checks of $1,200 going to individuals $2,400 to couples $500 per child help families get through this rough patch similarly for small businesses there's an expedited online review process by which people can buy which people can apply as a small business owner and that includes churches for example nonprofits you can't online apply for an SBA loan and get that support to get you through this rough patch if you are an Airbnb owner you're a single employee but your own businesses you fixed up an Airbnb you can apply through the SBA portal and lastly we increased we increased unemployment benefits so those people who are laid off again they can have their needs met financially as well that's fantastic and can you talk about a little bit more about you know PPE and what in the steps are we're taking as a country to provide you know our health care providers with dental and people that need ventilators PPE that kind of stuff that we've had a shortage giving this boom so personal protective equipment PPE if you're a police officer a fireman a first responder nurse nurses aide if you're in if you're the clerk working at the front desk telling people where to go doctors nurses you name it you need to protect yourself if the person you're dealing with has coronavirus or might have coronavirus and then he paused for a second Wesley and give a shout out to a fellow Texan a jolt president george w bush when he was president begin to understand that we were due for a pandemic and president george w bush a fella created the current system that is helping us now he stocked up with personal protective equipment with ventilators and everything we would need in order to address this issue unfortunately it was allowed to kind of taper off so we don't have the supplies we had when he left office but he is the one to put in place a system which has benefiting us so much and if he happens to see this I want to give a real shout out to your fellow Texan George W Bush thank you that's it there has been a shortage of face masks and the covering of people where to keep from getting infected so that has been President Trump has worked hard to get more supplies from overseas as well as to ramp up production here in the United States to make sure that our first responders our health care workers all have the equipment they need to avoid getting infected there was a little bit of shortage at beginning but that shortage is easy those supplies are infiltrating if you will out into the places where they need to be and so again that first responder now has should have the first the personal protective equipment they need in order to not get infected as they keep us all safe excellent excellent well sir that that pretty much wraps up what my questions for you and I really appreciate you taking time out of your day to be here and doing this please pass my best on to the state of Louisiana where my would and raise and so it's near and dear to my heart personally and thank you for all your service I really appreciate it hey listen let me thank you for running we need folks like you who have demonstrated their commitment to our country as you have first in your life by attending the West Point Academy didn't serve in our country in the military but also to bring a reality of a broader community to our Congress when people like you step up and do that Wesley our country is better off if someone give you a real shout out to you your campaign best of luck and I'm trusting that the folks of your district will just see the qualities that you just exhibit and and and send you along to help us further in Congress thank you sir god bless you I really appreciate this and keep fighting a good fight thank you you too

I appreciate my my fellow friend from Michigan yielding this time and I'm a freshman this is my first term in session here in Congress and I wasn't here for the passage of this bill but i can tell you i am here because the american people wanted change they did not and will not accept what was passed by this previous Congress you're going to hear a lot today about how it has helped people we cannot go back to the to the status quo but this is not the solution this is not the way and that's why I rise today in strong support of the repeal of the Obama care act HR sixty seventy nine the fact is the recent chamber survey chamber of commerce survey indicated that a whopping seventy-four percent of small businesses say that the law makes it more difficult for them to hire new law new employees I'm one of those small business owners who's been paralyzed trying to figure out what my what my insurance costs are going to be for my employees in addition the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office predicts Obamacare will reduce ins labor supply by 800,000 people not something that we need right now not only is this lawful of compliance uncertainties and disincentives for growth 15 seconds regulation 50 the Supreme Court recently made it clear that the individual mandate is despite what the president and my colleagues in this body are trying to say it is a colossal tax increase on the middle class while I'm disappointed in the decision we know that the American people want us to come back in and change this law because it will not help them in the long run thank you very much

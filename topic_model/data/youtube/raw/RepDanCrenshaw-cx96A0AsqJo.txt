we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created as a member of Congress I get to have a lot of really interesting people in the office experts on what they're talking about this is the podcast for insights into the issues China bioterrorism Medicare for all in-depth discussions breaking it down into simple terms we old we hold we hold these truths we hold these truths with Dan Crenshaw hey welcome back folks this is going to be one of the most boring episodes you've ever had to listen to because we have Mike Gallagher's Our Guest I'm just kidding Mike is my friend it's actually gonna be really great Mike is a fellow representative from Wisconsin um he's also a big nerd he went to Princeton uh I'm just I'm just wrecking you I'm sorry I like to be the most boring member you're not though yeah one of the smartest actually um do go to Princeton very low bar that's true yeah um so uh you went to Princeton you had the National Intelligence University I didn't even know you have a PhD from Georgetown yeah they're giving them away these days so yeah regardless I mean it's not nothing you're a professor you were like doing it you were doing Professor work before you came to Congress I think it's more accurate to say I was an aspiring but failed academic uh and that Georgetown took pity on me as because I was still on active duty when I was doing most of the program and yep you were a marine decided to get rid of me by by giving me the PHD so that I wouldn't bother them anymore but I'm just excited to be here Dan uh to be the greatest casting ever and talking with the man who shot Bin Laden and uh what's that like that but obviously can I get some details how many books do you get to write if you shop Bin Laden what what is that yeah what's that like well it's like two major books written I think that would have been fun um so I would remember where I was when Bin Laden was shot and unfortunately it was not in the place was shot which is Pakistan yeah um we're going to talk about you know what I want to have you here today to talk about because like you were like you were deployed to Iraq you were in the Marine Corps as an Intel officer you've been representing Wisconsin's 8th District since 2016 and um Foreign Affairs National Security have been in your wheelhouse and uh you you I recently posted one of your videos because it was hilarious but also very informative um you know there's look guys I'm telling you there's a lot people ask me all the time they're like where's how come the rest of the Republicans don't do stuff like you do stuff Dan and I'm like well they actually do you just don't follow them yeah and maybe you should follow them um you know and Mike Mike is one of those you put out some really good stuff um well can I confess I actually I very much struggle with this because I like it it is I constantly debate the value of like time put into social media and I recognize that it's just sort of the price of doing business in the modern Congress but it's not necessarily conducive to I think a at times like a sane conversation with your constituents I think long-form discussions like this are actually far more valuable I mean maybe it's just even this a lot of members do podcasts but it's honestly not worth your time if the audience just isn't growing well I think for you I mean you have such a big following and it happens so many people love this podcast so many people love you you have no idea but most people love this podcast it's like the most people where are you in the most beautiful podcast system uh probably number one like all the time I mean obviously people are giving it five stars right now people are pausing the podcast right now to give it five stars [Music] um that's gotta be true uh but I know for like I just feel so there's an interesting I wonder if you feel this pressure I just feel like everyone in Congress now is trying to be like a social media content creator and like that's not necessarily the same thing as being a legislator and there I don't know if they're mutually exclusive but I find myself going in the opposite direction of okay how do how do I pay less attention to social media while still like effectively communicating with my constituents and I I mean I've been here five years and I've never figured it out yeah I do a little bit of both Paul Ryan I had this discussion like he divides people up up here into legislators and performers and look the truth is you have to have a foot in each in each category yeah yeah um to effectively communicate because whether we like it or not America is a giant reality TV show and people want to be entertained to an extent and um that's easy to do because it's easy in the conservative side to just sort of list the slogans that we know work like lock her up it just works right but um but also it's like there's not like okay the more serious conservatives are like well you know it's like due process and there's these other like sort of like long-held values um but but it gets the people going you know and so you've got to get the people going but you've also owed them a more intellectual discussion so like you can't I I can't claim that I'm not a performer right I jump out of airplanes and campaign videos like obviously I've done that stuff um because it's fun but then you owe people a serious discussion like you're bringing them in with the entertainment but then you owe them a serious discussion that's kind of what you did um I don't know I don't know if it was that entertaining but the video I was talking about to go back to it yeah um was a deep dive into the truth behind fauci's claims that there was no gain of function research and you just like you opened up like three white boards on this thing and you were like you looked like Charlie Day from uh from Always Sunny in Philadelphia it was like and like you even had like the the crazy professor your shirt your sleeves rolled up and like your collar like undone yeah it was good it was good stuff but it was also very informative um you want to go into that yeah sure like because it's still on people's minds yeah I mean look again this is the difference between like lock him up like and just like look let's actually look at what happened here yeah um I'm not sure he committed a crime per se uh but but I don't trust him yeah you know so tell us why we should okay so so and this this came up again last week because there was a very intense yeah yeah back and forth between him and ramp do you think I'm in rampall are secretly buddies they're just like it's good for both of them like both their audiences yeah exactly um no I doubt it I doubt there aren't they actually hate each other by the way the listeners the millions of listeners should know that we're drinking some of Dan's whiskey the last time I drank Whiskey on a podcast it did not end well uh hashtag John Goldberg what happened uh well it was a very entertaining podcast um we talked about half-baked ideas I think it's fair to say you know they're the the the you can notice the difference between the start of the post it's gonna sink your political it's already it's already sung although I feel like I so I graduated college in 2006. I feel like I it was like I was the last the last person on the helicopter out of Saigon in terms of social media like nothing and I I got off Facebook uh after two years on it so like that that period of my life is not cataloged at all whereas now I just feel like these kids the next generation is screwed in terms of every aspect of their life is documented and it's going to come up in job interview that's true no I feel we're the same age so that's about oh well I don't know but I feel so much younger than you do you know yeah yeah I have more hair interesting she just called me a bastard on my own podcast it's a sensitive subject um how old are you I'm 37. we're the exact same age look at that when's your birthday are you are we allowed to say that March March 14th yeah I mean I raise money on my birthday so I know it how we not had a joint birthday party yeah so you're you're uh you are older that's true this is a crushing realization I was the second youngest when I came in in 2016 behind the lease does anybody have a does anybody share your birthday that's famous um good question I don't know I know that Shaquille O'Neal's birthday is March 6th so it's not your birthday but I know that because I used to celebrate it again not your birthday okay not my birthday but I do still love Shaquille Rashawn O'Neill doesn't matter it's not your birthday so on my who cares you've answered the question so my birthday who shares it Alberta generous Albert Einstein I'm so smart uh it's also Pi Day is that true yeah it's true Albert Einstein shares your birthday oh that's great what's Pi Day what's Pi Day like as in the number or the yeah the number yeah yeah the number wow because 314. oh Perfect Look at that that's very exciting we'll have to celebrate Friday okay fauci um yeah people want to know I think what's getting lost in and I and I I actually think um Rand Paul is right and and fauci is wrong and it's not just me as a conservative saying that you had there's a lot of evidence here Josh Rogan uh Center left fair to say Washington Post reporter who's been all over this said that exact same thing after the exchange the fact is as a matter of public record you know what do we know um we know that grants from nyad fauci's organization went to the ecohealth alliance and it wasn't just nyad it was uh the United States agency for International Development there were DOD funds from DARPA and ditra that went to these non-profits in particular there was one non-profit the eagle Health Alliance run by Dr Peter dazick who we know was doing Cooperative this is a matter of public record it's indisputable collaborative research with the Wuhan Institute of virology um and we now know based on and this is what uh senator Paul was citing in the back and forth uh published research papers they were doing experiments on these viruses designed to make them more pathogenic and that's more definitional purposes that's what gain of function means that is as Dr Richard ebright from Rutgers has said the the the the the essence of the definition of gain of function so I think fauci is hiding behind a highly legalistic interpretation and his organization wrote the basically exemption the remember there was a moratorium on gain of function research yes because so fauci back in 2011 2012 has op-ed said he wrote saying that you know of course this is risky and he has a speech in 2012 that's amazing in terms of he basically lays out all the potential things that could go wrong with this including accidentally causing a global pandemic from a lab leak uh so this was very controversial within the scientific community in the Obama Administration 2014 they imposed a moratorium they said we're not going to gain a function research but there was essentially a review process set up and they set it up in a way where the definition is very opaque and funds continued to flow to these third-party organizations so hundreds of million dollars hundreds of millions of dollars went to ecohealth equal Health was doing Cooperative research with the Wuhan Institute of virology and they were taking naturally occurring coronaviruses and they were doing experiments on them this is like the Jurassic Park problem right like life finds a way and so it becomes a super virus you would think and again we don't know that it came from a lab I happen to think that most of the evidence is stacking up in favor of the lab leak hypothesis but we don't have a Smoking Gun but notably those who are arguing for the zoonotic origin I.E that it came naturally occurring from an animal or an intermediate species like a Pangolin by the way I didn't know what a freaking Pangolin was two years ago what is a Pangolin it's like a weird looking animal interestingly enough someone in my congressional art competition drew a picture of a Pangolin almost one came in second place but what's up what does it look like it looks sort of like uh like a kangaroo penguin like that's what I'm imagining no it looks like sort of a like a ferret mixed with an armadillo is sort of how I would best so it's armored yeah it's hard to help armored yeah it's an up armored Pangolin uh all right we're we're getting off track here yeah it's important though also doctors I've I've talked to say you really don't need gain of function research because of modern algorithms and modeling techniques I mean it's just it's just unnecessary so but so what they did was was there do you think there was intent at NIH to to fund it but just fund it in a in a roundabout way that offers them deniability well I so if I step back one layer and say I should say the intent behind the gain of function research I don't think is an evil one right the whole the whole idea is that by yeah experimenting on these natural viruses you're trying to get ahead of the next pandemic but in modern times that people have assessed that the risk reward just isn't there totally right I mean you're meddling with the Prime Minister one of the reasons is the ones I just stated you have modeling techniques can that can sort of allow you to to do the same job without creating a super virus and we've learned that lab leaks are actually more common than we thought right and it's not just in you know especially Penguins running around the lab is that what you're saying there's pangolins running around lab a couple of pangolins hopped up on Texas whiskey you don't know what's going to happen yeah well you do yeah Global pandemic um I I here's what here's like here's what I think is the most plausible hypothesis fauci and sort of the network of scientists that Fouche be awarded funds to because fauci is the Godfather of gain of function research had so much of their professional reputation invested in gain of function research right and they thought that they were saving the world by doing it right that it is so hard for them to admit that it went wrong and I think the bias during the moratorium was yes we need to continue to make progress on this type of research so we're gonna we're gonna get close to the line maybe we'll jump over we're gonna obscure where the line begins and ends that's that's what I think happened but it is undeniable that hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayer money went to gain a function of research once again a function research and Cooperative research with the Wuhan Institute of virology and we now know thanks to what the outgoing Trump Administration Declassified that as early as 2017 we had U.S diplomats flag security concerns with the Wuhan Institute of virology that there were possible military dimensions of that program or at least there were Chinese military officials that had access to the lab if not overall control of the lab we know that there were workers lab workers at the Wuhan Institute that got sick potentially as early as October we know that there was a massive Gathering of international athletes the world military Games was held in Wuhan in early October and that there were people there were athletes from multiple countries that came down with flu-like symptoms and so I've asked the Pentagon to release all the records we have from the roughly 200 American athletes that were there it seems obvious to me that we would want to know if they got sick were they tested did they have antibodies and again I'm not trying to like go out there and score points by bashing fauci I just don't want there to be another Global pandemic that totally upends our way of life and so understanding how this one started and when it started is step one in trying to avoid and prevent the next pandemic but yeah here's the thing I'd say and I didn't start off in this position with faucy I don't think any of us did totally uh he seems so arrogant right now like in that exchange with Rand Paul yeah he's he's attacking he's on offense he doesn't Express an iota of humility or just explain it like it like give us your version of it yeah you know say it the only plausible explanation that fauci could give is explaining how it's impossible for NIH to know that if money goes to Eco Health Alliance there's no way they could possibly know what it Where what happens to that money after that that would be the and you'd have to prove that to us that would be a very simple explanation but he doesn't do that he just screams at Rand Paul yeah so just say like okay we were funding ebright's organization because ebright was in the business of going around and collecting all these viruses we did not intend to fund the gain to function research we did not have perfect visibility into everything that was happening at the lab here's how we interpreted the definition here's how young interpreting it like this it doesn't have to be uh right yeah and then it would kind of be forgotten about because I don't think anybody thinks the NIH wanted there to be a global pandemic of course not you know so I'm not even sure the Wuhan Institute wanted that so I'm not even you know I think the Chinese government tried to cover it up I don't think they wanted yeah this to happen um you know just seems like a bad policy on a lot of fronts but you know so so I don't understand the defensiveness from fauci I don't understand it all it's it's it's gone from just defensiveness to arrogance and it's actually I mean so the administration still has them out there on the Sunday shows every week as sort of the lead Messenger on everything related to coronavirus but I think he's lost the Public's trust and this is part of the reason why so many public health officials have yeah and it's it's like and it's because of me watching the news all day today and as they try to make the case that that you know children are at risk this is the top 10 killer of children but it's like a child has a much higher chance of dying from the flu than covid that remains true it's always been true so when you say things like that without any context without it without the actual facts you're just you're trying to scare people deliberately and unnecessarily we don't wear masks for the flu again children are at more risk from the flu just buy the data then covid and yet and yet this is the the line that they're using now now we want to have people wear masks because even if they're vaccinated this is nonsense well fauci was on I think it's on tapper's show on Sunday someone sent this to me and I forget the exact way Tapper worded the question but he said you know given you know what we know about the lab does this make you hesitant about doing this type of work with them going forward and fauci basically said we've always been careful and will continue to be careful I'm sorry but that's not a freaking acceptable answer why does the Chinese need our money anyway I mean I guess that's just for a broader policy discussion I maybe they don't need it I I suppose we invest in labs around the world so that we get in access to their data perhaps I don't know what the point is of funding this otherwise yeah so what's interesting about this is the plan on the table and this is where Josh Rogan has really Unearthed a lot of this is to increase we have this whole program that's geared towards all these Cooperative relationships with these labs and again the intent is isn't is is a noble one I'm not suggesting anyone's out there trying to like actively cause a pandemic it's we're going to get ahead of the next pandemic they're actively trying to push a 6X increase in the funding for this program called the predict program where we're going to increase the amount of money that we we spend to do Cooperative research and I think it's a bad idea because I do think if if indeed it's determined as a the most of the evidence suggests that uh this leaked from a lab and that we were funding gain a functional research the lab the first thing you would do is to stop doing that right let's not do more gain of function research particularly in sketchy Chinese Labs that are controlled by a genocidal Communist Regime that does not give one crap about the welfare air of the Western World at all so sorry to sound crazy on your otherwise sane podcast uh Super Saiyan can I say one other thing about this before we move on to your list of issues and by the way I should I should note I'm staring at a very handsome portrait of a of uh Dan Crenshaw on the the cover of his book fortitude available in bookstores everywhere if books are still sold if they haven't been shadow burned off Amazon at this point looks very good I may not read your book to say but I'll stare at the cover because you gotta signed copy read for the audience when I signed it okay you don't have to Dan you can just read it you could give whatever version you want Mike hopefully this book helps you be stronger finally [Laughter] and then like way down the page Semper Fi of an exclamation point give you a little shout out Bill like break me down build me back up yeah I appreciate that okay final point on Wuhan then we can move on to your things so in April I don't know why I'm obsessed with this in April early April of 2020. so that like we're in the the throes of the pandemic at that point everything's shut down the intelligence Community the uh led by the dni the office of the Director of National Intelligence releases a statement a short paragraph statement it's very odd it's very rare for the dni to release like public statements like this and it says uh and I'm paraphrasing you know the intelligence Community agrees with the strong scientific consensus that this was a naturally occurring virus and not you know man-made or genetically modified so effectively the the dni and the entire intelligence Community the Trump intelligence Community by the way weighs in in favor of fauci in all the EX quote-unquote experts who were pushing this narrative that all started with this letter that was organized in this medical journal the Lancet or scientific journal of the Lancet which was organized which we now know thanks to foia documents fauci's Communications confirmed this by Richard ebright who was the head of the eagle Health Alliance who has the biggest conflict of interest in the world the one guy who was sort of the leading proponent of gain of function research who had built this entire professional career organized a letter in this otherwise reputable scientific journal that said this didn't come from a lab it came from it was naturally occurring and anyone who suggested came from a lab like Tom Cotton like Dan Crenshaw is a crazy tin foil hat conspiracy theorist and then our own intelligence Community weighs in on their behalf what the hell happened with that I want to know like did they Outsource their analysis to these scientists that they just uncritically accepted their worldview that's unacceptable from the intelligence community and I come from the intelligence Community like my bias is to is is with like the hard-working people there and this this is a crazy failure and I think if confirmed the biggest intelligence failure since 9 11. that's a pretty big that's a pretty big deal what you just laid out there and people should probably just maybe rewind um a couple minutes if you want to hear it again I think it's a very important point the fact that that letter that that analysis was created by Eco Health Alliance who had been funneling this money too they are the ones who funded gain or function research directly to Wuhan so that so that fauci could say we didn't do it directly and um and then they get the the bureaucrats in DC to basically come together and all agree I guess it's a bureaucracy bureaucrats love broad consensus yeah you know so if you're trying to understand psychologically like how could this happen yeah I think well I think a lot of people dni don't understand the science of it no they know they they defer to experts right there's a everybody everybody goes to the same Master's programs he needs a refill needs a refill they have it out there um they uh they go to the same experts you know they graduate from the same schools right um the same schools you went to all this evil Georgetown yeah yeah Harvard jeez I didn't go higher you went to I would never go to Harvard is that a two-year or four year I've never heard so one year yeah I didn't exactly get my PhD I didn't but it is a master's program anyway don't worry about that that's not that's an important point this is a very important point because I think um there's a great uh I I kind of said this before in after the Bay of Pigs Fiasco in the early 60s Kennedy has this great quote where he says uh you know you always assume you know when he says when it comes to the minimum wage I have no problem overruling somebody or telling them that they're wrong because I know the issue but when it comes you know when you're dealing with the generals and you're dealing with defense issues you always assume that the military generals have you know information that's not available to ordinary Immortals and I still think that effect holds true and why it's important to have veterans in Congress because I do think that if if someone comes from the intelligence Community or someone comes from the Pentagon and they got a bunch of stars on their shoulder there's a tendency particularly among sort of uh members of Congress that haven't served to just uncritically accept everything they say and the intelligence Community I say this as a human intelligence officer like that you know it's subject to the same flaws and biases that all human beings are we used to say the problem with human intelligence is that it involves humans and there were severe limits to our ability to collect in China it's a very difficult collection Target and I think it's fair to say we weren't focusing a lot of our collection priorities on labs in Wuhan and let's be honest I I think that just for some reason uh bureaucrats in the so-called deep State I don't like that term but it you know it is kind of a real thing you could call it at least an administrative State that's what it is executive branch has grown but when people are talking about the Deep State you know sometimes it gets a little conspiratorial I don't think it's like this like this organized deep State what it is is it's a collective of people who come from the same worldview and have a have a very severe reaction to how Donald Trump talks right because he sounds wrong even when he's right like that's that sort of yeah I just I love the guy but let's just be honest and um and you know it's like man he was right a lot but he sounded so wrong every time he talked about it it's like even you know like the UV light and the veins thing that sounds crazy but it's actually real like that's a real scientific procedure like it's totally real you know or during during the whole uh hydroxychloroquine yeah Fiasco yeah my family's all Physicians I'm the only like non-physician and they were like yeah we've been prescribing this for years Super safe you and I have taken it overseas probably yeah what malaria or something I guess the jury's out on whether it's like the most effective right but it's like it's not dangerous so try it like my God like why was this such a thing totally the scientific Community has severely lost credibility the public let's call it the Public Health Community sign means a lot of things right I still think theoretical physics has some awesome places to go okay that's a totally different podcast but space lasers and well talking about here um well I mean look the debate over over whether you know over whether there are or we are in a multi-world universe oh interesting right and you know the the a lot and like very mainstream physicists believe that there's just an infant number infinite number of universes now why is that well it's because it's because of the the schroederer equation and the probability collapse of a particle yeah so you don't you never know where it is until you measure it okay for for a given particle that's just a that's just a fact of particle physics it's a fact of quantum physics and so the question is um well you know what happens to the other the other half of the probability and I'm not describing this perfectly but I'm basically getting it right and and the answer is it splits interesting the answer is it splits and so you have an infinite number of universes um and uh I don't like that uh Theory a whole lot it doesn't sit right with me but um but you know I'm not really smart enough to debunk debunk it I just read this uh String Theory String Theory would be I think the other version of this um kind of a basically like a holographic Universe they're sort of like an underlying energy field and then our reality is projected in sort of a 3D image from that 2D reality I thought I was supposed to be the nerd and I have an irresistible urge to stuff you into the line I minor to do this right I just read this this sci-fi book that I liked a lot called dark matter which is all about this about sort of infinite universes and then this this author I think is Blake Crouch maybe I'm getting that wrong he just wrote another one called recursion which is not necessarily about time travel but it's time travel-ish I like to read sci-fi Dan that's a yeah you just talked about stuffing me in a locker you're like wow wow I die five bucks all right it's true but I already I already fooled my wife into marrying me so I don't need to pretend anymore it's all the veils coming off congratulations yeah yeah it was uh it was a big accomplishment on my part yeah that's great your first date yeah just all right what were we talking about we talked about fauci Wuhan yeah look can I make a final point on this oh yeah yeah then we're gonna get to kind of just broader Chinese how we should think about China and some other so that was gonna be my final point so I'll instead I'll say sure you made a comment about science and I do think the Public Health Community has suffered uh as a result of this crisis um although I think I think the general public and maybe this gets to the themes in your book I mean like I don't think the government's role in our life is to like remove all risk from our lives like yeah well this is a key philosophical difference between and a key reason why we've had so much disagreement on the covet response yeah and and like the essence of Science in my opinion as like a fake political scientist is is is is not like to generate consensus but rather to challenge it right like it's the whole scientific method is you develop a working hypothesis and then you actively try and you disconfirm it you try to disprove your own hypothesis yeah but somewhere along the way in this pandemic we did the opposite where it was like science means you have to subscribe to a certain set of beliefs questions and silence other stuff I mean it was ridiculous yeah because I mean consensus is built eventually but only after like you know the world is round yeah like it just is and um that but that consensus was built over time yeah as you know you know let's call it like the arrows from the flanks of trying to disprove that consensus kept failing yeah but that's the that's a great example not the Earth is around but uh you don't believe the Earth is around dude I do I do I do the basic the basic idea of like heliocentricity that the earth goes around the Sun was considered heretical at one point so there's this great like vignette about Galileo who obviously challenged that and then the church authorities came to uh to arrest him from his house and they're like taking him out of his house and who knows if this is apocryphal or real but he has this quote and I don't speak the language but he says he says so he's getting he's getting like taken to prison as a result of believing this and he's like and yet it moves it's like it's still true that it moves and he was willing to challenge the scientific Orthodoxy at the time which is really a religious Orthodoxy which is what I think we're confronting today right which is a religious movementism yeah yeah fauci has become a a demigod that cannot be challenged I think National Review had like a uh of cover of him with like a halo around his head I mean let's just be honest that's what it is climate change debates the exact same thing it's a religion but that's like it's got to be a proxy for something bigger that I don't fully understand like why like why would the left I'm not sure if they understand their intentions on this I I do think it ends up in in control and collectivism there there's a bit again the question still is why like why do you love that idea so much why do you love that control why do you want everybody doing the same thing and singing the same tune so badly why does that make you so happy and it's funny coming from the people who who Express such love of diversity and and and even want more diversity in any institution just for the sake of diversity of course what they mean is more of like a color of skin diversity they still they think all the people of different colored skin and ethnicities should also say the same things and sing from the same Hymnal yeah so you know superficial diversity so to speak but it's it's weird and um I'm not sure they know why yeah uh to be honest I I think um in my in my estimation and Analysis of the left it's they they moralize and they analyze life through through for one lens and one lens only which is their sense of compassion and caring yeah and this kind of makes them pathological um and unable to engage in any kind of conscientiousness you know problem solving just fact-finding um they they don't engage in that linear logic yeah that you would need to engage in to come to certain conclusions you you see this in the mass debate right and I say this is someone like in the pandemic my basic view was hey like let's wear a mask it's imperfect but that's what I have to do so that my local you know restaurant can stay open I'm more than happy to do it right like yeah master and perfect just watch a friend there's like a healthy yeah sure yeah yeah yeah just like use your best but post vaccine though yeah I don't know now they want to remask yeah this is a problem so why the hell did I get the vaccine if I gotta go back to wearing masks this is gonna this is this is hugely detrimental for vaccine hesitancy and you know this because now it's like wait now I have really no point in getting a vaccine if I still have to wear a mask and I don't know if this is the same in your district and my district used to sort of be a swing District now it's a little bit more Republican but I think I still think it's true of just your just your middle of the road person in Northeast Wisconsin I think we've reached a point where it's just naive to think that we're going to go back to shut down some massive particularly for kids no we're done we're done we're having massive events everybody's in baseball games and stadiums like we're just not we're just not there you know and and like you know if if if there's vaccine hesitancy um I I just heard this stat on the news so I'm going to repeat it you know don't hold me to it but two-thirds of the people I'm vaccinated are in the Latino and black populations so who's messaging to them let's be honest it's Democrats interesting and who is who was creating distrust in the vaccine early on it was Democrats right I was Paul Harris I was blowing up among them I was blowing up Governor Cuomo today because Chris Cuomo decides to like mention me on his show yesterday like I'm this like anti-vaxxer and I'm like whoa whoa whoa whoa you know get your facts straight but he's like he's like Freedom whatever you know this is basically his monologue um I posted it on my social media and um and I was like oh so I've always said this that you should take the vaccine um but you know who hasn't your brother Governor Cuomo who was like you shouldn't he literally is quoted you know in October like saying you shouldn't trust it you know this just wouldn't trust this FDA that's what he said yeah so like they they set the stage for this early on they politicized it early on and um they're trying to Gaslight the American people and make it you know and say republican no obviously there's a lot of Republicans who are clearly skeptical of it um look you know it is what it is the the thing about government and the thing about the philosophy of government is you just have to accept that as a governing body you can only do so much and you should only do so much that is life and they hate they hate that idea yeah that's where faucism comes from because faucism is all about you do the thing that the experts said to do yeah and you you do it you rube you just have to I think I reached my breaking point when and I was all in on we got a sacrifice I was pissed about two weeks what I wrote not bad but I but I didn't fight it you know it was two weeks I wore an op-ed after that April 2020 where I said okay hey the shutdown we had to do it but not a sustainable strategy here's what we got to do going forward whatever but then in when Thanksgiving came uh and you had fauci out there saying like people can't gather together in Thanksgiving like okay I'm sorry the government really has no role in telling like who this was the start of my big Fourth of July party is that right because President Biden was like well if you're lucky you can uh have some people in your backyard outside for Fourth of July and I was like I'm gonna have a giant party now yeah so well this gets to your issue you want to transition to uh not that you know about super spreader hashtag uh um this is the difference between China and America and like we're not going to beat China by out China in China like China was welding people into their Apartments early on in covid like China's ability to lock down a society is always going to be better than ours like we naively like America can do a 15-day shutdown to slow the spread I think you can appeal to the Patriots I mean like maybe you stretch it to a month like maybe at Best But like this is a nation of you know Frontiers people and Risk Takers and Texas also it's never worked anywhere in the world it hasn't worked anywhere in the world all there's other countries like still I think Singapore's re-locking down yeah um you know all these countries that have been hailed is like getting it under control because they were responsible yeah but it's like it's a pandemic and it's Global people always do this with Singapore and I admire a lot of Singapore's you know they have interesting Healthcare Systems it's like five people who are all bazillionaires it's not America right you have to you have to filter the ideal through what's possible in America right uh and I think the American people are willing to sacrifice a lot but when it I I just think the school issue is where it came to a head a lot of parents in my district I mean yeah digital learning may help a little bit with high school kids but for middle school for young kids disasters worthless and then they finally get to school and they're forced to wear these masks on their face and it's like totally and again the science says you you are more at risk from the flu yeah you know this is just it's just it's mind-blowing okay let's get to let's get to China um tell us how to solve the China problem is is this the greatest uh foreign policy threat facing America over the next 50 years I think so uh and I say this as someone I spent the first 15 years of my career as a Middle East specialist and an Arabic linguist convinced that the Middle East would be yeah like the main and I'd be curious if you had a big proponent for Endless Wars endless yeah just like the only problem with these wars is that they end at some point yeah you can keep them going uh um so and this is sort of like my biggest area where I had to revisit my priors and had the help of a lot of good friends a guy served with uh he's in the same specialty as me Matt pottinger he was a deputy and security advisor Manor in linguist China guy super smart guy and I met him in Iraq in 2007. you know we've had this debate going on and he was right I was wrong on the whole thing um I do think it's sort of the only existential threat we face now you can make an argument that Russia presents an existential threat because of its nuclear weapons but like as an ideological matter like I think what's so dangerous about the Chinese Communist party is is they're trying to not just like destroy us militarily and they are trying to do that in the region they're trying to sort of discredit the entire sort of American model and in so doing discredit the entire free world and show that their model is is superior and they've they've gone to school on the failures of the Soviet Union and learned a lot of lessons from that and and feel like they have sort of figured out the code they've been they're leveraging technology they're far more economically powerful than the Soviet Union never was and so for that reason many others I think China is is going to be the sort of over arching threat of the next 50 years I think we're in the early stages of a new Cold War it's different from the old Cold War it has some similarities but notable differences we can get into I think the most critical element of this competition is is still however sort of a hard power military competition over the fate of Taiwan in the next six years and I'm not sure we're taking that very seriously and uh incredibly do you have a good answer on that one because look I don't think they might like I don't think voters would possibly support boots on the ground in Taiwan I agree with you so that's a bit that's a failure what can we do yeah I think that's in part of failure of people like me and possibly you and in terms of explaining the importance but I think you're right like if the Chinese tomorrow invaded Taiwan or just at least planted some facts on the ground and we had a vote on an aomf I think we'd lose that vote on the on the house floor almost certainly um so we have a lot of work to do okay so how do we prevent that from happening because ours is a defensive strategy it's a deterrent strategy we want to avoid I think I don't I don't think I don't I think no matter what you do no matter how convincing you've been over the last decade if let's say we've been convincing people how important that was yeah I still don't think he'd get there um so one question is how do you prevent it but this is critical distinction you can't have a strategy that is based on deterrence by punishment because that's going to fail right you can't say oh if you invade and plant some facts on the ground we're going to punish you we're going to potentially escalate all the way up to the nuclear level because I think both Xi Jinping and the American people think that's BS we're not going to do that right which is why you needed a strategy of deterrence by denial you need to feel the capabilities that can actually prevent The Invasion from happening or at least degrade it significantly in real time I think I agree with that that's extremely important make it so make it you would they would never put the Chinese would never put boots on the ground in Texas yeah because everybody's armed yeah they would just like you know I mean so so how do you make Taiwan that same kind of porcupine I did have on this one I guess I I had what I called a Red Dawn Taiwan one a strategy where it's like how do you in similarly in Wisconsin it's not crazy with every deer season we become like the eighth largest army in the world just based on the number of people who have deer hunting license the number number one through seven are all Texas counties but good luck try it come on uh uh so how do you how do you do that how do you turn Taiwan into a porcupine so one of the opportunities we have available that doesn't involve you know five years to build a super expensive ship or like betting big on autonomous weapons that may never materialize so and one of the biggest things we've done in in the five years that I've been in Congress is we got out of something called the INF treaty the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty was signed in 87 under Reagan 8788 check me on that your legion of fact checkers can talk about that um so this allows us to field all of these ground launch missiles with ranges between 500 and 5500 kilometers that basically allows us to flip the script on what China's doing to us for the last decade because the biggest thing China has done is build up their rocket for us right and these are really serious missiles they have totally like ship killing plane killing missiles and we're on the wrong side of the cost curve right because it costs relatively nothing to field that missile as opposed to a carrier which now costs 13 billion dollars so we can actually reverse we have totally different goals I mean we're trying to power project and they're just trying to defend a region totally so you know it's not fair it's not a fair fight from the get-go although we are trying to defend specific territory in this case and it's hard it's hard to do they'd have to do some sort of amphibious Landing in Taiwan I mean that's not an easy military time yeah yeah you just you want to make the cost so high that you know without without American troops necessarily so we'll even get to that point this is our key part of it I think uh the comment on the Marine Corps has the right idea with trying to rotate these small teams of Marines throughout the first island chain just really to kind of mess with the Chinese but have those Marines been through um like diversity and inclusion training I knew you were going somewhere thank you because if they haven't I don't know how they could possibly beat the Chinese god this is this is such a disaster I mean we're still we're still getting um we're still getting uh emails on this stuff there's been some more good yeah that's why we haven't sent the report yet because you and Tom Cotton opened up this basic open Forum yeah for yeah I've I've uh so I'm now the ranking member on the military personnel subcommittee so this is front and center okay name dropper no big deal I mean um 250th in seniority in the house you know a lot of people need to die and then I'm in charge yeah it's really huge too uh I did not mean to imply that I had power as a result of this just that it's anyway on it's at the Forefront of our minds I'd be curious I always think of this in terms of uh it's gonna sound stupid um pull-up bars right so the Marine Corps you know I was not it's Miss shock you Dan as you're staring across at the just the physical specimen in front of you right now I was not a great athlete growing up you know I was good I was all right at running I played a little basketball I was not good gazelle yeah yeah I'm not a runner so for me the biggest challenge to getting in the Marine Corps as stupid as it sounds was doing pull-ups like the first time I got upper body strength yeah I just left I didn't lift you know and that's why I need this book that encourages me to get stronger Fortitude by Dan Crenshaw fortitude published by 12 New York available in bookstores everyone uh but like it's like so I had to work my tail off for two years to go from two pull-ups to 16 Pull-Ups so I went to the bare minimum you need to survive OCS as 16 pull-ups and I did that and then it took me another two years to work up to like 20 22 Pull-Ups so I could get the max score on a PFT and like yeah I was proud of that right for someone who was like a weak little you know like I couldn't do anything like and the beauty of that is there's all the Marine Corps cared about was whether I could do this thing it wasn't it was like the great equalizer right and that that is essential kind of important to how the military operates right all that matters is like can you get the job done and I served in what were pretty diverse units downrange and race was never an issue it was never like a discussion at all it was just how do you get the job done can you do your job when the moment comes like will you carry the radio when it's your turn kill the rate like it just and this is a very destructive ideology Bing West had a great article on this other way I'd be curious to hear your thoughts I imagine they're somewhat similar and particularly in the seals where it's like you know there's just no room for this stuff no not at all um and it has seeped into the teams I I don't think I I'm not as worried about our training yeah um because this this was a this was a problem because they wanted to grow the forest not because they thought the force should be diverse or whatever but because they wanted to grow it um there was talk about lowering the standards and the SEAL Teams had to had to um justify why it did every single little thing like why why are you paddling for 12 hours in this boat on Thursday of hell week and why haven't you let anybody sleep for five days like why what is the point of this why do you have to do 22 pull-ups what is the point of that it's like well because you have to climb a caving ladder to board a ship you might have to climb a rope to get over a wall you know and if you don't have upper body strength and not just for your own body weight but for like you know the 50s 60s 70 80 pounds of gear you might be carrying then you're useless to the team and you need to go away so we just make sure that you can handle that before we even send you to a team it's very simple right it's just a simple screening process and so why do we torture people the way we do and and they did a great job just justifying that line by line and so um actually one of the things I did in this last session was ask for those standards and justifications from each Special Operations uh unit like when the army every branch and um so that if they ever try to change it we can we have that in writing we can go back to them we can give it to you because you're the very important man on the on Hask uh the personnel subcommittee and you can say C I told you you see this is why you have to do 22 Pull-Ups um so well the Air Force is like there was an article two weeks ago Air Force uh physical fitness test uh now allows you to like choose they're thinking about like allowing you to choose whether you want to do the run or the walk or a row or a swim I'm just not on board with that there just needs to be a single high standard across the board and then the the Gophers will say General officer flag officer will be like well we want America to we want the military to look more like uh America does that's a terrible idea it's not it's not it's not true right like just like 70 of what does that mean 18 to 34 year olds aren't even eligible to join the the military and we're in an all-volunteer Force like you want it to be elite right yeah maybe the best of America that's right you know maybe the most elite of America and it should and people aren't going to want to join if they feel like they're joining this like sort of wishy-washy JV team yeah you know and we can't give that impression and uh the pushback we've gotten from um some of the Joint Chiefs and you know just leadership the dod is well you're undermining our credibility it's like no you did you undermined your credibility we're reacting to it and we're stopped we're doing a big favor here so stop resisting it first of all yeah because I'm you know I'm the bad guy here instead of you having to be the bad guy and the meanie against diversity and inclusion training so but that's the issue right I mean I think and that's sort of the more pernicious aspect of this and is this where we need to stipulate of course we don't want any racism in the military no one should be discriminated against the color of skin but that's not what this is about no I I don't know if you I I'm maybe that exists in some units it should be exterminated it I never saw it personally whatever I mean uh but I think a lot of our general officers and flag officers are just trying to appease the mob at this point and then also there's an industry I mean the industry of diversity and inclusion I mean the military is paying money for this stuff like they are Outsourcing training um you know it's the the and they have their gods like there's a whole like religious aspect to this you know there's there's the there's Martyrs um there's there's Gods there's there's there's priests I mean they're really if you really think like ibra mix Kennedy is a priest who gives you the gospel that you must recite and like there's words you must recite there's rules you must live by like this you know diversity and inclusion is is just an offshoot it's it's the it's the nice way to say critical race Theory yeah and it would it would be fine if you were just like teaching people about different backgrounds okay because if like in the Navy we know I don't know maybe you're in a unit with a bunch of Filipinos and so because it's very normal it's a very normal thing in the Navy uh so maybe you should have a I don't know a time when you get together and you learn about it each other's cultures sure fine that would be what I would think about as like diversity and inclusion training but like that's not what they do or or just intellectual diversity right I'm all for people challenging like the mission not we can't challenge the mission but like challenging the concept of operations right like okay beat this up red team like what am I missing you know what I mean like I imagine the SEAL Teams was even way more collaborative in a flat structure than in the Marine Corps right like if that's the diversity we're talking about okay but then when the Commanding Officer says all right we're moving out we're crossing the line of departure like oh sorry uh okay we just bleep it leave it sorry all right you got my bad being such a bad fashion geez my bad I don't know like podcasts are you Catholic I am yes yeah are you uh what are you are you I was married as a Catholic what does that mean who's my wife is Catholic and I do what my wife says that's a very Catholic sentiment yeah um but I I mean I grew up in a Methodist Church yeah interesting interesting uh we don't need to go down that road I forgot what I was saying but uh something about the military and diversity anyway but the point is as we went off on a huge tangent there because of uh my one little joke but uh we were talking about Taiwan but I you okay so I think we got what else should we how wait let's let's just talk about Congress Stan throw your oh yeah off the okay so no more foreign policy yeah um I'd be curious how much time do we have in this uh shindig until we vote good we don't have votes when are votes not until eight all right we got three more hours so late yeah uh okay so when you came in in 2018 is that right yeah yeah I remember this vividly because uh I met you at something and uh I'm like this guy seems awesome and uh tell me how attracted to me you were I was very I'm like and uh uh uh and my team my team I'm like let's give him money and my team was like well obviously he's not going to win The Establishment candidate has all the support I'm like really I don't know he seems pretty impressive did you give me money I don't remember you did it yeah but like you bootstrapped this whole thing out of nowhere and I think most people just like discounted you and then you like built this whole thing which is amazing but I'd be curious like what are your you've come into this institution you we've never been in the majority since you've come in so it's like very different than when I came in two years prior like what are your observations about like how Congress works and and doesn't well I don't have the same like complaints it's really popular to come up here and and be like oh this is so frustrating as nobody gets anything done and my thought has always been it's not supposed to just get things done yeah you know that this is not the nature of Congress it's supposed to be a unbelievably deliberative and difficult body to get things done it's not optimized for efficiency like that's a feature not a bug of the system it's like hard yeah just like we should just kind of be happy about that it shouldn't be it's it's the reason the Democrats haven't really passed much yeah um so we should maybe be a little bit grateful for the whole not getting things done stuff because uh it's actually it actually works quite well there has to be very broad consensus um to get anything done at least and even in the current state so Democrats have control of all three bodies but they just they you know they barely have control of the Senate so they just can't do a whole lot and we have the same problem when you were in the majority so it's like it's kind of like a fake it's like a it's like a fake majority in a way yeah and um everybody gets on your side gets super frustrated that you're not getting the things done that they think they should get done but um it's also that same environment is what prevents the next guy from getting the things done and then and then maybe God forbid we just get those things done at a local level tailored to individual needs at certain communities you know that maybe need it maybe we engage in some pilot programs maybe some incremental policy making you know it's uh it's like the funny it's tough to get conservatives to understand that our rallying cry is uh who said this I'm not I didn't come up with it it's like a it's but but it goes something like this it's like what do we want well incremental change at a reasonable rate when do we want it in due time yeah you know are there are there like an obvious though set of reforms that you think would help I'll disclose my bias and then you can disagree so I oh to Congress yeah like I think I think you need you need power devolved from leadership down to the Committees because committees are where you can sort of get that incremental change and you know a little bit of bipartisanship happening I um I think the schedule is sort of absurd here like there could be a far more like rational way we fly in for a couple of weeks contiguously and then go home after that you get more time in the district more time here I think the existence of the Appropriations Committee makes no sense and you should sort of like devolve that Authority into all the authorizing committees and the distinction between the two makes no sense and then I I believe in some like more radical things like term limits and and stuff like that just be curious or you just sort of view that I don't know if I disagree with any of that obviously the devil's in the details on all of those things um you know it's not obvious to me that empowering a committee will necessarily drive a better outcome but it's not obvious that it wouldn't yeah um you know term limits I'm in favor of term limits but um you know not because I think they'll do anything good for the country I just I'm just in favor of them because everybody listening to this podcast wants them honestly and I'm just honest with people about that I'm honest every time I'm asked the question and uh you know because I can't find any good reasons because I'm like here's here's how I talk to people about it they're like I'm like look do you want you want me gone they're like no no I like you I'm like I get it but you don't like Nancy Pelosi right like you don't think she should have been there for 40 years and they're like exactly exactly I'm like do you think Nancy Pelosi is going to be replaced by some reasonable like Democrat or do you think she's going to be replaced by somebody to the left of AOC yeah all those all those center-left Democrats in San Francisco I mean you know it's like it's just I'm just like I'm just like fine I support it I'm not opposed to it I just um I just I just I'm not gonna lie to anybody and say your problems will be solved um by term limits I I think you know I I also think like the the tournament push for you know six years is like that's that's stream we landed on a 12-year account I think 12 years is perfectly fine and um you know because six years like just completely empowers the Deep State the administrative State and the staff State let's call it you know here in Congress there's a lot of older members these old boring members you've never heard of um who just will come up with some kind of history from a committee from a bill from like 10 years ago and it's like nobody would have known that if you weren't here just that long yeah and that's an important piece of information yeah and uh you know you need to have some members of some experience yeah there's nothing wrong with that there has to be some institutional knowledge um also we get reelected every two years and yeah there's some advantage to being an incumbent there's also some disadvantage totally like a voting record that like people used to be more of an advantage than I think it is I don't think it is as much anymore with social media and the way the Grassroots movements can just topple people that we've seen in our our own conference so you know I mean also also just by the way the quickest way to equalize the playing field would be to remove caps on donations interesting think about that yeah because it's impossible for anybody to compete with me monetarily in you um but what if what if you raise the individual cap to like a hundred thousand dollars it would be easy now because like now now like 10 donors could raise a million dollars for a candidate they really liked resume I hadn't thought about that now um and so I'm gonna think of a counter argument in five minutes yeah but it's just it's just so in Texas we don't have those limits for a state at the state level interesting at the state level so you know and it's certainly not obvious that it empowers an incumbent or a challenger really it's just it's just the way it is it's just it's different but it's not necessarily worse I do think though and I I don't fully understand what causes this but um the the it's undeniably true that your the average cost of a campaign has gone up and up and up it's ridiculous and so I think I think correspondingly the average amount of time your average member of Congress spends on fundraising has gone up and so that's actually the more pernicious effect of of money in politics it's not like people are coming into your office with a bag of money saying right that's an important point to tell people people don't understand that people think you're like owned by donors it's just not true it's just a Time cost it's like you have to donate X number of your time to raising money for re-election and that like naturally robs from the time you need to do I think that's true I think it depends on the member I don't feel like I spent a ton of time on that well you probably you're probably able to raise a lot uh from small dollar donations online right yeah yeah I can't do that yeah because no one likes you or everyone hates me um number one just that's like the main reason not good looking yeah it's I'm sure it's like a triple whammy man you know it's like my mom you know she thinks I'm cool like other than my wife sometimes but other than that it's just a real it's not what they've said yeah really you you reached out to my mom I knew it I knew it Jackie what are you doing so sweet sweet Wisconsin woman she isn't a man she's she's a she's a saint Jackie is a saint um I had another point on this that now I've lost in this conversation uh wasting time on campaign Finance wasting time on campaign Finance utility of congressional reform I think it's not feudal you think it is no no no I didn't say I disagree with any of the things you said what was what was the last thing you said okay so we have this division between the authorizing committees and the Appropriations that's an interesting one dates back to the days of John Quincy Adams it makes no sense because presumably the same skills you would need to be an effective authorizer yeah the same for an appropriate right you need to have knowledge of the executive it does seem like a weird extra step that we do yeah so just um you want people that are paying attention to what that executive branch agency is should we talk about the uh real elephant in the room what's that earmarks earmarks okay it's too dangerous congressionally directed spending congressionally directed spending yeah it's um it's it's gotten such a uh well here's such a reputation on our side and uh maybe for good reason because I think it was there were Apostles there were abuses at some point I believe but it's like the question is is there a way to make it not awful and why is it that the executive branch gets to direct this spending to to you know to individual projects in my district and I don't that's like what the hell so that's the okay so let's all just submit okay there were abuses that needed to be addressed so what happens getting rid of money for beekeepers and whatever you know just silly spreads to Nowhere right so Congress took action well in tension but it had the unintended consequence of further empowering the executive branch and I suspect this is the area where you and I agree the most which is that the real story of Congress or the modern Congress is giving up power giving up power to the executive branch right the executive branch is sort of unusually powerful in the in the Modern Age um particularly unelected members of the executive branch and that's and that's who chooses where the money goes when it comes down to like the really minute stuff because project approval totally like I can't I can kind of advocate for project approval especially for like the Army Corps of Engineers but if it comes to like awarding something like no way you can't be involved in that but the bureaucracy is and maybe that's okay I don't know but the um but the argument for earmarks I'm not making it just just saying it and it's it's not a bad one yeah it's basically look we know how to direct this spending the best and if you put really good safeguards on it this is you know like for for me those safeguards would have to be like it really has to be used for infrastructure and only infrastructure right I think that what the Democrats have done in this session is put a lot more safeguards on it I still don't think enough yeah um I think you can still give it to non-profits and things I I'm not I'm not sure I like that but but the point is there's got to be a way to claw back that Authority and not have it decided by unelected people in the executive branch right while still preventing the abuses you can do both I think you can accomplish both yeah but um earmarks have just gotten such a terrible reputation and um like like honestly I think a lot of things a lot of the problems people have with Washington seems like they're they're always referencing a past abuse that isn't really relevant now but it's really hard to have the conversation now I'm trying to think of other examples where that would be true like lobbying for instance I think maybe that used to be much more corrupt now there's so many ridiculous rules on gifts just all sorts of things it's just they used to be the wild west now it's just not and I just I don't think they have this power that people think that they have that's true you know and it's just people just don't realize that people also think we get retirement for life which is also just not true do you agree with my sort of schedule thing because it strikes me that uh what was your schedule thing okay so we'll actually be here more or less more I think uh okay but okay we fly in on Monday we fly out on a Thursday it's crazy there's no time people are fundraising all the time like you and you like you and I I think I agree with that it needs to be like blocked it doesn't have to be more time but how about we just put all the time at once yeah so that we're just like better time quality like we're just here um yeah I agree with that because like you like this is probably the longest conversation we've had and like we're friends we're friendly we talk on the house floor a lot part of that's my fault you've invited me to the concerts and I've been like my bedtime's 9 30. I can't go yeah I can't go out so you're a nerd but uh they're just you gotta you gotta get to know people to like get anything done in Congress and maybe getting things done is not what you want to optimize around but uh I don't know it's just the Comfort conversations would be good you know there's a happy medium of the getting things done yeah for sure yeah again people it's not as easy as people think it is or at least just having a debate like my dream is to walk onto the house floor and to witness an actual debate happening which I have not seen in my five years in Congress I've seen people reading talking points I've seen people yelling at each other I've seen something approximating a debate I've seen it during the government shutdown because no one had anywhere else to be and everyone was actually on the floor but and I I guess I think I've seen what I think approximated debate you know especially when we had motions to recommit and there was like argument counter arguments that's a debate yeah but maybe the definition of a debate should be somebody could actually be persuaded yeah you know and like that that's maybe what you're referring to like there's there's no each side is simply making the arguments and um they're not willing to be persuaded and I don't know if there's anything wrong with that uh to be perfectly honest I it just it just might just be the way it is yeah um but it also depends on the issue I there are certain it's rare but there are votes where people are like figuring it out at the moment for sure because it's just that I'm just that unsure about it it has happened a couple times for sure so you know it's just it's just rare um it doesn't mean I don't know if that means there's anything wrong with the system per se um we didn't cover anything on your list here apologize but yeah we got China cyber security so I don't know if people are that interested in some of this stuff I think they're probably a little bit more interested on the inside baseball and of Congress yeah I wish I had like a lot of stuff I've already I've already talked about malicious story that uh we could tell the times we went to the White House together to yeah we do have a White House story but it's not salacious no we we just well okay what were the we we was going to precipitously pull everybody out of Syria right and we were like you should think it was a bad idea that gets to the whole Iraq and Afghanistan withdrawal my view is that we've through a process of very costly trial and error we've arrived at a sustainable posture which is you have a small investment of special operators and you know regular forces that work by with and through local allies and you're able to actually do a lot a lot for like a modest investment of U.S resources yeah you and I are in the same outlook on that and we lost the debate you know I mean look at what we're doing right now um and we're quickly moving into a situation in Afghanistan that looks just like it did pre-911. um and uh I hope nothing bad happens you know it's it's uh it's a little frustrating and it's almost insulting to to have the deadline be September 11th totally insulting to be honest um at the 20-year Mark like who are you saving I'm so tired of people moralizing over it like we're just like they're saving like us poor soldiers that didn't understand what we were getting into that's that part really pisses me off I wanted to ask you about this because I that's like the we got to bring the troops home well like yeah you know I was like there are little babies I wanna I wasn't a seal it's like let me tell you what these guys are like you're not your little babies when I was like 23 and like a second Lieutenant like you were probably a babe I was a total baby little babe you couldn't even do pull-ups you could even keep your head up because your neck is so weak you're just like a little bit it's like uh someone cradle me like the last place I wanted to be was in Garrison like doing like yeah PowerPoint slides like I wanted to yeah everybody wants no I'm not saying like we casually deploy yeah you don't have your time waste so you don't want to lose your legs for no reason but like yeah you know you didn't sign up to do nothing so stop feeling bad for us um and also people are like well what did you get out of it you know what did you get out of 20 years I'm like no no more 911s yeah it's kind of a big deal yeah frankly because there's like tens of thousands of those people that want to kill us and would love to commit another 911 yeah if they could get the resources and planets and just like have some time to breathe also we haven't given them that time to breathe like when I joined the military I didn't do it in fact I thought like the invasion of Iraq was a bad idea at the time I didn't do it to achieve some greater geopolitical objective I did it like that was not my role as a like a a you know the person's lowest on the telephone like I didn't serve my country I did it to pay back a debt I felt I owe to my community I did it because I wanted uh to test myself selfishly I did it because I wanted the test specifically of I didn't know anywhere else where as a you know a 21 year old graduate of college I could have that much responsibility and really see what I was made of and then I like just some there's a complicated Adventure yeah yeah that I just like I you know I just want to go out and run around and see what I'm made of you know it's like it's not like I was like I'm joining the Marine Corps because I feel like having a non-sadam democratic Iraq is so important that I must be right in that I think that's an important point that people don't understand there's definitely a lot of people um that I think went to Iraq and served there for those exact reasons um and who were like openly against the war yeah so that and I think that's a pretty interesting point to make and I had another point to make but I lost it but that was everything fortitude Dan Crenshaw American resilience the age of outrage available for books are are sold how do we how do we wrap this up we talk about low brow stuff what was they gonna low-pressed yeah what do you do for fun this is how you got into trouble on Jonah's podcast Joan again in trouble on this podcast not me I held it together yeah well that's good what did he say or did he even publish it no he put it out there yeah it was it's all good yeah it's not elected we talked about have baked ideas so I have a lot of half-paked ideas that are not quite ready for prime time they're not fully baked well this is a policy podcast first and foremost an American I can play when you're half-baked ideas and you can pull it up on your little iPhone 5 there which is kind of weird that you have one of those very old uh um file of half-paked ideas uh wow that's weird yeah so one of them is uh airport bars if you're not flying because airport bars are an interesting place you know the airports should just have their bars open 24 7. do you think it would again people you think that would get people though yeah yeah just you know they could be at six a.m where else can you drink a beer at six a.m a lot of guys with like their kind of ties hung low like the top button unbuttoned my brother-in-law my brother-in-law said that uh on the subject of term limits there should be term limits for drug kingpins because part of the problem I know you're big into you know Mexico South America Central America part of the problem is these you know they they get you know there's rivalries within the drug cartels and you know if there were term limits there wouldn't be as much violence and turnovers how do you enforce the term limit do you kill them I don't know I think they do enforce term limits and drug cartels I think they murder people Dan listen I'm not the details guy I let you nerds yeah we're the Nerds the space lasers will take care of the the so we got a couple hours before we go back to votes you're just gonna you're gonna read your sci-fi novel I might I don't know yeah I'm sure I have worked it I got to

hi everyone this is congressman Greg Stanton I think we've had enough time for virtually everyone to join today's call so let's get started with today's webinar regarding economic stimulus portions of the cares Act that was recently passed by Congress I don't need to tell anyone on this call these are really challenging in difficult times in the United States of America one of the most difficult times that we have ever faced and first and foremost our hearts go out to people who have lost loved ones as a result of this horrific pandemic the corona virus people have lost family members friends colleagues no one in our country has been left not impacted by this horrific pandemic and of course we have had to shut our economy down and that has had devastating impacts on individual small business the entire economy people are hurting and we did pass with in Congress so far three important bills directly related to the corona virus pandemic and today we're going to talk about a variety of things but including especially portions of that bill that related to direct financial support to people that have been so negatively impacted by this virus every single day my team and in the ninth district and I were hearing from folks who are hurting people are worried about their paychecks and making ends meet we're having in Crete record increasing levels of unemployment people have lost jobs many have had the clothes there are small businesses and they're in dire need of financial relief so in a few minutes we're going to hear from experts we're gonna walk us through the economic stimulus portions of the relief packages that we've passed and we're going to talk about during these difficult times tragically and sadly there's still people who are engaging in inappropriate activity scam operations to try to take advantage of people that have received this money we're going to try to talk to you also about how you can avoid becoming the victim of a scam let me first just talk diving a little more detail about what we've done in Congress to support the American people during this crisis at the beginning of March we did pass an eight point three billion dollar bill that really had to deal with the medical side of it to make sure that we got we try to provide as much support for supplies for our medical responders our heroes during this crisis I like everyone on this call and frustrated that we have not been as successful as we need to be to get the equipment particularly personal protective equipment into the hands of people that need it not just our doctors and nurses but also our police officers and firefighters and emergency responders and those that are working on the front line in our grocery stores who were we have come to learn are such an essential part of delivering food and providing food security during this time of pandemic all of them deserve that personal protective equipment as a member Congress have been frustrated at the despite allocating the resources that we have not done everything we can including full of rotation of the defense production Act to make sure our heroes get that personal protective equipment after we pass that first bill a two weeks later we did pass the families first act and the family's first act ensured that coronavirus testing would be free to anyone in need regardless of whether they have insurance it provided emergency paid sick leave enhanced emergency unemployment insurance and it did allocate over a billion dollars to expand food assistance programs and it also provided emergency measures to protect frontline health care workers and much much more again that was the right thing to do but I'm also frustrated that we have not done nearly as much testing in the United States as would need to be done if we're going to talk about opening up the economy that's not the discussion of today's webinar but as a member of Congress I am paying close attention to the President and other leaders in their discussions about when and how to reopen the economy and I feel we cannot really really open the economy unless we have significantly more testing in a place and that's been frustrating as a result of that of the family first act that a more vigorous testing regimen not been put into place the United States of America and then of course the the bill that we're gonna really talk about today is the cares Act that was passed at the end of March a two trillion dollar bill the largest bill that the United States Congress has ever passed in American history it gives you a sense of just how serious this pandemic is that we were that we did pass the cares Act and by the way more is coming one of the provisions of the cares Act was to immediately send individuals and families direct cash payments to alleviate some of the hardships Americans are facing and there's a lot of misinformation in the news media and social media etc and there are some bad actors who are trying to cash in on this crisis so that's why today we have experts from the Internal Revenue Service and the Federal Trade Commission we're gonna answer your questions about those direct payments and to address some of the common scams that we're seeing people try to take advantage of this horrific pandemic how you can protect yourself as a member of Congress I'm gonna keep working and fighting to meet your needs and make sure we all come out of this as financially secure and stable as possible this is the one of the greatest challenges we face in American history and succumb but upon Congress to do all we can to support the people of America make sure the people and families of America are protected to the extent possible we're already working on a fourth stimulus package and it certainly will include more resources for families in need okay with those introductory comments I want to welcome all of you to this important webinar we're going to be covering the facts regarding economic stimulus checks common scams and how to protect yourself and to answer a few important questions that we've received in advance from people on the webinar let me introduce you to our experts first we have Annabel Marquez she is a congressional district liaison here in Arizona with the IRS office of legislative affairs so she works with Congress in the community on a regular basis second we have Maricela Segura she's a director of the Federal Trade Commission's western region office in Los Angeles she'll talk to us about some common scams that were seen sadly during this pandemic thank you both of both of our experts for joining us this morning Annabel can you start us off thank you Congress Thank You congressman Greg Stanton for this opportunity to deliver important IRS information as the congressman mentioned my name is Annabel Marquez I'm the congressional liaison for Arizona I work with congressman Stanton's office basically to help constituents get answers to any IRS with needed questions they may have I'll start by sharing that the IRS is working as quickly as possible to make sure people get their economic impact payments in fact over 80 million Americans already receive their economic impact payments and their bank accounts this week additional rounds of payments will continue ultimately helping a hundred and fifty million Americans as you may know these are there are many things that still need to be smoothed out and you and updated information is frequently being posted on the IRS website so I encourage everyone to visit IRS govt forward slash coronavirus for all the latest information economic impact payments are being distributed automatically with no action required for most people and this includes Social Security recipients so let's go over eligibility requirements in order to qualify for an economic impact payment people must have a valid social security number if you're single you must have had an adjusted gross income of no more than $75,000 people with a married filing jointly status who earned up to 150,000 are eligible and if you file as head of household you must have earned up to a hundred twelve thousand five hundred dollars in order to qualify folks who receive Social Security benefits or Supplemental Security income are also eligible and the same applies to adults who receive non-taxable income the payment amounts are at follows $1,200 for single dividuals married couples who file joint returns receive 1,200 per person for a total of 2,400 per couple in addition to these amounts there will be an economic impact payment of $500 for each qualifying child and for people with incomes above these amounts that I just mentioned the payment amount will be reduced and it'll be completely phased out if you're single and made more than 99 thousand or if you're married filing jointly and made more than a hundred ninety-eight thousand so how does the IRS know where to send your payment as I mentioned earlier economic impact payments are being distributed automatically with no action required for most people the economic impact payment amounts a person receives is based on the information the amounts are based on the information you provided on your 2019 taxes so for those of you who have not yet filed their 20:19 returns your 2018 returns are being used to calculate the payment payments are then issued to the bank account or address you indicated on that return the IRS is also working with other agencies to retrieve your information if for example you receive Social Security benefits or SSDI benefits again there's nothing you have to do your economic impact payment will be issued through the same method you receive those benefits people who have not filed tax returns in a long term or although because they're not required to do so it could be they are in too little or they earn non-taxable income those folks can now file a simple information return online again IRS govt you go to the website /khroe no virus it's the easier webpage to access this tool it's a new tool called non-filers enter payment info here by clicking on that you'll be asked to submit submit your full name your current mailing address email date of birth social security number and your bank account information again you can access this tool by visiting I Giove forward slash coronavirus we also have you know some advice from the Social Security Administration basically going over let's see or some of the information that we discussed people that receive Social Security benefits again they don't have to do anything if they didn't file a return for 2018 or 2019 and they qualify for the benefit and they earned under the threshold the IRS will again contact you know deliver their payment automatically because we're working with the Social Security Administration on that if you haven't yet received your payment it will likely arrive at your account in the next few days for non filers who enter their information online those payments should also be issued within a matter of days and paper checks will be mailed out in early May so we're only two weeks away from May so that'll be soon very important to note the economic impact payments will be available throughout 2020 so if you don't receive one right away the IRS will be mailing out letters two weeks after issuing an economic impact payments these letters will confirm that in fact your check was deposited or mailed that letter will also have instructions on how to claim your economic impact payment if you never actually received it and well we will continue updating our website with answers to your frequently asked questions so you make make sure to check check back frequently and one more thing I just want to make sure that you know we start talking about this and I know money said less I would have from the Federal Trade Commission will speak to you more about this but I just want to remind everyone that the IRS will not call you to request personal or financial information over the phone or by email the agency will not call you about economic impact payments remember those are being automatically distributed so once your payment is sent off again you'll be getting a letter in the mail confirming that and there's no need to believe anyone who calls acting like the IRS or asking for personal or financial information and with that and to get into more of these scams that may be going around our yeah I'm going to turn it over to muddy selasa little mouse thank you and I look forward to answering your questions Thank You Annabelle and Thank You congressman Stanton for inviting me to participate in this webinar we really appreciate the opportunity to talk to people in your district about scams related to coronavirus what we're doing about them and what we can all do to avoid them to give some context to this issue today the FTC has received over eighteen thousand two hundred reports related to corona virus or koban 19 and people have reported losing over thirteen point four million dollars related to corona virus fraud that is more than double the reports we saw this time last week next slide please we know that scammer has following headlines we know this from all the health emergencies and natural disasters that we've had in the past as things change and headlines changed you can expect to see scammers targeting people to reflect those new headlines as well so by sharing what you're seeing in your community you can help everyone else spot these scams too so we encourage you to report any scams or frauds to us at ftc.gov backslash complaint our complaint our consumer Sentinel complaint line we'll share those complaints with over 800 law enforcement partners throughout the country who also use our complaints to guide their enforcement efforts so please let us know what you're seeing out there you can also call us to submit a complaint at 877 FTC help next slide please um so we know scammers are going to follow the money so by now you know we know that the federal government the IRS and Congress are making a strong Airy effort to provide some financial assistance to those in need as a result of this crisis even before the ink was dry and the care zaq scammers have been targeting people with fake relief checks schemes and they're exploiting the uncertainty about these government programs and payments the first thing in helping people to spot and avoid economic impact payments cans is to cut through the confusion and uncertainty about these issues so I can't stress enough that you need to go to the reputable sources for these for these pieces of information you go to irs.gov backslash coronavirus as Annabelle mentioned and also if you want some Social Security Administration specific information you can go to ssa.gov backslash coronavirus next slide please now here's what what you need to remember as Annabelle said if someone calls you out of the blue claiming that they have the end there's money available from a government agency and all you have to do is make an upfront payment or provide some personal information or financial information to get that money hang up the phone it is a scam the IRS will not call you about your economic impact payment the IRS or nor the gun nor anybody in the government is going nobody's going to ask you to pay to get help no one should ask you for sensitive information to get this help what scammers are doing is they're trying to take advantage of the uncertainty so ignore anyone who calls emails texts you out of the blue with offers for help to get money from the government these are scams if you receive a check for more than what you're expecting it to be be very careful the government is not going to call you to ask you to give back the overpayment by sending cash or gift cards like iTunes or Google Play gift cards or wiring money that just will not happen if you receive a call like this that is a scam only use irs.gov/fatca-registration for these fake treatments and cures everything from these miracle cures vaccine offers and home test kits that people are getting they're targeting people who are on Medicare older adults claiming that they that there's a product or a test kit offered to older adults in need and a few minutes we'll talk about what the FTC and FDA are doing about these fake cures and treatments the takeaway here is to ignore again these out of the blue online and telephone offers for vaccinations tests or cures help will not come to you in this manner and if you receive such an offer it is a scam so if you see ads with the prevention treatment or cure claims for corona virus stop right now scammers are Hawking these bogus products to prevent treat or cure the corona virus if there's a medical breakthrough you're not going to hear about it for the first time from an ad or a sales pitch but especially if you're on Medicare you might get calls or emails or see ads that claim to give you special access testing or treatments that's not how Medicare works they're not going to call you to offer you quote special access or put you in line for a test or treatment anyone who does call you with such an offer is a scammer next slide as usual scammers are using us emails and texts to try to get your personal information your money or to load malware and viruses onto your computer here's an example of a fake World Health Organization email that put malware that could would put malware onto your computer you see it has a click here for safety measures we're also seeing that scammers have brought up lots of don't bots have bought up lots of domain names that include the word corona virus in them and they even include misspellings of the word so if you visit one of these sites they could it could put malware onto your device so here's a tip don't click on links from sources you don't know it could download a virus onto your computer or device make sure that your anti-malware and antivirus software and your computer is up-to-date especially now that many of us are working from home and engaging with our colleagues in that way on next slide please so robocalls this is always an issue and now we're seeing that you know as more of us are working from home we might be picking up calls that we wouldn't normally answer because we're getting them from work colleagues and the law that means we we may also be receiving more robo calls scammers have been quick to pick up on and get into the coronavirus business and they are offering fake cures again Prevention's and test kits by Robo call these are those automated calls that are pre-recorded but they're also tailoring their Robo call scams so we have seen some coming from the Social Security Administration supposedly purportedly coming from the Social Security Administration that let's say it's related to the corona virus for example saying that your Social Security payments are going to be suspended because of the corona virus issue unless you provide some personal information they're also tailoring these calls to talk about your mortgage and student loan payments with relation to corona virus here's what you need to do hang up on all Robo callers and block that number and then report the call and the number if you can get the number report it to the Federal Trade Commission we use those numbers and we post them on a daily basis and make them available to telecom companies on a daily basis so that they can block those numbers these numbers are a come up again and again these scammers can get new 800 numbers so in blocking them is important one additional thing to know about these robo calls don't press any number even if the recording says press 1 if you want to be taken off this list or press one to speak to a live operator do not do that because pressing 1 will not get you off the list will not take you to a live person who's going to help you what it's going to do is is inform the Robo call of the scammer that it's a live number and it might lead to more robo calls instead next slide please and unfortunately the chair there are charity scams and charity scammers follow headlines as well and so whenever there's a natural disaster or health crisis like this we can all expect to see fake charities as well as fake Appeals for money and these might come your way on social media or on crowdfunding sites we're in phone calls and emails so we really urge you to do your homework when it comes to donations use the organization's listed at FTCC back slash charity to help you research reputable charities if someone wants a donation from you in cash or by gift card or by wiring money don't do it these are sure signs that it is a scam next slide please now I just want to make a note about misinformation and rumors I mean there is just so much information flying around right now some of its good and some of it is not and it's hard to tell the difference to try to sort things out we urge you to think critically about the messages you're seeing ask yourself these questions before you act to pass on any message to a friend or a family member think about who is this message from do you know them do you trust them are you sure considering all the fake emails and phone numbers we've already talked about you really need to be sure that you know what the source is also what do they want you to do what do they want me to do do they want me to buy something or provide personal information or download something take some kind of action oftentimes if they're urging you to take action especially if they're urging you to do it very quickly at the sure sign of a scam and then what is the evidence behind the message there's a lot of information out there about about the virus and what can prevent and cure the virus so do some fact-checking from good sources before you pass the message along you do not want to spread poor information bad information and certainly false information so let these let these questions steer your next step and then also you want to get information from trusted government sources about Kovan 19 and you can start by going to usa.gov backslash coronavirus for information and links to federal state and local government agencies and resources next slide please so in terms of our law enforcement we're primarily we're a law enforcement agency and what we're doing is we're targeting companies that are making claims without scientific proof to back it up so during this pandemic our attorneys and investigators are working to find those companies who are breaking the law and stop them so to date we've issued 47 warning letters to companies who are making claims about products that allegedly prevent or cure the corona virus and giving them 48 hours to say how they're going to address the concerns we raise and so some of this snake oil is vital silver aromatherapy different kinds of homeopathic remedies herbs here's some example of companies that have received some of our warning letters we've issued many others and we've worked with the FDA to make sure that these claims these dubious health and cure claims are removed and we also watched social media and online marketplaces and complaints to make sure that we have that not only the companies we receive our letters cut it out but that we're not seeing other bad players we're happy to report that our 47 warning letters have succeeded in taking down the dubious claims for the companies who receive those letters so I will say your reports matter if you spot what looks like a suspicious claim about a so-called coronavirus treatment or cure please tell us about it let us know at ftc.gov backslash complaint or call us at 877 ftc.gov and with that I'm happy to take any questions hi everyone this is Larry sandy the director of outreach for congressman Greg Stanton Thank You Annabelle and Thank You mighty Sela for this really important information before the the webinar we asked our constituents if they could submit questions that they had and so I'm going to ask as many as I can and mostly about the stimulus checks so Anna Bono I know that you covered this but can you confirm our people on disability eligible to receive a check oh yes the answer is yes they are and they should be receiving those checks beginning and early May okay will the $1,200 stimulus check be recorded as additional income no the statutory language and the care sack legislation establishes that the economic impact payment will not be taxable as a matter of fact what it does explain is that it's going to be a refundable credit which would allow folks who weren't eligible to receive it in 2019 or who hadn't yet filed in twenty twenty nineteen and who's 2018 returns were used to determine eligibility and did not get it as a result would still have an opportunity to claim it when they file taxes next year okay and and abow as far as you know can it be recorded as income for the purpose of other federal benefits again the economic impact payment is not taxable income so it wouldn't you know effect you know if taxpayers receive other benefits if this is independent of that and it's not taxable okay another question that we have is can the check be garnished and if so how much and for what reasons that's a great question Larry and based on the announcements and the Care Act legislation language the check can only be offset if there is delinquent child support debt so for purposes of a care sack legislation in terms of any delinquent debt having to do with federal taxes or state taxes that would pretty much be off-limits meaning the check couldn't be garnished for anything other than child support payments now there have been some media reports out there that point at other types of debt but as far as the karasek legislation as it relates to federal state tax debt it's been established that no offsets would be allowed other than to cover delinquent child support and the amount would basically be dependent on how much is owed so it could essentially mean that an entire $1,200 payment is offset if the child support delinquency is $1200 or more okay thank you can i stimulus check even if I'm three years behind on filing a return with the IRS yes absolutely what the IRS is encouraging folks to do if they haven't yet filed their returns and they have the requirement to do so based on their earnings is to go ahead and file as soon as possible if they file their tax returns they could do it online we have several programs including free file that allows for people to file their taxes online with no cost but the good news with filing now is that even with the IRS office closures nationwide folks who electronically file their tax returns are seeing that those tax returns are still being processed within normal times and if they are owed a refund those tax refunds are still being issued within the 7 to 21 business days that the agency always promises so if they haven't yet filed their returns and have the requirement to do so they should do that in order to be able to then receive the economic impact payment ok another constituent asked I haven't filed my 2019 taxes yet but my 2018 taxes put me above the adjusted gross income would I be eligible for the check if my 2019 income would be below the required income level yes and again we do encourage folks to file their 2019 taxes as possible I'll take this opportunity to remind every one that the IRS did extend the tax filing deadline this year to July 15th so understandably there are many people that possibly taking advantage of this extension and haven't yet filed their 2019 returns so if the IRS wasn't able to locate a 20-19 return and pulled up the 2018 return to determine economic impact payment eligibility and noticed that the income threshold was above the eligibility for the 2018 return what's going to happen is as soon as they're farther four they filed or 2019 return if they're eligible there will still receive an economic impact payment if they're still not eligible in 2019 but because of the financial hardships of the pandemic in 2020 this year they would be eligible and they can claim that credit that economic impact payment credit on their taxes next year okay Annabelle so just to clarify you know if I am a person a taxpayer that made too much in 2019 but then lost all sources of income for my 2020 filing I can still get that tax credit yet that won't be determined until you file taxes in 2021 remember we filed taxes for the previous year so next year you'll files are 2020 taxes and then it'll be determined that based on your earnings in 2020 in this case you know the losses would make you eligible for the economic impact payment and you would receive that economic impact payment on top of any refund that you're owed got it got it now we're moving to family situations who receives the children's benefits in a split custody situation the IRS can only use the information on the tax return on file soldiers in a change to marital status since the loss falls at home then that would be an issue that has to be also figured out and squared away between of the two spouses and you know it happens sometimes with the poeple earned income tax cuts well you know sometimes there is a situation where parents have separated or divorced and they're both claiming the children for the economic for the Earned Income Tax Credit and the question is well can the IRS do anything to make sure well usually there is an arrangement that is made in terms of who gets to claim the children so all we can do is we'll issue the economic impact payment and anything having to do with you know which parent would get the five hundred that would be something that you know the IRS pretty much has to stay away from we encourage them to have that conversation now one thing I will mention is that if they had a joint bank account and when the last filed the return but because of the separation or divorce that bank account was closed the IRS will generate a paper check in the name of both persons on the tax return so when they received that check then both persons would have to go to the bank and figure out how they would divide that stimulus okay does that make sense yes okay I received benefits for someone who recently passed away but had filed their taxes does this money have to be returned we don't have official guidance on what happens in the event where a person receives benefit for a taxpayer who's deceased but what the IRS is saying is that basically assets of the decedent belong to the decedent's estate and should be handled by the estate's administrator so any issues concerning you know involving a decedent's filed return or the you know the economic impact payment should be addressed by the legal representative of the decedent's estate and for that we have publication five five nine but I do expect to have month all the Department of Treasury soon and once we get guidance on that I'll be happy to pass it along to congressman Denton thatha's okay and then we can pass it along to the constituent who asked that question thank you mm-hmm another question related to family situations I had a baby after I've filed my taxes from the last time how do I claim my newborn for the $500 benefit sure that it that goes along with the answer that I shared a while ago folks who didn't have a dependent in their last file tax return that have a dependent now would be able to claim that dependent for purposes of the economic impact payment when they filed taxes next year but for now there's no such tool where they're you know ability for the IRS to go and add an additional five hundred economic impact payments payment for a new qualifying child so all we can do for now is take the information from the last filed tax returns and next year when they file taxes they'll be able to claim the new dependent for 2020 okay and another question related to the website so I see that there is an option for non filers enter payment info here and then another one that's get my payment can you clarify which one I should use in what circumstance so the non filer tool is specifically designated for folks who don't generally file a tax return and for whom the IRS doesn't have pretty much you know an account so that we can then pull their banking information or their address to mail that economic impact payment so that would apply to folks who earn income that are let look below the threshold that's required to file a tax return or for folks who are non-taxable income that's what the non filer tax non filer enter your information here tool is for to get payment tool is for people who want to check the status of their economic impact payment the get payment told me also allows folks to enter their bank information so that would pretty much be what people go and login and check on to see if so that their payment has been issued and you know when to be expecting it so that's what the get payment tool is for that's the difference one is to enter your information and the other one is to check on your payment okay we have a constituent say that they try to using the get my payment website to track their payment and received a message that the status was not available but they believe that entered the correct information well what are some reasons that a constituents could receive either an error message or one saying that status was not available a simple reason why you may receive a message that says status is not available is because the IRS hasn't quite gotten to your account yet meaning the economic impact payment is being calculated and hasn't yet been issued so a lot of folks that haven't filed their returns in 2019 that I would say it's safe to say that those folks that filed taxes in 2019 and asked for a direct deposit for their refunds those were the the fastest and easiest you know economic impact payments to sort of start issuing out so now folks that hadn't yet filed the IRS is now having to locate the 2018 return so if they go and check you know on the get my payment tool to see if their economic impact payment has been issued they may get that status update saying information unavailable that only means that we're working on it so to speak okay and how often information updated yes thank you we are asking people to only check once a day because the information is only updated every 24 hours so used to you know go back and check numerous times during that same 24-hour periods and it's only once a day do we get updates to help people check again okay and we've had a couple folks say that they have not been able to use the website and because the taxpayer assistance centers are closed they want to know is there a way of contacting a live person for help well you know that's the difficult thing they are the agency is establishing a helpline to ample questions having to do with economic impact payments but because of you know the the measures in place for the protection and safety of taxpayers and IRS employees our call operator centers are currently closed so that's why we are asking folks to be patient and to refer to the IRS website and as soon as we do have a phone line that's up and running with operators able to answer calls we will be sending that information out you know immediately so that people can know where to call if they have questions we don't yet have that available for taxpayers well okay okay and what do I do if this if the stimulus check is for less than what I think it should be okay that's also a very good question if for some reason you received the wrong amount the IRS will basically be funding your letter in the mail like I mentioned during the presentation and you should be getting that letter about 15 days after the payment is made the letter will provide information on the amount of the payment how the payment was made and how they can report any failure that to receive the payment so if they believe they were not given the correct amount that letter will have instructions on how to claim the right amount okay and you said people will get that letter about 15 days after they get their payment the bank correct so in about two weeks they'll start receiving these letters from the IRS that's right okay mighty said I have a question for you from a constituent who hasn't been able to pay their debts and fears that debt collectors will soon start trying to contact her what protections exist for someone in this situation yes okay thank you for asking under the cares Act I'm not sure what kind I did this is but the cares Act actually includes a provision for deferral of student loan debt payments until September 30th 2020 so with respect to anything student loan related what I really want to urge your constituents is to stay away from third parties who are offering to assist that person with their student loan debt consumers do not need the help of third parties and they certainly don't need to pay third parties to deal with their student loan debt they should be getting their information directly from the Department of Education with respect to other debts it's my understanding that many banks and other institutions are trying to help borrowers right now so I would urge your constituents to contact their creditors directly as opposed to taking these unsolicited calls from debt collectors now it's true debt collectors may be calling and if they're starting to use aggressive tactics there's a few things that your constituents should remember the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act contains protections for them so for instance if someone calls out of the blue asking to collect on a debt and something about the debt doesn't sound right to the consumer your constituent they can ask for information on the debt they can also ask that all communications be in writing and they certainly shouldn't be subject to any kind of threats of of lawsuits jail if they start receiving really abusive and threatening calls they should report those actors to us because we enforce the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act so all repeat our complaint Lynas FTC gov FTC help they should also remember that debt collectors should not be revealing their debts to third parties sometimes disreputable collectors will try to shame people into paying by calling their their neighbors or their family that that's illegal so there are protections for folks under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act there is some relief for student loan payments but again I will urge your constituents for anything the student loan related they should go to the Department of Education they shouldn't be paying a third party to help them with their student loan debt anything debt related they have protections under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and if they feel like someone is being abusive or acting illegally they should submit the complaint to the FTC FTC gov and above all else talk to your creditors or your lenders they may be willing to work with you during this time many have said it publicly and so we anticipate that they'll be able to find some relief just by dealing with their creditors directly thank you and and money said one of the scams that you mentioned earlier which I'm hoping that you can resize now is about you know people caring to be friendly neighbors or friends going to the homes of you know either senior citizens or other vulnerable people and offering to get groceries can tell me a little bit more about that yes yes and thank you for asking it's a these are another twist on what we call the imposter scams people posing as folks offering help what we've heard unfortunately very sadly is that there are there are some people that may be going door to door and may be targeting older adults or folks who can't go out and buy groceries and they're offering you know for $50.00 I'll go and run your errands or buy your groceries these are scams they take your money and they run off and then also what we what we're still seeing during this time related coronavirus and we've seen before our what we call the family member or grandparent scams and these are where scammers will call out of the blue and pretend to be a family member and sometimes they'll just call an older if they know that it's a number belonging to an older adult they'll call the older adult and say grandpa grandma I'm you know your nephew or niece or grandkid and I need some help I I just need some money really quick and they'll try to rush the recipient of the call into action and ask them to either wire money or buy gift cards immediately because they're in dire need and what we want to tell your constituents is if you receive a call like that that is urge even if you think it's a family member take a beat stop do not go and send money or provide personal information first check it out if you really do think that you're receiving a call from a family member in need maybe you hang up the phone get the number hang up the phone and call around to other other family members just to check check out whether it's true or not sometimes even asking the person calling for a callback number so that you can take a few moments to check this out well we'll end the scam right there because the scammers do not want to give you a callback number but yeah we see these personal imposter scams and these fake offers of help coming up and some of them may just be going door to door and offering to buy groceries so again just my one tip is your force field to avoid all of these scams is if you're receiving a contact out of the blue you didn't initiate it and someone's asking you for money or personal information it's a scam do not engage hang up the phone and certainly tell let us know about it by submitting a complaint thank you money said we had a constituent say that they I'm sorry Anabelle at a constituent say that they had try to access to get my payment and the met they got a message that says please try again later based off of what you said earlier it sounds like people may get that message if they check it multiple times within the same 24 hour window can you confirm that and expand on that yes we are really encouraging folks to check once a day if they get an error message we do have a frequently asked questions document on irs.gov that goes into a little bit of detail of what certain error messages and it may mean but for the most part you can imagine millions of people are all caching the website trying to get information on their economic impact payment so it is possible that they may get locked out of the account after a numerous attempts we also know that you know congressman this is an app that's only been available for a matter of a couple of days so there are a few things that may come up we have identified perhaps a glitch or two and the IRS is quick to respond and make sure that things are smoothed out but we just ask that folks check once a day and if the issue continues I would encourage your constituent to send an email specifically detailing what the what the issue is and I'll be happy to personally look into the issue and see if we have an answer to whatever it is that they're facing when they're trying to access that tool thank you and just as a reminder to everyone who's participating is that you know our office office of Congressman Greg Stanton is here to help and so if you know you have one of these situations like animal just mentioned of you know repeatedly getting the same error message even after you wait 24 hours please contact our office and we can get in touch with the IRS for you and even though we are teleworking we are still offering full constituent services for the folks who are joining us are the phone number of the office is 602 nine five six two four six three and also contact us through our website which is Stanton house gov so unfortunately we don't have time for more questions but for the constituents that did some eight questions we will get in touch with you about your question and B and answer it just before we close off I just wanted to go over quickly again about how key it is to stay informed and what resources are available so you know one place where we are compiling a lot of this information is on congressman Stan's website which again is Stanton house gov and there you'll find resources from the IRS from the FTC and as new information comes to light we will be updating it and making sure that folks have access to the latest information and we've also listed the IRS toll-free number it's here on the screen you know and for individuals it's 1-800 eight to nine one zero four zero and that toll-free number is 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. - I don't know if you want to just one last time - over what are the options available for FTC on yes sure we have blogs and consumer alerts that let people know on a weekly sometimes daily basis what the scams are that are arising and how to avoid them so if you'd like to subscribe to those they're they're very interesting and pretty digestible it's FTC gov complaint online of complaint assistance is FTC gov about any topic including robo calls and debt collection and then our complaint line is 877 FTC helped heelp thank you thank you okay folks were unfortunately out of time but I just want to give our panelists you know ask them one question there's one thing that you want us to take away from this what would it be and we'll start with you Annabel then go to you mighty satellite and then congressman Stanton will close us out sure thing well I I think on behalf of the IRS I would simply like to remind folks to visit our website irs.gov e we are facing challenging times the IRS was handed this in incredibly large you know assignment so to speak this task of issuing payments to American taxpayers to folks here in this country that you need them right now during an already very busy tax season so because our operations are limited our offices we do encourage folks to visit the website and we're happy to answer questions from your constituents and I thank you for the opportunity congressman and Larry to address a few points and to answer questions thank you and for the FTC's part I've said it before and I think it's worth repeating if someone calls you or contacts you in some way out of the blue asking you to provide them money or personal information in exchange for help it is a scam do not engage with that person it and I want to emphasize if this is an uninitiated contact for example if you're already in communication with your bank well you know you're in communication with your bank but if this is something out of the blue coming to you as an offer for help but you just need to give them a little bit of money or or personal information do not engage and I guess I would also urge that folks before you forward some sensational news story or like some sensational story or pieces of information check it out because there's a lot of misinformation flowing around and that really does help support harm and scams right now by passing it forward so thank you for that for giving me time to talk to your constituents thank you the congressman Stan do you want to close this out thank you very much thanks everyone for taking the time to be on today's call it was very informative we find that using these webinars or a great way to provide information

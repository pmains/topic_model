i want to be very clear the rank and file members of the fbi and our department of justice they are brave men and women who do their job every single day i think they're doing an incredible job however the seventh floor the leadership of the fbi and the department of justice have been politicized in the eyes of most americans and i want to say that perception is reality and so it doesn't matter if you're doing right if people perceive that you're doing wrong and the only way to change that perception is through transparency and allowing people to know that what you are doing is right in the in the eyes of justice and that the scales of justice are balanced

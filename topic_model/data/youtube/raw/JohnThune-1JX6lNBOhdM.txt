uh Senator thune thank you madam chair and senator bullsman for holding today's hearing to consider trade and Horticulture titles of the farm bill um I look forward to working with you both of you and our colleagues on this committee to advance a farm bill that supports the needs of producers and Rural America and I also want to thank our Witnesses panelists for being here today to provide your input on this important topic and I wanted before I know it's already been touched on my colleagues of raises but before I turn to my questions I also want to reiterate my concerns with Mexico's efforts to restrict genetically engineered corn Imports which would threaten food security and stifle AG biotech Innovation that benefits both the United States and Mexico and under secretary Taylor I appreciate usda's strong stance on this issue and urge USD to continue holding Mexico accountable on its trade commitments under secretary Taylor as I've previously mentioned you I'm concerned about this administration's lack of attention to expanding Market access for U.S agriculture products I hope you and your your and ustr AG Chief and chief negotiator McKellips recent confirmations are a turning point for this Administration when it comes to AG trade in your new role what are some specific um you know new ideas and in addition to maintaining existing existing access corn exports to Mexico what are your ideas on New Market access opportunities for U.S farmers and ranchers and is it the administer is the administration considering Market access opportunities in Africa and then finally are you advocating for reauthorization of trade promotion Authority and so um first and foremost one of the areas that is a priority for me coming into this role is looking at a market diversification um obviously um the People's Republic of China is our largest single agricultural Market but we all saw um an over what an over Reliance on any single Market can mean so looking to help our agricultural exporters our farmers and ranchers identify new markets is really critical um I Look to a couple different regions of the world first I think South Asia is a really exciting opportunity I think about countries like Vietnam um when they have some of the highest macro economic growth projected in Asia they also have an expected 5 million middle class households going to come online in the next five years so we have an opportunity today and early on to create um consumers lifelong consumers their population is also relatively young so lifelong consumers of American agricultural products I think think there's a lot of potential and exciting opportunity there one that while the indo-pacific economic framework is still getting underdeveloped and exactly what the outcomes might be for U.S agriculture but I am hopeful that we will see successful access there addressing SPS and non-tariff barriers to knock down some trade hurdles that we currently experience likewise you mentioned Africa I think Africa is um generally um has a lot of uh potential uh in specifically um I think Kenya is a very exciting potential Market which obviously we are engaging with there as well we're also engaging on a couple other areas within the African continent um we are working with the African Continental free trade area that is under negotiation there um but one of the areas that we are providing support is technical support in particular as they are addressing SPS um regulations and how science-based principles can really help form that Continental trade agreement and the US is providing that technical support which will also benefit our agricultural producers so I think there is a significant opportunity on the African continent as well let me just uh say and again with by way of ipf and I couldn't agree more that the way to isolate China is to do it economically and that has obviously in that region of the world a lot of National Security implications as well and um it just seems like the ipf didn't address the issue of Market access which is what our agriculture producers in South Dakota are looking for and you know free trade agreements with countries in that region in the world you know free trade rooms with other places around the world some that are kind of what we think are low-hanging fruit and so it just seems like the administration no request for trade promotion Authority uh it hasn't been an FTA done and and the issue or the times there have been at least any sort of discussion around this issue it's been related to um issues on that don't have any of the market access so I'm just saying I you guys got to step up your game here and I hope you will I want I'm I just have a few seconds here remaining but during your confirmation hearing you mentioned your willingness to work with me on a path forward for mandatory country of origin labeling for beef last week I introduced a bill that would direct usdr and USDA to develop a WTO compliant means of reinstating cool for beef my question is will you provide technical assistance on the legislation and what actions will you take to coordinate with ustr on a path forward for mandatory cool for beef uh Senator thune we would welcome the opportunity to provide technical assistance on that bill and work with you you and Congress on implementation with our colleagues at ustr should it pass okay thank you thank you madam chair

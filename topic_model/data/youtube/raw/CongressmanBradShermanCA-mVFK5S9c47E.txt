brad sherman he's a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee congressman what's your reaction to that comment let it not be an arms race you know this kind of entertaining shoot-from-the-hip stuff might make sense in a campaign but not when you're dealing with an ex-president the United States and you're talking about nuclear weapons we need to be predictable perhaps in business you but could be unpredictable you've got a medium-sized aggressive powers Iran comes to mind that might find it in their interest to be unpredictable but we are the world's guardian of order and for us to be shooting from the hip or have our leaders shooting from the hip on nuclear issues doesn't make a lot of sense does it leave you scratching your head as to what Donald Trump's relationship is or will be with Russia we know how i see it is between Vladimir Putin and President Obama but now this and Vladimir Putin did say just today if someone accelerates and speeds up the arms race it's not us so what do you believe is happening between Putin and Donald Trump right here well one possibility is that this isn't all nonsense or even a mistake but rather is part of a choreographed effort to eliminate sanctions on on Russia and perhaps even acknowledge or tacitly acknowledged their occupation of Crimea hold on so you think that maybe this is Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump putting on a show for us I don't know whether it's a thought-out and choreograph but i think that one could imagine that they simply re-sign the START treaty tell us look we've solved this this nuclear problem or at least played it down and now is the time to eliminate sanctions take other concessions to Russia so I don't know whether this is all a mistake from people not thinking or whether this is a to say look at the nuclear that's what's important therefore we will make concessions on non-nuclear items we will just have to see how this develops I think the keep in mind though that much of what both leaders have said is consistent with current policy Russia is modernizing their system and we're engaged in a hundred and eight billion dollar program to modernize ours so if the talking is just live within the START treaty limits modernize your forces that's just a restatement of current policy it's hard to know what a position is when it keeps changing when it's a shoot from the hip and especially when it's expressed in 140 some characters well that's a new world we're living in all right congressman thank you so much for joining me this morning merry christmas good me with you you know

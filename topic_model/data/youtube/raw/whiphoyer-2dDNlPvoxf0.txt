point six billion dollars can get a massive tax cut I now yield three minutes to the gentleman from Maryland the Democratic whip mr. Hoyer this gentleman the gentleman from Maryland is recognized for three minutes I ask unanimous consent to revise and extend my remarks without objection mr. speaker the budget act adopted in 1974 requires that the house complete work on its budget for the next fiscal year by April 15th that's 172 days ago yet we now have a budget resolution on the floor already into the fiscal year for which the budget supposedly is planned some may ask why the answer is a simple one this is first of all not a realistic budget which could or should stand as a budget resolution no this budget is about putting our country it is not about putting our country on a sustainable fiscal path and and this is indisputable it is not a budget to inform the appropriators of budget priorities and constraints no the Appropriations Committee will not be informed why because we've already passed the appropriation bills this budget doesn't have anything to do with you tells their past they're gone they're in the Senate this is merely a vehicle for achieving partisan tax reform of the kind that President Trump and Republican leaders in Congress outlined last week despite what this sham of a budget pretends their plan is to push through tax changes that massively increase deficits I call it the granddaddy of all debt increases while shifting even more wealth from middle-class and working families to people like Donald Trump according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center 80% of the tax cuts in this proposal would go only to those who make over $900,000 a year here me the tax cuts mainly go to those making in this nation over [Music] $900,000 per year despite promises from President Trump and Republicans here in the house their plan actually raises taxes here me while cutting taxes on those over 900,000 it actually raises taxes on 1 in 3 middle class families who are in between 50 and 150 thousand dollars even though Republicans continue to assert that discredited supply-side mantra that tax cuts pay for themselves no responsible economist believes that not one responsible is the operative word the Tax Policy centers analysis found that their tax cuts would add to an additional one minute is yielded tax cuts would add two point four trillion to deficits over the next 10 years the previous speaker said this balances in nine years that's Allison Wunderland balance it will never happen I've been here for 36 I've heard those comments all the time it never happened but it's even worse mr. speaker the budget resolution also proposes to disinvest in job creation potential to repeal the Affordable Care Act it hasn't been repealed yet they pretend it's been repealed to kick 23,000,000 off their coverage and make those with pre-existing conditions uninsurable it cuts Medicaid and would end Medicare guarantee furthermore it would severely cut programs that reduce poverty and provide the kind of job training proven to get more people back into the workforce this resolution is a grab bag of all the worst Republican policies partisan tax cuts for the wealthy that leave the middle class behind the cruelty of Trump Kerry I thank the gentleman time has yielded partisan tax cuts for the wealthy that leave the middle class behind the cruelty of Trump care and draconian reductions in domestic investment the product is just as bad as the sum of its parts indeed it's worse instead we ought to be working together to enact bipartisan tax reform that is fiscally responsible and focused on the middle class I urge my colleagues to defeat this resolution and I asked Republicans who believe that tax reform must be permanent and therefore partisan be part bar bipartisan to join us in doing so the debt under Ronald Reagan only one person can stop spending that's the price of the United States he can veto spending bills the debt under Ronald Reagan increased 189 percent under bush 1 and 55 percent he had for years under Clinton 37% under bush to 86% and under Obama with the deepest recession of our lifetimes 87% ladies and gentlemen a budget is supposed to inform the Appropriations Committee of how it ought to proceed this budget comes after the fact and is only for tax cuts for the wealthy and I yield back the balance

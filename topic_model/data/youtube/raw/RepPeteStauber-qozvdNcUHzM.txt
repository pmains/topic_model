Thank You mr. speaker and thank you ranking member Chabot for yielding my bill 2345 the clarifying the small business runway extension Act is a bill that does exactly what it says makes clear of the intent of the small business runway extension Act of 2018 the runway act of 2018 was simple straightforward and unambiguous it simply extended the Small Business Administration's receipt based size calculation from a three-year average to five years recognizing the significance of this bill for small businesses the runway act easily passed through both House and Senate becoming law on December 17th of 2018 within four days of the law's passage the SBA stalled its implementation issuing an information notice that effectively contradicted the runway act of 2018 by maintaining the three-year calculation until the agency agency could go through the rulemaking process coincidentally or perhaps because of the pressure exerted by Congress and the public the SBA issued its proposed rule for the runway act of 2018 mere days before chairman golden and I held a hearing in the Subcommittee on contracting and infrastructure to hold the SBA accountable for its delay unfortunately the proposed rule still maintains the current three-year standard in SBA regulations during this hearing we highlighted how this conflict a la verse SBA regulation imposes significant real-world challenges for small businesses who may be teetering on the edge between small and other than small business status the need for clarity was a constant and reoccurring theme and this bill provides that clarity first HR 2345 makes the makes clear that act of 2018 does in fact apply to the SBA and therefore should have become effective on the date it was signed into law thus businesses relying on the five year average to remain in their quote small business status were correct in their assessment and may continue to hold this status second the bill requires a Small Business Administration to develop a transition plan for small businesses and federal agencies as they shift to the five-year rule the transition plan shall include a buffer period in which firms that benefit from the old three-year calculation may continue to rely on that formula for a set amount of time as they prepare for the eventual shift to the five-year average calculation in short HR 2345 restates the intent of Congress as written in the runway act of 2018 and adapts solutions that will create a smooth transition for all parties involved this will allow more businesses to retain access to SBA benefits including loans and contracts that have allowed our small businesses to grow thrive and greatly contribute to our economy I would like to thank chairman golden for his leadership on this act and it was and is a privilege to work with you and the Small Business Committee Thank You mr. chair and I urge my colleagues to support HR 2345 the clarifying the small business runway extension Act and I yield back

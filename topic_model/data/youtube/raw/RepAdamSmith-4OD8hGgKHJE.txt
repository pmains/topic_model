penn state adam smith sir with a big welcome to you um i'm curious if you expect this bill can be changed enough to pass i it's a difficult needle for the republicans to thread because they've got the conservatives who don't like what it does and you've got the folks who are trying to moderate it so i don't know uh it's it's hard to say i mean it's really sad the way they've approached health care which is simply to be against obamacare and not to be for anything because all the plan that they're doing does is takes health care away from a bunch of people and throws our system into even more chaos look obamacare worked in terms of adding a lot more people to the roles what we need to focus on is how do we make cost control work i don't see anything in this bill that's going to make cost control better so you know whether they pass it or not i think healthcare in this country is in a very very bad place and interestingly sir an nbc wall street journal poll suggesting that the majority of americans do not like the republican health care plan there's a quinnipiac poll suggesting only 20 percent of american voters are likely to vote for someone who supports the revised health care plan so what does that suggest to you and how democrats can make it work for them well i'll give you a slightly different answer look the problem with the health care debate and i raised this issue when we were passing the affordable care act with the obama administration is very few politicians are actually honest with the american people about the choices that are involved i mean nobody's worse obviously than president trump who says we're going to have a plan that's going to cover everybody it's going to be cheaper it's going to be great it's going to be perfect for everybody well that's not the way healthcare works in order for everyone to be covered you have to take into account the fact that people who are older or sicker are going to get priced out of the market unless you make people who are younger and healthier pay more unless you put various systems in place to ensure that healthcare companies can't cherry pick healthy people or cherry pick people in certain categories that's why you require a minimum benefits package that's why you require it to cover pregnancy and you say gosh i'm a 58 year old single man i'm not going to be pregnant but the point is you got to put everybody into the pool in order to make it affordable if you allow people outside of the pool the people who are healthier or less risky than the costs for people who fall outside get prohibitive that's what pre-existing condition is all about and the thing most people also don't realize is pre-existing condition it's not it's not okay these are the people with pre-existing conditions everybody is vulnerable of getting one you can have a child born with a horrible disease i mean simply getting old puts you in a position of having a pre-existing condition that makes you uninsurable so to make this work to get costs under control some people are going to have to pay more than they would on a simple open market but you pay more now so that hopefully when you get sick or you get old you can have affordable health care that's the balance we have to strike and i don't hear what i just said said hardly at all or is it this health care debate it's all about well they're taking insurance away from people or democrats want government to run it look healthcare policy is complicated for the reasons that i just stated and many more we need an honest discussion about it and then an honest bill that gives us the best chance look america does not have the best health care system in the world and we we haven't for quite some time we need to look and learn from what other countries have done that are actually doing a better job providing health care to their citizens for a lot less money but that requires an honest conversation yeah well congressman uh your your thoughts certainly are honest i thank you for sharing them on that and we could talk a lot more but i do want to get to the bill that you introduced this week aimed at getting the department of defense to come up with a strategy for dealing with russia's aggression politico's reporting today that the trump administration is debating whether to withdraw from an international treaty signed by reagan and gorbachev in 1987 that bans an entire class of nuclear missiles what's your reaction to that well that's sort of a minor side issue well not a minor side issue but the russians have been in violation of that treaty for some time so how we handle that is important the larger issue is the fact that the trump administration flat refuses to acknowledge even what russia is doing much less that it's a threat and it's just embarrassing that president trump finally came up with a position on it and that is well if it happened it's it's obama's fault he's been president now for six months he's come up with no strategy whatsoever in fact as you mentioned earlier most of the time he says the whole russian thing is fake news what my bill attempts to make clear it is not fake news what vladimir putin and russian is russia are doing is a clear threat to our country our democracy it's not just our election that they meddled in they're meddling in elections all across europe eastern and western europe they're also creating a lot of fake news stories in order to drive policies that they think are advantageous the whole situation between qatar and saudi arabia and the states in part was kicked off by a speech that the foreign minister of qatar supposedly gave that was inflammatory to saudi arabia only the foreign minister didn't give that speech it was something that was posted on the internet that was simply made up and then people bought into it these are the types of disinformation campaigns that russia is running and they are doing it to propo promote autocratic dictatorships and undermine democracies and president trump has steadfastly refused to even acknowledge that this has happened so my bill says acknowledge it and put together a strategy for countering it washington state congressman adam smith i enjoyed speaking with you i look forward to doing it again

on behalf of the Chairman senator wicker please Thank You mr. Spencer I've been in and out and it seems that you're doing well and I think I intend to to join a unanimous committee in in supporting your confirmation let me say two things please know as our future Secretary of the Navy that this committee is serious about helping you and helping president Trump get to the 3:55 ship fleet we've had over time since I was in the House of Representatives goals that we never quite got to it was 308 it was 313 here we are at 276 ships and our fleet we have language in the DoD bill and our house counterparts and language in the NDAA over there indicated to show you we're serious and frankly we think we've got you the money this first year to get us on the path to 355 ships so please know that we're serious about this and we want to be your team mates there let me ask you my one question about the physiological episodes that are occurring to our pilots particularly our training pilots in the t45 at the three undergraduate pilot training bases I've learned more in the last four or five months about hypoxia then then probably is wise for someone of my educational attainment I've learned that there's there are many types of hypoxia but the real problem with the training planes and our three pilot training stations is the histo toxic hypoxia and try as we might with the best minds in the Navy and the federal government we haven't gotten to a correct diagnosis and and the best I've heard is that we can maybe patch together a halfway of a solution here and with with a bit of a solution there and get us back to flying it to correct altitudes that we need to train these men and women to do the hard work that is expected on them and you've already testified in answer to senator Ernst question that that these PE physiological episodes will remain a top priority thank you for that we put a little something in the bill that I want to draw your attention to and I hope it stays in the bill and is signed by the president and and and it basically says while we're putting the best minds of the government at work the Navy and DOD can if they want to not forced to but can if they want to implement a prize competition you come from the private sector serve and all we're doing is saying after the best minds that we have in the federal government have tried and so far haven't found the exact diagnosis of what the problem is the causes is histo toxic hypoxia we could offer a prize to anyone in the country anyone on the face of the globe for that matter and you don't pay the money unless you unless you get a solution so I would just urge you to I would urge my colleagues let's keep that in the bill and treat it seriously and I would urge you after you're confirmed and if we don't get to a solution which I certainly hope we get to a solution quickly but if we don't take this provision seriously and let's unleash the brain power of the entire country and the entire globe to try to get to the solution so at whatever thoughts you might have on on that statement in one minute I would be happy to hear senator very exciting chapter one of thinking outside the box that's fantastic to hear and it excites me that those tools and authority would be available to us thank you thank you mr. chairman yield back

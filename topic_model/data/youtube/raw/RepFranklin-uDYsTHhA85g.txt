thank you mr chairman uh general clark uh as we've discussed the 13.2 million dollar budget is makes essentially flat for three years which in light of inflation does represent a cut as we had talked about for the first time in the organization's history you're going to be looking at personnel cuts what um what are you not able what would you not be able to accomplish with this budget that is this high on your unfunded requirements list congressman the the the aspect with this budget is that just we won't be able to go as fast as we would like to in some of our modernization and some of our future capability development and so as you hit it uh on what we try to what we what we did was submit an unfunded requirements uh list and that that list points to some of those specific uh things that we would like to accelerate if the if we could if that additional funding was given we submitted 28 different requirements for about 650 million dollars for so come which is about a six percent of our budget very good uh i am supportive of increasing our forced posture in eastern europe specifically baltics poland and romania and especially with our soft personnel do you see value in increasing soft's presence along nato's eastern flank i i think it's it's not as much as the increase in people as is the capability to make sure that we have the right uh capabilities in the right places it as you as you well know we have been in the baltics uh and we remain we've remained a partner of choice i believe with our soft partners in uh in eastern europe for a while i'd have to reevaluate with general walters and the and you know the our special operations command europe first specific additional but for the for the current ukraine crisis you know we put additional people and capabilities you know forward to assist with that crisis and that's an investment that's been going on for some time as we've talked about and has been noted in the press you know the ukrainians have put up much stronger fight than a lot of people are going to give them credit for and i think a lot of that credit goes back to the partnerships that have been formed over these years i don't know if this is the forum we want to talk about that or if there's anything in the unclass setting could you elaborate a little bit on the benefit that we've seen from those partnerships congressman in this in this setting uh those those enduring partnerships that we've had with the ukrainian forces in the ukraine since they were invaded by russia in 2014 have been critical they've been enduring and it's not just the us and the ukrainian but we've also brought in many of our our nato allies have also been shoulder shoulder with us in the ukraine you know training side by side with the ukrainian partner so it it's the it's the it's the relationships that we have built with many of our nato allies that have really helped tie this together well i'm reminding the old train like you fight fight like you train the time to figure it out is not when the war is hot that that's exactly right um the fiscal year 23 budget requests cuts cuts funding for maritime support vessels namely the carolyn schust for you all does this requirement for the requirements still exist and if so what is what is socom unable to do without this capability congress we're working very closely with into pacom specifically for the maritime to support vessel that you were talking about that that vessel just like any afloat staging base and as a former navy officer you understand you know how important proximity is in locations but the the maritime support vessel in and of itself is not a soft specific requirement or soft specific funding issue we're really looking you know to the services uh in in the in this case the navy uh and indo-pacon to provide that capability that will allow us better proximity uh to some of the to some of the issues in the indo-pacific you know so that we can be placed in the right positions thank you mr chairman are you back

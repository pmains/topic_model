i'll start with you senator king uh yesterday we saw a uh a multinational coalition announced that uh russian agents were targeting vaccine research through cyberspace uh uh in this pandemic healthcare networks are incredibly important to our security and while it's not clear whether the russians were seeking to destroy data the attempts are clearly troubling so how would a national cyber director play a role in preventing it preventing incidents like this and why did the commission find this construct most efficient well i think that the key is to have someone in an overall charge as i mentioned before we've got responsibility for cyber scattered throughout the federal government a variety of different agencies a variety of different authorities funding levels but there's no central coordinating function there's no person with the authority of the white house uh to settle turf wars to oversee budgets and to basically uh forge cooperation through the various agencies that are involved it was i think it was one of the most obvious suggestions of the commission that we talked about now we had quite a bit of discussion about where it should go and how it should be structured and the but the the conclusion one thought was uh elevate scissor or create a new essentially a new cabinet office we we rejected that because number one it would take a long time number two it would be duplicative of other functions that are already there and it wouldn't have the power and authority of the white house so the model we ended up approaching it as is the u.s trade representative who has responsibility for trade that cuts across a lot of federal agencies is presidentially appointed senate confirmed and has that uh uh authority within the executive office of the president but the fundamental idea and i used i was in business before i got into politics when i was doing contracting i wanted one throat to choke and that's what we're really talking about here one person that is responsible can be held accountable and i feel this is actually a favor to the president to have somebody in that office that he or she can hold responsible for and will be accountable for all the various complex operations of the federal government with regard to cyber

miss Taverner welcome and we've appreciated the discussions with you as you know I feel very strongly that it is time for the government to finally mobilize and take care of the millions and millions of seniors who could be taken care of at home and we haven't been able to reach them with good quality care largely because over the years and just studied and studied and studied it goes back to the days I was telling my friend senator Rockefeller has director the gray Panthers we were circulating petitions for Senator Rockefellers efforts then to get more care for seniors at home now we finally got with chairman Baucus support the independence at home model into the Affordable Care Act and in effect it's giving us a chance to really move like the VA has in order to get people better care where they want it and also to save substantial sums of money my understanding is that you all are beginning something called the rapid cycle evaluation group that's kind of a mouthful but I gather it is a fast way to really determine how to look at these care models like independence at home and when they do show that you can get better quality at less cost they can be accelerated and serve to address the needs of more seniors would you support including the independence and home program in this rapid cycle evaluation group I hope I'm using the right term is a great term and yes of course the independence at home has been a great project and I to support more care in the home in the proper setting and so yes we will use the same type of evaluation and we should know something very good the other question I I had deals with chronic care as you know independence at home is for the very sickest individuals people who so often you know her home bound but there are millions of other seniors who essentially need chronic care they may not face the same kind of challenges in terms being homebound but they're walking around for example with you know high blood pressure diabetes a host of problems and it seems to me that not enough has been done to address the needs of the chronic care population of course this is about seventy percent of the Medicare dollar so when we find better ways to take care of the chronic care population with better quality and lower costs to a great extent we fix Medicare we have a lot of debate about raising the age and all kinds of things here's a way to help people get better quality care at lower costs have you all looked at trying to come up with a kind of health home option for States and Medicaid programs for the chronically ill beneficiary because it seems to me that this would be another way using really existing authority we could step up our attack in terms of improving care for this population to Senator Rockefeller started years and years ago yes sir we have we actually have some Medicaid health home models that have started they are small in number but they are starting to catch on and we work with States to make that happen obviously in Medicare some of the work we're doing in the innovation center is around the medical health home the time for the vote is it is is about to expire would you look at extending this model we're talking about for Medicaid to Medicare yes or no yes I would look at very good thank you i'm looking forward to supporting you appreciate your help in the office of Senator Rockefeller thank you for the extra time

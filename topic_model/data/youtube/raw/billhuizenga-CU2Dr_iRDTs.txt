all from social network network privacy to gas prices there are a lot of big issues going on in Washington right now that's right joining us with more this morning as congressman bill heisting a feel-good see again hey good morning guys can are you doing you we're doing just fine summers get in here and it'll be good to have the kids out of school those kinds of things absolutely well you are obviously always busy in Washington but you have some some key pieces of legislation that you guys have been working on I want to get your opinion on the social networking bill right now about why and I think that is very interesting obviously when we're in Washington trying to deal with how the states are responding to all these things it's a it's a big deal I mean we tried it we try to talk to our own kids me on my oldest is in eighth grade for 14 and we try talking to you know there is there is a an electronic you know trail of breadcrumbs at we go and everything that we do and it seems to me it's a bit of an overstep when you've got an HR person asking for passwords and those kinds of things but I mean people have to be careful what what they're doing and what they're putting out there and we have to make sure that you know one the government's not collecting things that it shouldn't be collecting and then keeping an eye as well on what what businesses are doing with that I think it's really interesting in this day and age because 10 15 years ago we wouldn't be talking about any of these privacy issues no you're absolutely right i mean it's completely different and you know everybody's walking around with one or two cameras on them depending on how many cell phones they carry and whether they've got an ipad and all those other things and you know frankly mike and i probably wouldn't be in the positions we're in right now we know that you're good Sarah we're good but coming out there but it is it is completely changed the complexion of people's interactions and last night that was at the Grand Rapids econ Club dinner and there I am live tweeting about what Tony Blair's having to say and those kinds of things and people are taking photos and and you know it just it's completely changed the complexion hell we're probably doing photos right now that will end up you know on Facebook and Twitter and those kinds of things just with what we're doing now so that you know the speed with which everything has is dealing with as we're dealing with it has just changed so much speaking of some things that people are dealing with I mean these gas prices they've been it's been such a roller coaster you know and people have been predicting we're going to reach five dollars we reach four dollars you know what is it going to be and there's some legislation going on right now that's later on in June that you're going to be talking about yeah I think that's actually a state specifically the the bill is a state issue that that that is looking at how to round out those cliffs that happen over specially over holidays and Thursdays for example and there are some things that we can do at the federal level as well to help and it's frustrating to me that we're not doing that and I just Saturday I filled up my my yukon and there was a hundred bucks now and it is it definitely impacts a family and impacts all of us as consumers so we're hoping to see that that there's going to be some things at the state level and the federal level that that try to deal with that okay we had a question from one of our viewers that what they wanted to ask you this JC freedom fighter clarity bill is that right asked what is your thought on House Bill 5580 safe access is a must don't you agree of course talking about the bill regulating medical marijuana provisioning centers do your thoughts on yeah and I believe that one is also a specifically a state a state bill that they have gone through but you know it's interesting I've talked to a number of those HR people that we were talking about as well and what was more interesting to me was talking to school principals and school superintendents and the number of students and frankly their parents that are coming in arguing for these kids needing to have their medical marijuana card and those kinds of things you know I didn't realize glaucoma was so prevalent in high school these days you know I mean there's there's how do you separate I guess is that is the real challenge how do you separate those that need it or need to have something like it to them and those that are looking for frankly more of a lifestyle element and that seems reasonable to me if we are having medical doctors physically examined somebody as opposed to doing it over a video link or maybe not even seeing them having some sort of regulation on the access to it and I know people are very passionate about it I hear about it from them they they believe it's something that they ought to have free unfettered access to eye but we have state laws and federal laws in conflict all the time on this and talking the state's attorneys general you know whether it's bill shootie here in michigan or others we hear about this all the time are there law enforcement basically just throws its hands up and says so what am I supposed to follow you know the federal laws the state laws you know is there is there a threshold here that that we ought to be looking at and I think we've got a responsibility to give some clarity on them all right well I think we are out of time it's always good to see you buddy to see you guys can sit out here for another couple hours if you want the news all right happy to do that and I remember as a kid going through the cotton it's going to be sad to see it go but I understand why I asked you so I'm congressman Hines to get thanks for coming in this morning with some time with us we appreciate

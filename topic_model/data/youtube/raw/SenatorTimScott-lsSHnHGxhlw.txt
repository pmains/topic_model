thank you mr chairman thank you to the ranking member grassley as well for holding such an important hearing on a topic that is obviously growing in importance around this country right now certainly with a backdrop of increasing hate crimes around this country it is important to note that we have finally after 200 times tried and they failed this congress in a bipartisan fashion frankly in a non-partisan fashion just putting americans beyond politics passed the anti-lynching legislation that this senate has passed three times in the last three years it is good to see that it is on the way to the president's desk and it sends a positive powerful signal to those who have been the victim of lynching the importance of what's happening today and to their families as well and so with that i'd like to just note that as we think through the challenges that we're seeing on campuses around this country specifically speaking of hbcus we have to note in fact that you think about the professional class of african americans who are college graduates whether you're talking about teachers doctors lawyers general officers in our military half nearly half of those individuals found their start at an hbcu and so when you're talking about populating america with some of the brightest most talented gifted individuals who are willing to put their lives on the line who are willing to serve this nation hbcus is the foundation for so much of that success and so with that and also note that when you think about that success eight hbcus find them find their home in south carolina and so this is an issue that is incredibly important and frankly as i think about the impact that hbcus are having as far as creating and very professional class of african americans who are changing this country in a very positive way i think about places like kentucky state university hbcu with 40 of its student population are not black and so the diversity on college campuses that are hbcus have never been more diverse than they are right now but over the past few months my heart has been heavy mr chairman has been broken by the number of calls on hbcu campuses bomb threats stopping in their tracks the students on campuses alarming the law enforcement agencies in their areas causing confusion and once again a loss of learning on those campuses one of those campuses is claflin university in the great state of south carolina a victim of such threats students were going about their everyday business trying to get classes trying to do what students do on campuses every day being told to shelter in place find safe haven when you're just trying to learn it's a devastating event that can easily scar you emotionally as well as we've learned with this pandemic these kinds of unnecessary and unwanted disruptions within the campus community and the spirit of fear within our education systems can be detrimental to the long-term health and viability of our students education played a key role in my life and i know that it does in so many lives in this body and around this country and it's important for us to protect that that place that sacred place of education in our country in addition to the campus disruptions these kinds of threats also draw down a significant amount of resources from our law enforcement agencies that are already struggling ranking member grassley talked about the challenges of meeting the demands and i am thankful that president biden spoke about the importance of providing our law enforcement agencies with more funding because the challenges that they face are extreme it shouldn't be this way schools should not be a place of fear they should be a place where dreams come true our nation has fought and fought and fought and continues to fight against dark elements within our society and we will continue to do so last week i was pleased to see the senate unanimously passed bipartisan resolution condemning these evil threats of violence against hbcus we need the doj and the fbi to continue to provide oversight and to provide investigations it's also sad to see that more than half of the hate crimes against people of religious background happen to our jewish members of this society we can do better we should do better it's one of the reasons why i supported and sponsored legislation around anti-semitism on college campuses as well i believe it is our responsibility as an american family to the address the issues that challenge us because a threat to one is indeed a threat to all

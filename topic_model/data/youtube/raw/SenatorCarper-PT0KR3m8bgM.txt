Thank You mr. president president the terrorists attacks we have seen over the last couple of months including those tragically in Paris and in San Bernardino California have made it all too clear that terrorist threats to Americans and to our allies are very real I believe the best way to combat the the threat of Isis across our globe is to continue to degrade and destroy their forces overseas and show the world that they're not as powerful as they claim to be our success will not only rob them of their safe haven will also undercut their recruitment a narrative that Isis is on the rise but in addition to destroying Isis overseas we must also focus on defeating threat of Isis here at home now I realize that many Americans mr. president many of our colleagues are concerned about terrorists traveling to our borders as refugees from Syria or maybe some other country as many of my colleagues may recall late last year we debated a question regarding the resettlement of four million Syrian refugees and whether we in this country should open our doors to even a small fraction of them the debate it actually right here on the Senate floor and some of you recall we debated at our committees and including the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee where I serve as the senior Democrat and during that debate I was reminded of the words of Pope Francis historic and moving address just at the other end of this building to the capital over the house chamber when he has said in a joint session address to Congress last year last fall he said the reason why should remind us all of the Golden Rule fact I think was more applause when when he did that to treat other people the way we want to be treated to love our neighbors as ourselves and he also invoked some of you may recall Matthew 25 deals with the the least of these when I was hungry did you feed me when I was negativity of clothing or thirsty to give me to drink when I was a stranger in your land did you take me in I think we have a moral imperative to provide for the least of these but at the same time we have a moral imperative to protect Americans from extremists who may seek to come to the United States to cause us harm as we learn to to address this tension our naval has neighbor a nation has rigorous screening procedures in place for all refugees as well as enhanced screening for Refugees might be coming here from Syria it's a process that takes an average of two years to complete I guess I might say just for those who aren't familiar process people in this case four million refugees the left of fighting in Syria to try to get away to save their lives they are at the end up in refugee camps that part of the world and the United Nations has a special mission which includes to vet them to get to know them to talk with him and to see if they would like to stay in refugee camp or try to get settled into some other other country inviting the four million refugees a small fraction of those are folks who had indicated that they would be interested in maybe we settling in this country and at the end of the day after wintering down from 4 million refugees I believe that the UN sent us I think seven thousand names and out of the seven thousand we selected 2000 mostly kids mostly young families mostly old people not very many men of fighting age if if you will but the president is called for increasing that 2002 something like 10,000 over the next year the course of this so this year think about that out of four million what percentage of four million is 10,000 people if we took them all if you took all 10,000 and it's one quarter of one percent that's what it is a one quarter of one percent and there are obviously concerns about whether interest people are dangerous pose a danger to us women a danger to our people I would have just have us keep in mind in two thousand have come and of course the last year not one has been arrested nah one who's been convicted of terrorist activity plotting or trying terrorist activity and one of the reasons why that happens is if if I were a nicest person and I were in Syria and I want to get over here I sure wouldn't spend two years trying to come through with refugees that's the most stringent vetting of any group of people who want to come to this country they have to go undergo biometric checks they are interviewed by people who are trained not just by the UN but also by us I'll receive they are vetted by people interviewed by people who are trained to to detect the deception we have the ability to check these people against any number of databases which relate to potential terrorist activity so if i were a nicest person wanted to embed myself with a keris group i'm not gonna wait two years to do that and face the most rigorous vetting process of anyone trying to come to this country for those of a Syrian descent the trial process could be even longer than that and they it's a long time to wait for terrorists if they are going to try to use the refugee program to access the US the viral chairs trying to to come here last thing I do is go through those two years of vetting and while I understand my colleagues concern the refugee bill that we dealt with today we're do little to address our nation's security needs and that's why many of my colleagues join me and opposing this bill the bill that was before us would require the head of top national security agencies to personally certify the personally certified that each refugee from Syria in Iraq poses no security threat before admission to the United States not now not ever if this bill had passed it would have served as a backdoor way to shut off the refugee program by requiring our national security leaders out of the FBI Director of National Intelligence Secretary of Homeland Security to promise something they would never promise as currently drafted this bill would require these three national security leaders to guarantee that the refugee will never never become a security threat that is not how these leaders or their organizations evaluate security threats they don't have a crystal ball and they cannot predict the future simply put the SAFE Act would effectively stop the resettlement of fully vetted refugee women children families older folks from Syrian from Iraq and weaken our national security again that's one of the reasons why I believe one must focus our attention on threats that pose a greater risk to our homeland Democrats put forward a series of common-sense solutions alternatives if you will that would strengthen our security and help protect us against Isis a couple of which I had the pleasure co-authoring instead of vilifying refugees the proposals that we put forward impose tough new sanctions on financial institutions if they knowingly facilitate financial transactions with Isis that particular proposal closes loopholes that would let Terrace legally buy guns this bill improves intelligence sharing with our allies who join us in the fight against Isis the bill also includes several provisions to better protect the homeland for example the bill like our proposal strengthens the security of our airports the bill provides better training for law enforcement to respond to active shooter incidents the legislation also makes several improvements to the security of low-level radiological materials so that potentially dangerous material does not fall in the hands of terrorists who might use it to create a dirty bomb one particular area that I want to focus on though is countering violent extremism as a tragedy in San Bernardino California underscores one of the greatest threats that we face is homegrown terrorism and self radical radicalization and that's why the Democratic alternative includes language from the legislation that I introduced that would strengthen the Department of Homeland Security's ability to counter violent extremism here in the United States this proposal authorizes a new office charged with helping communities across the country Muslim communities across the country stop there young people from being recruited by Isis the legislative proposal would also create a grant program that would help the Department of Homeland Security to work with nonprofits with local officials with religious leaders and youth groups to work together to counter the narratives offered by terrorist groups like Lake Isis mr. chair if you if you look in in the recent years that the folks in this country that are inspired by Isis to commit terrorist activities against those of us in this country I you won't find them having come over and embedded to my knowledge with any refugee organization or any refugee group the biggest threat to us is not that it's not people necessarily coming through on the V in the visa waiver program or student waiver programs or student visa programs or tourist visa programs but the biggest threat to our security here is folks that in many cases were born here or in some cases folks who came from they could have come from Syria could have come from Iraq or some other place but they came here and became radicalized after coming here maybe after becoming a citizen here those are the threats that I think are other great pose a greater sager be calm lone wolf and one of the best ways to it to address those folks is to see if there's look around at our history and maybe of other countries what's going another country and see is there some way to reach out to those people who are actually in danger becoming radicalized you're becoming a lone woman somebody could reach out to them and reduce the likelihood that they're going to be radicalized and take out their frustration their anger on people in this country in harmful ways when I was governor of delaware my last year's governor telework i was involved in standing up a foundation was called the American Legacy Foundation funded by tobacco settlement with between the tobacco industry in all 50 states and the idea behind the American Legacy Foundation was to use this billion dollars that was provided to the American Legacy Foundation to develop ways to message communicate were young people in this country who either were smoking or were thinking about becoming smokers and some of us remember as our youth the idea of smoking when I was kid going up with was actually something was thought to be a desirable thing we're not aware early on about the health consequences to it and so you see on television and you're in all kinds of advertisements and commercials people smoking and say oh that would be a cool thing to to do while the American Legacy Foundation comes along in 2001 and develops a counter message to all that and we called it the truth campaign the truth campaign and the the truth campaign is a multimedia campaign include radio and TV commercials it included the internet and included the magazines that sort of thing that young people read are the young people listened to and it wasn't the the narrative and the ease of messaging the messaging communications were not developed by the boardrooms like me they were not developed by the paid staff of the American Legacy Foundation they were developed by young people that I could have been 11 or 12 or 13 or 14 15 16 17 18 years old who developed a narrative and said this is a message you need to send out through all these different medium to try to convince them not to smoke or if they already smoking to quit and that's what we did and it's amazing if you look at the incidence of smoking among people that are like preteens and teenagers in the country what it was in 2001 and what it was by the end of the last decade it's amazing how well it worked amazing how logged work it's called the truth campaign hard-hitting the messaging the messages develop I really are talking off target audience there's a saying on our into business we'll ask your ask your customer talk to your customer what what do you what do they want and and in this case we talked to our customers a lot of people about the age of our pages they're sitting here to today I the department homeland security has stood up was attempting to stand up a an obviously called the Office of Community Partnership and it's an office that would work with the Muslim community across the country with families with the religious leaders with other young people in order to try to make sure that the young people did not become radicalized and undertake activities that are go home other folks in this country I think it's a very promising initiative a very promising initiative and we're putting in touch the other folks at the department homeland security who are leading this effort this partnership office and with the American Legacy Foundation to see what work what worked and really change in a game with respect to young people smoking this country using tobacco in this country and houses he if there's some lessons that might be available to us for trying to deter the likelihood that people will with Muslim faith will somehow be convinced that that their faith the directs them to undertake these violent activities I'm encouraged by this prospect last thing I'll say is we've got about a one-half million people one half million beat actually would have billion people around the world who are Muslim Muslims and they believe I'm Protestant and have people in here in a different face in this body Protestants Catholics choose others the among the things we have in common as well as with the Muslim filosa Muslim faith is something I mentioned earlier it's a golden rule almost every major religion on earth almost every major religion on earth has several things in common but one of the things they have in common is the golden rule love our neighbor as ourselves to treat other people the way we want to be treated I don't care if you're Protestant Catholic Jew Buddhist Hindu Muslim but somewhere in your sacred scriptures is that idea that notion that directive and there are some people who take my faith christian faith and they just turned it on his head to say and to do things that we never do we should never do we take the Bible oh that's from the New Testament and instead of like embracing Matthew 25 the least of these when I was a stranger in your land did you take me in basically say we're not the letting people in this country of also the Muslim faith that's not a Christian thing to say or do and people take our my religion my faith and they turn in something is not even close to being and not surprisingly some people who do that with the Muslim faith and we need to counter that and help a lot of people the majority the vast majority of folks for Muslim in this country to help them better counter that in ways that frankly I could never do but in which people in Muslim community that faith across the country would like to do and what to do and we need be a good partner to help them to be successful in that effort doing bad Frank is a whole lot better a whole lot better alternative then the legislation that was before us to today and that's one thing we ought to be able to agree on and I hope my colleagues Democrat and Republican and independent will find find a path to to joining me and others who think this is a good idea and enjoying some may can happen

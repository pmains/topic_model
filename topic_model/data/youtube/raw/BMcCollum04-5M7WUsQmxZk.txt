mr speaker today i rise in support of the affordable care act a law that has made a real difference in minnesotans and americans after seven years of attacking the aca republicans still have not come up with a plan to replace this law instead they plan to work with president-elect donald trump to repeal the law and destroy the progress we've made repealing the aca would leave tens of millions of americans uninsured repealing the aca would let insurance companies deny coverage to more than 2 million minnesotans with pre-existing conditions and repealing the aca would eliminate free high quality preventative health care for hundreds of thousands of families in my district make no mistake republicans aca repeal plans would turn back the clock leaving millions of americans just one illness away from bankruptcy for the sake of minnesotans and all americans who have benefited from this law join me in fighting to save the affordable care act

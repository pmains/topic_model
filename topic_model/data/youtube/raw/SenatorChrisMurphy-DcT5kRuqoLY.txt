thank you very much chairman good to see you again I've a sore solvent thank you very much for your service to the country you masked I think a version of this question in a couple different ways but let me ask it specific to the events that we now know took place over the course of the summer and fall we've learned now with some certainty as you've testified that employees of the State Department people under your supervision specifically Kurt Volker Gordon Salman and Bill Taylor were pressing the Ukrainian government to open specific investigations into topics connected to the Biden family and alternative theories about who interfered in the 2016 elections knowing what you know now about what was happening and those specific requests that were being made do you think the actions of those individuals were proper what they were doing back then was it proper I don't I'd have to think about that I don't think that as I've testified previously if the the concept of investigating a political rival as opposed to encouraging any corruption reform which is illegitimate I think inconsistent with our values that that would be inconsistent with our values and so in this case they were specifically requesting investigations connected to a political rival of the President of the United States and so your testimony is that that those requests were improper to the extent that they were made I'm going to have to assume that that what I read in the pain I'm not present at the depositions but what has been reported in the press I've said as a as a general matter in response to one of the first questions from Senator Menendez that investigation of a political asking a foreign government to investigate a domestic political rival as opposed to as part an in a larger any corruption campaign which we'd been engaged in encouraging the Ukrainians for years those are two different things and do you have any reason to believe that that the reports in the press and the testimony of ambassador Taylor are wrong I don't I don't also don't know that they're accurate I I just I don't know one way I will accept for purposes that hypothetically if they are I'll answer the question that I just don't know personally these as I mentioned we're individuals acting under the auspices of the State Department and so I think it's important for the committee to understand where their authority came from we talked a little bit about this in our private meeting did you order volker Sandlin and taylor to coordinate with rudy giuliani and pressing the Ukrainians for these investigations into burries mo or the origins of the 2016 interference I did not did secretary Pompeo order these individuals to request these investigations not to my knowledge did John Bolton order these individuals to coordinate with Giuliani and pressing for these investigations I don't have a basis to answer I don't believe so but I I don't know that he did I have no reason to think that he did I just I don't I don't have a factual basis to provide a definitive answer but clearly if these are people under your supervision you didn't ask them to undertake these activities I would imagine you would want to get to the bottom of that and so what is your understanding as to where their instructions were coming from if they weren't coming from you or the Secretary of State well they're getting their instructions ambassador our chargee ambassador Taylor in Kiev is getting instructions from the secretary from me and for our undersecretary for right but in this case you testified that neither you nor the secretary asked them to request these specific investigations and so where did those instructions come I don't know and did you have you met any of them to find out since I learned of it in September I have not I think that's curious if people under a ting outside of your specific instructions I think it's curious that you would not try to find out let me just ask a few more quick questions is it currently the policy of the United States that Ukraine must conduct investigation in tuber yzma and CrowdStrike no why not if it was this was the policy over the summer so why is it not the pie you know I had accepted as a hypothetical that was our policy I don't know that it is not our policy our policy has been to encourage any corruption reform generally in Ukraine that's something that I've worked on for over two years but never with respect to a particular investigation or company or individual he's really Giuliani currently carrying out any diplomatic business on behalf of the United States not to my knowledge so mr. Chava I have a great deal of respect for the work that you have done you've toiled under difficult circumstances and I'm frankly pleased that you're willing to take on this difficult assignment but your testimony as to your lack of of interest in asking questions about why people under your control were being given direction that did not come from you or the secretary and your lack of attempts to delve into what the policy actually was during this period of time you're accepting hypotheticals but you don't seem to have an opinion as to whether it actually was the policy of the United States which by the testimony that the house has received it clearly was to encourage these investigations I I do think is concerning but again I appreciate the service you've given the country and appreciate your testimony today

  LEADER OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES  COMMITTEE, MR. WESTERMAN. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE  GENTLEMAN FROM ARKANSAS IS  RECOGNIZED FOR FIVE MINUTES. MR. WESTERMAN: THANK YOU,  MR. SPEAKER. TODAY, I THINK ABOUT WHEN MY  FOUR CHILDREN WERE YOUNG. THEY'RE TWO YEARS APART. THEY USED TO HAVE COMPETITIONS  IN THE BACKYARD. THEY WOULD RACE FROM THE PATIO  TO THE ELM TREE AND BACK. AND I WOULD STAGGER THE STARTING TIME. LET THE YOUNGEST ONE GO FIRST. THEN THE NEXT TO THE YOUNGEST  AND SO ON. AND BY THE TIME THEY TOUCHED THE TREE AND CAME BACK IT TURNED  INTO A REAL COMPETITION. A PHOTO FINISH A LOT OF TIMES. WE'VE ALL COMPETED IN GAMES  WHOSE OUTCOME HAS LITTLE  SIGNIFICANCE IN LIFE. BUT MR. SPEAKER, WE'RE NOT  FACING AN INSIGNIFICANT  COMPETITION IN OUR FUTURE. WE ARE IN A RACE OF IDEOLOGIES. THE STAKES ARE AS HIGH AS THEY  THINK BE. -- THEY CAN BE. WE ARE IN THE STRUGGLE FOR  FUTURE WESTERN CIVILIZATION, OF  DEMOCRACY, OF REPRESENTATIVE  GOVERNMENT, OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND  FREEDOM. MR. SPEAKER, THIS ISN'T A MATTER OF COMPETING. IT'S A MUST-WIN SCENARIO. AND QUITE FRANKLY, I'M AGHAST  THAT THIS MAJORITY THINKS WE  ONLY NEED TO COMPETE. LOSING IS NOT AN OPTION. OUR ATTITUDE MUST BE TO WIN. IF WE LOSE, HUMANITY LOSES. I BELIEVE FREEDOM-LOVING  REPUBLICANS, DEMOCRATS,  INDEPENDENTS, AND PEOPLE ALL  ACROSS THE WORLD WANT AMERICA TO WIN. I'M DISAPPOINTED THAT THE  SPEAKER AND THIS MAJORITY HAVE  ONCE AGAIN DROPPED A MASSIVE  BILL THAT COULD AND SHOULD BE  BIPARTISAN BUT INSTEAD IS A  CLOAK FOR FAILED BUILD BACK  BETTER POLICIES THAT LIE DEAD IN THE SENATE. MR. SPEAKER, YOU AND I HAVE A  RENDEZVOUS FOR DESTINY. WE WILL HAVE THE LAST BEST HOPE  ON EARTH OR WE WILL SENTENCE  THEM TO TAKE THE FIRST STEP INTO A THOUSAND YEARS OF DARKNESS. IF WE FAIL, AT LEAST LET OUR  CHILDREN AND OUR CHILDREN'S  CHILDREN SAY OF US, WE WE  JUSTIFIED OUR BRIEF MOMENT HERE. WE DID ALL WE COULD BE DONE. THESE ARE WORDS FROM RONALD  REAGAN IN THE 1960'S. BUT THEY ARE NOT TRUE MORE THAN  TODAY. HOW SERIOUS ARE THE ISSUES WE  FACE? TAKE A LOOK AT THESE CHARTS FROM THE ECONOMISTS. THIS FIRST ONE IS IN 2000. THE BLUE IS THE U.S. AND ITS  TRADING PARTNERS. THE RED IS CHINA AND ITS TRADING PARTNERS. LOOK WHAT'S HAPPENED IN A SHORT  20-YEAR SPAN AS WE LOOK AT THIS  SAME MAP FROM 2022. .WE SEE A MASSIVE DECREASE OF BLUE ON THIS MAP. WHAT DO PROVISIONS OF THIS HAVE TO DO WITH CHINA? IT DOES THE OPPOSITE BY KILLING AMERICAN JOBS. RESTORING CORAL REEFS OFF THE COAST IS A COMMENDABLE GOAL BUT SPENDING $292 MILLION ON CORAL REEF RESTORATION HAVE WITH US WINNING AGAINST CHINA? THIS GIVES SUPREME UNILATERAL AUTHORITY TO THE U.S. FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE TO DETERMINE WHICH SPECIES CAN BE IMPORTED INTO THE U.S. THIS IS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO IMPLEMENT AND WILL SHUT DOWN AQUA CULTURE AND SIMILAR INDUSTRIES WHO NEED TRADE TO CONDUCT BUSINESS. THE WEAPONNIZATION OF THE LACEY ACT WILL ONLY EMPOWER BUREAUCRATS AND IGNORES THE CURRENT STATE-BASED APPROACH ON SPECIES IMPORTS. IT'S LEGISLATIVE LAZINESS AND SINCE THERE HAVE BEEN NO HEARINGS ON THIS BILL. WHAT IN THE WORLD DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH WINNING AGAINST CHINA? THE BILL REQUIRES NEW HEAVYHANDED REGULATIONS DESIGNED TO KILL AMERICAN MINERAL DEVELOPMENT. HOW CAN THIS MAJORITY PROPOSE THIS BILL FOLLOWS THE DEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATION CONTINUES TO ILLUSTRATE INCOMPETENCY BY KILLING AMERICAN ENERGY AND JOBS AND EEP PULLING MINING LEASES IN MINNESOTA? THEY CAN CREATE JOBS AND SUPPLY RESOURCES FOR THE VERY POLICIES ON ELECTRIFICATION THE ADMINISTRATION SUPPORT. THIS ONLY SHIFTS WEALTH AND JOBS TO CHINA. HOW DOES THAT HELP US WIN? IT REMINDS ME OF MY KIDS' RACES WHERE THE MAJORITY IS TRYING TO HANDICAP AMERICA AND GIVE CHINA A HEAD START. WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING TO HAVE A WINNING STRATEGY, WE SHOULD BE WORKING TOGETHER ON THIS -- ON REAL ISSUES TO ENSURE THAT AMERICA WINS. WE SHOULD BE STRENGTHENING DIPLOMACY AND TRADE WITH OUR ALLIES AND CREATE A SOLID WESTERN HEMISPHERE ALLIANCE TO ENSURE AMERICA WINS. WE SHOULD BE DEVELOPING OUR RESOURCES AND JOBS TO HELP AMERICA WIN. WE SHOULD BE PART OF THE SOLUTION AND NOT THE PROBLEM. AMERICANS AND FREEDOM WILL WIN IF WE LET THEM. AS I CLOSE, I WANT TO REMIND YOU OF A FABEL BY ESOP, THE EAGLE AND THE ARROW. THE EAGLE WAS STRUCK BY AN ARROW AND AS HE LIED ON THE GROUND HE LOOKED BACK AT IT AND HE SAID, ALAS, I HAVE BEEN WOUNDED BY AN ARROW THAT WAS FEATHERED WITH MY OWN PLUME. MR. SPEAKER, WE CANNOT AFFORD TO PUT MORE FLEUMS ON CHINA'S AR -- PLUMES ON CHINA

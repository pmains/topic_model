CIPOLLONE AT THIS POINT.  >> IT IS. HIGH STAKES TESTIMONY FOR SURE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >>> ALL RIGHT, LET'S BRING IN  REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN ADAM  KINZINGER OF ILLINOIS. HE SERVES ON THE JANUARY 6th  COMMITTEE. HE'S ALSO ON THE HOUSE FOREIGN  AFFAIRS COMMITTEE. SIR, THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US THIS MORNING. WHAT IS THIS SIGNALING TO YOU  THAT CIPOLLONE HAS BEEN  SUBPOENAED? WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU ABOUT  WHERE DOJ IS GOING HERE? >> WELL, I DON'T -- AGAIN, I  DON'T KNOW THIS -- YOU GUYS  REPORTED IT, I'M SURE IT'S TRUE. I HAVEN'T HEARD THIS FROM THE  COMMITTEE'S PERSPECTIVE JUST  GENERALLY I'LL SAY THIS IS  PROBABLY BAD FOR PRESIDENT --  FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP. THIS IS -- IF HE GOES IN FRONT  OF THE GRAND JURY, IT SHOWS THAT THIS IS MORE THAN, YOU KNOW,  WHAT DID JOHN EASTMAN DO, THE  ATTORNEY THAT BASICALLY CAME UP  WITH THAT CRAZY SCHEME TO  OVERTURN THE ELECTION, AND IT  PROBABLY IS A VERY DEEP INTEREST ON WHAT THE PRESIDENT DID. I THINK IN TERMS OF THEIR  NEGOTIATIONS, OBVIOUSLY THE  JUSTICE DEPARTMENT KNOWS BETTER  WHAT THEY CAN IN ESSENCE GET  AROUND WHEN IT COMES TO SAYING  EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE. AND SO I HOPE THEY, YOU KNOW, GO AT THAT JUDICIOUSLY. I HOPE PAT CIPOLLONE ACTUALLY  JUST TELLS THE TRUTH. I HAVE NO DOUBT HE HASN'T. BUT THERE IS NO REASON TO  PROTECT PARTICULARLY CRIMINAL  BEHAVIOR, WHAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR BEHIND  EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE. SO WE'LL SEE WHERE IT GOES. BUT THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THIS  INVESTIGATION HAS DEVELOPED  FURTHER ALONG THAN WHERE WE KNEW IT WAS OR THOUGHT IT WAS A FEW  MONTHS AGO.  >> IS CIPOLLONE AN AREA WHERE  THE COMMITTEE AND DOJ ARE  COOPERATING? >> I'M NOT GOING TO GET INTO  THAT. YOU KNOW, WE HAVE SHARED 20  TRANSCRIPTS OF DOJ. WE HAVE AN OPEN CONVERSATION  WITH THEM, BUT I'M NOT GOING TO  GET INTO THE DETAILS OF ANY OF  THAT.  >> CNN IS REPORTING THE PENTAGON WIPED THE PHONES OF TOP  DEPARTING OFFICIALS AT THE END  OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. THEY DELETED ANY TEXTS FROM KEY  WITNESSES. THIS IS AN INITIAL COURT FILING, OF COURSE, THAT WAS IN MARCH,  THAT WAS ASKING FOR THIS  INFORMATION. WHY DIDN'T THE COMMITTEE KNOW  ABOUT THIS BEFORE? >> SEE, I DON'T KNOW. I THINK I'M ALMOST MORE  INTERESTED IN WHY WE DIDN'T KNOW THAN EVEN WHY THESE MESSAGES  WERE DELETED, THOUGH, OF COURSE, WE'RE QUITE INTERESTED IN THAT. YOU KNOW, WE MADE IT CLEAR WHAT  WE WERE INTERESTED IN READING,  PARTICULARLY WITH THE SECRET  SERVICE. WE KNEW THAT THERE WERE TEXTS WE NEEDED TO SEE. AND, YOU KNOW, WE FIND OUT THE  INSPECTOR GENERAL KNEW MONTHS  PRIOR TO EVEN WHEN HE TOLD US HE KNEW ABOUT MISSING TEXTS. SO I DON'T NECESSARILY KNOW IF  THIS IS SOME MASSIVE COVER-UP. IT CERTAINLY STINKS TO HIGH  HEAVEN, BUT IN THE WORST CASE IT ISURE TO FOLLOW  THROUGH ON RECORDS KEEPING. THAT IN ITSELF IS AN ACT THAT  NEEDS FOLLOWED THROUGH ON. LOOK, WE HAVE THE -- ONE OF THE  MOST INTENSE DAYS FOR THE U.S.  MILITARY AND PARTICULARLY FOR  THE SECRET SERVICE SINCE 9/11. THE IDEA THAT YOU WOULD GO  THROUGH THEN A TECHNOLOGY  MITIGATION OR MIGRATION AND BE,  LIKE, YEAH, I DON'T CARE IF YOU  DELETE ALL YOUR TEXTS FROM THE  TWO MOST -- ONE OF THE MOST  IMPORTANT DAYS AS FAR AS THE  SECRET SERVICE IS CONCERNED, IT  DOESN'T REALLY MAKE A LOT OF  SENSE TO ME.  >> WHERE ARE YOU GUYS ON WORKING TO TRY TO RECOVER SOME OF THAT,  WORKING WITH FORENSIC, YOU KNOW, TECHNICIANS WHO MIGHT HAVE SOME  INSIGHT INTO THIS? HAVE YOU MADE ANY HEADWAY THERE? >> WELL, WE'RE CERTAINLY TRYING, BUT, I MEAN, I THINK -- I THINK  IT IS -- NOT THAT WE'RE GOING TO LET UP, BUT I'M NOT SURE TO WHAT EXTENT WE CAN GET THIS STUFF  BACK. I KNOW WE'RE ASKING THE  QUESTIONS AND TRYING TO FIGURE  THAT OUT AS MANY ARE, BUT IT IS  POSSIBLE IT IS JUST GONE. AND, YOU KNOW, IF SOMEBODY  INTENDS TO MAKE SOMETHING GO  AWAY, IT CAN GO AWAY. >> YOU'RE NOT HOPEFUL. YOU'RE NOT HOPEFUL YOU'RE GOING  TO GET ANY OF THIS. >> WELL, I DON'T KNOW. I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT TO BE  HOPEFUL WITH THIS OR NOT. HERE IS WHAT I AM HOPEFUL FOR AT LEAST, SOMEBODY COMES FORWARD  AND TELLS US WHAT THEY KNOW. IF THERE IS SOMEBODY KNOWS FOR  INSTANCE THESE WERE  INTENTIONALLY ERASED, THAT'S  YOUR DUTY AS AN AMERICAN TO COME FORWARD AND SAY SOMETHING. IF YOU KNOW, LET'S BE HONEST, IF YOU KNOW IT WAS JUST AN  ACCIDENT, THEN WE NEED TO KNOW  THAT TOO. THAT'S OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING THAT  SEEMS KIND OF FISHY, BUT IT'S  POSSIBLE. LET'S BE HONEST. I'M A LITTLE MORE CONFIDENT THAT SOMEBODY WILL COME FORWARD AND  TELL US SOMETHING THAT WE DON'T  KNOW WITH THAT, THAN I AM THAT  WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO  RECOVER IT. BUT WE'RE CERTAINLY TRYING. >> I KNOW YOU'RE CLOSELY  WATCHING THESE PRIMARY ELECTIONS AS WE ALL WERE LAST NIGHT. YOU CALLED IT DISGUSTING. HERE ON THIS PROGRAM, THAT  DEMOCRATS WERE HELPING ELEVATE  ELECTION DENIERS IN THE HOPES  THAT THEY WOULD BE EASIER TO  DEFEAT IN A GENERAL AGAINST A  MORE MODERATE REPUBLICAN. ONE OF THE MODERATES IN THE RACE IS PETER MEIJER WHO LOST HIS  PRIMARY. WHAT IS YOUR REACTION? >> YEAH, I MEAN, IT'S -- YOU  KNOW, IF PETER'S OPPONENT WINS  AND GOES ON TO NOVEMBER AND  WINS, THE DEMOCRATS OWN THAT. CONGRATULATIONS. HERE IS THE THING. DON'T KEEP COMING TO ME ASKING  WHERE ARE ALL THE GOOD  REPUBLICANS THAT DEFEND  DEMOCRACY AND THEN TAKE YOUR  DONOR'S MONEY AND SPEND HALF A  MILLION DOLLARS PROMOTING ONE OF THE WORST ELECTION DENIERS THAT  IS OUT THERE. THE DCCC NEEDS TO BE ASHAMED OF  THEMSELVES. SOME MEMBERS OF CONGRESS,  DEMOCRATS HAVE SPOKEN OUT AND  SAID THEY'RE DISGUSTED. I RESPECT IT. I HAVE SPOKEN OUT AGAINST THE  NATIONAL REPUBLICAN  CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE MANY  TIMES WHEN THEY HAVE DONE THINGS I'VE DISAGREED WITH AND THERE  ARE ALSO PEOPLE WHO SAY THIS IS  JUST POLITICS, HOW CYNICAL THAT  IS, AND THAT'S WHY THE AMERICANS ARE JUST SICK OF BOTH PARTIES TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.  >> I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE  SPEAKER'S TRIP TO TAIWAN. YOU'RE SEEING CHINA RESPOND. WHAT DO YOU THINK? >> LOOK, I GOT TO SAY, THAT WAS  COURAGEOUS OF THE SPEAKER TO DO. SHE DESERVES CREDIT. I WAS CONCERNED THAT, YOU KNOW,  AFTER THIS KIND OF PRESSURE  MOUNTED THAT SHE WOULD BACK OFF  AND SHE WENT THROUGH AND SHE IS  TOUGH IN DOING THAT. AND SHE HAD TO DO IT. LOOK, CHINA IS GOING TO TRY TO  LOOK TOUGH. I DON'T THINK THEY WANT TO  ESCALATE. I THINK MR. XI IS RUNNING AGAIN  AND HE WANTS TO BASICALLY SEND A MESSAGE TO THE COMMUNIST PARTY. BUT, LOOK, THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR US AS A COUNTRY TO RECOGNIZE. STRENGTH, WHEN YOU DO SOMETHING  OUT OF STRENGTH, IT ACTUALLY  MAKES CONFLICT LESS LIKELY. AND BY NANCY PELOSI FOLLOWING  THROUGH AND GOING TO TAIWAN, SHE SENT A MESSAGE WE WILL NOT BE  INTIMIDATED. I WISH, FRANKLY, THE  ADMINISTRATION HAD SENT THAT  MESSAGE INSTEAD OF SAYING WE  DON'T WANT HER TO GO. BUT THAT SAID, SHE DID AND IT  WAS, I THINK, A GOOD MOMENT FOR  THE UNITED STATES. >> AFTER THIS VISIT, AS YOU SAY, A GOOD MOMENT FOR THE UNITED  STATES IN YOUR OPINION, CLOSER  TO ANY SORT OF CONFRONTATION  WITH CHINA? DO YOU THINK THE U.S. IS CLOSER? >> I THINK WE'RE CLOSER EVERY  DAY. I DON'T THINK IT IS NECESSARILY  RELATED TO THIS. IT IS RELATED TO CHINA'S DESIRE  TO TAKE TAIWAN. IT IS LIKE RUSSIA AND UKRAINE. AND SO, YEAH, I THINK EVERY DAY  WE'RE CLOSER. I THINK FRANKLY CONFLICT IS VERY LIKELY. NOT NECESSARILY IN THE NEAR  FUTURE, BUT AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE. THIS IS WHY STANDING UP WITH  STRENGTH AND MAKING IT CLEAR  THAT WE WILL DEFEND OUR FRIENDS  IS IMPORTANT TO MITIGATE THAT  POSSIBILITY.  >> HOW ARE YOU SEEING THE U.S.  YESTERDAY TAKING OUT THE LEADER  OF AL QAEDA IN KABUL? OBVIOUSLY A VERY SUCCESSFUL  OPERATION, AND YET THERE HE WAS  IN KABUL, CERTAINLY SENDS A  MESSAGE TO AL QAEDA THEY'RE NOT  SAFE IN KABUL, BUT WHAT IS THE  TAKEAWAY FOR YOU ABOUT THE  SAFETY OF THE U.S.? >> I THINK THE TAKEAWAY IS WE'RE A LITTLE SAFER WITH ZAWAHIRI  DEAD. I ALSO WANT TO SAY TO ANY OF THE PEOPLE I HEARD IN MY PARTY THAT  ARE, LIKE, SOMEHOW SAYING THAT  THIS ISN'T A BIG DEAL, JUST SHUT UP AND BE AN AMERICAN FOR ONE  DAY. YOU KNOW, THIS IS A GOOD DEAL. NOW, WHAT IS THE BAD OF THIS? CERTAINLY THE TALIBAN OR  ELEMENTS OF THE TALIBAN  COMPLETELY UNSURPRISINGLY TO ME  AND I GUESS COMPLETELY  UNSURPRISINGLY TO THE  ADMINISTRATION, I HEARD AN  ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL SAY  YESTERDAY, OH, YEAH, WE KNEW  THAT THERE WAS GOING TO BE A  RELATIONSHIP, BUT OBVIOUSLY THE  TALIBAN AND AL QAEDA ARE BACK IN BED. WE SHOULDN'T BE SURPRISED AT  THAT. WE HAVE REALLY BEEN HAMPERED IN  OUR ABILITY TO FIGHT TERRORISM. WE CAN DO VERY GOOD TACTICAL  THINGS LIKE KILL A MAN, IF WE  KNOW WHERE HE IS. BUT THE STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS  OF WHAT WE CAN DO IN  COUNTERTERRORISM, BUILDING  ALLIANCES, DENYING AREA TO AN  ENEMY, KNOWING WHAT THEIR PLANS  ARE, THAT HAS BEEN MASSIVELY  HAMPERED. LET'S CELEBRATE THIS WIN. I'M GLAD HE'S DEAD. BUT LET'S GO INTO THIS EYES WIDE OPEN. YOU GOT TO STAY ON THE OFFENSE  OF THE BIGGEST TERRORISTS. THEY HAVE NOT CHANGED THEIR  OPINION. THEY HAVEN'T CHANGED THEIR MIND. THEY STILL WANT TO DO WHAT THEY  DID ON 9/11.

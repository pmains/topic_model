joining me right now to assess the global threats is florida congressman and former green beret combat veteran michael waltz congressman it's great to see you thanks very much for being here yeah thanks maria i want to talk about the chess board globally in terms of these lines being drawn but first give us your assessment of president biden's trip to the middle east you know i'd give it mixed maria i'm glad he went to stand with our greatest ally in israel that the squad and other progressives call an apartheid state so at least he took a stand of progressives there but i was disappointed uh you know he reverts right back to this giveaway of billions of dollars to the iranian regime you know in the hopes that they won't pursue a nuclear weapon look maria no one wants any type of military action uh against iran but we have to make it clear to the iranians it's on the table the israelis made that clear during the trip but biden fell back to the billion dollar giveaway here and only if iran believes that that program could get taken out do i think at this point as they race towards a nuke which will set off an arms race in the middle east uh a nuclear arms race in the middle east uh will iran back down and the biggest way that we could do that is say it make it clear on the international stage from the commander in chief and give the israelis the technical military equipment that they've been asking for and this administration's been holding back on well i don't know whose idea the fist bump was but it's getting panned across the country the president found it amusing when asked about it listen to this on friday watch mr president yes you're coming under a lot of fire for your fist bump with the crown prince i just want to give you a chance to respond to that but also how can you be sure that another incident another murder like jamal khashoggi won't happen again well god love you what a silly question how could i possibly be sure of any of that i just made it clear if anything occurs like that again they'll get that response and much more what do you think congressman you know you know um look this is an 80-year relationship with the saudis it's not perfect they are not perfect by any means but we have to maintain uh that relationship as you said in your lead in the russians and chinese are absolutely happy to fill the void what i thought was kind of pathetic was that the president left with no announcement on oil they basically said well thank you very much for your visit and we'll think about it and we'll talk to opec about it i mean the president would have done a lot better to visit texas visit oklahoma let's talk about domestic production and if he has to go abroad he refuses to stand up the progressives and do that here how about you go places like our friends the kurds that are absolutely wanting to produce more oil in line with u.s interest but again very mixed very mixed review on all of it well i want to get your thoughts on china because it feels like this administration continues this soft on policy for china i mean look at the china policy that we have listed all of the things that we've seen in this first year and a half we know that there are many reports that the family has taken tens of millions of dollars from chinese officials who are tied to the communist party i mean and this is and this is china's way of doing things uh you know give gifts lend money and then overall you know take over uh he has failed to demand any real investigation into the origins of covid uh he's spoken to xi jinping at least five times and he and and as far as i know he's not brought up the subject although he said he brought it up we don't have any evidence of that he has failed to confront china on fentanyl the fentanyl is made in china and it's pushed through mexico uh he is sending china oil from america's strategic reserves and now he's considering lifting the tariffs on chinese imports if we can show that graphic again christopher please put that up because it is a long list of soft on china policy that we continue to see your thoughts on what's going on here you know and at the same time maria the chinese are buying up america they are buying up huge tracts of land which oh by the way happen to be key farming uh tracks but also near our military bases they're buying up our food supply chicken pork other producers and they're buying up our technology if they can't steal it then they come in and they and they buy it what are they doing with all of it they're creating dependencies on them and they're handing the technology over to their military as they have the most rapid military buildup in modern history and look at the end of the day the democrats want to talk about defund police i've been saying let's defund dictatorships let's defund the chinese communist party but we have wall street our politicians academia the sports industry hollywood you name it that are that are absolutely drunk on chinese dollars the chinese communists know it z knows it and they are looking to win the economic war way before there's any type of military conflict and we've got to wake up as a country and this administration is totally asleep at the switch right well the leadership begins at the top and the administration apparently is okay with uh unwitting investors investing in chinese companies tied to the chinese communist party that may very well end up turning around and fighting america tom cotton has a problem with this esg agenda and he says that he wants to investigate esg practices uh from groups like blackrock which he says have created a climate cartel to suppress investment in the fossil fuel industry in america and that's contributing to five dollar a gallon gasoline your thoughts on the investments of american families and this federal thrift fund having a wide open window this is the 401k for government employees past and president and they're able to invest in chinese companies that may very well get hostile on america we we are funding their expansion but we have we absolutely are but how sad and ironic to have our military members retirement plan start to be invested into beijing that lists all of their defense companies that money is going right to the future chinese stealth fighters uh tanks and planes that'll be shooting our men shooting at our men and women and we had an amendment to stop that to ban it and the democrats came back and said well we'll support you in banning funds going into chinese firms if you agree to allow these esg and environmental bans as well the irony there maria is that it that's going to also flow to china because they've cornered the market on solar panels so it's shutting down american energy independence flowing through this green obsession over into china and i could show you satellite images that are available on the market of chinese solar plants being powered by coal-fired plants right next door this isn't about the environment for china it's about creating dependencies and making america dependent and the left is playing right into their hands yeah and by the way you said it at the top of the interview china's influence campaign in the u.s a chinese company recently purchased farmland in north dakota just 12 miles from a u.s air force base with sophisticated military drone technology congressman we're watching all of this we so appreciate your insight thank you sir

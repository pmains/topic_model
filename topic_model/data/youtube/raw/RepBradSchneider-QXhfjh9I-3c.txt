thank you not just for your friendship but tonight for organizing and bringing us here to have this conversation for us in Illinois and Wisconsin throughout the country it's been a harsh winter everyone's talked about the weather and the snow and the storms but for some it's been a harsh winter than for others in January I hosted a roundtable on unemployment long-term unemployment and at that roundtable I met a young mother 29 years old with two young children and she told me how at the end of the day she comes home she makes dinner for her kids and make onda bet into bed under the covers to eat dinner and watch TV because she had to make the choice between paying her rent and paying her heat I met another woman who is looking for work now for over a year her story was a little different she was in an industry travel agency that shrinking she has two kids high school age we're looking forward to going to college and she's now in the position of having to deplete the kids college accounts so that they can simply make ends meet as she looks for work this is the reality for two million people around the country and the numbers of you as you have pointed out grow by seventy two seventy two thousand people every single week in Illinois alone there are more than 116,000 people who have lost their unemployment insurance and are struggling just to survive and yet in this chamber in this house of representatives we have not had a single vote to extend or address the unemployment insurance challenge partisan gridlock partisanship and gridlock have already cost millions their emergency unemployment insurance and the next year it is estimated that it will cost the US economy 240 thousand jobs failing to extend unemployment insurance is hurting families it's hurting businesses it's hurting our communities and it's hurting our national economy that's why yesterday I filed this discharge petition to end the gridlock and to bring to the floor a vote on extending unemployment insurance now look I understand some of my colleagues may disagree and I respect their perspective and I respect their right to vote no but not allowing a vote on the or not allowing us to voice our vote in this house of representatives on unemployment insurance is simply unacceptable I believe extending unemployment insurance is not just smart policy it's the right thing to do and celebrate the passage or the the Senate bipartisan agreement to extend unemployment insurance by five months and I look forward for that to come into this house and I hope we will have a chance to vote on it I know the path ahead is not going to be easy but our constituents deserve better than partisan gridlock thank you for sharing your time and thank you for organizing this evening thanks so much well thank you represent inator I mean your efforts for this body leading the House Democrats on that discharge petition we didn't know today the Senate was going to come up with something that may pass and may be able to get through this house but your leadership made sure that that over 110,000 people in Illinois and each and every week more people adding to that can get those benefits so

the problem among the problems we have right now we have employers that are not hiring people they're hiring temps they're starting to have people work a lot more work week we need to incentivize them to hire people real fulltime employees part of that can be a tax credit excuse the employers from paying the flank of payroll tax but that's part of what means fairly narrow bill I think initially and something to incentivize to employers small businesses to hire folks secondly to make sure that our highway transportation funding doesn't stop flowing that you don't shut down little transportation projects all over the country a third piece that we need to do it at this point in time is to extend a credit especially the small businesses provide liquidity different banks from the Small Business Administration so that they'll have the money that they need to to go on initially I think what we need is a what I call a fairly skinny bill and Republicans and Democrats can offer there are proposals to that we're going to come back in the the once they head and do more probably every month to to help out but that's so we need a good start and be but nice we get every bipartisan start with the comics bottom got the congregate in terms of gbg both very strong a year ago we're losing 600,000 jobs hey I'm not this January we lost almost no net jobs on monthly basis the economy's getting better productivity is up all we just need to make sure that we continue moving in in the right direction what we're going to do is every month we'll do something not differently we may focus one my fun I'm the tax credits or something to incentivize employed employers to hire folks another month we may work on the liquidity side trying to make sure the banks from providing liquidity to employers you eat in another month you may work on infrastructure mature highway roads highways bridges rail poor construction that continues we need to continue to spend money and spend down money in the stimulus package and one is really flowing now could do a lot of good and those are some of the pieces that we need to be doing again does that be all done at once but each month we should try to find common ground with Republicans if we can if we can't to do as much as we can on on on our own

  WAS PLENTY OF ATTENTION THIS  PAST WEEK ON SOME HISTORY BEING  MADE ON CAPITOL HILL AS  APPELLATE COURT JUDGE KETANJI  BROWN JACKSON WAS CONSIDERED BY  THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE  TO BE THE FIRST BLACK WOMAN TO  SERVE ON THE UNITED STATES  SUPREME COURT. PART OF THAT HEARING INVOLVED  TWO CALIFORNIA SENATORS, DIANNE  FEINSTEIN AS WELL AS ALEX PADIA. HE JOINS US FROM WASHINGTON. THANKS FOR TAKING THE TIME. WE UNDERSTAND THAT JOE MANCHIN  HAS SAID HE'S GOING TO SUPPORT  THE JUDGE'S NOMINATION TO THE  HIGH COURT. DO YOU BELIEVE YOU HAVE THE  VOTES TO GET HER OUT OF  COMMITTEE AND ON THE FLOOR FOR A VOTE TO CONFIRM HER NEXT MONTH  IN THE U.S. SENATE.  >> FIRST OF ALL, GOOD TO BE BACK WITH YOU. AS YOU MENTIONED, THE SENATE  DOESN'T JUST HAVE ME BUSY, BUT  ESPECIALLY WITH THE CONFIRMATION PROCESS OF JUDGE JACKSON,  SPENDING A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME  IN WASHINGTON THAN THE NORMAL  RIGHT NOW, IT WAS GREAT TO BE A  PART OF THE CONFIRMATION  HEARINGS LAST WEEK. YOU MENTIONED A 50/50 SENATE AND BY EXTENSION A 50/50 COMMITTEE. I DO BELIEVE DEMOCRATS ARE ALL  UNITED ON THE APPOINTMENT OF  JUDGE JACKSON. ANYBODY WHO HAS READ ABOUT HER  RECORD AND HER PREPARATION KNOWS THAT SHE'S MORE THAN QUALIFIED. ANYBODY WHO OBSERVED OBJECTIVELY THE HEARINGS OF LAST WEEK, THE  LONGER SHE WAS IN THAT CHAIR  TAKING THE TOUGH LEGAL QUESTIONS AND WEATHERING POLITICAL STUNTS  COULD ONLY BE MORE IMPRESSED AS  TIME WENT ON. WE KNOW SHE HAS THE GRACE AND  TEMPERAMENT TO BE A GREAT  SUPREME COURT JUSTICE.  >> HOW MUCH OF THE REPUBLICAN  QUESTIONING DID YOU SEE AS  ACTUALLY PAY BACK OR SCORE  SETTLING FOR THE KAVANAUGH  CONFIRMATION HEARING? >> LOOK, I WASN'T HERE AS YOU  KNOW, CONAN, FOR THE PRIOR  CONFIRMATION HEARINGS THAT WERE  REFERENCED BUT SITTING IN THE  ROOM THIS LAST WEEK AND I COULD  TELL YOU WERE PAYING CLOSE  ATTENTION THERE WAS A LOT OF  GRIEVANCES BEING AIRED, WHICH IS UNFORTUNATE, BUT I GUESS IT IS  WHAT IT IS. IT'S A POLITICAL TIMES THAT  WE'RE LIVING IN, WHETHER IT'S  THE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT, THE  EFFECT OF TRUMPISM OR THE 50/50  BALANCE OF THE JUDICIARY  COMMITTEE. BUT, AGAIN, I ENCOURAGE US TO  LOOK BEYOND THAT. MOST OF THE MEMBERS INCLUDING  SOME REPUBLICANS I THINK STUCK  TO THE INTEGRITY OF THE PROCESS. IT'S OKAY TO ASK TOUGH QUESTIONS BECAUSE THIS IS AN IMPORTANT  NOMINATION. IT IS THE HIGHEST COURT IN THE  LAND. A LIFETIME APPOINTMENT TO THE  HIGHEST COURT IN THE LAND. SO QUESTIONS ABOUT THE LAW,  QUESTIONS ABOUT JUDICIAL  PHILOSOPHY, THOSE SORTS OF  THINGS, THOSE ARE APPROPRIATE,  BUT SOME OF THE REPUBLICANS THAT CAME IN WITH A VERY DIFFERENT  TONE AND TRYING TO ASK SOME  GOTCHA QUESTIONS OUT OF CONTEXT  WAS A DISSERVICE BUT THE MORE IT HAPPENED, AGAIN, I GIVE MORE  CREDIT, HAVE MORE APPRECIATION  FOR THE PERSON THAT JUDGE  JACKSON IS. >> I DON'T WANT TO MAKE TOO MUCH OF THIS, BUT YOU DO HAVE A  COUPLE OF SENATORS WHO ARE  RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, TED CRUZ  OF TEXAS, JOSH HAWLEY OF  MISSOURI. SO I'M WONDERING IN THE  DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS DID THEY SEE  THEM AS ACTUALLY NOT SPEAKING SO MUCH ABOUT THE JUDGE'S  QUALIFICATIONS BUT ACTUALLY THE  BASE REPUBLICAN VOTERS PERHAPS  OUT OF IOWA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE? >> THE SAD PART IS THIS, AT THE  RISK OF SOUNDING LIKE A LAW  PROFESSOR HERE, JUDGES JUDGE,  THEY HEAR FROM PROSECUTORS, THIS HE HEAR FROM DEFENDERS, THEY  ASSESS A CASE AND WHEN THEY  SENTENCE THEY DO SO WITHIN THE  GUIDELINES THAT LAWMAKERS HAVE  PUT OUT. SO IT'S INCUMBENT UPON CONGRESS  AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL TO HAVE THE POLICY DEBATE ABOUT SENTENCES,  FOR EXAMPLE, MANDATORY VERSUS  ADVISORY, MINIMUMS VERSUS  MAXIMUMS. ANYBODY THAT IS UNHAPPY WITH HOW NOT JUST JUDGE JACKSON BUT  FEDERAL JUDGES ACROSS THE  COUNTRY ARE ISSUING SENTENCES  SHOULD INTRODUCE A BILL IF THEY  WANT TO SEE THOSE CHANGES.  >> LET'S SPEAK TO THE HISTORIC  NATURE OF THIS, YOUR SEAT MATE  THERE CORY BOOKER GAVE AN  IMPASSIONED SOLILOQUY ABOUT THE  HISTORY MAKING NATURE OF THIS  APPOINTMENT AND PLUS SOME HAVE  SAID, LISTEN, JOE BIDEN DIDN'T  NEED TO SAY I'M GOING TO A MONTH AN AFRICAN OR BLAM FEMALE TO THE SUPREME COURT. BASED ON HER QUALIFICATIONS  SHE'S IN THE UPPER STRATOSPHERE  WHEN IT COMES TO NOMINEES. SHE COULD HAVE BEEN APPOINTED AT ANY TIME.  >> YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. HER INTELLECT, QUALIFICATIONS,  RECORD, EDUCATION, PULL ALL OF  THAT TOGETHER, IT STANDS SECOND  TO NOBODY IN TERMS OF  PREPARATION AND BEING ABLE TO  SERVE ON THE SUPREME COURT. CONAN, I HAD A TOUGH ASSIGNMENT  THIS WEEK, IT'S A LOT OF WORK IN AND OF ITSELF NOT JUST AS ONE OF THE TWO SENATORS REPRESENTING  CALIFORNIA, THE MOST POPULOUS  AND DIVERSE STATE IN THE NATION, A MEMBER OF THE SENATE, A MEMBER OF THE SENATE JUDICIARY  COMMITTEE, TO PREPARE TO DO MY  PART, YOU KNOW, POSE THE  QUESTIONS THAT I POSED  THROUGHOUT THE HEARING PROCESS  RAISING ISSUES THAT ARE  IMPORTANT TO ME AND IMPORTANT  FOR MY HOME STATE, BUT AT THE  SAME TIME AS A LATINO, AS A  PERSON OF COLOR, SITTING  ALONGSIDE SENATOR BOOKER TO NOT  APPRECIATE THE MOMENT FOR WHAT  IT IS AND IT'S ONE THAT WE  SHOULD BE CELEBRATING. EVEN BEFORE JUDGE JACKSON IS  CONFIRMED SHE'S ALREADY MADE  HISTORY BY VIRTUE OF HER  NOMINATION, BY VIRTUE OF HER  APPEARING BEFORE THE SENATE  JUDICIARY COMMITTEE SO IF YOU  ALREADY MORE THAN CHECKED OFF  ALL OF THE QUALIFICATION BOXES,  SHE'S BEYOND HIGHLY QUALIFIED. SHE BRINGS RICH DIVERSITY OF  EXPERIENCE BOTH PROFESSIONAL AND PERSONAL. THE PROSPECTIVE OF A BLACK  WOMAN, A WORKING MOM, A FORMER  FEDERAL PUBLIC DEFENDER THAT HAS BEEN LACKING AT THE HIGHEST  COURT IN THE NATION, I GOT GOOSE BUMPS. DID MY JOB, BUT ABSOLUTELY  RELISHED BEING PART OF HISTORY  IN THE MAKING.  >> BEFORE WE LET YOU GO, THE  CRISIS IN UKRAINE. IF IT COMES TO A POINT WHERE  NATO ACTUALLY HAS TO GET  INVOLVED MILITARILY IN THAT  CRISIS AND U.S. TROOPS ACTUALLY  ARE EMPLOYED IN THAT CRISIS,  WOULD YOU WANT THE BIDEN  ADMINISTRATION TO GET  CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL FIRST? >> I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION,  CONAN, BUT I'M GOING TO REFRAIN  FROM ADDRESSING HYPOTHETICALS. I WILL SAY THIS, I GIVE  PRESIDENT BIDEN A TON OF CREDIT  FOR THE AMOUNT OF SUPPORT THAT  WE'VE ALREADY SENT TO THE  UKRAINE IN TERMS OF RESOURCES,  IN TERMS OF EQUIPMENT, IN TERMS  OF A HUMANITARIAN AID WHICH  CONTINUES TO GROW. HE HAS DONE A PHENOMENAL JOB OF  RALLYING NOT JUST NATO BUT  ALLIES AROUND THE WORLD TO  COUNTER THIS UNPROVOKED,  UNJUSTIFIABLE ATTACK AND  INVASION FROM RUSSIA INTO THE  UKRAINE. I THINK WE'RE -- DESPITE SOME OF THE HORRIFIC IMAGES, WE'RE  HAVING A LOT MORE SUCCESS THAN  PUTIN COUNTED ON WHEN HE MADE  THIS HORRIFIC DECISION AND OUR  RESPONSE AND OUR COMMITMENT WILL CONTINUE TO EVOLVE ALONG WITH  THE EVOLVING SITUATION ON THE  GROUND

hi congressman tracy mann with this week's man minute we were in washington for some votes last week uh got to go home over the weekend and we're now back just really for a day maybe a day and a half of votes it's disappointing to me that these votes couldn't have been taken care of last week but we'll see what plays out here over the rest of the day and tomorrow a big thing that's happening right now is the build back better they call it bbb i think it means bad bad bad this 2 466 page bill that we've often talked about it got scored last week and so the true cost of it over 10 years there's been a lot talking to be 1.5 trillion the reality is if the 150 programs are going to get started in that bill if it passes it gets signed into law those 150 programs over 10 years will cost five trillion dollars and add three trillion dollars to our debt so our debt you know we're approaching 30 trillion that passes will be assured to be at 33 trillion dollars just way too much money hopefully that doesn't get passed in the senate but that's where that's at right now a couple of things to touch on um the debt limit so we as a nation are approaching the debt limit again i'm just got word that there'll be a vote to extend that to by to add two and a half trillion dollars to the debt limit that will kick the can down the field um for a little over a year uh maybe 16 months big picture we've got to get a grasp on all the spending we have and i'm very concerned about that you'll see me voting no against increasing the debt limit here later on this afternoon or tomorrow morning thirdly vaccine mandates there's still a court ordered stay on the osha vaccine mandate that would require employees employers greater than 100 employees to vaccinate their employees also there's a stay on the cms which really impacts a lot of our health care providers so currently that's in the courts fortunately there's a stay on it we'll be fighting back on that legislative as well as always if any questions or anything you need from our office please never hesitate to reach out thanks a lot and if i'll see you before then have a merry christmas

I know this has been a very good good panel and I want to start with a question that stems from what I have heard all of you say not just today but you know repeatedly that you know your pears and when you come before the Congress and talk to us about issues it almost always comes back to information which really means data and you need access to it and particularly global data because you can really only look at what's inside you know your system and the fact is that under federal law you can't really get access to the data now senator Grassley and I want to change that we have a bipartisan bill to open up the Medicare database so that it would be possible to look at I think would you call global information be able to compare what you have in your system to to others and you know dr. Reisman and mr. Cardozo I think you all in particular and it's generally true of all five of you you are really sort of the point persons on this question dr. Iseman would this be helpful to you and and how would you assess the need for effort legislatively open up the Medicare database so that you really could get access to this kind of information and use it to drive improve quality and hold down costs right so I would suggest that there were two elements of this discussion of data one is retrospective analysis of aggregate data to identify trends to support comparative effectiveness research to understand what really works best and we think that's enormously important in fact we're working with the administration and Todd Park CTO office in order to in fact take advantage of those data capabilities and one of the capabilities that we bring to that is the ability to apply our analytics to ask some of these important questions the other element which is related but I just want to define it as being separate is the notion of availability of real-time data at the point of care to support the physician in regard to taking care of the patient who's sitting in front of him so there should be in fact the record locator that would allow me to identify data about you analyze those data and make sure that what I'm doing for you is again consistent with the best clinical evidence is and is not contraindicated relative to other activities that other doctors are pursuing with you so I think there's the aggregate and there's the real time but in any case the availability of information that resides within the Medicare database would be enormously important for a number of reasons yeah I would second that I think what there is to be encouraged about on this topic is that we're talking about it there's consensus that data matters and sharing it among clinicians matters it wasn't very long ago that you couldn't have that conversation physicians are fiercely protective of their medical records and we've seen a sea change just in the last three years in working with our physicians on this topic they're coming to understand as I said in my opening comments medicine is really complicated now and it takes a team it's not it's not an individual walking into his office in the morning and back out at night and he's all by himself and he's taking care of the patient those days are passed so they know they need to interact with other physicians they understand the importance of sharing data and by law patients have access to their records and why wouldn't other physicians involved in the care team care of that patient not have access to them as well we are at the advent of this but I think it's going to move fairly quickly why don't I bring the other three of our valuable witnesses into the second topic I want wanted to ask and if any of you would would like to elaborate on the question Medicare database certainly we can we can do that either in writing or or as you respond to this but the second question I wanted to ask all of you since you come from the private sector and you watch the federal government and obviously the federal government to all of you sometimes looks like it's moving very slow and slow to change and slow to adopt and slow to evolve and traditional Medicare even as we talk today is still in the sort of demonstration project kind of stage what would be your recommendations for speeding all of this up and particularly you've got the chairman ranking minority member here we're in a position to look at ways to speed up and accelerate these changes they get out of the demonstration kind of project area and can be be sped up so I don't we take our other three witnesses who didn't get a crack at at that one and your council on how to speed speed up changes and reforms for the second one dr. Schaffer and once you stay sure I'd say that that over the last couple of years what we've seen actually is quite impressive speed with respect to the uptake of the accountable care organizations and that I would leverage that because as we were talking about before the key is going to be for Medicare to be able to move away from a model of payment that deals with individual actors and and yet holds them accountable for the behaviors of every other doctor across the country and if others are using too much my rates are going to go down next year to a model where I have had Group a group of peers that I have accepted accountability with and we're working together to manage total medical expense quality and outcomes so the fact that that you have stood up 32 Pioneer ACOs in such a short period of time and that Medicare Shared savings program is getting underway I think sort of sets out the beginning of a continuum that to me actually reminds me very much of the way that we waded into the a QC model that I talked about today when we launched the a QC in 2009 we hoped that by the end of that year or possibly the following year we might have ten or fifteen percent of our network accepting that broad accountability for total medical expense quality and outcomes by the end of year one we had a quarter of our network contracted that way and at this point in time we have close to eighty percent of our network across the state contract in that way why did it happen why do we have that fast uptake I think there are lessons to be learned for the federal government and a big part of it was it was voluntary to begin we weren't forcing anybody in we said if you believe this is a better way and you can see that you can earn well under this model by making care better and by contributing to affordability over the long term then then come on into this contract and then what I think led to the rapid acceleration was a couple of things one organizations started to see that the initial pioneers no pun intended in our organism Otto we're succeeding both at improving quality and at managing to their budgets second they saw that the fee-for-service system was starting to look pretty unattractive was starting to look like you know low or or no payment increases no real opportunities to advance and that created some acceleration they started to understand that the kind of support they were getting from us as a payer and that I think the federal government will have to work out similar models to help them as a transitioned from a volume-based system to a value basis take that last point because I think that ballgame yeah I I think that is the ballgame and that of course is what we started essentially almost three decades ago in our part of the world whether it's group health up in Seattle or provenance or other kinds of plans in our area what what could the federal government do to accelerate that transition beyond fee-for-service well I think there it goes back to your earlier question about the datasets right because from from Washington DC or Baltimore it will be hard to partner with the provider organizations that have the courage to to sign up for these new models in the ways that we've seen have been critical to their success in our market but imagine that if those who sign up for it are able to partner with they're private payers who are also paying them in that model then and and if those private payers and the providers who have come into it have all the data to work with if we could be doing the same rich analytics for the providers in our organ in our market that are a QC organizations and also Medicare pioneers this would be enormous assistance to them if we could then take those analytics and be helping them with the performance improvement guidance that we give them on the commercial side giving them that same guidance on the on the Medicare side I think you'd start to see more rapid uptake across the country because fear is one of the rate limiters right now I think folks think I wouldn't know the first thing about how to transition from a system that pays me for every unit I produce to a system that's now going to ask me to have accountability for overall spending and quality so you have to help them its chairman when when a witness says that they support the effort along lines of what Senator Grassley and I are talking about to expand access to its Medicare data and they want to promote a transition beyond fee-for-service I usually think how to quit while I'm ahead I really should you're doing just great I thank you for the help the time

I've spent the last eight years almost eight years on the Intelligence Committee in the last four years intensively studying the Russian interference in the election of 2016 I can assure you that the Russians are going to try and are trying to interfere in the election of 2020 it's probable that the Chinese will it's likely that the Iranians will and possibly possible that the North Koreans will and the problem with this challenge that we face is and it goes to all of you who are working in the administration of our elections they don't have to change votes all they have to do is sow doubt doubt is the is the dagger in the heart of democracy of people doubt the election results if people doubt the fairness of elections and that's a very high standard to meet and I think we just we just have to be thinking about that as we approach all of these issues and for example online voting I'm sympathetic to the needs of those who are overseas and to the disabled but I think we need to be exceedingly careful about online voting I just spent a year with the National Cyber Commission on cyber threats to the elections and other parts of our society and there is no safe online voting system there is none I have not seen any evidence of a safe online voting system I've seen lots of evidence to the contrary so to the extent that those are used to enable people who otherwise couldn't vote to do so we need to be exceedingly careful about how they relate to the rest of the voting system whether somebody can use an online voting system for the disabled for example it can get into the rest of the voting system get into the voter database so I think those are matters of exceedingly important concern risk of registration online it seems to me mr. chair and as you always remind us you were affect a Secretary of State we need to think about what's our responsibility what's what are our powers and ultimately these elections are going to be up to the states and the mechanics so what do we have to do we need to provide some insight and advice which I have just volunteered about online voting and the risk of malicious activity in connection with our elections secondly though we do have to supply their resources or we don't have to but we should and if we don't particularly in the light of the kovat emergency we're failing our responsibility and failing failing our our voters miss Clark you talked about long lines often those long lines are in neighborhoods of color and where you place your voting places are important these kinds of decisions are absolutely critical but it's my belief and I don't know what the right number is but it's my belief that there is a need for additional support for simply PPE or for election personnel for other techniques for keeping the clerk's office open for more early voting all of those things are really critical a third place where it seems to me mr. chairman we really have a responsibility based upon all the testimony that we've had today is the post office there was 10 billion dollars in the cares Act as a loan to the post office to my knowledge it has not happened and yet the post office is facing imminent insolvency September is a date that I've seen given that there are now nine states that predominantly vote by mail and many others who will see a great deal of additional voting by mail we have to provide them with the infrastructure that votes by mail can be counted if the post office can't process those and secretary of state one of our secretaries of state said you know it's got to be in by the election day well what if they physically can't meet that those people are disenfranchised so mr. chairman I feel that that's something that we really have to attend to and we can't just skirt around the the the issue of the support for the post office because the president doesn't like their their package rates this is a matter of fundamental access to the ballot box for the people of America and if the post office can't get the ballots to the to the clerk's then they're being disenfranchised so I've gone over my time I didn't manage to get in a question but I think these are some points that we really have to consider Thank You mr. chairman I really appreciate your doing this earring Thank You senator King and there'll be another chance to ask questions if you've got

as mentioned we have uh our own congressman dan muser well the only one we count anyway we've we've got a few of them uh and he is joined by house minority whip steven scalise gentlemen how are you bob great to be with you hey bob great to be with you and with dan now uh first of all uh representative scalise i want to commend you obviously i never got to talk to you after that horrific shooting at the ball field years ago i was talking about it earlier on the show when you came back to the floor of the house and the courage you showed throughout all of it came through all at once i i was bawling like a child it was just so inspiring and i i don't think i was the only one i'm welling up thinking about it now so i just want you to know how much we honor you here and uh we love the fact that you're italian too there's a lot of scalises around here hey bob look look we first of all thanks for that it was an unbelievably magical day i mean special to be able to get back to work when i didn't even know if i was going to make it out of the hospital but uh you know to go and see so many of the people that helped me through the capitol police who took the shooter down and you know my wife was there doctors who who rest you know kind of treated me i mean it's just a treat to be able to come back and uh and then share with everybody what's great about this country uh on the italian american side so bob you you and me we've got a friend of joe piscopo who's a radio guy yes yes i get to do his show every now and then he's out of new york i mean you talk about a guy who loves who loves our italian heritage he is great he is great and uh and and post note on it just to continue the complementary vein you're the way you've handled yourself since i i didn't hear you running around whining about oh my god i got shot at you just went and did it you did the gary cooper thing so you're so far up on my hierarchy i i can't say enough about you so it's great to have you with us but when when when you get a second chance at life like i did there were miracles on that ball field that day and you know i'm lucky to be alive but i'm gonna make the most out of it and i'll tell you what you know dan and i have been working on a lot of things we're working to get this country back on track and we got to put everything we have into it and there's so many people around the country that that have the same love for this country and are just angry that that it's being destroyed right now and want to do something about it luckily we have that opportunity in november to flip the house to fire nancy pelosi you know dan's got some great legislation on immigration to figure out what's really going on and put a stop to all the madness on the border crisis you know biden won't do any of this stuff but you know we want to get the house back to be able to start pushing back well uh congressman scalise congressman muser we had the pleasure and the fortune because of our audience uh to be able to catch ghost flights coming into wilkes-barre scranton international airport and with the help of dan muser and our your former colleague lou barletta we exposed it to the country and now now everybody's doing it which is good we're exposing them unfortunately now they're flying them one by one out of texas to different locations and i i i you know dan you've got legislation i know that's what you guys are on to talk about today tell us a little bit about it yeah sure and and you know bob just real quick i appreciate your your words and background on uh whip scalise here not only has he become a great friend he's really just an incredible leader here and we're we win this majority back uh he's going to be in the in the top echelons and i'll tell you what the man is fearless uh the book is called by the way for and i highly recommend it i read as soon as i um got into congress it's called back in the game and uh it's really a book of miracles people really appreciate uh buying it and you know what anybody needs one i'll be the first to show you how to get it or i'll send you one well you promised me a copy but i wanted autograph now because i have a special section of my library that has the autographed uh books so scalise has to autograph it for me but look you know we've talked enough about the serious subject of this open border policy avidens how he reversed uh the trump policies uh implemented this title 42 change reverse remain in mexico implemented and adopted catch and release so i mean we've been we've been issuing amicus briefs i mean we got the supreme court to eventually overturn the uh biden's uh being against the uh asylum in mexico uh position and policy so we did get some of those things done but but the problems still exist we've got tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of illegals coming across and this is just a treacherous situation uh young people dying along the way being abused all kinds of drugs you know as well as i know the overdose fatalities in pennsylvania is higher by far than ever fentanyl just crossing the border so yeah we've got some legislation here that that steve is uh uh is supporting and um it's about us being notified uh relevant elected officials but it as important it's about us knowing who the sponsors are that these miners yes because i think i mentioned to you one time when i was at the border and i've been there several times as has whip scalise here but when i have a cbp customs border patrol look me in the eye and say sometimes when they're reading an address or a phone number off of a off of a minor's arm and saying sometimes they feel as if they're a chain a link in the chain of human trafficking we know where where these people are going and the taxpayers deserve to know there's no doubt about that representative scalise now you've been following this issue among many others i mean it's it's like a fire a day with these nut cases that are tr running the house the senate and the white house uh tell me where your focus is when it comes to the illegal immigration issue well bob there's so many different elements of this and and i think the fact that number one people are really paying attention to it all around the country because every town is narrow border town when they're flying people to wilkes-barre scranton it's it's happening in your town it's not just in texas but i went down to the border months ago i actually got to embed with our border patrol agents down along the rio grande river in texas they took us to the donna detention facility where they're bringing a lot of these it was thousands of kids that they were bringing but what's the most alarming and this is where everybody in america ought to be concerned and dan's been all over this is the drugs and the human trafficking that's coming across because of this they've turned operational control of america's southern border over to the drug cartels it's it's it's an alarming thing to say that the drug cartels are controlling our southern border and we've actually figured out they they divide the administration will not be transparent about this but we've identified that there are people who are on the terrorist watch list who have been caught coming across our border they won't tell us how many i mean frankly every american should want to know and deserves to know how many people on the terrorist watch list did they catch let alone how many came across that we didn't catch but they're bringing fentanyl fentanyl has killed a hundred thousand young people last year in america everybody that you talk to knows somebody who's died from fentanyl drug overdoses guess where it's coming from across the southern border because biden turned control of our southern border over to the drug cartels and congresswoman should that be any surprise because he turned security in afghanistan at the uh hamad karzai international over to the taliban i mean it's a better organization and gave them 85 billion of the world's best military technology we're going to look we get the majority back you know i know dan's going to be all over this we're going to be having hearings to find out exactly what they gave to the taliban and who was involved in that decision-making process who's involved in the decision-making process at the border how many terrorists have come across our southern border and why aren't they enforcing the law it's going to be there's going to be a lot of accountability in addition to legislation we've passed to work on fixing this well congressman muser tell us what can we do what can the people in northeast pennsylvania do to to help you with this bill well you know continue to be alert to the issues as as people are i think they're very informed and they're very energetic about the um about us you know winning back right i mean putting those into office and and yes they they're republicans uh that that are fighting for them that are fighting for america and along the way any uh anybody uh any democrats in in the house uh weigh in with them uh as to um in pennsylvania or anywhere as to that they need to support securing the border yes support this bill but frankly more importantly right is to get to the root cause and that's the policy of the byte administration in allowing this the the border to remain open uh enforcing act title 42 and going back to remain in mexico and there's other bills as well we want to strengthen the customs and border patrol but yeah you know get this i mean what they're doing to to to work their their terrible policy because the border is so overwhelmed you broke the story actually bob with these secret flights coming in but coming in the middle of the night i'm now told just yesterday uh by a airport official that flights are coming in lights off now it's been it's been about a month lights are off the windows occurred are shut down so there's a few lights airport personnel is being told to to go home so they have as minimal as possible the buses are no longer um waiting at the at the tarmac they're waiting around the corner uh at uh at a local gas station i know exactly where that would be at a truck stop and look none of this is the local uh folks fault i mean this is the bible administration directing the department of homeland security and hhs and um and i was also told that it's not just kids not just young people yeah adults as well well we could tell kamala harris if either of you talk to the vice president we can let her know the root cause of this migration into this country it's that this country's great and actually the sad part is they're working on the the root cause because they're trying to destroy our greatness people won't want to come here after they're done representative scully's here to be part of the greatness they're coming here to bring drugs and human trafficking into our country and look we've got a legal way america let's be clear about this america is the most generous nation in the world uh for letting people into our country a million people get to legally come to america every year from countries all around the world but there's a legal process and you should wait in line like everybody else people wait years sometimes to come to america and they're insulted by the fact that somebody's going to jump ahead of them and just cross over to tonight across the rio grande be given a plane ticket by joe biden and go to pennsylvania what other who knows what other states they're being sent to and the next day they're in america while you've been waiting legally for five years to come here that's what i think irritates people who came here legally through our immigration system so we've got to get back to rule of law we're a country of laws absolutely we're a country of immigrants but we're also a country of laws and that's what joe biden seems to want to forget well i know you gentlemen have to get back to work i appreciate you taking some time out of your day to be with me representative steven scalise house minority whip his book is back in the game it is inspiring it is it's it's tingling it's it's just that good but back in the game is the book representative dan muser representative scalise thank you so much for being with us great being with you bob thanks bob

I have a prepared text here that I would like to enter into the record but let me begin my remarks first of all but welcome into our capital today miss Jennifer Pinckney and her two daughters there are the wife and children a Reverend clementa Pinckney who along with eight of his Bible study in this lost his life to a de minute white supremacist who said that he was interested in starting a race war he entered their church participated in the Bible study which they welcomed him into and as they closed their study that evening and prayed for what they had experienced and for the next meeting this gentleman while their eyes were closed opened his and slaughtered to them I find an interesting in my colleague is talked about the inconvenience of waiting longer than three days to purchase a weapon without mentioning those poor souls of Emanuel AME Church he has talked about people who might be inconvenience he's talked about something he read in the newspapers but he has not mentioned them well I'm here today to say that the members of this august body need to think a little bit about the value of those lives are they more valuable than the inconvenience a gun purchaser may have by having to wait 10 rather than three days to make a purchase what would make one so anxious to purchase a gun in the first place if you've got to have a gun right now chances are you have no useful purpose no redeeming value in the purchase of that gun and maybe we ought to participate here as members of this body in helping this purchaser with a cooling-off period which is all we are asking to do here Charleston South Carolina is nicknamed the holy city churches steeples dominate this skyscape line of this historic city which until recently had an audience ordinance that normally could be constructed higher than 55 feet wanting nothing to obstruct it steeples faith is fundamental to the Charleston community however that faith was rocked in June 2015 when this long gunman rushed into this Bible study after studying the most historic african-american churches in the state of South Carolina develop a list of five churches one of which was Emanuel AME he by his own admission selected this church because of its importance to the african-american community being the first organized place of worship in the south for African Americans he selected this this was a hate crime of the first order and we're saying we should not inconvenience him and we did not inconvenience him we allowed him to get that gun after three days when it was around the fifth day that they found the glitch in the system and found him to be ineligible to own a gun we just had a gunman go into his workplace in Aurora Illinois he was in the eligible that have a gun but he was allowed to purchase the gun and when they found out that he was ineligible to have a gun they then sent him a letter and say please bring us the gun that you are not eligible to have a gun give me a break no he didn't return the gun because he had no redeeming value in having a gun and he murdered his coworkers and you telling me we should not inconvenience him well my colleague the chair of the committee is laid out for you the procedure in this bill a procedure that makes it a maximum irrespective of my colleague me say it's a maximum of 20 working days business days that one would have in order the person but I would hope as we move forward here today we would think about those poor souls of Emanuel AME Church we'll think about those full thousand people four thousand two hundred people who purchase guns in 2016 using this loophole the four thousand eight hundred people who purchase guns in 2017 using this loophole think about their families think about their children gentleman's time has expired and think about what we about Panem charity Minister I yield the gentleman an additional minute thank you for yielding in addition let me just take this minute to go back to what I prepared to say here today in troubling times many of us find solace in the serenity prayer god grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change courage to change the things I can and wisdom wisdom to know the difference the Charleston loophole is something all members of Congress should have the courage to change and by doing so grant the American people the serenity they deserve in their schools in their entertainment venues in their neighborhood streets and god forbid in their places

eally me the time it's a speaker i rise to continue honoring HBCUs historical black colleges and universities for their significant contributions to our nation's history while only three percent of our nation's higher education institutions or historically black HBCUs produced 20 percent of the african-american college graduates today I recognize and celebrate two of the seven HBCUs in my congressional district Voorhies College and Denmark Technical College in Denmark South Carolina for his college was founded in Denmark as Denmark industrial school in 1897 by Elizabeth Evelyn Wright when she was just 23 years old right studied at Tuskegee Institute and was a devotee of Booker T Washington she had peoples and led efforts to start schools in African American Americans in South Carolina which were always met with arson and threats of violence she persisted in her efforts to offer African Americans an opportunity for a better life and before he's created an institution that would stand the test of time right originally taught classes in an old store in Denmark but in 1902 New Jersey philanthropist Rev Voorhees donated money to purchase land and construct a building for the school in high school at first who is offered classes at this level for african-americans in the area in 1924 the Episcopal Church partnered with Voorhees and an affiliation that with that church continues to this day the college began to order for junior college degrees in 1947 and 4-year degrees in 1962 while originally founded on the principles of Booker T Washington to teach job and trade skills to African Americans voice now proudly claims to offer a blender this philosophy and that of W EBD boys who believe a classical liberal arts education was vital to the development of African Americans the college's recently retired president dr. Cleveland Sellars is a Denmark native who graduated from Louise's high school Sellars went on to Howard University where he became active with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee participating in his 1966 march against fear in 1968 after returning to South Carolina Celes was arrested and imprisoned for supposedly exciting the confrontation between students and police that became known as Orangeburg massacre when police opened fire on students killing three and injuring 27 for esa's college's new president dr. W Franklin Evans previously served as interim president of Miami mother South Carolina State in that role he successfully led South Carolina State out of a financial crisis I sincerely believe that though his college is well positioned for the future with dr. Evans and it's Hill Denmark Technical College whose campus is adjacent to four he's was originally a branch of the South Carolina trade school system it was created in 1948 by the South Carolina General Assembly and many been did it to provide trade skills to African Americans doing this separate-but-equal era Denmark check was one of the few opportunities for trade mission offered to African Americans by the state in the early 1960s governor Fritz Hollings and then Senator John West led the effort to create the South Carolina Technical College System in 1969 the existent trade school in Denmark was transferred into the system and the Morden Denmark Technical College was created its total enrolment is approximately two thousand nine a six percent of whom or minority students Denmark Tech continues to provide technical education and trade skills in this society region of Bamberg Barnwell and Allen they are counties voyeurs college and then mark Technical College like their fellow HBCUs have made an indelible impact on their communities South Carolina and the nation they're provided generations of African Americans educational opportunities and I look forward to their continued success mr. speaker are you

at very much you know growing outrage is happening right now over a controversial decision apparently by the administration actually is not by the administration that's an important point it's actually by the Department of Homeland Security to start releasing detained illegal immigrants the move said to be an anticipation of looming federal budget cuts more than 300 illegals in Arizona have already been let go and Governor Jan Brewer there is not happy this is just unexplainable unbelievable and it's appalling the bottom line is is what about the respect for the law abiding citizens and who is running this country you know it's blamed this person blame that for a duck cover you know the American people Neal are fed up well meanwhile the chair of the House Homeland Security Committee is asking why this is happening and wants answers on it Texas Republican Michael McCall is the author of a letter that he wrote to ice and chair of the House Homeland Security Committee congressman nice to have you in person on thanks for him i said appreciate this week we've heard different numbers we've heard hundreds have been released we've heard thousands have been released what are we talking about here how many know we really don't know we know hundreds have been released it's a very dangerous reckless policy I sent a letter to director more demanding answers in terms of how many people have been released what is the background what is this policy that you're doing that you didn't notify Congress about and you know what is the criminal background so we're hearing that some of these people released have violent criminal backgrounds we're hearing from the White House Jay Carney spoke about this yesterday saying that the White House has no input on this plan this is up to the department to make that decision what do you think about that very interesting how Napolitano announces this at the White House tries to tie it to sequestration a scare tactic that they've been doing all week long you know I think it's tied to see question I think that she's tried to I think this whole thing backfired on the White House and then you saw him running for cover and they throw the secretary under the bus and say oh we had nothing to do with this is all ice in the Secretary of DHS so why would they do that though what would be their motivation to releasing people if it's not due to budget cuts from sequestration well I think you know for the past year they have had this plan to start releasing these detainees in their view to save money but I think it's a weak immigration policies what it is and they're using sequestration as sort of a guys if you will an excuse to do this to effectuate that policy we kind of caught them red-handed on and I sent my letter to director Morton and then he saw them all kind of running for cover and then the White House not taking responsibility you don't have a response to the letter so far but do you have any evidence that this is their plan you say this is your gut feeling about this but any evidence that you can point to know that they had a directive that they were looking at doing this as far as a year ago so it's sort of ironic that Napolitano tries to tie this to sequestration again you know the skys falling oh now we're gonna have to release illegal aliens and again I think that that strategy totally backfired on them we call them out on it and it's a dangerous and reckless policy to release potentially violent criminal offenders into the general population we need more information on this obviously how many who exactly is is being released we had Karl Rove join us at the top of the hour and he said something that Republicans should consider doing is giving the power to the President and sequestration to have some ownership to the cuts and how they're made right now as we just talked about the White House's well we don't have we don't have any ownership of these cuts because it comes out to the department's what do you think about that should that be that something that you you all consider so that the president has a role and what cuts are being made of how look we want smarter cats but let's let's be honest this was a president's idea he came out with this idea and you can't balance a budget if all you talk about or discretionary spending that's one quarter of the budget need to talk about the three quarters of the budget which is entitlement reform and without that adult conversation in the room we're never going to get this thing done and yet the president won't even come to the Congress and talk to us he's running around on a road show politicking rather than governing let me ask you this though a lot of our viewers are hearing about their meat not being inspected long lines at the airport teachers being laid off illegal immigrants being let out at the same time what we're hearing is that lawmakers are going home tonight tomorrow and we don't know what to think what what's really going on here is this just an opportunity for for politicians to be political sequester or do you think that the sequestration cuts are really going to have this effect that we're all hearing about I don't think that this thing is probably going to go forward I know leadership Smee with the white house tomorrow not optimistic about that but the sky is not going to fall the cuts will probably take place we're going to be okay it's a lot of hype by the administration scare tactics to blame her house republicans we don't think that the House Republicans should take any action from this point on to try to prevent this or make some sort of common well you know we we have we passed two bills to replace sequestration the Senate has done nothing the present didn't respond to it the prep that Boehner tried to negotiate something with the present state but again he won't talk about entitlement reform you can't get this done unless you have cuts and discretionary but also mandatory spending cuts and that's where I think quite honestly Boehner will tell you he got rolled by the president the White House he's not going to do it again we let us know when you get a response to your letter about the specifics I'm sorry well and i plan to sit down and meet with the director morton personally and i think the American people deserve answers to what I think is a return to the catch and release policy that we ended many years ago congressman pleasure to have you on set with us thanks Jenna thank you for the time today

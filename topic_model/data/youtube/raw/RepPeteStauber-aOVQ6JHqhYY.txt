minutes Thank You mr. chair and I think the Chairman and ranking member for including my amendments in these n bloc amendments mr. speaker my amendment is simple it requires the Secretary of the Navy to create a report regarding the feasibility of doing maintenance work on naval vessels at shipyards other than shipyards in the vessels homeport currently the Navy has a tremendous backlog maintenance backlog but under current law there are certain restrictions that limit where naval vessels can undertake maintenance repair unless these restrictions are lifted the Navy's backlog will only increase exponentially at the same time there are fully qualified shipyards in the rest of the United States including the Great Lakes region Gulf Coast and Alaska that can perform repair work for certain types of naval vessels yards such as Frasor shipyards in superior Wisconsin have the capacity and skills to do this work they just need the chance I know Fraser shipyards and others are dedicated to the national security mission of the United States and would be an efficient and competent service provider and I am certain Fraser shipyards and others within the Great Lakes do not stand alone in this process although these vessels may not be homeported in these regions of the country it should be within the Secretary's discretion to decide what types of vessels could be sent to such shipyards to help with the Navy's maintenance backlog this could include noncombatant vessels vessels with minimal whose or other vessels that only need limited periods of time in shipyards for the repair work the opportunity to create additional geographic repair centers presents the United States Navy an opportunity to diversify their industrial base create resiliency and improve our military readiness I want to thank congressman Duffy in congressman Cox for co-sponsoring this amendment and I encourage all of my colleagues to support the end block amendment Thank You mr. chair and I yield back

mr. president I also rise to speak about the nomination of congressman prices HHS secretary I will oppose his nomination principally because he has been an opponent of virtually every program that provides healthcare access the people of modest means in this country Medicare Medicaid the S chip program which he called socialism Planned Parenthood which is the primary health care provider of choice for millions of women and the Affordable Care Act there's much to talk about but I'm going to focus my comments today on his repeated promises to repeal the Affordable Care Act repeal of the Affordable Care Act would be very unwise it would be heartless and it would be economically foolish the Virginia stats are instructive in Virginia a hundred and seventy nine thousand Virginians have been able to enroll in Medicaid since the ACA was passed an additional 179,000 and nearly 380,000 Virginia's have been able to get coverage through the marketplace we haven't done the Medicaid expansion program if we did another 400,000 could receive care through the ACA nearly four million Virginians have protection against discrimination on the grounds of pre-existing health conditions they have such conditions and they could be turned away from insurance companies as they have been in the past as my own family has been before the ACA only those with employer coverage got tax benefits to help pay for health insurance and now 320,000 moderate low-income Virginians get tax credits averaging 275 dollars a month to help them in addition there are nearly 5 million Virginians with employer-sponsored insurance and over 800,000 Virginia's would lose access to free preventive care under the under Medicare if the ACA were to be repealed nationally a repeal of the ACA under an estimate of the Urban Institute would cause 30 million people to lose their health insurance that's the combined population of 19 states we had a hearing last week in the Senate Health Committee about the Affordable Care Act and it was called by the majority Obamacare emergency and I asked the witnesses demo radical republican and of no political identification I asked them would a repeal of the Affordable Care Act with no replacement be an emergency and all the witnesses agreed that it would and one of the witnesses said it's more than an emergency it would be a catastrophe and so then I asked these witnesses again bipartisan witnesses okay we shouldn't repeal if that means we should fix it or repair it or reform it or improve it should we do a fix or improvement hastily carelessly and secretly or should we do it openly publicly carefully and deliberately and they all said of course we shouldn't do it we should rush we should get this right and that's why many colleagues on our site had asked Republicans sit down with us and let's make improvements but don't push people off of health insurance it would also lead to significant economic catastrophe for hospitals for providers to have a repeal and not know what comes next and remember that health care is one-fifth of the American economy if you inject uncertainties of that you have consequences that we could not now predict they would be negative but the real story is in any of these statistics and I'll pick up on what my friend the senator from Arkansas said the real story is about individuals patients and what happens three weeks ago I put on my website a little section came senate.gov backflesh ACA story and I asked people to submit what it would mean to have a repeal of the Affordable Care Act and today i have had sixteen hundred and fifty for submissions by Virginians of what it would mean to them and we've been able to follow up on some of them and get permission from some so that i could read their stories on the floor and so during the remainder of my speech i'm just going to tell you what a repeal of the ACA would mean to people all over my Commonwealth Michael Dunkley was in Alexandria Virginia quote i was diagnosed with advanced stage for non-hodgkins lymphoma cancer in october of 2013 and was put immediately on an extremely powerful five component chemotherapy treatment program that would conclude in late january 2014 my insurance coverage at the time of my diagnosis was under the terms of Cobra and my monthly premium was 875 dollars with a 7,500 dollar deductible and a $15,000 out-of-pocket limit my cobra coverage expired on midnight December 31 2013 and was immediately able to be replaced because of a plan I had been issued to the provisions of the Affordable Care Act because of the new law I could not be denied coverage to a pre-existing condition advanced cancer and I was issued a new plan that was far superior in coverage and cost me only 575 dollars a month with zero deductible and in 1850 out-of-pocket limit three days after receiving my new health insurance coverage I was infused with a fifth round of chemotherapy for which I was charged thirty five thousand dollars near the end of january 2014 i received a sixth dose of cara p chemotherapy and was build another thirty five thousand dollars i was given a pet-ct nuclear scan that cost five thousand and one week after that on februari 14 2014 my wife and i were told by my oncologist that my advanced cancer was now in complete remission as i am the sole caregiver for my wife who has advanced multiple sclerosis the news of the cancers remission was a lifesaver for her as well as myself had it not been for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act I would not have been able to purchase my health insurance for any price due to my pre-existing condition of having cancer had it not been for the income subsidy I would have not had been able to afford or pay the premium for a superior plan a plan which saved my life Thank You President Obama and thanks to every member of Congress that voted in favor of the life-saving Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act Patricia Mills Virginia Beach my daughter who has lupus and her husband who has juvenile diabetes have been struggling for the last six years to keep their conditions under control they have a gifted 17 year old daughter who has been in the ID Academy in virginia beach and have had to sell their home to pay off debts due to complications from their illnesses my husband and my have made our home their home but their struggles have continued because of the enormity of their medical expenses since they have been able to enter the affordable care for their insurance they've been able to stabilize their lives financially if the Affordable Care Act is repealed I don't know what will happen to them insulin is extremely expensive and so are the supplies to inject and check blood sugar to keep my son-in-law alive there is no option for a diabetic to turn to to get life-saving into one a diabetic individual needs who works hard every day but falls above the Medicare threshold we are living in terror at the thought of a repeal Justin Jackson radford as i type this i'm currently sitting in the offices of the community health center of the New River Valley I'm 25 years old and the last doctor I'd seen until today was my pediatrician like many struggling Americans I cannot afford insurance and rely on low-income free clinics to receive preventive care the aithe helps programs like the one at the Community Health Center clinic with funding we cannot afford to lose clinics like this one with cuts funding public health Americans should not be denied health care we should not have to file for bankruptcy for becoming sick or avoiding a doctor all together because it costs too much the Affordable Care Act should be revised not repealed if Congress repeals the ACA 20 million Americans risk losing insurance that's 20 million Americans that may stop going to doctors because they can't afford it I plead to Congress to care about your fellow Americans and give us health coverage that is affordable or better yet three seeing the doctor shouldn't revolt revolve around a choice between going hungry or not Gabrielle Falco Alexandria Virginia senator Kay my name is Gabriela I'm a 26 year old full-time student studying what she loves I work part-time in my field of study that makes the money to live on my school expenses are all covered by student loans when I was 22 fresh out of college and unemployed I was diaper I was diagnosed with hyperparathyroidism and many severe kidney stones to prevent kidney failure or worse I required multiple surgeries all of which were come by my parent's insurance through the Affordable Care Act ever since I've had twice yearly checkups and ultrasounds as well as some scares with my kidneys there is no explanation for my medical history and all the doctors can do is monitor and treat it when troubles arrived when I turned 26 I chose my own health care plan through the ACA as I'm a student I have the way of working full-time for benefits the ACA has allowed me to live and safely and affordably monitor and treat my kidneys while finishing my master's degree were it not for the ACA I fear my health would become a choice between death or bankruptcy I don't know what I'll do if I lose my health care I could not afford it without the ACA I will fight for you senator Cain and please fight for me and my health in Washington corwin Hammond Williamsburg Virginia senator came before the ACA my wife and I did not have nor could we afford medical insurance my wife is a business owner and I'm a pastor of a small Church in toano Virginia I left my state job that provided full benefits because the ministry needs in my community were so great I'm grateful for this legislation that allowed us to have peace of mind in knowing that we're covered and able to visit the doctor without going bankrupt why not just fix the components that need repairing instead of throwing millions of hardworking Americans to the wolves we deserve better how about the Congress and Senate repealing their health care and leaving ours alone thank you for one handed Sarah Mullins fears prospect Virginia senator Cain I have one perfectly imperfect child he has not one but two pre-existing conditions he was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome and he was also born with a unicameral bone cyst a hollow bone that affects one in four children this year we were able to purchase our lifelong dream a family farm 18 perfect acres of peace and promise this summer we endured a medical ordeal we could never have imagined my son broke his arm due to the cyst for the fourth time in less than three years and we were finally approved for surgery to place a titanium rod through the cyst that would prevent further brakes on july twenty the surgery was successfully completed and the next day we were released with instructions on pain management and to not remove the surgical bandages for three days on July thirtieth we remove the bandages to find a hot swollen bright red nightmare we were readmitted to the hospital I wasn't truly afraid until I saw the face of the same nurse that discharged us that night she was fighting back tears over the next three days there were two additional surgeries on my son including a PICC line and after six days when we released a home health care suddenly I had a health care provider every eight hours a dose of antibiotics had to be attached to the PICC line it took approximately 90 minutes to administer and then the line had to be cleaned and prepped there was never a six-hour window that I could be away from my child which mean I was not able to work the six hours scheduled at my part time job which means after the second week I was fired told I could reapply when I was ready to come back to work on August 26 my son slept for almost 20 straight hours and then woke up vomiting and with her fever so by lunch we were readmitted to the hospital again the next day while in the hospital he broke out in a mystery rash from head to toe and had a white blood cell count of a chemo patient for me this was the worst because no one not even the consult from UVA infectious diseases knew why after three days with the Douglas CBC count trending up and more research the leap of faith was decided to end all antibiotics and see if they were the cause for the reactions they were in by October my child was healed ineligible school almost five weeks after he should have started his first day in middle school by then the bills had started to arrive daily the first bill from the hospital was a hundred and five thousand dollars before insurance and over twelve thousand dollars with benefits we're still receiving bills and our pre insurance totals are well over seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars before insurance but because of the ACA we were capped at 7500 dollars out of our family pocket that means 231 dollars a month for 24 months which helps our families but it also means we can still afford our mortgage I wake up every morning thankful for my healthy child amazed that we live on this tiny piece of heaven ata made this possible for us I have kept all bills all x-rays and documents related to our journey Sasha Baskin Richmond when I was 17 I discovered that I had a rare and highly aggressive tumor in my job it took three experimental surgeries to remove and replace the tumor with a metal implant and bone graft I was fortunate enough to be dependent on my parent's insurance when this medical event took place with the Affordable Care Act I had been able to stay on my parent's insurance into college and graduate school and maintain my health status to regular doctor's visits I require a yearly checkup to make sure that the medical implant is intact and that the bone graft is growing successfully within the next five to ten years I will need another surgery to replace the metal implant with my new technology if the implant breaks or if I have any kind of accident that injures my jaw I'll require emergency surgery and most likely have my jaw wired shut I'll turn 26 in October and no longer be eligible to be on my family's insurance but thanks to the Affordable Care Act I can rely on being able to maintain affordable insurance and feel comfortable about my health I can trust that I won't be turned away due to my pre-existing condition of a metal jaw and history of tumors I can be sure that i will not reach a lifetime limit of coverage when I need another surgery or if the worst happens and I need to have an emergency surgery when the doctors first found this tumor when I was 17 they told me not to go to college because I needed so many surgeries I was planning to attend school in Maryland my parents lived in Connecticut and my doctors were in Boston but I was determined not to let my medical problem take control of my life I went to and graduated from college in Maryland and I now enrolled in graduate school pursuing a masters of fine arts in Richmond I rely on the affordable care act for safe and reliable access to doctors all over this country I've been able to live my life independently because of the freedoms and access healthcare has provided I'm a recent Virginia citizen but I love it here I am proud of my represent tation and I hope my story will help you towards saving healthcare in our country and Odin all richmond virginia on new years eve 2013 we were informed that our youngest son patrick 18 years old had type 1 diabetes an incurable disease that comes with a lifetime of insulin dependent injecting oneself six to eight times a day the cause is unknown it is not a lifestyle disease and there is no escaping it once diagnosed the beta cells on our sons pancreas just stopped working type 1 diabetes is extremely dangerous and when not managing it will be in order type 1 diabetes is extremely dangerous and it was not managed causes blindness kidney failure limb loss other issues and even death we were knocked off our feet numb confused and overwhelmed by the danger and the medical requirements to stay within an acceptable insulin range people with the disease must balance insulin doses with eating and other activities throughout the day and night they must also measure their blood glucose level by pricking their fingers for blood six or more times a day our son still can have dangerous higher low blood glucose levels both of which are life-threatening he will die without insulin he could dive away Norwich insulin in the midst of our fog and sadness we remembered the ACA at least the ACA will be there when Patrick is on his own he will be able to get health insurance regardless of his prior condition was our mantra one day Patrick came home and announced great news the AC allows me to stay on your health insurance in telling 26 I changed my retirement schedule I can do that I've watched and worried as insulin prices soar Pat takes two types of insulin a single carton of which costs between 400 and 500 dollars retail I run the math in my head and I worry more about the lack of insurance we're covered by my employers insurance which pays for most of the drugs equipment and health care needs but what would happen if we found ourselves without insurance what if I lost my job public service runs deep in our family my husband's a retired teacher are all the sons of policemen it appears patent moving toward nonprofit or public service work as well Willie have health insurance will we have it without the ACA I can promise anyone reading this that you know someone whose life will be positively impacted by the ACA there are 20 million people like our son Patrick don't allow a repeal of the ACA fix the problems work the issues but don't play politics with our son's life Linda crisp Lynchburg Virginia I had employer health care for 38 years in 2013 I lost my eyesight to macular degeneration and could no longer work an insurance company covered me for 695 dollars a month with the lost income I could no longer afford insurance I contacted them and was told there was a new plan I can apply for I applied and I was turned down pre-existing condition you see in nineteen eighty four decades before I had been diagnosed with kidney disease I was treated and according to my physician cured but the insurance company didn't care I applied for insurance under the ACA and got a silver plan that cost was 345 dollars a month I was given a tax credit the ACA saves me when I was waiting for Medicare to kick in after receiving disability I'm sure that my premium would have gone up with the ACA but it saved me when I needed it John Carle setzer Winchester Virginia my son was born in 2009 with a severe congenital heart defect called hypoplastic left heart syndrome basically he was born with half a heart and required three open heart surgeries all of his treatment is considered palliative in 2009 he had the first of two heart surgeries in addition to another on his diaphragm he was hospitalized for many ways he had insurance under my employer coverage clearly he has a pre-existing condition but the other issue is that he almost maxed out on his insurance coverage in his first year of life my understanding is that the ACA eliminated the lifetime caps on insurance coverage and my wife and I blew a major sigh of relief otherwise he would have had to switch his coverage for my insurance to hers however he required another surgery a couple years later and at some point will require a heart transplant thus the insurance games would have continued the ACA eliminated that burden on us at least until he's an adult the lifetime cap is not something i hear debated much these days but it's something to consider for people that have major health complications please consider this in future legislation in addition to coverage for pre-existing conditions I'll read one more story and then see to my colleague I have so many more that I want to read and this is just one or two percent of the sixteen hundred and fifty four stories that my office has received in three weeks Jennifer smells midlothian in 2008 my husband started his own construction company after the national home building company he worked for pulled out of Richmond it was our first time being self-employed and along with adjusting to the idea of not receiving a paycheck on the fifteenth and thirtieth of each month we needed to secure our own health care coverage for our family of five we submitted our applications for insurance and were notified a short time later that we would not be offered coverage for our oldest child he's on the autism spectrum and they were denying him coverage because of his autism diagnosis we were shocked our son was high functioning and was not in need of any special medical services and he still received this denial with the passage of the ACA we no longer had to worry about being denied coverage due to a medical diagnosis this bill is not without its flaws our premiums were high in addition to the high deductible and it was a stretch to afford the plans even with the credits available to us but at least we felt uneven ground that in addition to parenting a child on the autism spectrum we didn't also have the challenge of not being able to secure healthcare coverage for him

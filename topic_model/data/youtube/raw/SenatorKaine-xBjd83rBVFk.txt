from Capitol Hill Democratic senator Tim Kaine of Virginia great to have you on the show this morning thank you I want to talk about that second meeting with Vladimir Putin but let's stay on health care your president talking about letting Obamacare fail and then he'll somehow win first of all will Obamacare fail no look it's providing insurance for millions of people who've never had it before bankruptcies are cut in half people with pre-existing conditions are protected we do have to make improvements weekend I'm a member of the Health Committee health education labor pension I was on the committee for two days I got on in January two days later I wrote a letter to the Republicans saying let's take this matter up in committee how do we fix it how do we improve it we're ready to work with you our committee has had so many meetings but we won't meet about health care we meet about nominees we meet about the FDA but what does it happened here in the Senate it's been an effort to jam something through now we need to do it the right way listen to the American public and do it the right way and and I hope this effort will fail the president rooting for health care to succeed means he's going to feel good if millions of people get hurt that's just outrageous we won't let him sabotage our health care system we've got to work in a bipartisan way to make it better senator health committee so how many meetings have you had with Republican senators we've tried to share with you the travails of they're getting this legislation to the point where it could have a vote have you had any meetings with them well Mike I've certainly discussed with many of my Senate colleagues on the committee this very thing but again the point I'm making is we've got a great committee our committee chair Lamar Alexander was a governor he understands Medicaid we've got a doctor on the committee bill Cassidy from Louisiana Maggie Hassan a governor who's got a disabled child but we're not using that process at all and I'll tell you something the reason this thing has failed in the Senate is first because of people you cannot threaten people's health care and expect them to go quietly a mother who of a disabled child told me about a week ago I was having a roundtable meeting in Virginia and she said they picked the wrong group of people to fight with and I said well what do you mean by that and she said if you've got a disabled child you fight from the moment that child is born for their health against doctors hospitals insurance companies against social stigma against school systems you think we're going to let them slash Medicaid without a fight they badly miscalculated when they went after the Medicaid program which is for kids folks with disabilities in seniors and now they have to set it aside and come back and try to do it the right way how about hanging a banner in the Senate with the words of senator Shelley Moore capital from West Virginia who said the other day I didn't come to Washington to hurt people I did not come here to hurt people and this is a lesson for the president to I think in this one the presidents is learning that facts strike back I think they've gotten sloppy down there and they think they can say whatever and people will buy it hook line and sinker but this is a president who said everybody's going to be covered nobody's going to pay more I'm going to protect you if you have a pre-existing condition I won't cut Medicaid and when a House bill passed they shattered all those promises he has a celebration at the White House isn't it great this isn't a game show here this is reality and when you make promises to people about their health care and then you shatter them they're going to remember and the facts are going to strike back and in this case they have senator Steve Kraske what you've seen the political reality you just talked about the build-a-guy out of the house what Republican leaders in the house thought they were capable of getting their members to vote for certainly here in the Senate you see the political realities on the Republican side there I know you just said you want to work in a bipartisan fashion let me just ask you looking at the political realities as they are in Washington realistically is there anything you can say here specifically right now where you think there could be agreement between Democrats and Republicans on this Steve I do if we if we do it like we're supposed to which is get in committees and hear from the public and then trade ideas we can find improvements I'll give you an example I have a bill in to bring premiums down through using reinsurance now you know reinsurance it's a backstop insurance companies have some you know most people's claims are not that high but then you have a very small portion of people of very high claims if you provide a backstop of reinsurance then you can price premiums for the regular everyday person rather than the high cost that brings premiums down for everybody we use reinsurance and crop insurance flood insurance Medicare Part D reinsurance was part of the Affordable tract for the first three years then it expired it's got bipartisan cred I have a bill just to reinstate the reinsurance provision in the Affordable Care Act and it will bring premiums down and other colleagues have similar bills but thus far we haven't been able to bring our bills up we're like in a starting gate that won't open my hope is that now people like my chairman Lamar Alexander and our ranking Democrat patty Murray they've got a great track record of finding common cause on things like rewriting No Child Left Behind tough tough issues if we can just do this the right way we will find improvements that can get bipartisan support

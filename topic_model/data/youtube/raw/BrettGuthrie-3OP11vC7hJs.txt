Jarrid again for bringing this hearing together and thank you all for being here and I do echo three marks that you just made last week we held a hearing on the rising cost of insulin and heard from patients doctors and patient groups about the rising costs of how the rising cost of insulin has affected Americans with diabetes more than 30 million individuals and I have two nieces nine point four percent of the population in the United States have diabetes in 2016 about six point seven million Americans age 18 and older used insulin then some prescribed today is different than the insulin discovered over a hundred years ago and the life expectancy of diabetics has improved dramatically these innovations should not be underestimated and a lot of exciting research is on the horizon someday soon I hope we will have a cure for diabetes as we discussed last week however the average list price of insulin airily tripled between 2002 and 2013 making this vital drug unaffordable for too many Americans many argue that while this prices have been increasing net prices have stayed relatively the same or have even gone down this sounds great because in theory no one is supposed to play pay the list price for insulin however is a patient if a patient is uninsured or underinsured that may end up paying the list price or close to it we've also heard that more Americans are paying the list price at the pharmacy counter for part of the year because of enrollment and high deductible health plans has increased we have struggled to fully understand and I emphasize this fully understand while this prices for medicines such as insulin have continued to rise the prescription drug supply chain is complex and lacks transparency we have had a lot of conversations with participants in the drug supply chain over the last two years to better understand how the pricing and rebaiting system works we've been told that manufacturers set the list price and therefore lowering the cost of prescription drugs is as simple as manufacturers lowering their list prices on the other hand we've heard that manufacturers can't simply lower their list price because the pharmacy benefit managers are PBM Semana rebates and if the manufacturers do not provide them with these rebates the PBM don't put their drugs on their formularies for health insurance plans although they're not on the panel today we've also are concerned about other entities in supply chain such as health insurance companies and as chair to get said I'll emphasize we're not here to point fingers at that that's what we've heard we want to try to get to a solution while while some may think that one party in the supply chain is solely responsible for the rising price of drugs their incentives to increase list prices throughout the drug supply chain to beyond the potential for manufacturers to make more money by raising prices a higher list price allows manufacturers to provide larger rebates to PPM's most of whom have contracts allow them to keep a percentage of the list price or receive fees based on the list price additionally the health insurance companies decide whether to pass the rebate along to the patient at the point of sale or keep the rebate to lower premiums across the board for all beneficiaries the current system contains many incentives for list prices to increase rather than decrease unfortunately while we keep hearing assurances that net prices are staying flat or decreasing and then almost all rebates are passed on to the health plans we know that many patients are being disadvantaged by this system and are paying more for their insulin at the pharmacy counter your companies have taken steps to try to reduce out-of-pocket expenses for insulin to the patients who need them and that is a good thing I'll worry however that these are only short-term solutions it is important that we collectively find a permanent solution that improves access to an affordability of medicine such as insulin I think our witnesses for being here today and I will yield the remainder of my time to my friend from Indiana miss Brooks thank you thanks for being here and I'm gonna use a quick example just goes to try to make it simple I've been wrestling with this for about a month and trying to figure out what's happening so if I wanted to get was making this phone and I want to buy and she said she's willing to take $100 for it but she says I'll sell it to you for 300 give me 200 back when that doesn't make sense or cure two guests willing to take $100 and I say to her hey I'm willing to pay a hundred but charging me 300 I'll give you 200 back and the whole idea is that Brittney is that is the purchase at the end and I'm passing I'm giving that to her for $100 because she's the plan she's saving the money and pass it on to her consumers and what we're trying to figure out where that in Delta is going is this hard to figure out and say and I've been spent a lot of time on it so fair six so the three manufacturers I wanna try it because I got a lot a few questions to try to go fast you said that your net price your list price is going up but your net price has gone down what would happen if he just said hey I'm gonna make my list price my net price and put it out on the marketplace so that you three first of all we are dropping our list price of Humalog by 50% was our launch of vice Provencal in' for us there's there is many people who have access the majority people have access for insulin at affordable costs through their health plans that's not tied to list price right so we don't want to disrupt those by lowering this price and so we think the best way is to provide in a short term is to keep our list price at the way it is so people we don't disrupt those individuals we don't harm the access that they have but if you're willing to take I think you said you know what whatever the net price is I know that prices are different with their for plans there's not one that price I get it but if you're willing to take a net price for your product and three of you here why wouldn't that be something out there for everyone to pay I mean that's what you're willing to charge right it's just more difficult to do that to disrupt that for a product that's on the market place today because people have affordable access but you've had your net price in court in your to your testimony go up to hundred seven percent where your list price dropped by three percent according to the latter on February 6 on Huma Huma law and and I think you're all are similar to I don't want to just do Lilly all of you guys as well I mean that's the kind of so we see the net price going I understand what you're saying but we see the net price rise and we don't know why is it do it maybe there's a market reason for that and it's and it's benefiting consumers but we want to know so in the current system today the most important thing for us is for the met the most number of patients to get our brands at the most affordable prices and in the system today that is the current formulary positions just a three BMP PMS here today represent over 220 million covered lives you said they were perverts okay I'm that's 80% of the life so for us to lose one of those positions that would be a dramatic impact to patients in terms of the medicine that their own physicians in terms of their choice in your argument would be you would lose your position on the formula if you lowered your price in the current system if we eliminated all the reboots yes you're shaking your head leave that wouldn't be in jeopardy you said there were perverse incentives what are the perverse incentives well we're spending almost 18 billion dollars a year in rebates discounting fees and and we have people with insurance that with diabetes that don't get the benefit of that so what a perverse incentives for that 18 billion in rebates you said I prefer going into the system in their misaligned right so that's we believe that they should go back to the diabetic patient the PM's are very effective negotiators it's what happens with the results of that negotiation those rebates are not necessarily going all the way through to patients they're being used for other parts of the system and we don't have visibility to how those rebates get used those rebates are part of how we secure formulary placement and cost-sharing for the patients that are covered by those plans would you say so you say I'm willing to take X for a product but for me to get on their formulary I know I'm gonna have to lift raise my list price because they didn't want rebates is that what you're arguing the rebates is how the system has evolved the rebates are part of the negotiation to secure formulary placement and associate I went too long on that site because I'm not giving you mister you always talk to that I guess I had two other questions about either hearing your responses to that so as mentioned previously by my colleagues my left of course we're looking at the clinical attributes of a product I know you want to get to the economics the way we make formulary decisions is based on net to price and if every one of the manufacturers to my right wanted to reduce their list price there will be no implication to the rebate status so long as the net price remained the same so so on my example if she's willing to sell for me a hundred and I sell to Britney for a hundred and we're you're saying rebates keep the price down but in the end because you're selling to her it than that price so why wouldn't the net price be what we're trying to figure out is it seems like there's a price that's marked it through the system that seems to be based on something but there seems to be an inflation and another a higher price that just seems to be caught up in the system but where it really affects people before as we've talked about when they're going to the point of sale when they haven't hit their deductible when they and now you've got these plans in place and those are great but we need to figure out the economics behind it so if we need to do something here to help people out we need to understand which we have more than five minutes I yell bang I just want to close and when the chair and I were discussing having the hearing we thought insulin was a proper one to have one I know it's different than 100 years ago today but but we had a lady before a doctor physician from Yale that said that there was a held up insolence that is to say you talking about Ms Schakowsky my friend Miss Kowski from Illinois she also talked about President Trump it's saying that this is the port of him and in my experience with him is in meeting with him is that drug pricing is important to him so it's everybody it's in uniting everyone in and I'm gonna be quick I know five minutes went fast before they get on my question I'm not gonna ask the question because that's not what I've been recognized for but innovation is important I saw a film yesterday of a father talking about his daughter I don't know cured the right word by not having any symptoms from sickle cell I mean it is just hepatitis so you can take with and you talk about medical devices you can do the HEPA the artificial pancreas is here so innovation and having a market-based system and a free enterprise system is absolutely important and but what we're trying to get at with this is it and hopefully you can see our frustration is that we see the pharmaceutical companies say our pet price is going down we see the list price going up and we have friends here from Bardstown that are that are in the buddy Carter situation or of community pharmacists and they see have described any situations that he just described and they have to pay the list price to sell to somebody who's not through the when they sell so it's a cash flow to those kind of businesses and what we're trying to figure out is if the net price is the net price then why isn't that what's paid to the if the idea is we're gonna get the lowest price for our are insurance companies then why is it selling something for $135 that's cost $135 better than selling something three or four hundred dollars and getting three or four hundred back other than saying I've saved you that money there's a truck right where the money's going and so this has been informative I think one course I want to ask that I'm gonna do for the record is so what do you put on the formulary is it better for a high list price with a lower net or that's better for the insurance company but it's not as good for a if it's just a lower net price just lower list price it's actually lower for the consumer going to the counter at the pharmacy so this is just hopefully the beginning of a series of hearings and it's been informative and we do appreciate you're willing to come here and your testimony and trying to inform us because we we do have to make some decisions and we don't want unintended consequences because you could get in if you get into price controls you get into rationing and you get into shortages and that's not where we want it I don't and that's not where I want to go we won't people have a a fair price if they can pay and if they can't pay to have the assistance to have that because it's life-saving so thank you for your indulgence and I yield I think I think the ranking member and I think

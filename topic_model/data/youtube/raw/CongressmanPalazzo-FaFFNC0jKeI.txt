THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE   GENTLEMAN FROM MISSISSIPPI IS  RECOGNIZED.  MR. PALAZZO: THANK YOU, MR.  SPEAKER. I WANT TO THANK THE RANKING  MEMBER AND THE CHAIRMAN OF THE   SUB-- OF THE COMMITTEE FOR   ALLOWING ME THE TIME.  I RISE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF S.  2981, THE NATIONAL OCEANIC AND   ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION   COMMISSIONED OFFICER CORPS   AMENDMENT ACT OF 2020. THIS BICAMERAL AND BIPARTISAN  LEGISLATION AIMS TO IMPROVE THE  SMALLEST UNIFORMED SERVICE IN  OUR COUNTRY, THE NOAA  COMMISSIONED OFFICER CORPS.  THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE NOAA  CORPS OPERATE HIGHLY SPECIALIZED FLEET OF SCIENTIFIC SHIPS AND  AIRCRAFT.  SEVERAL OF WHICH ARE BASED IN MY DISTRICT ON THE MISSISSIPPI GULF COAST, AND ALONG COASTLINES  AROUND THE NATION. THE RESEARCH CONDUCTED ON THESE  SCIENTIFIC PLATFORMS HELPS TO  IMPROVE HURRICANE FORECASTS,   MANAGE HEALTHY AND SUSTAINABLE   FISHERIES SUCH AS RED SNAPPER,   AND ENSURES SAFE AND EFFICIENT   MARITIME COMMERCE ON AMERICA'S   WATERS.  MEMBERS OF THE NOAA CORPS ARE  THE ONES WHO OPERATE THE NINE  AIRCRAFTS AND 15 VESSELS IN  NOAA'S GROWING FLEET.  DURING A HURRICANE, THEY DEPLOY  ON MISSIONS INTO THE STORM AND   IMMEDIATELY AFTER HURRICANES   THEY DEPLOY TO ASSESS DAMAGE AND MAP OUT DEBRIS AND THE CHANNELS  TO OPEN OUR PORTS BACK UP AS   SOON AS POSSIBLE.  ALL THESE ACTIVITIES ARE   ESSENTIAL TO MY DISTRICT AND   MANYER OTHS. ESPECIALLY THIS YEAR WHERE WE  HAD BACK-TO-BACK HURRICANES IN   THE GULF IMPACTING OUR MARITIME, ECONOMY AND ECOSYSTEMS.  NOAA CORPS OFFICERS PROVIDE  ESSENTIAL SCIENTIFIC AND   OPERATIONAL EXPERTISE NEEDED FOR NOAA TO MEET ITS MISSIONS EVERY  DAY. RECOGNIZING NOAA'S 50TH  ANNIVERSARY AND THEIR GROWING  RESPONSIBILITIES, THIS   LEGISLATION WILL HELP NOAA   RETAIN AND RECRUIT THE MOST  QUALIFIED OFFICERS AND WILL  OFFER THESE SERVICE MEMBERS THE  LEVEL OF PERSONNEL AND   PROFESSIONAL SUPPORT THAT THEY   DESERVE. THE 2020 HURRICANE SEASON  CONFIRMS THAT WE NEED TO MAKE  THE RIGHT INVESTMENTS SO THE   NOAA CORPS CAN BECOME EVEN   BETTER AT PREDICTING STORMS AND  TURN -- INN, TUR PROTECTING LIFE AND PROPERTY.  WHILEPI HELNG CONSERVE OUR   FISHERIES THAT ARE VITAL TO OUR  NATIONAL HERITAGE. MR. SPEAKER, I BELIEVE IT IS   CRUCIAL THAT WE RE-AUTHORIZE AND SUPPORT THE NOAA COMMISSIONED  OFFICER CORPS AND I URGE MY  COLLEAGUES TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF   IT.

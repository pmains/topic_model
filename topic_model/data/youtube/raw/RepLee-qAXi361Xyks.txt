first let me just say mr. Hoyer are whip talked about the 50th anniversary this year and Johnson's war on poverty now this war on poverty included such initiatives as Medicare Medicaid head start the Higher Education Act the Department of Housing and Urban Development there was a very important immigration bill you name it 50 years ago this legislation the war on poverty really has helped to reduce our poverty rates in the United States poverty has fallen from twenty six percent in nineteen sixty seven to fifteen percent in 2015 yet we have a long way to go so it's not time to end this war on poverty actually it's time to increase our efforts to make sure that the 47 million people living in poverty have access to all of these initiatives that were begun fifty years ago that really have lifted families out of poverty and have prevented families from moving into poverty that is very important to remember about this 50th year anniversary the supplemental nutrition assistance program for example snap that has kept nearly 5 million Americans including 2.2 million children out of poverty in 2014 that's why we do not want to see any more cuts to this program social security benefits kept 1.2 million children out of poverty in 2013 and Medicaid kept nearly 3 million people out of poverty in 2014 and programs beyond the war on poverty like the Earned Income Tax Credit in the child tax credit which congresswoman DeLauro and our whip Hoyer spoke about these two initiatives these two policies and programs have kept nearly 10 million Americans including 5 million children out of poverty in thousand and fourteen alone they strengthen our economy these programs they increase opportunity for families and provide millions of Americans with pathways out of poverty we've tried to make sure that our Republican colleagues understand these facts and not gut these critical programs because they're extremely important we do not need to continue to fund tax breaks and giveaways to corporations and the well-connected while so many people are still living below the poverty line stealing aid to the poor and handing more to the rich that's really shameful and that's utterly unacceptable and so we need to come together to really begin to recognize that we've got to lift people out of poverty and create a level playing field so that everyone can have the opportunity to live the American dream cuts to these programs not only cost our government more money the taxpayers in the long run but they're really it's really morally wrong to cut these programs now as a former food stamp recipient myself and public assistance recipient I know firsthand just how important these safety net programs are I would not be here today if it were not for that lifeline that bridge over troubled water that these types of programs extended to me when I was a single mother on welfare raising two amazing sons trying to get my life together so that I could move on and take care of my family and live the American dream believe me I know no one wants to be on food stamps no one everyone wants a good paying job that allows them to provide for their family and contribute to society they want to take care of their kids their bumps in the road yes and now the economy has turned around for many but not for all so that bridge over troubled waters more than ever so I hope that in the negotiations in this omnibus bill we're going to make sure we remember these people and not raid the programs that keep people out of poverty provide a safety net and as mr. Hoyer said let's do no harm in this bill and let's help people move into the middle class we must recommit ourselves to combating poverty and inequality once and for all it really is a disgrace when you look at these charts when you see the percentage of people living below the poverty line and this is in the wealthiest and most powerful country in the world it's a challenge to all communities and communities of color of course are disproportionately impacted and affected but American Indians Alaska Natives african-americans Latinos asian-americans Asia Pacific Islanders white living below the poverty line in Appalachia and rural America there are people living in poverty all over the country I come from California close to seventeen percent of the population of California mind you California is living in poverty that's almost two percentage points higher than the national average and that is in California while many people believe that poverty only touches cities and urban communities as our whip indicated our rural communities continued to be plagued with persistent poverty while lacking many of the resources found in cities such as public transit food banks access to critical workforce training according to the united states census bureau eighty-five percent of our nation's persistent poverty counties defined as twenty percent or more of a population living in poverty are in rural America mr. Clyburn our demo system leader has laid out a formula for years 2010 2030 which would direct and target federal resources to these in to these counties and to these areas that would lift people out of poverty and so we need to really understand where people are and make sure that our tax dollars go to those communities to lift people out of poverty more than one-third of rural Americans and one in for rural children live in poverty in 2015 these are appalling touches our population that really needs help to most including our children and our seniors in 2015 more than six million seniors now that's fifteen percent of all people over 65 years of age living in poverty even worse while children make up just twenty-three percent of the population in the United States they account for one-third of all Americans living in poverty that's one in

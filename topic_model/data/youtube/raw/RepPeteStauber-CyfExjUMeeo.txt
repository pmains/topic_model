part of the country Thank You congressman Hearn for about giving me some of your time chairman Lola Fong and ranking member ghosts are mining defines Minnesota's past present and its future so I appreciate this opportunity to peep to appear in this panel because I fear these heart proposed hard rock mining reforms would disincentivize any mining and irreversibly damaged Minnesota's economy the first bill I introduced the Superior National Forest land exchange Act it codifies the land transfer that occurred last July between the Forest Service and polyMet mining this bill passed the House last Congress under my predecessor former representative Rick Nolan's leadership with broad bipartisan support including mr. chairman your support along with four other Democrats sitting on this subcommittee mr. Koller thank you for appearing today to discuss this crucial issue involving Minnesota the Iron Range in my district produces the iron ore used to build America and helped us win World War two the economy on the range is volatile it ebbs and flows with the price of steel and is constantly threatened by cheap iron ore from international competitors lacking any environmental or labor standards mr. Coomer how would instituting the proposed royalty and shift to a leasing system affect iron ore mining and steel production it would have a major devastating effect on the ability to acquire new sources of iron ore and the Rocky Mountain West and to this state there still are no mines that have been developed under a leasing system in the Upper Midwest so these are different types of properties the existing industry and a new industry where it's developed with more federal mineral but we're now haven't developed yet we're still trying to after years and years of permitting and compliance activities thank you along with iron ore there are two proposed copper nickel projects in northeastern Minnesota the polyMet project past all environmental standards taking in incredible 14 years other countries mining copper and nickel have varied little to no environmental standards mr. Coomer how can places like northeastern Minnesota compete internationally under this proposed legislation it would be very difficult both in Minnesota and throughout the West land tenure mineral tenure will be lost its it will be devastating and I'm not a skies following type person neither am i thank you for answering those questions mr. coma and for your testimony and my next question will be to Commissioner Lac alt commissioner I appreciate your service as a county commissioner I too came from the county commissioner realm so I appreciate what you're doing and understand what you're going through and thank you for testifying today you listed clean renewable energy as a priority and and continued energy diversification requires elements like copper nickel and iron ore I want to ask you this would you rather power your County with elements harvested in places like northern Minnesota who have environmental strict environmental and great union labor standards or would you prefer to receive these elements from places that lack union labor and environmental standards like Brazil China and Russia sir thank you for the question and I think it's really important to honor the past our mining history and my part of the world is we honor how our region came to be and the economy that it helped build but we need to look to the future and we work with a lot of solar companies you should have a commissioner I have to yield my time back to two Zenit of Hern yeah you'll get

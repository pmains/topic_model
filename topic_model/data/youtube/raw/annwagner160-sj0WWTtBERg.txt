I thank the chairwoman I think secretary Carson for his testimony today and for his service would you like a minute sir any more time to respond yeah thank you very much the fact of the matter is Congress has responsibility for making the laws that govern this and they have the ability to change that and if in fact you want to explain to the American citizens who've been on the wait list for several years in your district in New York why we should continue to support families that are not here legally I would be happy to join you and help explain that to them thank you and I'm glad you could definite your answer congressman Al Green and I have written and worked on legislation that addresses major challenges facing the disaster relief funding process at HUD according to numerous IG reports and a hearing that the financial services Oversight and investigations committee held in March major issues have been identified with the Community Development Block Grant disaster recovery program some of the difficulties identified are the potential duplication of benefits slow disbursement of disaster related funding and delays in funding for low and moderate income citizens while HUD has become a primary provider of disaster recovery this program is not codified in statute HUD uses more than 60 60 Federal Register notices to issue clarifying guidance waivers and alternative requirements to oversee at least 113 active disaster recovery grants which totaled more than 47 billion dollars as of last year how to find the cdbg-dr program would provide a framework for future disasters reduce their over Alliance on Federal Register notices for each disaster and speed delivery of disaster assistance to grantees and disaster victims codification provides proper controls that protect against waste fraud and abuse mr. secretary are you aware of these challenges within the cdbg-dr program and how are you making sure these funds are directed towards the Americans who need it the most thank you very much for that question and for the visits that we've had to discuss this and other matters I actually very much agree with the whole concept of appropriate qualification you and Congressman Greene have been working on this I know with some others and the big advantage of course is you know you start out on second base is turning out from home and you know there are a lot of things that are done consistently all the time and you can get those things codified and done quickly so that you can decrease the amount of time in agreement with that and we're very happy to work with you we're already making some progress in that area and I think we can do this because one of the things that has concerned me is the amount of time it takes to get grants out right and I've asked every office at HUD to look at their own internal procedures and see what they can do to speed it up if you have ten offices and nine of them get things done quickly and one of them takes six months the whole thing takes there's got to be coordination between high SVA FEMA state agencies all talking to each other to make sure there's a procurement issues I so look forward to working and continuing my work with congressman green to to bring this to the to the floor so I thank you for your support and for your commitment to this quickly moving on the world's largest Catholic health care system ascension is headquartered in st. Louis region ascension is implementing a comprehensive organizational response to trafficking survivors as its hospitals and its hospitals unfortunately ascension can only establish these programs where emergency housing is available I understand that the continuum of care FY 18 competition focus included fifty million dollars for housing services for domestic violence and trafficking survivors will HUD extend this program and ensure that projects including housing for trafficking survivors are or are there more permanent ways that HUD can address transitional housing needs for trafficking survivors sir well you know trafficking is obviously a horrendous there's a lot more on these days and we definitely need to take care of that and that was a very good program it turns out that you all have fun that that for the 19 seasons so yes it will be continued wonderful I'm glad to hear that my time is expired I yield back

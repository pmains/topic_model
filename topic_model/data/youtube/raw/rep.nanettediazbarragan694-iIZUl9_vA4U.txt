more complicated than that mr. Johnson I want to I want to go to you to talk a little bit about microgrids one of the solutions for improving community resiliency to outages from climate disasters these micro grids where we combine local clean energy resources such as solar with battery storage to keep the power on can you speak to this solution and what policy changes Congress can make to bring micro grids to more communities thank you very question we know they work because we had one during the fire season to blue-like Rancheria tribe as a micro grid solar with battery storage and they were able to use that to keep some of the Humboldt County area electrified during one of the PSPs so we do think going forward and have actually significant plans to increase the number of micro grids on the order of perhaps 20 more this year and 40 more over time I think these are largely well one thing will happen to have helped fix this would be a carbon standard would be a climate standard by the Congress that certainly would move this in the right direction otherwise I think these are mostly state decisions reflecting state standards and in California there's very hospitable to this kind of application what do you envision that carbon standard by the Congress would be like economy-wide affordable and driving innovation okay mr. McWilliams as the area designated as a higher fire threat widens an additional risk from climate change hazards such as storms and flooding grow I'm concerned that homeowners particularly low-income residents and people of color will not be able to afford home insurance how is access and affordability to insurance being impacted in California and the country yeah I think that's absolutely an issue one of the things I mentioned in my written testimony is that to me what's happening in California but in climate change-related issues more broadly is that we're seeing society really having to grapple with the question of how we're going to take these increase costs which are going to be very significant and allocate them among all these different stakeholders whether it's the rate payers or tax payers etc and so this is another example where we're gonna have to look at and decide how we can support those communities because increased costs are going to go up because a risks are going up in the actuary's will reflect that ultimately and rates right I haven't represent a district there's only four districts poor in California than my district and when I would call people throughout California during the wildfires those in more affluent communities would say well my family is just evacuating we're gonna get a hotel not a big deal for us more of an inconvenience but when I think about my own district and districts like mine there will be many communities who will not have the ability to do that which is why I think it's so important that we collaborate and leave we work together to prevent more wildfires and how do we get it so that it's not the new norm and so thank you for our panel for all your suggestions and I'm sure this will not be the end of the conversation with that I yield back

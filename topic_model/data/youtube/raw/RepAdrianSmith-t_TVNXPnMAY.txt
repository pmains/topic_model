thank you I certainly appreciate my colleagues and and their support of our effort to have changed the name from homestead National Monument of America to the homestead National Historical Park obviously the some of the reasons have been outlined appreciate the Chairman and ranking member for bringing this legislation to the floor it's supported by the entire Nebraska delegation and even more importantly by local stakeholders and as was mentioned the Homestead Act of 1862 it was signed by President Lincoln and it absolutely helped shape the American West it allowed US citizens to earn ownership of a portion of the vast public lands owned by the federal government across the western US ultimately the federal government granted title to ten percent of the land in the u.s. through this program it gave millions a chance to build a new life for themselves their families and for future generations in order to claim a 160-acre parcel of land under the Homestead Act a homesteader was required to be at least twenty-one years of age or the head of a household build a home on the land improve in from the land for five years and pay an $18 filing fee the Homestead Act remained in place through 1976 with provisions allowing for homesteading in Alaska through 1986 President Ronald Reagan said the Homestead Act quote ensured that the Great Western prairies of America would be the realm of independent property owning citizens a mightier guarantee of freedom is difficult to imagine end quote we are very proud the very first claim under the Homestead Act was made by a man named Daniel Freeman near Beatrice Nebraska in Nebraska's third District to memorialize this milestone as well as the 1.6 million other claims which built the American West the homestead National Monument of America was established also near Beatrice unfortunately referring to this site as a monument brings images of a single static Monument such as the such as a statue or an obelisk or even a natural feature like the Scott's bluff National Monument near my hometown of Gering Nebraska not of an extensive park that celebrates the hype the pioneering homesteaders of many years ago homestead National Monument consists of a Heritage Museum the freeman school has mentioned earlier and as well as the tall grass prairie hiking trails of forest farming demonstrations and much more referring to this site as an historical park instead of a monument would far more clearly describe the opportunities to take in this living history site in fact according to the Friends of Homestead 89% of first-time visitors to the facility were confused by the name on behalf of the people of Nebraska and particularly is particularly the citizens of Beatrice and gage County Nebraska I appreciate this opportunity to advocate in support of this proposal today thank you I yield back

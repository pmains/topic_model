I want to bring in congressman bill Huizenga who was a Republican from Michigan thanks so much for being here thanks Chris I mentioned that the majority leader Cantor is on be briefed and members of Congress aren't going to be briefed today and tomorrow what questions do you have yeah I've got I've got a lot of questions first of all what exactly is that clearance process that's allowing this many people to have that that type of clearance what is exactly the role with the contractors and and how widespread that is and then frankly what what else aren't they telling us I want to make sure that we've got a full complete picture of what's going on what do you think about Edward Snowden shouldn't be prosecuted based on what you know is he is he a criminal or see a whistleblower he says Americans need to know that all of this is out there well I'm not ready to declare him either a hero or or a tyrant here but I do believe that he had other avenues he could have gone down rather than disclosing this to the press so all you have to do is turn on any of the myriad of cable programs and you'll see the congressmen and women and Senators who are questioning these things could have easily gone and approached one of those offices had a conversation that way as opposed to going and exposing this to a foreign press agency you've said that the NSA collecting these records collecting all this data raises some significant concerns in yet you voted yes for the Patriot Act the reauthorization are do you think that was a mistake do you think that this has gone beyond what you thought it would well I think that is part of it I'm not ready to clear that a mistake yet I do have a lot of questions as to what what weren't we told at the time what is it going to be any implication that laws were broken here except maybe by him not by by the collection of this data and I think there's there's an absence of information though when we're going into some of these votes and you know I got classified briefings before and and some of these on I not on these particular issues so when the president's going out saying well Congress was fully briefed well as a rank-and-file member we were not fully briefed about these types of specific issues on what was happening that is what the Intel committee is about in 40 was missing what were you briefed on why generalities and what was going on I had no idea that they were going in and doing this dragnet type of a program where they were going in and scooping up everybody's phone call records and those kinds of things certainly this this new revelation about going in and in gathering everybody's Facebook and Google and everything else that's that's been going on that that was news to me and I think a lot of my colleagues as well as I'm talking to them so there is this big picture question you know Snowden told reporters at the Washington Post that these animals aren't bad guys but they labor under a false premise that if a surveillance program produces information of value it legitimizes it and and if we are stopping terror texts say na boo jolla zazie he's the guy who was going to take the backpacks on the subways and and blow up the subways do the ends justify the means if we can say well look yes it's a huge dragnet but we're stopping attacks is that okay no i mean because we could stop attacks if we had cameras in everybody's home and at every corner and in every car and we were listening in on everything where do you but that's fine well I think that's that is there isn't a bright line on this and it gets very gray and that's what exactly what we need to do is figure that out I for me personally I'm not needing to be convinced that this was the wrong thing I'm needing to be convinced that this is the right thing to be doing and I haven't been convinced yet congressman bill Huizenga good of you to come in and thank you so much appreciated

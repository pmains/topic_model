population of our country but most importantly for those who services veterans in the military last night the Senate agreed to significant legislation on three fronts to make the VA a better and more responsive to our veterans ranking member tester and I have spent the entire year working towards making sure we didn't delt dealt with the needs the VA had so that all these stories we've seen on the front page of papers stories about there being unsafe conditions stories about people being mistreated stories about people having wait so long for their appointments we wanted to put an end to all this and we've given the secretary of the tools to do exactly that in fact I was telling the ranking member this is called the no excuses day secretary Shulkin will have no excuses for any mistake to be made because every tool he needs in his toolbox to see to it that the Veterans Administration is responsive to the veterans the United States of America passed in this house in this Senate and passed in the house six major bills in the first seven months of this year a remarkable achievement a testimony to teamwork to staff and to the leadership of the Republican and the Democratic parties the majority minority leader of this Senate made it possible for that to happen last night and I'm eternally grateful to both of them for their support and their help I'm not going to read all the names of the staff now because I know we're in limited time but I want to enter for the record and ask unanimous consent to enter for the record every staff member that served the VA committee this year to make sure it had its best year ever and I ask unanimous consent to be made a part of the record without objection now let me close by saying this you know credits and a lot of times given to captains and to presidents and the people with titles and Senator tester and I have the titles when it comes to the VA committee but the reason the VA committee was successful in accomplishing every single goal suit set forth the beginning of the year was because of every rank-and-file member brie publican or Democrat we took our labels off we put our armor on we plowed ahead we didn't say no the problems it looked like they were too hard we said yes the solutions that look like they made sense and the veterans the United States of America I have better health care better educational benefits and a modern VA to deal with in the years ahead and I'm proud to have been a part of it and I want to commend senator tester and his effort in his contribution and I want to yield to Senator tester to make his remarks of this the senator from Montana Thank You mr. president I want to thank chairman Isaacson for his great work on the VA committee we've gotten a lot of work done in the first part of this Congress and we've gotten a lot of work done because we've communicated we haven't put up artificial barriers we've set down and we've all realized that taking care of our veterans the cost of war we need to do it and live up to the promises that this country is made to those folks when they sign out and we've done some pretty darn good work and it's not only Johnny it's not only myself it's also the people who have served on that committee many are which in the chamber right now and I want to thank them for their commitment to making sure we live up to the promises we made our veterans but it's it's it's about working together it's about talking to folks it's about compromise and it's about not digging in but but but moving together this is a great country and it was built by people working together the VA committee is a prime example of people working together we've set aside our differences we've listened to the veteran service organizations we've let them drive the bus to an extent and we've worked with secretary Shulkin and the other leaders within the VA we've been transparent we've been honest when we've disagreed we haven't embarrassed one another and and quite frankly this is the way it can work in this body when we start from a point of agreement rather than disagreement and what has happened we've got two bills already signed into law the accountability ball vid bill which holds VA employees accountable to the veterans fires bad employees protects whistleblowers the veteran Improvement Act which makes VA the prime prime payer and reduces out of FICA expenses for veterans and then bills that were passed last night to take care of the disability appeals some 470 thousand we're going to expedite that process and bring it down from three years to one year the VA is going to do that we're going to give them the tools to do that it will simplify it cut the red tape the VA choice funding fix so it'll allow the private sector to fill in the gaps where the VA can't provide health care it will help recruit retain more doctors and nurses critically important and expands the capacity in the VA which cry flanker is critically important and then the forever GI Bill which eliminates the 15 year limit breaks down educational barriers and helps veterans transfer transition into civilian life we've done some good work we've done some good work for this body we've done some good work more importantly for the veterans and we need to continue on that line is we continue to address health care and we intended to address important issues like tax reform it's about working together it's about find common common ground it's about taking everybody's opinion into context and then drafting up bills chairman Isaacson and I have done that we're going to continue to do that we've got some more tough issues to deal with over the next year and a half but we're going to work together to make sure that we do it and we do it right with help from the committee and out for the Senate we can have more successes I want to thank the chairman of the present to thank the chairman of the committee and Thank You mr. president I yield the floor

Mr. Speaker, perhaps it’s not surprising
that House Republicans haven’t put forward a budget despite passing their deadline more
than two months ago. It has been nearly 800 days since House Republicans
agreed to a budget. Hat-tip to the HuffPost’s Matt Fuller for
that fun fact. What we’re seeing is the ongoing inability of House Republicans to do their jobs. Republicans have introduced no jobs bill;
given no indication whether they will lift the debt ceiling to avoid default; and offered
no responsible spending legislation. Mr. Speaker, this is dysfunction at its worst. The American people sent us here to deliver
results—on jobs, on health care, on security. I urge my Republican colleagues to take that
responsibility seriously, and to work with Democrats to achieve progress. I know we can. And I yield back the balance of my time.

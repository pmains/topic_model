the milwaukee wisconsin america the world lost a really good man yesterday i mean a really good man and probably probably the best way to convey it to your to your listeners how good a person he was is i truly hope that everybody in your audience at some point in time meets somebody like pastor smith gets to know them gets to love them just have them be their friend um he enriched not only my life but he enriched so many people's lives and and he didn't have an easy life i mean he has so many health problems and you know the last year or two of his life and i won't get into him because we're just privacy issues but you know serious health issues and every time i talk to him you know johnson i am blessed man i am blessed praise god um again every one of us could only wish that we could have a fraction of that positive impact on other people's lives and he's just again the the uh he is a great man but an even better compliment from my standpoint is he's just a good man a good person talk about the people he did help so that the joseph project was the brainchild of pastor smith and i think maybe some people have it backward then um what was the what was his idea that launched something that you know maybe a lot of people took a look at and said that'll never work and and and then tell me why it made you think let's let's invest in this let's try to help with this well it really was kind of a serendipitous coming together of a bunch of people you know i've been traveling around wisconsin and all these opportunities and yet you have high unemployment in inner city and i'm talking to my staff about that there's got to be something can we bust people out of you know i know that's got negative commentation but what what can we do to connect people that want to change their lives with the all the all the opportunity then we had a staff member orlando owens who knew pastor smith he's a deacon in the greater praise church of god in christ and it was pastor smith and orlando's are talking about these things and the pastor smith goes well we can use my church we can use the people that i know we can use to be on my location here in the inner city and you know let's let's let's figure out how to we'll train people you know and again they put together the training program so it was definitely a collaborative effort but but pastor smith was the heart and soul of the joseph project um he just was and by the way it was named for a book written by robert woodson senior the triumphs of joseph that's how a lot of people call him a pastor joseph smith really jerome smith and we got the joseph project you know from another source but again he was the heart and soul he he was the guy who'd be taking calls from the participants at one two o'clock in the morning as they may be struggling with their their addiction problem or they're having you know problems in the home but again these are individuals who you know either formerly incarcerated or you know alcohol or drug addicts so you know people that were maybe in some cases just at rock bottom but realized that they wanted to turn their lives around and here was a man he was a church incredibly modest little church that i'm sure provides so much joy and inspiration people and it was a light people and pastor smith had a unique ability to recognize those people that truly had made that commitment you know he turned down a lot of people because he was looking for those people that really were committed to turn their lives around and they would exhibit the attitude the very do this very simple but powerful things to succeed in your life to succeed in a job you know that realize you know the attitude employers are looking for is they just want people that are willing to work hard that that recognize if they contribute to the organization they're going to have a better job of making that organization successful so they have better job opportunities the chance that a better pay better benefits um better job security you know you know we're honest it's very simple con concepts and pastor smith completely embraced them and and he was he was this spiritual leader of of this joseph project i listened to uh a podcast you had put out this was a couple of years ago and it was one of the graduate graduating classes of the joseph project they had been in their jobs for some time by the way this was connecting people with really well paying manufacturing jobs in many many cases and i remember being quite struck by a woman who said she'd never had anything better than temp work she had struggled with addiction problems she was making really good money and and made a mistake at work and thought for sure she was going to be blown out and instead because she had alerted her supervisor the mistake she ended up not too late uh not too much later after that getting a promotion on a management track and got a raise to 28 bucks an hour and she was talking about how it was the first time she could pay her utility bill she could put you know feed the kids she could actually feel stable she could afford to buy a car and i you know so it's those kinds of of intangibles i think that that never get talked about when you talk about the joseph project the intangibles of of of the dignity of a of a day's work well and and again so many joseph project participants have told me that hey my kids are proud of me now you know my mom or dad are proud of me and plus they also had the added dignity because we pointed out the only reason they were in that pew in the 50th class of joseph project is because the participants in class 1 through 49 succeeded so you have this opportunity and if you succeed you're going to benefit somebody sometime in the future somebody you don't even know you're going to have the joy and dignity knowing that something you're doing your own self-interest for your family is going to help somebody in the future as well so no it was powerful i mean it is by far the the most satisfying thing that i've been involved in as u.s senator that's that's because of pastor smith it would not it would not have happened without pastor smith and he is going to be sorely missed

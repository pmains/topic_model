I voted for Peter Roskam but not again he called climate change junk science and opposed an assault weapon ban Donald Trump's tax plan gave one trillion in tax breaks to big corporations but stalked Illinois families with the bill we need a strong check on Trump in Congress Roskam and Trump they don't stand up for us I'm John Caston and in Congress I'll work with Republicans when it helps Illinois but stand up to Donald Trump when he hurts our district I'm Shawn Caston and I approve this message

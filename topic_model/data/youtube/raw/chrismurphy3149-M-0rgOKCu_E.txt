hey it's chris murphy i'm about to try something different i am going to start walking here in voluntown connecticut i'm going to start heading west and i'm going to see how far i get over the course of the next six days the idea is to see connecticut from a different perspective to start walking on average about 20 miles a day and to try to stop into is many homes and businesses and places of work as i can to try to hear about what people care about on the ground floor of connecticut people that may never have a thought to email me or write my office or come visit me you know maybe i'll be able to get a perspective walking across the state that's different then you'd get any other way i don't know how far I'm going to get I've never tried this before but I hope that for as long as it lasts whether it be a half a day or six days that you'll follow along as I start walking east to west across the state of Connecticut

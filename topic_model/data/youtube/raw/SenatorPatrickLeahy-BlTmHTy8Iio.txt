thank you for joining us today to talk about the second chance reauthorization act but also about reducing recidivism in our prison system we address this we can help to prevent crime we can reduce prison costs we can improve and save taxpayer dollars i and i was a former prosecutor i'd consider those all worthwhile objectives in the past few decades congress and also the individual states have passed new criminal laws that bring about more and longer sentences for more crimes so we spend every year we send more people to prison but we also spend millions and millions of dollars more when we passed the second chance act four years ago we gave resources in the states we wanted to improve reentry programs that have proven and positive results preliminary studies we find these are working so i proposed a bill and i'm delighted to have my friend senator portman here to to join me as a lead co-sponsor to improve the second chance act we want to make sure funding is available for the key re-entry projects we want to make sure that states are using proven programs to reduce recidivism is to make sure that all states have the opportunity to develop and benefit from these we're trying to find of course in all areas ways to trim spending and the second chance reauthorization act that we propose consolidates a number of programs so we can do just that and we're joined by a number of officials who are uh involved in this and involved in programs within their own states to uh to cut recidivism because eventually people do come out of jail and we want to we would like to lower the necessity for them being back in there and now senator portman and i are both committed to this and we're going to i know later this year these officers others from the states are going to come together to discuss what to do so i and we'll be marking up on this tomorrow in the senate judiciary committee i can't emphasize enough i mean i i put people in prison and they deserve to be there but i also knew they're going to come out someday and i want them to come out in such a way that i wouldn't be seeing them again as a prosecutor every single police officer will tell you the exact same thing and if you haven't come out it's basically illiterates if you haven't come out without uh drug programs you haven't come out without the things to bring them out they're going to be a danger to society to themselves it'll be back in there and we the taxpayers to pay for it this is a way to make that improved i'm andy fleet on the commissioner of corrections for the vermont department of corrections uh i want to thank senator leahy for his leadership on this issue it's a issue that affects all states evenly when you have every state in the country that has set high bars and new new highs and incarceration across the country in the last decade uh the flip side of that is you have unprecedented numbers of people coming back out of jail and unless you create wrap-arounds and those sorts of things services for people who can so they can succeed and not create new victims um this isn't going to work we're just going to keep reincarcerating the same amount of people so i want to thank senator leahy and senator portman for their leadership on this bill in vermont we're trying to be creative with some of the funding that's coming out of second chance we're doing things that are we hope to set the stage nationally where we can show some promise on some emerging programs but it takes time for those things to develop

great vice chairman of the committee thanks so much mr. chairman and thank you all for being here and it's been a long day but as rock burg I think what members policymakers want to know here with the reauthorization coming at the end of the month is its some sort of basic admission that there are some challenges and running an organization right there have been discussions of indictments the IG is sitting next to you their ongoing investigations there so what would you say well I should probably let the IG answer himself but we've had one I'm a sight you and he had one indictment sir one indictment work and the person pled guilty and that came to light because another employee saw something that didn't look proper and the other investigation of the Inspector General has said at this point in the investigation none of them involve employees but you can ask him directly okay so are there any management challenges sorry by the company for 20 years every organization has management challenges but this is no different this is no different they're every organization is different but of course their management challenges we're trying to move forward or trying to be responsive to Congress responsive to exporter's work with the private sector and not compete with the private sector make sure we're competitive globally their number of those challenges get more small businesses to export so government survey of your employees at XM government employees not your employees you had the organization but they don't work for you they work for the American taxpayer only forty-two percent of XM export-import bank employees agree with the statement my organization's leaders maintain high standards of honesty and integrity said sufficient pardon me forty-two percent said that and about thirty percent had no opinion so that's fantastic is what you're telling me oh I liked about LSU maker I'm supposed to look at this and say keep going man you're doing fantastic without question sir I take this very seriously we all take the series of the bank we work and we put a much higher priority on improving the workplace environment we have at Exim Bank I'm of course I'm disappointed in those results okay some sort of admission is sort of helpful not trying to inject humility to a grown man here but I'm simply saying that that should not be in any way acceptable and there should be a firm desire to improve the standards you have within the organization you head we're giving the opportunity to say that is what I'm telling us what are the key objectives we establish because you say you know we've only had one indictment how is that a sales pitch for reauthorization of the organization you'll head up that you explained in great detail the importance of what you do and in your defense is one indictment we've only had one indictment I mean he'll the American people look at Congress and don't say well gosh they've only had one indictment wow that's good we're happy walk me through this I'd be happy to sir some some of asserted in this committee that there is one in this the organization is full of corruption when I tried to indicate this one indictment one employee the other investigations involved outside entities companies and individuals trying to defraud the government that's what I was referring to in terms of improving the workplace environment last fall we we established four objectives for the bank and what amongst the top four was making this a first-year place to work improving management development improving opportunities making this a better place to work on that working hard at that so in the same survey you have half of your employees agree or the half the employees at the words aish you had agree that if they disclose suspected violations of any law rule or regulation they will not fear actually only half say that they would not fear reprisal for that well if you look at the data star only twenty percent actually disagree with that statement not not twenty percent the employee said they actually denies ism this is like saying I'm like bragging I'm firmly middle management I'm a solid C student like this sort of this you should be making a better effort on this to acknowledge that yes there are failures that would be a helpful thing I would think I'm not trying to change your sales pitch but I'm just telling you it ain't working man it's just not working we're not buying it when you when you say that the management practices are sufficient good and just because you've raised this as a higher priority that that's sufficient we should be happy as policymakers when we look at your charter right something's got to change Tommy the gentleman has expired the chair now recognizes

now please recognize the gentleman from Illinois Mr Sorensen for five minutes thank you Mr chairman and thank you all for being here this afternoon my name is Eric Sorensen and I represent the farm families and the communities in Illinois 17th congressional district I was born in this District where farming is much more than growing crops and raising livestock it puts food on the table fuel in our cars and clothes on our backs as my fellow Illinois colleague Ms bazinski mentioned our State Illinois is the leading soybean producer and the second largest corn producer in our country that's why it's imperative that the upcoming Farm Bill preserves crop insurance programs and fortifies the supply chains that we saw break it also must include robust investment in agricultural research that focuses on improving farm and Community resilience so that we can address the challenges of resource quality and enrich productivity by growing more on less land with fewer inputs um securing these Provisions in the upcoming farm bill and ensuring that the 43.8 billion dollars in the inflation reduction act reaches our farmers and ranchers this allows us to be responsible stewards of our land uh our land our water our livestock while we Foster a thriving agricultural economy located in my district the Jacobs Brothers Farms have been in operation for three generations they raised beef cattle corn wheat soybeans and Rye sourcing parts for their farm equipment has been a challenge and also the rising costs of pesticides and fertilizer are a great concern to them Mr rosenbush and Mr LaRue what can Congress do today to strengthen our supply chains to keep costs manageable and equipment parts accessible for Farmers like the Jacobs thank you again it's a great question and we could probably spend a uh you know a big better part of the day uh talking about that but just to summarize very quickly we just again stress for uh the challenges that you uh presented as as much about making sure that there is fair um competition and access out there uh the market when you have a fully functioning and competitive market that makes sure that these laws of supply and demand that we talk about a lot here are actually working um and that we have true competition um and in the absence of that we run into all sorts of challenges that's on top of any kind of supply chain disruptions that we have so as far as actions that Congress could take right now it's ensuring um that we are doing everything possible to create that uh Fair playing field out there and then uh I would say on top of that uh you know many of the things that Mr Rosenberg talked about in terms of creating access for even more domestic access so for the sake of not repeating some of the things I've said I would just point out that um there is a piece of legislation in the Senate side that Senator Marshall has introduced to address this exact topic called the sustained act so if there's one thing Congress could do is uh I'd love for someone here in the house to pick up the companion bill here and push that forward that would make a huge impact uh my background is being the local meteorologist I talked about climate change on television such that I didn't realize that our farm families were the ones that were watching me they couldn't believe anybody out there but they could believe Eric Sorensen for this and they've come to me and they've said Eric we trust that you're going to listen because so many people in Washington don't listen to us because we know things are changing and we we want to stop the politicization of of climate how can we all come together I would take this opportunity to to again make reference to the food and agriculture climate Alliance this is an alliance that really is unique in many ways we've talked about the fact that Farmers Union is joined by Farm Bureau at that table but also with the environmental Community with the food manufacturers community and Forestry as well as many in the conservation Community have all come together many of the recommendations that we've made forward for the the upcoming Farm Bill were all consensus they were all focused on making sure that they were science based incentive-based and really where possible create new market opportunities here so if we are approaching climate with that kind of consensus and keeping a focus on the science uh I I think we would go a long way thank you Mr chairman I yield back

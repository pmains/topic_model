- My priorities in Congress
are Texas's priorities. We are red, white, and blue. We're proud of it. The wondreful thing about
running for Congress is you can make more of an impact than just national security
and counterterrorism issues. You can an impact on all fronts. Fixing the border, I
can't do that as a SEAL, but I can do it in Congress. And I know how to do it because of my experience
in the SEAL teams. And of course, national defense. That's my source of expertise. Foreign affairs, dealing with
the problems we have ahead, you know, these kind of issues cannot be solved by talking points, they really have to be solved
by people with experience, who've had the classified
briefings over the years who've been on the ground, and I think that's what the
second district deserves. You need to know that
somebody's got your back. I'm Dan Crenshaw. And I approve this message.

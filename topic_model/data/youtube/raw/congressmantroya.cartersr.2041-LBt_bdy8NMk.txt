. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE  GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED. MR. CARTER: THE COVID PANDEMIC  HAS PRODUCED A RISE IN DRUG  ABUSE, VIOLENT CRIME, AND OTHER  INDICATORS OF COLLECTIVE TRAUMA. THESE ARE PRESSING ISSUES THAT  URGENTLY NEED RESOURCES DEVOTED  TO THEM. WE MUST STOP WASTING PRECIOUS  RESOURCES ON MARIJUANA OFFENSES. LAW ENFORCEMENT SIMPLY CANNOT  AFFORD TO CHASE SMALL-TIME POT  OFFENDERS WHILE VIOLENT AND  RANDOM CRIME CONTINUES TO BE ON  THE RISE NATIONWIDE. THE ACLU REPORTS STATES WASTING  BILLIONS ANNUALLY ENFORCING  CANNABIS LAWS. THIS IS MONEY, TIME, AND EFFORT  BETTER SPENT ON INVESTING ON  TRUE COMMUNITY SAFETY. FURTHER, OVERWHELMING AMERICANS  WANT MARIJUANA REFORM. 91% REPORT THEY BELIEVE IT  SHOULD BE LEGALIZED. CONGRESS IS LONG OVERDUE IN  MARIJUANA REFORM AND  DECRIMINALIZING THIS SUBSTANCE,  BUT WE HAVE A LONG JOURNEY AHEAD TO ACHIEVE SOCIAL JUSTICE AND  CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM. THE WAR ON MARIJUANA IS A COSTLY RELIC OF THE PAST. LET'S VOTE YES TODAY SO WE CAN  BUILD A SAFER A

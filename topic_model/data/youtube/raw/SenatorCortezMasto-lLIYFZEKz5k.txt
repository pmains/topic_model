thank you thank you mr. chair for holding this hearing and I want to thank ranking member Nelson as well very excited about today's panel very excited about the subject matter this is something that I have been talking about and promoting around the halls here in Congress because Nevada is an innovation state very very excited to have this conversation today you know I have been talking about the fact that Nevada is an innovative state where the state Department of Transportation has worked to license the nation's first autonomous semi-truck where the City of Reno is a designee in the FAA s new UAS integration pilot program having just announced their first the recent first multi drone delivery of automated external defibrillators in the presence of the FAA and its other innovations in transit like our Washoe County Regional Transportation Commission which is pursuing a full range of electric buses so I am glad that version Hyperloop one is here as they have a fascinating test track in manufacturing outfit in North Las Vegas all of this plays into what I have been advocating here in the Senate for most of my tenure including my bipartisan moving first act with senators Burr and Nelson incentivizing the use of emerging technologies to develop smart communities and intelligent transportation systems which can improve safety and efficiency reduce costs cut down on pollution help us reach disadvantaged populations and much more this is something that is happening around the country and the world and I believe we should think of it as a global race here in the US places like Farmington Hills Michigan have used some smart streetlights to help manage traffic flows Nora Connecticut used a smart parking app to allow residents to see available parking in real time and in Milwaukee police are using sensors to pinpoint gunfire cutting down response times and improving safety and globally places like Grenoble in France have tested three-wheeled electric vehicles for customers to drive on the last leg of their journey into an out of the city in Mazda Abu Dhabi a similar project system works with autonomous cars and in Nevada we are helping to lead the way in all of these technologies so I look forward to this distinguished panel in the conversations today and thank you again mr. chairman for your willingness to hold the hearing today

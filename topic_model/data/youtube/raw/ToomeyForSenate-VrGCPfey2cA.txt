congressman is the obama administration doing enough to create jobs i mean i'm hearing stories from small business people across the country that credit is tight it's tough to get money to keep things going or to expand to create jobs what about all that let's give it credit for taking some good steps to stop the creation of our economy ed but no we aren't bold or aggressive enough nor do i believe that our first economic stimulus bill was bold or aggressive enough another 150 billion dollars every model showed you that we would have hundreds of thousands of less unemployed today if we had taken more aggressive measures

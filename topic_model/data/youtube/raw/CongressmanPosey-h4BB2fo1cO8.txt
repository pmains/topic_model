and ranking member lucas for holding this hearing it is important to discuss the importance of climate change research and uh the push toward lower carbon energy we all support moving to lower carbon energy and we've made a lot of progress already but it would be wrong to ignore the impact on the people we're elected to serve i'm particularly interested in hearing from the panel what they would say to senior citizens in florida living on social security about double or tripling their electric bills because of the higher costs associated with lower carbon energy the administration announced a plan to eliminate carbon emissions from the electric sector by 2035 by pushing wind solar nuclear and other lower carbon energy resources right this previous date was 2050. florida uses mostly natural gas for electric generation according to the florida municipal power agency the cost to convert natural gas to renewable energies by 2035 could increase florida's electric bill by 200 to 300 percent on an annual basis the current monthly residential electric bill in florida is 123. that's about 8 percent of the average social security recipient's monthly income by doubling or tripling over their electric bill would end up taking 18 to 25 percent of their annual income i'm concerned about moving the goal post from 2050 not available they earned an average of just uh 1 452 per month after as of december of 2019 any anyone can answer that let me take a shot at that uh let me answer it a little more generically i think there are a lot of people who will gain and some people that will lose if we do a rapid energy transmission that's in the nature of change but what shouldn't happen is that these groups and that includes for instance the coal mining communities uh be allowed to fall through the bottom of whatever safety net we have in this country and so i you know would fully endorse uh an approach that uh in fact i'll say i doubt a solution to this problem is possible unless we afford the appropriate protection to people who might be hurt and we've done so in the past electric bills to low-income families uh received support at least during the energy cri 40 years ago it's been done before to echo uh dr oppenheimer you know i i think that we can certainly move forward in an energy transition in a way that does not increase people's bills now whether or not we get all the way down to zero in the electricity sector by 2035 or say 80 to 90 of the way there i think is still a bit of an open question renewable energy is very cheap at the margins today but once you get closer to 100 uh decarbonization of the system driven by renewables you start getting much higher costs associated with the complementary technologies like battery storage and whatnot and so you know a world where we get 80 85 even 90 of the way there by 2035 while still having a fair amount of natural gas backup to fill in the gaps between intermittent generation is a much lower cost system than one where we get all the way to 100 now by 2050 the longer term decarbonization target we will hopefully have more mature alternative technologies to fill in those gaps in a cost cost-effective way and so i think we can definitely you know both decarbonize while hopefully reducing or if not reducing at least keeping costs similar to they are today for most customers and i think it's just important that we make sure we we do that the right way and there's been a number of of recent usd carbonization models that i refer to my written testimony that are very instructed there including by folks like dr chris clack and dr jesse jenkins who's testifying before you guys next week just following up on that i think ranking member lucas makes a good point about investing in more technology development you know how how can we use those new technologies to produce a cleaner energy economy that doesn't create more expensive for those that can't afford it yeah i would uh add in this discussion including uh the statement you just made um it's critical uh that uh the distributional impacts of policies are are quantified and and considered uh and that's both for for policy actions that your committee is considering as well as for the impacts of the climate changes that are happening and that cost benefits analysis is you know requires both sides of the equation and i'll just uh amplify that you know we have clear evidence that global warming is already costing americans billions of dollars a year we know from their contribution to uh climate and weather disasters that that that that's already cumulatively billions of dollars a year and then in in the impacts on economic growth uh the the those those economic impacts are even uh greater um and i'll go back to uh the chairwoman's question my time has expired and i have to yield back uh thank you madam chairman

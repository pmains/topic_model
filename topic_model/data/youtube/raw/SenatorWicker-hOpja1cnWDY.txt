i rise this afternoon to make sure that the plight of russian leader vladimir carter murza is not forgotten that the outrageous imprisonment of vladimir caramurza by the russian dictator vladimir putin is not forgotten we remember three decades ago what hope we had for a new russia russia russia entered a new age of possibility some three decades ago after more than 70 years of communist repression the soviet order had collapsed and with it the iron curtain that kept freedom away from millions was torn down as the red flag red flags came down in moscow the free world watched with anticipation hoping that democracy and the rule of law might finally take root in a free russia regrettably that has not happened instead of democracy and freedom the russian people got vladimir putin a man who has used his office to murder imprison and force into exile anyone who threatens his grip on power all the while enriching himself beyond anyone's wildest imagination while ordinary russians especially out in the countryside of russia live in squalid conditions one of his latest victims is vladimir carramorza a russian patriot and a friend i had the privilege of hosting in my office just four months ago as a matter of fact i've hosted him several times today vladimir koromorza spends his days in a prison cell where the only thing he can see through the window is a barbed wire fence what was his crime he simply spoke the truth about putin's war on ukraine his trial if it can even be called a trial was held in secret no journalists no diplomats or spectators of any kind were allowed to be there and for his offense of talking about the russian war against ukraine he now faces up to 15 years in prison this is not the first time the russian dictator has tried to silence him mr cara murza has been poisoned twice in 2015 and 2017 and almost died in both cases since then his wife and three children have had to live abroad though he himself has chosen to spend most of his time in russia in a recent interview with national review his wife evgenya explained why he insists on working in russia quote he believes that he would not have the moral right to call on people to fight if he were not sharing the same risks or as mr caramorza put it in a recent cnn interview the day of his arrest he said the biggest gift we could give the kremlin would be to just give up and run that's all they want from us what a contrast and character to the man currently running the kremlin the national review story goes on to describe mr carl morza's courageous work for democracy through the eyes of his wife evgenia as well as the costs that he and his family have endured along with so many other russian dissidents and mr president i asked unanimous consent at this point to insert the national review story that i referred to into the record without objection mr carter morris thank you mr president mr cormier's imprisonment is part of mr putin's larger assault on what remains of political freedom in russia in mr cara morris's words putin's regime has gone quote from highly authoritarian to near totalitarian almost overnight in march russian officials passed a new censorship law forbidding all criticism of mr putin's war in ukraine the law that has been the basis that law has been the basis for more than 16 000 arrests since the war began in february including that of mr caramurza another 2400 russians have been charged with administrative offenses for speaking out against the war meanwhile putin's propaganda machine is ramping up independent russian media outlets have all but vanished having been blocked shut down or forced out of the country by the kremlin the last embers of freedom in russia are going cold putin's crackdown on domestic freedom began in 2003 when mikhail horakowski was arrested on trumped-up charges of tax fraud after he simply criticized the government a former member of the elite mr hortokovsky had successfully led the ucos oil company through privatization after down iron curtain fell and contrary to the kremlin's claims the company consistently paid its taxes but that didn't stop vladimir putin from plundering its assets throwing mr hortokovsky in jail where he stayed for 10 years i would just i would note that just before his arrest mr horakowski displayed the same courage and patriotism that we now see in vladimir caramurza like mr caramarza he knew very well he could go to jail for speaking out against the government but mr hortokovsky did so anyway and refused to flee the country saying quote i would prefer to be a political prisoner rather than a political immigrant of course by then mr putin had already shown himself willing to violate the international laws of war having leveled the chechen capital of grosney in his own republic of russia in 1999. in 2008 he launched a new assault on international law with the invasion of georgia in 2014 he started a bloody war in eastern ukraine and in 2016 soviet russian dictator putin and his forces attacked the syrian city of aleppo killing hundreds of civilians and prolonging the rule of bashar al-assad meanwhile putin ramped up his attacks on domestic freedom as well in 2015 boris nemtsov leader of the democratic opposition former deputy prime minister of russia was shot to death in broad daylight just yards away from the kremlin three months later mr caramorza was poisoned for the first time more recently in 2020 alexei navalny the current leader of the opposition was himself poisoned and had to seek treatment in berlin this is vladimir putin's russia today when navalny recovered he chose to return to moscow knowing the risks and immediately upon landing he was arrested this is the deplorable state of russia and freedom under vladimir putin time and again he has shown that he is bent on stamping out the aspirations of his people for freedom and the rule of law as leader of the free world america must continue to condemn putin's lawless acts and stand in solidarity with our russian friends who are courageously fighting against all odds for a better future in russia and are suffering as a result these are modern day heroes alexei navalny vladimir carter mourism and we should not forget them my friend the distinguished senior senator from from maryland senator cardin and i along with congressman steve cohen and joe wilson are the four house and senate leaders of the helsinki commission which monitors human rights in former soviet countries we recently sent a joint letter to president biden calling on the administration to name and sanction all of those who've been involved in the arrest detention and persecution of vladimir murza i issue that call again today and i invite my colleagues from both parties to stand with vladimir murza and work for his release thank you mr president i yield the floor

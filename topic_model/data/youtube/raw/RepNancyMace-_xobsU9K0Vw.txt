guys i i we'll have you back a little bit later but i want to get the read on all of this with nancy mace the republican south carolina representative uh congresswoman very good to have you back um i do want to talk to you about infrastructure that sort of thing where are you on on that map the president was using congresswoman on on the eight to one ratio and benefits versus costs of of these uh tax credits well i'm having trouble i think they're the left certainly in the white house having trouble with some of the basic math on this deal we just saw yesterday with that 3.5 trillion dollar proposal by the biden administration it says to me the bipartisan infrastructure package that was proposed was so bad for the socialist swing of the democratic party they've got to put this package together to get the approval of socialists like bernie sanders and aoc and you're right neil about inflation and the cost of inflation with this kind of spending it'll continue to hurt the the economy i know for a tank of gas here in south carolina i'm paying almost three dollars a gallon right now significantly more today than it was seven months ago and so groceries have gone up the cost of housing has gone up all of everything that we buy today the prices have gone up significantly over the last six to seven months you know i hate to wait in the politics uh congressman but i i did catch the president saying there were no republican votes for this measure these credits uh so i said well i have a feeling this is going to be a midterm election issue on all these millions of people getting money to feed their kids you know the drill and that republicans were the greedy mean cold callous folks who said no um i think that's what he was setting the stage for but what do you make of that oh i bet and we saw last week jin saki saying republicans wanted to defund the police this is political and these are the kinds of games we should not be playing with the american people in the middle of a pandemic and i believe it's largely true the federal government helped incentivize with additional federal unemployment checks unemployment in the country south carolina itself i know for six to nine months over the last year and a half were saddled with unemployment at four to five percent not bad in the middle of a pandemic but could have been better if we didn't pay people to stay home and i think that it's very dangerous uh to set the precedent that americans are going to receive a check every month from the federal government because there is free lunch as one of your interviews interviewers said earlier somebody's going to have to pay that bill and it will not be the wealthy it'll be on the backs of everyday hard-working people that have jobs and are trying to do right by their families and themselves and their communities all right well much of this is paid for by the wealthy i mean the higher taxes for them um the president made a point of saying that that that will get them paying their fair share and corporations paying their fair share that is a moving target as you pointed out in the past congressman this idea of what his fair share um i have an idea that it might be significant higher than where we are what do you think well i would argue too that those costs will get passed down to the consumer to everyday americans because someone is going to have to pay that bill and and it will be you'll see it in inflation you'll see it in the prices the sur taxes on the wealthy and all that will be enough to cover this because the math does bear you out that that uh that alone won't pay for this let alone the three and a half trillion dollar so-called human interest no it's going to be i guess wants to debut next week right no i believe it's going to trickle down to everybody who has a job in this country they will pay significantly more in taxes whether that's through their paycheck or through the groceries that they buy at the grocery store or their gas they're they're filling up their cars with every every week they'll feel the pain

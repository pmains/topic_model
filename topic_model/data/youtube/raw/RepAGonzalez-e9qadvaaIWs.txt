thank you I want to thank ranking member Lucas chairwoman Johnson my colleagues in this committee and committee staff from both sides of the aisle for their input in writing this legislation and for allowing for its full consideration I urge my colleagues to support my legislation the identifying outputs of generative adversarial networks act a bit of a tongue twister as we were all trying to pronounce it but to direct research on the underlying technology used to produce deep fakes the IEEE ogen Act will allow us to develop much-needed tools to identify authentic videos voice reproduction or photos generated by deep fakes defects are not a new phenomenon I assume most of you have seen the movie Forrest Gump that's one of my favorites of all time if you'll have you'll remember some of the famous scenes where Forrest Gump was filmed shaking hands with various presidents was fighting in Vietnam and all sorts of different things throughout the video at the time the technique was was revolutionary and it was incredibly expensive and difficult to reproduce to the point that really only big Hollywood studios with massive budgets could afford to produce deep fakes with such images so fast forward a few decades later after Forrest Gump and we now live in a world where advances in technology and computing power have increased exponentially this increase in power has enabled techniques like Ganz to be developed making defects easier and cheaper than ever to be produced and disseminated on the Internet our techniques to produce defects are constantly improving and has made it extremely difficult to distinguish between fact and fiction experts say that eventually techniques will get so refined that deep fakes will be indistinguishable from real recordings pictures or videos given the national security and societal implications that deep fakes can pose for our country my legislation directs the NSF and consultation with other federal agencies to conduct research on the science and ethics of deep fakes this includes fundamental research on digital forensic tools and social and behavioral research on the human engagement with the networks my bill also directs NIST to support research for the development of measurements and standards necessary to accelerate the advance of the technological tools to examine the function and outputs of any type of defect technology the legislation also directs and a Stephanus to jointly submit a report on the feasibility of research opportunities through public-private partnerships the goal here is to identify new emerging technologies that could produce defects by using different techniques the report shall also provide Congress with any recommendations that could facilitate and improve the communication and coordination between the private sector and federal agencies to devise innovative techniques and detection of defects finally I would like to add that the ability to identify and label deep fake content is critical to preventing foreign actors or terrorist organisations from using manipulated media to influence US public opinion I'm proud to see the IO Connect addressing the needs to educate and train a new type of workforce in digital forensics which will be a profession that will be in greater demand for many years to come one of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle likes to say if we're gonna be divided gosh dang it it better be with real information and among Americans while that is you know who I'm talking about and I I share that and so this this bill my hope is will be a factor in making sure that the content that's being produced and presented into our public discourse is genuine and real I also want to take the time to thank representative Stevens Baird and Katie Hill for their support with that I urge my colleagues to support HR 4355 and I yield back

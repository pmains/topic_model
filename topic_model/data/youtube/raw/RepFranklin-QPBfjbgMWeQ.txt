happy to yield so much time as he may use the gentleman from florida mr franklin i appreciate my colleague from louisiana giving me some time to talk about this vitally critical matter mr speaker today i rise in support of our border agents who work tirelessly to defend our nation against the flow of deadly drugs crossing our southern border their job is made incredibly more difficult by the bide administration's open border policies i'm sometimes asked why as a floridian i care so deeply about what is happening on our southern border whether it's criminals terrorists human traffickers or drug smugglers problems at the texas new mexico arizona and california borders quickly become problems for all americans florida may be hundreds of miles from the border but illegal drugs from there are flooding our communities the tampa bay area my home has an overdose rate that is 50 percent higher than the national average to put that figure in context 30 people in the tampa bay area are dying every week from overdoses let that sink in the lion's share of these overdoses are from fentanyl this highly lethal drug primarily manufactured in china and smuggled in by mexican cartels is many times stronger than heroin morphine and other opioids as little as two milligrams smaller than the tip of a pencil which you can see right here in perspective relative to a penny is often enough to kill an adult fentanyl overdoses are now the number one killer of adults age 18 to 45. this is a national tragedy it's exasperating to see the hands of our agents tied as they try to stop this crisis because their own government stands in their way as one frustrated border agent told his chief in a recently leaked video for evil to triumph as for good men to do nothing mr speaker the biden administration is doing worse than nothing it is actively promoting an open border policy that allows dangerous drugs to flow into our communities this administration has the blood of its citizens on its hands for the safety and security of our nation it must stop and i yield back you

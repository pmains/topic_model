Senator Cassidy thank you first I want to thank Senator Braun for putting this up he shows a lot more concern for the retirement savings for the average American worker then does the administration and there's a certain irony here since they always build themselves as actually caring about the person who's struggling people are going to struggle more because of this Rule and so we'll have a vote on this policy and keep in mind there's a 152 million Americans potentially affected by this potentially will have a poor retirement because of this rule this ESG rule that only pursues an ideological agenda of the left it does not pursue optimal returns for the American looking at their retirement now for Louisiana Energy workers I'm particularly concerned about them of course I have the privilege of representing them this weaponizes their retirement accounts against both their future but also their present it would say for those of you who are out there producing the natural gas the natural gas that not only fuels our economy but is helping Europeans push off Russia's kind of economic blackmail your Louisiana workers who are producing the natural gas that has helped our country lower its emissions and absolute amounts to less than 2005. oh you Louisiana worker we're going to take your retirement funds we're going to weaponize it and we're going to work against your livelihood not just your retirement not just your future but your present you're now the job you're holding the the responsibility of an asset manager should be maximizing returns period full stop because her goal his goal should be that the retirement of the American who places their trust in them would be to optimize that retirement and I will repeat not to pursue an ecological and ideological agenda that not only hurts their future but hurts their president thank you

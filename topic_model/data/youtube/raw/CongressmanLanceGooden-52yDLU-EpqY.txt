bring in Republican Congressman Lee it's good and congressman it's good to have you here thanks for having me so your state of Texas you just issued this order that's gonna close bars restaurants schools gyms April 1st we're seeing this across the country we've seen it in New York already is this enough do you think to stop the spread not just in Texas but across the nation well I think it's a great first step governor Abbott our Texas governor has been on top of this he just announced in the last hour that the state is basically shutting down effective midnight tomorrow some of our larger cities had already done that but the rural areas what kind of waiting to see what he was going to do and so Texas is moving in that direction I think this is a great step to contain and flatten out the curve but I think what the president's doing is is everything that needs to be doing he's managing assets he is working with Congress in ways that he's never worked with Congress I'm hearing conversations with my colleagues Republican colleagues and Democratic colleagues that there's a willingness that has never existed before to work together and get the country back up and moving once we defeat this virus Congress obviously is looking at fiscal stimulus measures fiscal stimulus measures excuse me that can be put out to help Americans right now get checks and other hands talking about a trillion dollar plan that the White House has floated Treasury secretary minuchin the Treasury secretary saying that it's most important they get to small businesses they get to individuals do you have a limit in your mind of how much you're willing to see Washington spend as we deal with the coronavirus up right well you know my my my limits last week were tested I voted against phase two not because I was against the bill but because there were things in it that I was told would be fixed I had not read the bill we were given 30 minutes to read it phase 3 which is the big one which we're talking a trillion dollars at this point before this coronavirus existed I would have never my wildest dreams imagined even considering something like this do you worry about the debt the federal deficit is that of course but if there is no economy then that's going to be the least of our worries I think we are in waters that we've never been in before and this is a massive crisis that this country has never experienced and worse worse yet we don't know when it's going to end and so I think you'll see a pretty large proposal that gets by partisans this next week three major airlines operate out of your state you've got Southwest there you've got United although that's not their headquarters they've got a large operation down there you sooner than you've got of course American Airlines which is based out of DFW they want fifty billion dollars that is the discussion that's being had right now but these would be loans not grants do you think the American taxpayer should help out America's Airlines right now we cannot afford to lose our airlines and the president has even said just in the last few hours that he was ok with regulating their ability to buy back stock that's something that Elizabeth Warren was talking about and the fact that the president has come out in the last few hours and said he is ok with those strings attached to any funds that we give the airlines whether it's alone or whatever the fact that he's saying those I think is just indicative of the times we're in the willingness to work across the aisle and accept things that we perhaps wouldn't have dreamed of yeah we've heard that a lot from your colleagues on on both sides of the aisle let's talk about real quick hospitals ers medical centers these ships that are being moved onto each Coast to help with more beds more treatment for maybe not coronavirus patients but just sick patients right what is the situation in Texas right now are your hospitals ready for what could be an influx of these patients I I don't know that they're ready but they're getting ready and Palestine Texas one of the cities I represent they said they were just a few days short of running out of hand sanitizer which just seems outrageous to me obviously the ventilator situations bad I received just in the last 24 hours a call from someone that has the ability to immediately make hand sanitizer they they made liquor at one point they said they could start making hand sanitizer today but because of the red tape they were a little hesitant I told them just get going and we'll work through the red tape the president has said with the recent declarations he's made that we're we're not going to be going crazy with these regulations we want people if they have the capability of making medical supplies to do that I think Texas hospitals will be ready but we are all aware that the the cases are coming and it's going to get worse before it gets better well congressman we certainly hope so we're watching the great state of Texas the nation as well thank you sir we appreciate it thank you

democratic leader ms pelosi gentlelady from california is recognized for one minute thank you mr speaker i thank the gentleman for yielding i want to call to the attention of all of our colleagues and those who follow the work of congress extraordinary contribution that congressman and now ranking member chris van hollen has made to this debate he has led our members on the democratic members on the budget committee in a way that reflects the values of our country how we can meet the needs of our children their health their education the economic security of their families the when people ask me what are the three most important issues facing the congress they always say the same thing our children our children our children and the issues that are addressed in the budget address the needs of our children them directly and the families in which they live i was watched with great pride the debate and the strong this distinction that has been made between a values-based values-based budget put forth by the democrats and that supports a thriving middle class and the ryan republican tea party budget that upholds millionaires over the middle class we're here today because the republicans in the house have decided over and over again to walk away from bipartisan bicameral agreement that we we reach to avert economic crisis and to reduce our deficit and to honor the full faith and credit of the united states of america they're walking away from and punishing the middle class because they refuse to close even one special interest tax loophole reduce our deficit they're putting big oil and millionaires ahead of america's middle income families in recent weeks house republicans have voted twice not once but twice here we go again in the words of a great republican president to be who voted twice to pass a budget that gives a mass that gives massive tax breaks to the wealthiest americans while ending the medicare guarantee and increasing cost for seniors in the meantime that is an absolute fact today republicans are voting to begin implementing their out of touch budget middle class people seniors women and children will pay the price consider these few things i know that the members of the committee have made the case but i just want to focus on a few things that affect people very directly in their lives this republican ryan tea party budget will assault women's health by eliminating the prevention fund 326 000 women would not get the breast cancer screening they are slated to receive next year 248 000 women would not get the cervical cancer screenings they are slated to receive next year those are big numbers but every individual case is important to the families that those women live in so when the numbers are staggering but the specific cases are what is important and this is hundreds of thousands it would harm children this budget and seniors literally taking food out of the mouths of babies as nearly three hundred thousand children would lose free or reduced cost uh school uh meal three hundred thousand kids wait a minute we're gonna have a four hundred thousand dollar tax cut to people making over a million dollars a year and we're going to take food from 300 000 children to do that 1.7 million seniors would lose meals on wheels people are familiar with that in their neighborhoods in their communities and and other services put wall street ahead of the middle class and working families by weakening the consumer financial protection bureau in the wall street reform bill we not only had the biggest changes in regulations so that the recklessness on wall street would no longer cause joblessness on main street the recklessness of some i don't paint everyone with the same bra the recklessness of some on wall street would not create again massive joblessness on main street and in that same legislation and that was they were the biggest regulation changes in a long time decades but the biggest change in history was in the consumer financial protection bureau this budget weakens consumer protection that's just not right so here we are again with the republican budget to name a few in contrast to this draconian republican bill democrats are fighting for a balanced approach creates jobs expands opportunity reduces the deficit protects the health and economic security of america's families that honors the entrepreneurial spirit of america republicans are focused on obstruction rather than solutions americans have rejected republican obstructionism and made it clear over and over again we might work together to find solutions because this legislation will have a devastating impact it's opposed by numerous organizations from easter seals to national women's law center the u.s conference of catholic bishops and voices for of america's for america's children as the obama administration wrote in expressing their strong opposition to this bill the bill's unbalanced provisions failed the test of fairness and shared responsibility the same time as the house is advancing tax cuts that benefit the most fortunate americans this legislation would impose deep budget cuts that cost jobs hurt the middle class and vulnerable americans especially seniors veterans and children mr speaker instead of the slash and burn approach let's come together in a bipartisan way in a balanced way to cut our deficit by growing the economy creating growth creating jobs bringing in revenue to reduce the deficit to make the priority choices that reflect the values of our country the values of fairness and opportunity of sustaining a thriving middle class for the middle class and all who aspire to it it is the backbone of our democracy for that reason i urge my colleagues to vote no on this devastating bill and yield back the balance of my time generally yields back her time

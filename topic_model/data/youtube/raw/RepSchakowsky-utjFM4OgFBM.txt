hi it's congresswoman jan chakowski back with my plans and pans well after uh after a very disturbing friday and and so much concern um afterwards of the decision of the what i call a rogue supreme court i spent the day sunday at the pride parade it was such a happy event in chicago back after a few years where we weren't able to do it because of covid and i don't know how many people were there but it seemed like millions like the largest ever and i had a ball i was riding in a rickshaw that was driven side by side i could actually touch people and cheer cheer with them and what we're cheering of course is the celebration of lgbt gay rights um it's so it's so fantastic um and i was so proud of all the people that were there and there were families and old people and young people everybody celebrating that right and celebrating just being together and feeling powerful and happy in the city of chicago but of course it was a very difficult week you know at at first um you know i wasn't surprised i'm sure you weren't that the court had decided to overturn roe um the decision that was announced to end the access to abortions in the united states of america had been forecast by a draft of the opinion that was released some time ago and the final decision that was made is very very much like it essentially it does leave to the states the ability to have their own laws about abortion rights and it is expected that it may be as many as 26 states more than half the states in the in the country that will either eliminate or severely limit abortion rights many have done that already in my view i think in the view of i know in the view of most americans the vast majority of whom think that roe v wade should not have been overturned and and so this court went against the view of the american people and i know because before roe i was well aware i was around of course and i remember friends and hearing stories about about women who had harrowing experiences trying to get an abortion and i know that some people died and let's be clear roe v wade was not the beginning of women having abortions it was the end of women dying from abortions and there is no question that because of this decision women will die you know and it's not the end clarence thomas uh said something in uh in his support of overturning roe v wade and limiting abortion rights he also said that we should do more that in the united states of america we should prohibit contraception think of that um and um same-sex marriage yeah he wants to go further um to to limit people's rights and i see abortion rights as the fundamental right because if you cannot control your own body then you can't plan your life and this is a very very bad decision the president of the united states made a very strong and really passionate statement opposing what was done and i was really happy that he said this decision is not the final word you can be you can have the final word he was speaking to the american people he said that congress could act and you know that the house of representatives has already passed a bill that would essentially codify abortion rights that were in roe v wade the senate had a vote that failed but we know already we have 48 votes in the in the senate and so the solution to this problem may only be months away i'm talking about the november election everyone should vote should vote your opinion on this because roe v wade abortion rights will be on the ballot um and if we make sure that there are enough people in the house and the senate then we can even end the and the filibuster and uh we could be on our way toward having the senate endorse um the freedom to to to have an abortion so it may not be long in the future this fight is not over and we are seeing a tsunami of people women and men coming out and saying no we are not going back um and so um i at the end of the day as really not only disappointed but sad for women who have gone in now even for appointments that they had and been told them turned away the other thing you should know is that governor pritzker called for a special session of the illinois general assembly they're going to gather soon it may be very soon to to have a a session to decide how illinois which is it is a safe haven abortions are legal in illinois we're one of the best states in terms of those laws in the country and we believe that women all over the country will be rushing to illinois so they're going to meet to discuss how illinois can be helpful to women outside of illinois also wanted to talk to you about gun violence and you know that the um we were able to pass legislation in the house of of representatives after the senate already acted which was great i do want to mention that the supreme court the day before the bad abortion decision also made it easier for and for guns to be available in the city of new york making it clear that this supreme court is more interested in gun rights than in human rights and women's rights but this the legislation i think i told you last week but let me just briefly go over that one of the things that it does is have a red flag law which says that law enforcement can make sure that people who could be of harm to themselves and others and are adjudicated in that way cannot have access to guns there is also the boyfriend loophole that we closed you know we already had a law that said that if spouses have been convicted of domestic violence that guns can be taken away but now the boyfriend leupold says if there's a relationship and a threat um to uh or or adjudication of um domestic violence that that gun from that individual can also be taken away um we also and i think this is very important for chicago and for illinois cracking down on straw purchases and on trafficking of weapons because most of the weapons used in gun assaults and murders are from guns that come from out of state this will be very very important one shocking statistic that i learned about gun violence is that over the last two decades more school children have died because of being shot by guns then on duty policemen and active duty military think of that and of course i told you already last week that the number one killer of children in the united states of america is from a gun and i mean that that is more than cancer or car accidents or any other cause gun violence is killing our children and not to mention um aside from the mass shootings just everyday shootings that we see unfortunately on our streets in our in the chicago area and surrounding surrounding communities i also um wanted to talk to you about price gouging you know we talk about and hear about inflation and yes it's a problem prices are going up but you know the american people aren't stupid over 70 percent of americans have said that they believe that the reason is for the high prices of price of gas is that the big oil companies are over charging that they are gouging them and we absolutely have proof the top five oil companies um you know who who they are were talking about um shell and exxon mobil and bp and chevron have raised their prices in the first three months of 2022 by 300 percent over the first three months of last year and we also know that they have made profits um the these these companies have made record um profits over over that time and actually the global ceo of bp has stated that um bp is a money machine when oil prices are high now this isn't because their costs have gone up it is not it is because they made a decision they made a decision then rather to produce more more oil that they would not only raise their profits they would give more to their shareholders they would do more um stock buybacks which is buying their own stock back um making making more money and raising the uh wages of the the the ceos the house of representatives actually passed the price gouging prevention act i will point out that not a single republican ended up voting for that bill it passed the house but the senate has not acted but most americans vast majority of americans would like to see republicans and democrats by the way would like to see a windfall profits tax and it has been such a bill has been introduced we need to move that forward and you know we want to encourage the the white house to call upon the oil companies to reduce their prices for ordinary americans you know the amount of money that the oil companies made over the over the last year has that that amount of increased profit accounts for about 26 of what all customers have spent on gasoline in the united states of america so we would definitely see those uh those uh prices go down if we were able to stop the price gouging you know i've been working for years now actually about three years to finally get legislation to protect online consumer privacy this is something that americans really want the vast majority of americans feel very insecure online about the safety of their data as well they should so in in this last week we had what we call a markup that's where you put bill into language so that it can be voted on and that happened in my consumer protection subcommittee and i'm very excited that it was unanimous that we had bipartisan support to uh to to get that done it was it was really fantastic um and what that means is that we're going to create a secure feeling for everyone that goes online that you control your data you can't it can't be shared with any third party without your permission you can delete you can move it you can corrupt it you will not be forced into take it or leave at agreements i've always hated the idea that if i want to buy something you get to the end of the road and they say well in order to get that product that you want you have to allow for cookies which means that they can collect your data and sell it to a data broker we take that power away from the companies and we pretty much eliminate data brokers all together this is going to be a much safer environment and particularly for children we have done a lot to protect children from harm online which does occur and we raise the age of children that are protected from age 13 to 17. so we are really looking forward to that bill now going going from subcommittee to the full energy and commerce committee to the floor of the house and then getting passed in the senate yes it's a process but uh it is time you know other countries the european union and even states like california have already started moved ahead of us in protecting consumer data and consumers online and now we're going to be doing that and holding the big tech companies accountable we are tired of all the uh the the promises um and actually the lies that we've heard and now we're going to have it in law data privacy will become a reality and the january 6 committee continues to do its work it's really been remarkable the kind of information that has has has been revealed things that we didn't know before the kind of really vicious attacks on innocent people that were working at the polls you may have seen the attack on a couple of these poll workers this uh this woman and her and her mother who did nothing more than try and assure the accuracy of elections donald trump mentioned this woman a black woman and her and her mother who had worked at the polls had mentioned their names over and over death threats came this one woman said her life had actually been destroyed by this kind of harassment that she had people her mother was afraid to ever go outside it was dangerous the speaker of the house in arizona gave really dramatic testimony talking the kind of pressure that he got from the you know from president trump and from everyone around him rudy giuliani to say that he would change the vote that he would help make it a fact a lie into a fact that donald trump had won the election there he said that he would not do it it was the constitution and his faith that said he would not comply um and and and it went on and on and there is more to come you know donald trump who at first said yes the republican should not participate in the committee is now saying it was a mistake and he's right because the witnesses that they have called have uh by and large been republicans who are showing the um the activities of the the white house under trump but also the complicity of some of the republican members of congress in the ninth uh the the january sixth insurrection so um more to come um and we are interested in seeing the other information and seeing what the follow-up will be in terms of accountability um and uh and and finally let me talk about covid so this last week there were um 5 568 new cases and 22 deaths which is more than i've actually been reporting of of late i know that uh one of my grandchildren just uh called me this week and um said that they had covered um and had to you know stay stay home which is a drag because they have roommates so that's an issue and but the big news really is still that the vaccine for kids as young as six months old is now available i heard a report that not too many people have been taking advantage of of that from six months to six years kids are available and are eligible and there has been no evidence of any of the side effects that could be harmful so that's my report for for this week have a a wonderful summer so far the the weather has been quite beautiful in the in the chicago area and i will see you next week thank you

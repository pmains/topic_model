you're recognized for five minutes great thank you thank you um i'm chairwoman for holding this important hearing i always wanted to preface everything we say we want to get to the same goal a reduction of global carbon emissions um i want to get there in a smart way without destroying our economy and um i think the solutions we offer are generally a faster way to get there to be perfectly honest um i want to talk about i want to actually follow up on on what mr armstrong was was talking about mr skelly uh you authored a report on 22 transmission projects that are ready to go and even met with senior members of the administration to discuss building them however projects are on the shovel ready list have been on the list for a decade plus how many of the 22 projects are active and have experienced more than five years of delay um i would say yeah they've been well the list is a new list so they haven't been on the same list but they've been underway for uh at least a decade on average okay and uh there's a few reasons why they haven't moved forward one is permanent delays uh the other is failures in the cost allocation process that we that we talked about a little bit a little while ago um and that's in other words a failure to consider all the benefits of transmission and the other is a failure of the system to uh basically reward some of the merchant developers for the additional services that they provide so one of the things we see of course is um weaponization of the court system i mean talking about cardinal hickory creek maybe i'll move to the miss aspie for this since since you're y'all are in charge of this one um what why is that facing uh delays is it eminent domain permitting financing political will or is it mired in lawsuits yeah it's uh it's facing uh delay based on pending litigation uh which is essentially an appeal uh parties who are opposed to the project are appealing um the process um by which it it it went through for several years do you think mission projects are going to face similar litigation um and that would be a barrier to rolling out new transmission especially well over 120 additional new transmission which is what our fellows at princeton seem to believe would be necessary to meet our goals yeah there certainly is a history um of many major transmission projects being delayed uh through the through litigation um you know and obviously as we've talked about before i mean time time is of the essence um if we want to realize the benefits both in terms of integrating renewables the reliability the resiliency benefits um and so time is of the essence and these projects in and of itself even when everything goes as planned and well can take you know anywhere from seven to ten years to realize which is far too long and like this is the this is the broader point i'm trying to make here step two is is paying for this stuff and building it step one is actually allowing ourselves to to build it uh if we don't address the permitting issues in this country which are far more stringent than most developed nations we're never going to get to the part where we build 120 more transmission lines in america we're never going to get to that point there's no point in allocating around three trillion dollars to do this if it's just going to be weaponized by the courts and weaponized by invention environmental groups i'd ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to consider this your clean energy goals are directly in conflict with the environmental groups as well because they're the ones who sue and settle that the law has to be changed there's a lot of examples of this uh in 2011 president obama created the rapid response team for transmission to speed the permitting of five western transmission line projects only one is under construction so far only one the law needs to be changed a proposed 300-mile electricity line to deliver renewable electricity from idaho to oregon commence permitting in 2010 if federal agencies can't find a way forward on more than 30 federal and 50 state and local permitting actions and another 100 water crossing approvals then i want to get to another broader point which is is this even the right approach to try and build use build massive amounts and take up massive amounts of lands for wind and solar in places where the sun shines and in places where the wind blows build out massive amounts of infrastructure and transmission lines to get that to where we need it is that really even the right approach maybe we should rethink this we can build for that amount of money countless nuclear plants the nuclear plant by the way operates on a thousand acres versus the same power of of a solar farm that operates on a hundred 000 acres and the nuclear plant doesn't rely on weather guys you know i i want us to rethink how we approach the problem that we all want to solve thank you rep crenshaw

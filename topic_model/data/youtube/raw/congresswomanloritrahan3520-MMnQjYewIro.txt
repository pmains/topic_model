one good afternoon i'm congresswoman lori trahan and i want to thank you for joining today's telephone town hall on the covid 19 pandemic i'm thrilled to be joined by three incredible guests our lieutenant governor here in massachusetts karen polito small business administration regional administrator wendell davis and ceo and president of lawrence general hospital debra wilson before i welcome our lieutenant governor to share the latest actions that she and governor baker are taking to protect us here in the commonwealth i'd like to just take a couple of minutes to provide a brief overview of what we're doing in washington but also of the toll covid 19 has taken across our nation uh and the steps at the federal level that we're providing uh to our communities this week we passed a tragic milestone more than one million people have tested positive for covert 19 nationwide and sadly more than 61 000 people have died in massachusetts we've lost nearly 3 500 residents already each with a story a family and a future residents and staff at our nursing homes are especially vulnerable governor baker noted the other day that approximately half of the commonwealth's covid19 related deaths have been nursing home residents this is something we're seeing across the nation as well it's an urgent issue and we'll get into it more specifically during the q a but i want to thank the lieutenant governor and secretary sutters for their focus on keeping residents and health care workers safe including mandatory testing staffing support and national guard intervention when necessary this pandemic has taken an unprecedented toll on our livelihoods as well the number of folks who are bearing the brunt of the economic crisis caused by this disease continues to grow earlier today we received the updated unemployment numbers 3.8 million people filed for unemployment in just this past week bringing the total number of unemployment applicants since mid-march to 30 million including 893 000 folks right here in massachusetts that's 24 of our state's entire workforce behind each of these numbers is a story a moving story of hardship and struggle of workers and small business owners doing their part to slow the spread of this virus and to keep our communities safe i know it's been a long hard seven weeks but our actions they save lives that's why it's more important now than ever that we continue listening to the scientists to the expert our heroes fighting on the front lines are relying on us to do our part so that they can continue saving lives as we continue to navigate this pandemic together it's important for you to know that congress what congress has done to deliver relief to workers to families and to small business owners over the course of the past two months we've passed four emergency bills totaling approximately 2.7 trillion dollars to provide immediate support to our families and small businesses but as also to our hospitals our first responders our cities and towns and research institutions to improve testing and hopefully develop a vaccine soon in brief the first 8.3 billion dollar investment the coronavirus preparedness and response act provided a quick injection of support for our health care providers and our state and local health boards then we passed the family's first coronavirus response act which provided paid leave to workers food assistance for our children who rely on school meals but weren't in school buildings funding for wheels on meals on wheels and our food banks and ensured free coronavirus testing for anyone who needs it the third package passed last month was the cares act this historic 2.2 trillion dollar legislation is the largest funding package ever passed by congress and it contained a number of important provisions that have helped families all across massachusetts including direct cash payments of up to twelve hundred dollars per person and five hundred dollars per dependent child to more than 150 million households for workers laid off or furloughed because of provide 19 the cares act provided enhanced unemployment benefits totaling four months of full pay on average and for the first time the cares act made self-employed and gig economy workers eligible for unemployment under a new federally funded program for small businesses and nonprofits the cares act created the paycheck protection program you'll hear about that a lot tonight we'll refer to it as ppp this 349 billion dollar program provides loans of up to 10 million dollars to keep workers on payroll and it included another 10 billion dollars for small business administration grants of up to ten thousand dollars to provide immediate relief to small businesses trying to cover their operating costs and finally last week i was back in washington to support the paycheck protection program and health care enhancement act an emergency interim funding package which provided 75 billion dollars in assistance to our hospitals covering corona virus related expenses and continue treating patients 25 billion dollars to establish a national strategic testing plan and dramatically expand americans access to covet 19 testing 310 billion dollars to replenish the ppp with 60 billion dollars set aside to serve the most vulnerable and traditionally underserved small businesses in our communities and 60 billion dollars for the sba's economic injury disaster loan program 10 billion of which will be used to replenish idol's grant program for small businesses these are all important steps but the american people absolutely need more help and we are ready to work we are already excuse me at work on the next relief package as we continue those negotiations we must prioritize assistance to our heroes fighting coven 19 on the front line our state and our local governments our emergency workers and first responders as well as our families who need urgent assistance to stay afloat during this tough time we will get through this crisis but we must ensure that no one is left behind i want to take a moment to commend you all for staying informed as your representative one of my top priorities is making sure that you have access to the information you need to keep yourself and your family safe and healthy your presence on this call is a testament to your commitment to doing your part to slow the spread of this virus and to keep our heroes our neighbors and loved ones safe so thank you now i'd like to introduce lieutenant governor karen polito who will be providing us with an important update on what the administration is doing to get us through this pandemic the state of massachusetts has been a leader in its investment in testing and contact tracing so that we have confidence that our health and safety will be protected as we look toward reopening our economy and establishing guidelines for our new normal the lieutenant governor has been hard at work in the command center coordinating the state's efforts on acquiring and producing ppe updating protocols for our emergency workers and where i last saw her just a couple weeks ago standing up a field hospital for the merrimack valley on the campus of umass lowell i'm so grateful that she's able to join us lieutenant governor karen polito thank you so much congresswoman trahan for inviting me to be here for a few minutes with you our friends at the sba and our friends at lawrence general hospital and others who may join the call i understand this is your fifth call engaging with residents and families and individuals who you have the honor and are so proud to represent in washington and they are uh very appreciative i'm sure of your hard work and your effort doing an extraordinary job to make sure that massachusetts and your your district your congressional district gets its its fair share of the resource needed to combat the epidemic and also to support people as they have to navigate through it i just want to start with uh just an acknowledgement how how hard this is for everyone to live through i'm sure for you on the call who are listening uh it's it's great that you will take in the information maybe it'll help you or a family member or a friend uh but it's also really important to to sometimes just step away from this and to go out and take a walk when it's nice uh do something that really makes you happy to try to understand the the normal cadence of life as well as the mother of two children and i know uh congresswoman you you have to balance the same i have a a 16 year old son and a 14 year old girl who are at home uh trying to study and do their work and stay connected with their friends uh but i look forward to at night having my dinners with them more so than i i have in the in the recent past with this this job and i'm sure yours too laurie uh a walk late night with my husband and our dog and some netflix uh programming that my daughter and i enjoy uh settling down to uh some nights in fact the governor at his press event today talked about a movie that he recently watched and he he shared it he said called the biggest little farm and he described it being an hour and a half program that he i think he saw on hulu or something and it just gave him such joy to take a few minutes just to kind of refresh so having said that i wanted to start with an update to build on what the congresswoman talked about in our efforts day to day here in the commonwealth first and foremost we acknowledge and appreciate the front line we all know people who are police officers firefighters emergency responders doctors nurses personal care attendants they're all our heroes they are essential and they get up and go to their jobs and literally are coming into contact with more people than we might in our own day-to-day movements and they come in contact with people who have been identified as positive uh with the with the virus and they come in contact with people who are asymptomatic and without the virus that could make them susceptible uh to the illness and susceptible not only themselves but to their families so that's why when we talk about ppe which is called personal protective equipment it's really important that we work with our federal government and with private companies that are working really hard even right in your area you have 99 degrees that changed her workforce to make some of this equipment and you look at new balance and lawrence and they're making faith coverings we've been able to distribute over 7.1 million pieces of this protective equipment for our front line even the craft family was able to take uh a plane and bring mass from china back here so those efforts continue and they will be part of sort of the word wardrobe and the uniform that our front line will need to wear for for a long time to come testing is also one of our assets the reason we do the testing is because we want to be able to identify people who have the virus so that we can talk with them about isolating so that we reduce the spread and then we also have what's called contact tracing which we are leading an effort on here in the commonwealth where you can talk to the people that that person has come into contact with and ask them to isolate we know that these are proven methods given other pandemics that have occurred in places in epidemics in other places around the world and we really need to continue our testing in our tracing methodology methods in massachusetts we have had an a sort of a plateauing of cases which is is really good so the testing tells us who's positive and then we can track those cases and we are plateauing however yesterday we had our highest number of deaths reported uh that are coveted in nature and every single one 252 individuals has a family member or friend and is a loss to all of us in this commonwealth uh in lowell and lawrence lawrence you have 1 649 confirmed cases lawrence 1 639 cases and those are the ones that we know about i want to thank everyone on the call uh you know that social socially distancing yourself from others has become a normal part of our life now and that's because this is an a virus that is asymptomatic that there are people that are carrying it that don't know they're carrying it so the face coverings that we're asking people to wear when they go out of their home and they're not able to have a six foot distance from someone else whether you're in the grocery store or pharmacy or wherever you you go to if you have something you need to do you have to wear the face covering because you don't know if you have the virus you want to protect others from you and others need to make sure that they're protecting you from whatever they might be carrying so really important you'll be hearing our administration talk more about uh the essential nature of faith coverings as we move forward so i also want to thank global general in all of their counterparts across massachusetts for your hospital capacity we have 18 300 beds available statewide now i want to talk about that for just a moment because we've pretty much emptied out our hospitals think about it the kinds of treatments that people might have been going to the hospital for could have been a shoulder or a knee replacement those were called elective surgeries that have been stopped to allow for that bed to be available to someone who's really sick from maybe a stroke or a cardiac issue or because they have the covet illness that became so hard for them to deal with they needed to be admitted as a patient to a hospital so that bed capacity is available but 53 of those beds are empty which tells us that we are flattening that curve that we did not see a surge in a spike in hospitalizations that would have put more people at risk that's a good thing i do want a message though for you who are listening that if you have an illness and you think about you're thinking about putting it off because you're afraid to go to a hospital i want to discourage your thinking in that way if you have an illness that needs to be treated you need to talk to your doctor and you need to go to a hospital if that's the case or someone that you know to get the treatment and support that you need that's why we built that extra capacity in nursing homes we all know that that is a the most heartbreaking and heart-wrenching part of all of this because more older people and people that have underlying health conditions uh have have succumbed to this virus that's why we've had to pour in additional monies uh starting off 130 million we just added another 130 million dollars to care for residents of our nursing homes long-term care facilities ramping up these funds will allow us to test everyone staff and residents make sure that they have that ppe that protective equipment to be able to do their work ramp up staffing that means more nurses more cnas national guard deployed to help uh our nursing homes and also work through crisis management and infection control so you'll continue to see us ramp up our our support as well as expand our approaches you know we have nursing facilities that are totally be totally serving uh covert 19 older residents we have wings in nursing homes just for covert positive residents so we have developed new strategies around this and we are deploying them more so and rigorously throughout our commonwealth to protect our older residents there let me just uh pivot to unemployment i know the congresswoman uh talked a little about this and it is staggering uh the numbers that have surfaced because of the lack of people to remain employed uh 24 percent now of our uh once employed of our working population uh 24 are now on unemployment here in massachusetts so we've been able to process a lot of these applications we're paying benefits to over 400 000 people and because of the system we've been able to set up we've been able to now process the pandemic unemployment assistance for those individuals that were not contributing to the unemployment assistance program so someone that's like an independent contractor or self-employed or someone who works in one of those positions as a an uber driver or in a gig economy position they can now access unemployment that's a completely new benefit that didn't exist uh before this uh coven 19 time period and so far uh the system has received over 150 000 of this kind of of application and we paid out half a billion dollars in benefits to those people who have applied and these benefits include an extra 600 per week allotment from the cares act that the congresswoman talked about so we'll continue to serve this need as long as that need exists i talked a little about um before i go to that i do want to just acknowledge that i am co-chairing an effort around the reopening of our economy in massachusetts uh this has got to be done with the public health advisors telling us that the data shows that it's the time is is safer to be able to reopen but then we need a whole bunch of rules associated with what becomes a safer workplace in a covered world so we need to make sure that workplaces when they do reopen uh have the necessary measures in place like being able to have social distancing having hand sanitizers having a sanitization system better than ever making sure that there are protective coverings for workers and that customers enter stores with protective covering so there's a whole new layer of safety that will be built into workplaces when we have that time period come that we can start to reopen so that effort is actually underway being analyzed and being developed so more to come there contact tracing i talked a little about that earlier i just want to highlight that for one one half a minute and that is because there are a lot of people who are now known as contact tracers and they're making phone calls to people who have come in contact with someone affected so if you get a call like this from an 833 or an 857 number and it says math coded team that is an official call you should answer it and and provide the information so that we can help keep more people safe in the commonwealth uh thank you again uh all of you uh you know fema fba uh congresswoman and all your counterparts down in washington for what you do i just want to final uh finalize the call with uh some text alerts that you might like if you text 888 777 covid m a two eight eight eight seven seven seven you can get text alerts from our administration or coveted a e f t two eight eight seven seven seven spanish alerts the nursing 617-660-5399 and with any questions you have in massachusetts that we could help give you some resource around uh 2-1-1 can be dialed i think that the rest of it i pretty much covered and i just want to close out with uh thank you for doing your part around social distancing provide you yourself or others with face covering they don't have to be the n95 mask we want those reserved for the front line for the people that are doing all that great work for us so any face covering uh helps there is uh that's really important that we just sort of make that part of your wardrobe uh when you're going out i think that's just gonna be the way of life uh for all of us as we move forward and uh finally uh just you know find those moments along the way that make you happy um and balance out uh this extraordinary time that we are in and please be reassured that your your state leadership your governor uh me uh our work with the legislature and i work with uh great leaders like congresswoman trahan we will get through this that's who we are and i just wish you all you know good health and to be safe at this time thank you so much for a little bit of time with you this afternoon thank you i appreciate that lieutenant governor it was such a an important and comprehensive update and i know we all benefited from hearing it i know you have to jump off the call for another commitment but i just wanted to say on behalf of all of us the panelists and all the listeners uh thank you for taking the time to participate in this afternoon's call um so i am going to move on to our uh to our other panelists who have been patiently waiting uh they are star panelists today they'll be they'll be answering uh so many of the questions that you've submitted our first guest is uh wendell davis who serves as as the small business administration's regional administrator for new england wendell has served as regional administrator for our region since january 2018 and he's worked for 15 years to provide service excellence to our small businesses throughout massachusetts and frankly all of new england uh we're fortunate that he's able to join us to answer your questions on the more than 720 billion dollars in loans and grants aimed at providing a lifeline to our small businesses and our second panelist is deb wilson who leads the life-saving efforts at lawrence general hospital as president and ceo deb has been with lawrence general for nine years and took over as president and ceo in february but she's been a leader in health care since 1995 and we're so lucky to have her with us today to discuss uh the surge here in our region and the actions she and her colleagues are taking to protect us so i want to thank both of you uh for taking the time from your hectic schedule and i am going to get right to the questions uh because i'm mindful of the clock and you know as with our previous four teletown halls we receive so many questions through our submission portal we do our best to select uh the questions that are representative of your concerns and we'll answer as many tonight as possible and if we don't get to yours please call our office at 978-459-0101 978-459-0101 we are here to help our team is working around the clock to get you the information the services and the assistance that you need during this trying time so without further ado wendell our first question is for you it's from stefan b in concord he asks here in massachusetts third how many small business administration ppp loans have been approved uh funded how many applications have been submitted do you know of a bank that is approving new borrowers yeah thank you congresswoman tran and thank you for this opportunity and you know after listening to your opening remarks and the lieutenant governor's remarks i mean you're just reminded of how important these conversations are and i i do appreciate the again the opportunity to speak with you folks um with respect to the numbers let me let me just start on monday because monday we kicked off round two of the additional funding and and quite frankly there were a lot of hiccups on monday and i like to refer to them as hiccups because hiccups eventually go away and and the product i think the hiccups were a product of two things one there was a concerted effort to make sure that all banks had equal footing going into a monday because there was this pent-up demand and this pent-up applications that were going into banks and and the sba knew that so they put in some restrictions on banks that they could only put in so many applications per hour and coupled that with the the volume that we got hit with on monday so round one was unprecedented unprecedented for the sba in terms of volume monday doubled anything that we experienced through that round one so it was a there were some hiccups on monday i'm happy to report that tuesday was better than monday wednesday was better than tuesday and today is even better than those three days and all those emails i received on monday we learned i am not aware of any banks right now or lenders in new england that have a backlog that they that they need to deal with so that's the good news from that in terms of the overall numbers i was hoping i keep looking at my computer i was hoping i'd get current numbers today but i haven't received them yet but from this go around again just round two as of yesterday we were we're up to 90 billion dollars and 960 000 applications so we're we're over 100 billion now we're over a million applications and i think one of the some of the data points that i did get and i really enjoyed these numbers and because there was this concern that the larger banks were going to get the lion's share and and of that 90 billion so far let me give you these numbers the the sba has kind of separated out three different classifications for banks they have the large lenders which are lenders with 50 billion in assets or more the medium size which is 10 billion to 50 billion and then the smaller banks are 10 billion and under of those three categories the small banks under 10 billion in assets they did 43 billion of the initial 90 billion in application approvals the medium-sized banks did 21 billion and then the larger banks did 26 billion during that same time period from monday to today and i think that that that is good news because we want to make sure and i know your office and your team has been hyper focused on making sure the smallest of the small get access to these funds and and i know just yesterday last night the sba took took action to even open up and give access again to the smallest of the small uh between i think it was either four or five o'clock to midnight last night only banks with one billion in assets or lower and lenders with one billion in assets or lower were able to put in applications last night so the sba created a window uh to make sure that we are reaching those folks that i know you know you and your leadership you've been hyper emphasizing and making sure that was the case so those that's the good news one other figure i'd like to give you and this is based upon round one and again just a little bit of perspective in a good year a typical year for the sba in massachusetts they the massachusetts district office would would do about 350 million in loans and they would help out about 2 000 small businesses on any given year with their flagship our our flagship 7a program and that 12 and a half days under round one it wasn't 350 million it was 10.3 billion dollars hit the streets of massachusetts and went into and benefited small businesses throughout massachusetts and instead of the typical 2000 small businesses that we impact with our 7a program over the course of an entire year 47 000 small businesses received loans for the round one of the ppp in massachusetts alone they're really really incredible fee an accomplishment to get that money on the streets in an expedited fashion and i thank you for your leadership and and helping with that well thank you wendell it's uh it is great to hear that nearly half of the the uh 90 billion from this second round has gone to our our smaller banks and i i appreciate you sharing those numbers with us so deb carol b wants to know now that the number of new cases each day has plateaued and we're starting to come back uh from a surge to our hospitals are they seeing that they have enough supplies ventilators etc to treat patients and similar question that i'll put in um as you as you uh craft your response from aj can you speak to what is being done to prepare massachusetts hospitals and to support and protect our front line medical workers sure thank you so much for inviting me to the call congresswoman trahan i'm very happy to join you today and communicate with your constituents many of whom i know rely on lawrence general hospital for their care so i think the hospitals have done a tremendous job preparing across the state for the surge and surge capacity and supplies have been a major area of focus and throughout the district hospitals have expanded their intensive care units and staffing and supplies for example as you know because you've helped us with this to prepare for a surge we ordered new ventilators and monitors and many different types of supplies in great number we also tapped into the state's resources and asked for and received additional ventilators and testing equipment and testing capacity your district in massachusetts is fortunate to have a number of hospitals and elected leaders who have come together and worked as a region to obtain equitable supplies including ppe and ventilators and at lawrence general hospital we are in a good position because of all this support and preparation work as you mentioned we are plateauing and while there is some modest variation in our volume of admissions for covid19 the patients are very sick and we are at a high level though although we're plateauing so we have about 20 new inpatient admissions a day for covid19 on average and approximately 80 to 90 cobit positive or presumptive positive inpatients daily right now so although it's plateauing it's it's still at a high level so we in all the hospitals in the state prepared for this surge and fortunately we have not needed every bed and every ventilator as lieutenant governor polita polito had mentioned but all of these preparations the teamwork the governor's stay-at-home decision together with the hospital staff have provided us with the capacity to care for our patients we have prepared effectively and very well in massachusetts i'd also just like to report we're very excited that we just received approval to use the recently approved drug remder that dr fauci and the national institute of health announced yesterday is the gold standard for certain patients with covid19 so we're very excited about that opportunity on behalf of our patients we are also enrolled in the fda investigative program using convalescent plasma from patients that have recovered from covid19 to treat patients that are severely ill and it is presumed that the antibodies to the sars cov2 virus present in the plasma of these recovered patients will help our acutely ill patients fight the infection so that's um in terms of your first question i think that the state did an excellent job the support we received from all of you in this district really put us in a good position to be able to handle the increased volume from these very sick covert 19 patients in terms of preparing our workforce the support and safety of our frontline workers has been a top priority very early on we quickly put screening and visitor restrictions in place to prevent the spread and the transformation of the hospitals to care for covert 19 patients required working with staff to care for patients very differently it included education and support in properly dawning and doffing ppe and believe me i i did it the other day to round and it it's actually quite a process and the team has been adopting new team approaches to care and support such as having more doctors in-house and teams to care for patients we also decided to expand our occupational health teams to be available to staff seven days a week they have been tremendous in supporting our staff and being available as the staff does have questions and concerns about their own potential exposure we are very sensitive to the emotional toll that caring for such seriously ill patients in a pandemic can be mindfulness and self-care is so critical we are currently rolling out programs for leaders and staff to help manage stress strengthen resilience remain compassionate maintain a constructive focus and trying to stay positive our staff is working in a highly stressful environment while they also worry about their families back home and the hospital provides daily communication emotional support chaplain rounding child care connections and housing when necessary we also started victory celebrations cheering our patients that are being discharged home to recovery and those experiences are are wonderful it's been heartwarming to see the support for our departments among each other everyone is really coming together sending pictures of gratitude gifts of meals and so many signs of support and appreciation and and very important to us is the community outpouring it's meant so much to our staff we have a staff person that actually has to work full-time to coordinate all of the community food and financial donations that are coming in and this demonstration of caring connection is so critical and helpful at this time so uh that's really the highlights of how we're trying to support our our front line workers and all of our staff during this pandemic well thank you deb uh so one it's so exciting to hear um uh that lawrence general is on the forefront uh especially with uh you know rem de severe and uh and the the optimism we have around that but we're i know we'll be talking about therapies and treatments and testing uh in uh in questions this uh in this hour so uh and also know that it is um the community does band around our heroes i mean when you talk about wellness and mental health and you know we all uh are doing what we can to adjust to this new normal but what our heroes are enduring is unimaginable for so many of us so uh yes we will we will keep those donations and that love and that acknowledgement going to those folks who are getting getting up and going to work each day and facing this uh this virus head-on thank you for all that i'll uh i'll take this next one because it's uh it's from elaine m in chelmsford and she asks since under the current administration states seem to be left to fend for themselves in this pandemic do you know of any plans to bring manufacturing of ppe and other disaster related supplies back into massachusetts or new england through a state consortium so for those of you who have been part of our previous teletown halls you've probably heard me say this before the shortage of ppe and medical supplies for our health care and emergency workers you know and what's considered the wealthiest country in the world is just unconscionable in order to treat patients and protect our frontline workers states and hospitals you know they've been locked in a bidding war competing for scarce equipment as case as cases uh have multiplied by uh the hour in the beginning of this epidemic in the absence of decisive leadership uh and action from this administration you know my office has actively worked with so many uh patriotic manufacturers uh in the district and in massachusetts to repurpose their facilities to produce ppe or other critical medical supplies and lieutenant governor mentioned a few of them across our district and the commonwealth we've seen companies step up and join us in the fight uh holagik which is a marlboro-based company was primarily focused on women's health became one of the earliest manufacturers to receive emergency authorization from the fda to produce kovid 19 diagnostic test kits which are being used all over the country today in in chelmsford zole medical pivoted their manufacturing focus to meet the increasing demand for ventilators uh building capacity to produce up to ten thousand ventilators per month and uh and as lieutenant governor said new balance is manufacturing face masks on the line that once produced sneakers the cares act provided a billion dollars for the defense production act which the president has still to this day not fully utilized but um like you i believe that we must force this issue at scale an effective response to any pandemic requires a wartime footing this country is still in the beginning of this pandemic and we must reinforce our domestic manufacturing supply chain for everything from ppe to critical medical devices testing kits and components as well as the eventual production of a vaccine it's why i drafted legislation called the pandemic production act which will allow the federal government to partner with industry the way we do for our national defense we would never rely on a shipment to pull into port from another country to protect our homeland or our troops and we should never repeat the mistakes made in combating uh this virus the pandemic production act would create good manufacturing jobs at home it would keep our economy strong and viable and will help us combat future viral outbreaks and you know i do believe that this issue is a matter of urgent national interest and i have no higher priority than making sure our communities are protected in both good times and in bad so i appreciate the question elaine okay wendell uh you're up for those of us who have submitted applications for idle loans but haven't heard anything yet do you have any advice or guidance is there any assistance forthcoming from the sba to help uh to help process these requests that's from claire s uh in acton yeah great question the idol the economic injury disaster loan program is a is a sister program along with the ppp that the sba is administrating the idle program is one that you it's a it's a whole separate office called the oda the office of disaster assistance and and these are the folks that uh that go in after for example the tennessee tornadoes uh uh the hurricanes irma and maria uh and harvey and so they have existing staff it's a little bit frustrating for us in the field and i know bob nelson is on is on the call he's the district director in massachusetts because we're so used to having that relationship with our community banks and our lenders and and when something goes wrong we we get to jump in and we have answers for small businesses and our relationships with the lenders and and with this we don't have a lot of visibility they have their own communications team uh they have their own portal that we don't have access to so we're left with getting those you know speaking with these folks because guess what they're in our backyard they're in our neighborhoods and then we have to send it off to the oda for response and and that's not always forthcoming and it's and there have been delays and that's been frustrating even for the field offices with that being said i can tell you that the the funds did run out very quickly that the demand was unprecedented just like it is for ppp uh they have been stepping up uh continuously from day one trying to meet that demand and and i know this last legislation they were just refunded or the additional funds were provided so that spigot so to speak is back on bob and i are seeing those loans get processed and we're seeing the closings occur and and the money get on the streets but it's definitely been slow we acknowledge that and i'm hopeful now that the money uh the funding is there that we're going to see that pace pick up great thank you and uh and we'll make sure that uh in those release packages it's needed that we uh that we continue um uh funding that those programs deb matt why from chelmsford writes with this question lately i've been hearing a lot about antibody tests and that they're becoming available in massachusetts starting this week what is the status of the antibody testing and plans for wider testing of the massachusetts population so antibody testing also called serologic testing became available in massachusetts last week quest diagnostics is doing it antibody testing looks for the presence of antibodies which are specific proteins found in the blood and made in response to infections antibodies detected in the blood indicate that a person has had an immune response to covid19 whether symptoms developed from having the infection or even if the infection was asymptomatic and the presence of antibodies to cover 19 are indicative of a prior infection there are still many unanswered questions with regards to antibody testing and therefore lgh has not yet implemented its widespread use but the potential roles for antibody testing in the future might include to monitor the prevalence of exposure to the virus in the community to identify health care workers evidence of an immune response to identify people in a workforce or in a specific living situation like a nursing home with evidence of an immune response or to test for convalescent plasma for treatment of patients with an active disease it's important to note though that a negative antibody test may not exclude prior infection and it is yet to be determined if a positive antibody test will indicate protection against reinfection so the cdc in public health are in initial stages of studies about this community transmission of coven 19 and antibody testing is promising in a very important next step in learning how to protect all of us oh thank you so much there's no question that testing is going to become a part of our our lives in the near future so i appreciate your uh your insight on that uh the next question is for me it comes from christopher b in westford he asks what are the corvid 19 infection and death rates at nursing homes and long term facilities throughout massachusetts how many such facilities are there and how many have not provided this data do any refuse to provide it and then as a follow-up there was a we received lots of inquiries on life care center of neshoba valley in particular kathleen f from littleton wants to know what is being done to test staff from life care center of nashoba valley and determine where they have been in our community and going forward how are you protecting our communities from the spread of the virus so this pandemic has absolutely highlighted the importance of nursing homes having robust plans for emergency emergency preparedness and infectious disease control and even in scenarios where nursing homes do everything right a highly contagious and dangerous disease like covid19 puts our skilled nursing and assisted living facilities at high risk as hot spots i'm sure many of you are familiar with the outbreak in kirkland washington's life care center back in february it tragically claimed over 40 lives and it was a clear indication of the foreboding damage that this outbreak would have on residents living in nursing homes or senior facilities in our state approximately half of the 3 500 deaths from covid19 have occurred among residents and staff of these facilities which is why my office is in close contact with the 69 facilities in our district and the mass command center has prioritized these 734 facilities across the commonwealth as they monitor you know potential hot spots they update protocols they dispatch mobile testing units and intervene when necessary you know i became involved in the case at the life care center of neshoba valley when local officials made us aware of the number of emergency calls made to the facility by the fire department and emts patients at the facility were being sent to area hospitals because they needed treatment they needed ventilators and then maria crier a nurse there subsequently blew the whistle on what she perceived to be unsafe conditions for workers and patients alike at the facility so we quickly alerted state officials federal officials at cms and requested that the national guard dispatch to the facility to test staff and residents urgent common sense steps that anyone would take but that life care unfortunately had not uh as many of you know maria passed away earlier this month and at least 16 residents of that facility have passed away as well and the tragedy at life care center wasn't you know out of the blue as i said back in february another uh home in their network in in washington became a covid 19 hot spot and this uh this was very early on in the crisis so you know i believe that an alarm should have gone off to ensure that the networks other facilities were ready and that public health officials were on the lookout for those signs uh which is why i joined senators markey and warren in requesting that cms which is their governing or regulatory agency enacts additional oversight measures to protect staff and residents at life care centers and other senior senior living facilities from cloven 19. you know during this pandemic transparency and accountability is crucial to saving lives and safeguarding our healthcare heroes and you know you just listening to deb describe how uh you know you prepare for the worst and then everybody does their part to help mitigate or prevent that surge on the hospital that's what we need we need cooperation in these times of crisis so um that's what we're going to continue uh demanding uh from from all of our partners and i appreciate those those important questions okay i'm looking at the clock wendell we have another question for you this one is about ppp loan forgiveness and before reading it i i'd just like to preface the question with the fact that ppp is a lifesaver for so many of our small businesses and i greatly appreciate the fact that the sba has had to stand up this brand new 660 billion dollar program so quickly sba has essentially had to build the plane uh while you're flying it and you've also issued a great deal of guidance that tackles most of the big questions around ppp you know you and your team have been incredibly responsive even as you know we've been helping our small businesses navigate this program i'm grateful uh for that but this question from kathleen p of lowell is one that we've heard over and over again and we just haven't been able to get a direct answer thus far so here it goes kathleen is a small business owner she like others has been told by her lenders that her loan forgiveness for ppp will be based on whether she rehires by june 30th every full-time employee she had on staff before covid19 they've heard that if they take out a ppp loan that is which is insufficient which excuse me which is sufficient to hire back just a few of their employees for the forgivable period of the loan and they properly use at least 75 percent for qualified payroll they will still not have the eight-week loan for entirely forgiven due to the fact that they will not be able to rehire by june 30th every full-time employee who was on staff before kovit19 hit can you just spend a little bit of time clarifying whether or not this is a correct reading of the ppp program yeah i hope this clarifies it but clearly the paycheck protection program is all about payroll and it's all about employees and the goal is to make sure that whatever loan you do get 75 percent of that goes to payroll so you know there's other uh authorized uses like rent and mortgage interest and utilities but if if you use it all for rent and you don't hit that 75 percent then you know it's going to be reduced and one thing that's important is that 75 threshold when i first saw that i was concerned that is not a cliff that is going to be a proportionate reduction and it won't be a clip so if you are 74 you're not going to lose all of the forgiveness uh with that being said we're still awaiting the guidance on specifically what that formula is going to be uh but when when you look at it let's say you know you take out a loan and ultimately and this this is happening you cannot hire everybody back there's no requirement that you hire everybody back and you're able to hire x amount employees back whatever amount is devoted to payroll that's going to be forgiven and that the only question is the residual so if you only hire back 50 percent of those people and the loan was based upon a hundred percent that you were hoping to get back to the extent that portion isn't used for payroll then it converts to a loan and you do have the ability at that point to pay that back and there's no penalty to pay it back uh so i hope that answers the question in part that there is there is this little bit of um i don't want to call a strategy but you don't know exactly right now because you don't know the response from the employees the other thing too that i'm seeing a lot of confusion around as i speak to folks is that that they're worried that hey we don't have work because of the shelter in place rules i'd love to hire somebody back but there's no work for them to do and it's kind of counter-intuitive for a small business owner to say why you know i'm not going to hire them back when there's no work and and part of the the sba recognizes and the treasury department recognizes and part of the the rules are that you know because we recognize that we understand because of the shelter-in-place rules you may not be able to hire them back but we want to maintain that structure we want to maintain that relationship between the employer and the employee so you can pay them as long as it's part of that payroll or payroll expense you're allowed to do that even if they're not doing work so i hope that clarifies some of the questions that are out there absolutely i appreciate you going uh in in into depth on that uh and you know we're um uh while there hasn't been uh clear you know guidance uh you know we we absolutely look forward uh to you know as though as that information you know becomes you know very black and white that we can pass that on to uh to um to our small business owners but i i appreciate you uh you digging into to that uh this next one is and i you know we might go a couple minutes over uh tonight only because we did have a uh a chock full of talent on our panel tonight but uh deb this question is so important uh when might people be able to resume uh medical appointments uh procedures like biopsies that procedures that are currently considered elective um this is from tammy g in haverhill sure so let me just start by saying we are looking forward to resuming operations and our team is meeting regularly to ensure that we when we reopen it is done with the patient's needs put first it is very complex as you might imagine but we are going to work closely with the state and i know lieutenant governor polito is spearheading this so we need to evaluate many factors in resuming these elective procedures and medical appointments but let me emphasize that if anyone listening has a medical problem please don't hesitate to contact your doctor or in an emergency come to the hospital our medical teams are practicing strict social distancing and precautions at our campus and you can also take advantage of the availability of telehealth appointments so do not delay care consult your physician so considerations for us to resume elective medical appointments includes our ability to manage patient care with adequate staff equipment and space so today the hospital expanded its capacity to care for sick covid19 patients for example we have doubled our critical care capacity and expanded other inpatient capacity and in order to do that we redeployed staff from other settings to assist with this care that is why we were able to provide crisis care so successfully for this community during the pandemic but as the number of acutely ill coven 19 patients declines we will use criteria to prioritize opening up medical care and we will determine in what order to resume our elective procedures that are so important to everyone we are actively working on the plan and right now the guidance is that through may may 18th we will maintain the full restrictions but we have a team that's very focused on getting back to normal hospital services and we look forward to delivering that important care and we will do it as soon as possible and as safe as possible for all our staff and patients oh great uh thank you so much deb uh for that uh and thank you both you know i i was hoping we could squeeze in a few more questions because we have so many great ones but sadly that's all the time we have for today i'm very mindful that uh wendell and deb have very demanding full-time jobs and i'm going to let them get back to it but i want to thank our lieutenant governor and our expert panelists wendell davis and deb wilson one more time for taking the time out of their schedules to join us uh you all are such important voices on the issues that so many in our community are dealing with on a daily basis and your insight has just been incredibly valuable and i want to thank everyone for dialing in this afternoon and for committing yourself to staying informed you know for an easy way to stay updated on the federal and state response as well as information on future teletown halls and events please always follow us on facebook twitter instagram it's at rep lori trahan you can also visit my website at trahan.house.gov covid19 for important resources on how to keep yourself and your family safe as we continue to navigate this new normal i want you all to know that you're not alone the past seven weeks have been hard and all of us are feeling the weight of this stress on our bodies and on our minds the weather's getting warmer patience is wearing thin in my home it's getting increasingly difficult to explain to my young girls why they still can't hug their grandparents or play with friends but i can't say it enough these next couple of weeks are so important our heroes like deb wilson and everyone at lawrence general hospital continue to fight on the front lines of this crisis every day to keep us safe they're they're our health care workers certainly but there are first responders our grocery store workers our pharmacists our child care workers gas station attendants uh gosh our public transit employees our mail carriers custodial staff the list goes on and on and they're relying on us to continue doing our part just as much as we're relying on them to do theirs we've begun to flatten that curve but we're not out of the woods yet and every day that we do our part to slow the spread of covet 1919 is one day closer to safely reopening our state so please stay the course keep doing what you're doing stay home as much as you can keep washing your hands disinfecting frequently touch surfaces if you have to go out in public be responsible wear that mask and maintain a safe social distance from others and if you're wondering what that distance is i tell my girls it's at least one mummy or a laurie trahan of space between you and others most importantly take the time to check in with each other virtually or by phone we will all get through this together we know that i want to thank you all again and please stay safe and stay healthy good night

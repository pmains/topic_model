congressman adam schiff is a democrat of california he's a member of the january 6 committee which is set to hold its third hearing tomorrow he previously served as the lead impeachment manager for donald trump's first impeachment good to have you on congressman this has been a difficult story to pin down it's something that i was always very careful about in our reporting because the what seemed to be the accusations being leveled by democratic members of congress uh were very serious um we now have some evidence on the record what what do we know can you just establish what we know that you have publicly shared so we can pin this down well what we've shared is the footage just a part of which you just displayed uh you know other parts of that same person doing the narration of that same person who was apparently on that tour with representative loudermilk uh is talking in a threatening way about what he's gonna do to nancy pelosi and jerry nadler and a couple of my other colleagues uh and you know what makes it uh so concerning uh you know in addition to the fact that uh you know this is basically threatening uh the lives or well-being of members of congress is that you have these denials these emphatic denials by representative louder milk uh by representative rodney davis uh as well saying there were no tours they looked at the footage uh and of course now we see that there there is a tour of the the the complex here and very you know what appears on the film at least to be suspicious activity taking photos of stairwells which are not a tourist attraction uh appearing to take photos of uh you know security checkpoint at least one checkpoint and and so it's all the more baffling this is the reason we wanted this representative to come in we wanted to discuss this uh with him and of course he is refused yeah i mean it's a very strange situation the u.s capitol police chief thomas um manger i think is is that how it's pronounced um uh he wrote a letter to rodney davis uh who's the house administration committee ranking member saying that we train our officers of being alert for people conducting surveillance or reconnaissance and we do not consider any of the activities we observed as suspicious uh that's their point on it again it's all a little hard to tell without context i'm just looking at closed you know uh circuit security footage but i just want to make sure the committee has established or believes they have established that that individual that we heard basically threatening to violently assault members of congress um was on that tour the day before you know that is uh our belief based on the evidence that we've seen uh now uh if uh mr latimer wants to come in and say that's not so or demonstrate uh but but the evidence that we have i think is pretty clear uh you know we do want to talk with them and and make sure there's no confusion here uh i think all of us on the site committee find uh that letter from the capitol police to be utterly baffling uh and if that you know if those images don't appear suspicious or if they didn't make the connection uh that we have we want to know why uh and we hope that uh it's not uh a lack of diligence on their part yeah i mean i i think again i'm straining here to maintain i mean i have strained to maintain sort of healthy skepticism throughout this entire trajectory of this story partly because it's such a right i mean the worst version of it right is that a member of congress essentially colluding with people that are going to you know sabotage the capital by essentially using abusing their role as a member of congress to give this sort of special access to people fundamentally attempting reconnaissance right that's the worst possible interpretation of events the exculpatory version i guess from the congressman would be hey i give constituents tours i don't control what they do the next day but it does seem like he could just explain that on you know under your invitation right i mean he could just testify yes i mean that's exactly right um we gave him the opportunity we've given him the opportunity repeatedly we've you know re-upped the opportunity for him to come in and talk with us uh to to hear what his explanation is why he first denied giving a tour that admitted giving it to her uh denied that it was you know basically anything other than a family with small children um and you know uh we would like to hear his explanation uh and why uh there seems to have been this effort to dissemble about it final question since i have you here i'm working on my google calendar for the next few weeks are these hearings not going to go past next week can i get some clarity on that i can't get clarity i got three kids i got to figure out my schedule here what's going on you know i'm not at liberty to to uh release information about the committee schedule we release it uh you know as as soon as uh we were required to under the rules um but uh look there were more hearings to come i think that the evidence continues to mount that donald trump not only lost the election knew he lost lied about it continued lying about it raised money off those lies and those lies have continued to put our country at grave risk so a lot more to come from uh where where you know you've seen the other evidence today yeah i'm looking forward to mr jacob and mr ludwig tomorrow congressman adam schiff thank you very much thank you

  POLICE OFFICER, KNOCKING HER  UNCONSCIOUS. CONGRESSMAN ADAM KINZINGER IS  THE OTHER REPUBLICAN ON THE  COMMITTEE AND HE JOINS US NOW. GOOD MORNING TO YOU.  >> GOOD MORNING.  >> I THINK THE OPENING QUESTION  NEEDS TO BE WHAT WAS THE  COMMITTEE TRYING TO GET DONE  LAST NIGHT AND FROM WHERE YOU  SIT DID THEY ACCOMPLISH IT? >> WELL, I THINK WE ACCOMPLISHED IT AND OUR GOAL WAS -- IT WAS  BOTH TO -- YOU KNOW, IT HAS  BEEN -- IT'S BEEN OVER A YEAR  SINCE THE ATTACK. IT'S EASY TO MOVE ON. WE NEED TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF  IT. IT'S TO REMIND PEOPLE OF THE  TRUTH OF WHAT HAPPENED. THERE'S SO MUCH LIES AND  MISINFORMATION OUT THERE. BUT THEN IT'S TO LAY OUT THE TOP LINES OF OUR CASE. OUR CASE OF WHY WE BELIEVE  DONALD TRUMP IS RESPONSIBLE. HE LIT THE FLAME. HE SUMMONED THE MOB, AS LIZ  SAID, AND WHY WE STILL CONTINUE  TO THINK THIS IS A THREAT, THERE IS A THREAT TO DEMOCRACY. THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING, EVEN MORE THAN ACCOUNTABILITY  OUT OF THIS IS FOR THE AMERICAN  PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS  COULD STILL BE A PROBLEM. DEMOCRACY IS NOT SAFE UNLESS WE  AGREE TO FOLLOW A CERTAIN SET OF STANDARDS. I THINK WE DID THAT YESTERDAY  AND WE'RE GOING TO DRILL INTO  THAT A LOT MORE OVER THE NEXT  COUPLE OF WEEKS.  >> YOU'RE RIGHT. DEMOCRACY IS NOT SAFE. THERE'S AMAZING POLLING FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO SHOWING  THAT 21 MILLION AMERICANS DON'T  BELIEVE PRESIDENT BIDEN IS A  LEGITIMATELY ELECTED PRESIDENT  AND SUPPORT THE IDEA OF VIOLENCE IN REMOVING HIM. DO YOU THINK WHAT YOU DID LAST  NIGHT SPOKE TO THAT DANGEROUS  POPULATION IN THIS COUNTRY? >> I DON'T KNOW. AND WE'LL SEE WHEN THIS SETTLES  IN I THINK WHEN WE'RE THROUGH  THE HEARINGS, WHAT PART OF THIS  PART HAS SOAKED INTO THAT PART  OF THE POPULATION THAT HAS BEEN  PROTECTED FROM THE TRUTH, THAT  HAS BEEN ABUSED AND TAKEN  ADVANTAGE OF, FUND RAISED OFF OF BASED ON A LIE, THEY'VE BEEN  TURNED INTO A FEARFUL POPULATION BY PEOPLE THAT THEY TRUST THAT  LIE TO THEM. WE'LL SEE IF THAT CHANGES THAT. WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT TO ME AT  THIS MOMENT IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF AMERICANS  UNDERSTAND THAT THE COUNTRY IS  AT THREAT AND EVENTUALLY, LOOK,  HISTORY IS GOING TO POINT BACK. LIZ SAID IT WELL WITH HER  DISHONOR IS FOREVER LINE. HISTORY IS GOING TO JUDGE THIS  TIME AND IT'S GOING TO -- PEOPLE ARE PICKING SIDES RIGHT NOW ON  WHAT SIDE OF HISTORY THEY WANT  TO BE JUDGED ON. >> CONGRESSMAN, LET ME JUMP OFF  ON YOUR COMMENT THERE AND TONY'S QUESTION. THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE IN YOUR  PARTY WHO ARE CRITICAL OF THIS  PROCESS. THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE IN THE  REPUBLICAN PARTY WHO CONTINUE TO THIS DAY TO SUGGEST THAT THERE  WAS FRAUD IN THE 2020 ELECTION. WHAT WE SAW FROM CONGRESSWOMAN  CHENEY IS A -- THE FACT THAT  THERE HAVE BEEN MEMBERS OF  FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S PARTY,  OFFICIALS, CABINET MEMBERS, WHO  HAVE ALL TESTIFIED THAT THEY  KNOW THAT THIS WAS A LIE,  INCLUDING THE PRESIDENT OF THE  UNITED STATES, THEN PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES HIMSELF. HE KNEW THAT THOSE ALLEGATIONS  WERE -- THAT HE WAS LYING. WHAT ARE YOUR CONCLUSIONS TO  DRAW ON THAT? >> SO THIS IS SOMETHING, AGAIN,  WE'RE GOING TO FLUSH OUT OVER  THE NEXT FEW WEEKS. WE KNOW, BUT WE WANT TO PRESENT  IT IN THE RIGHT WAY. I THINK IT IS SO OBVIOUS, LOOK,  IF THE PRESIDENT TRULY BELIEVED  THE ELECTION WAS STOLEN, HE'S  NOT CAPABLE OF BEING PRESIDENT. EVERY PIECE OF EVIDENCE SHOWN TO HIM, DONE BY ANYBODY THAT IS  SERIOUS BESIDES WACKOS ON THE  INTERNET SAID THAT THE ELECTION  WAS LEGITIMATE AND HE WAS  ELECTED PRESIDENT. WHAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE IS HOW  QUICKLY A CONSPIRACY ON THE  INTERNET ENDS UP IN HIS EARS AND ATTEMPTED TO BE IMPLEMENTED. I THINK HE DIDN'T BELIEVE IT. I THINK DONALD TRUMP IS VERY  MENTALLY INCAPABLE OF BEING  PRESIDENT. BUT I THINK HE KNEW THAT THESE  WERE LIES, BUT HE WAS DESPERATE  FOR ANYTHING, ANYTHING HE COULD  GRASP TO STAY IN POWER. BECAUSE HE CAN'T LOSE. ALTHOUGH HE IS A LOSER, HE  DOESN'T WANT TO LOSE AND HE  WOULD RATHER THROW OUT DEMOCRACY THAN HE WOULD AND ACTUALLY HONOR IT LIKE THAT. THERE ARE A LOT OF AMERICAN  PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE IN DONALD  TRUMP, BELIEVE HE'S TELLING THEM THE TRUTH. THEY'RE BEING ABUSED AND BEING  LIED TO. I WANT THOSE PEOPLE TO WAKE UP  AND SEE THE TRUTH.  >> CONGRESSMAN, MICHELLE HERE, I HAVE TO ASK TO THAT POINT  EXACTLY, WHAT IS GOING TO BE  DONE ABOUT IT? OBVIOUSLY CONGRESS CANNOT CHARGE DONALD TRUMP, AS YOU SAY, THE  MAN WHO ATTEMPTED A COUP. BUT DOJ CAN. AND SO DO YOU SEE THAT  HAPPENING? >> I REALLY HOPE SO. IF THEY CAN LOOK AT THIS AND SAY THAT MEETS OUR THRESHOLD OF  EVIDENCE, LOOK, WE HAVE TO BE  VERY CAREFUL AND CLEAR, WE'RE  NOT A CRIMINAL COMMITTEE. WE'RE INVESTIGATING THE FACTS. BUT IF DOJ LOOKS AT WHAT WE'RE  DOING AND SAID THAT REACHES A  THRESHOLD, I THINK THEY SHOULD,  AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT I HOPE  THEY AT LEAST LOOK AT. BUT THE BOTTOM LINE OF THIS IS,  REGARDLESS OF HOW MANY PEOPLE'S  MINDS TURN TODAY OR TOMORROW,  THIS IS SOMETHING WHERE, YOU  KNOW, I HAVE A 5-MONTH-OLD BOY  NOW. I WANT CHRISTIAN WHEN HE'S IN  HIGH SCHOOL TO LEARN THE TRUTH  ABOUT JANUARY 6th. THERE'S A LOT OF CONSPIRACY  THEORIES OUT THERE THAT SAY IT  WAS THE FBI OR SAY IT WAS ANTIFA OR -- I WAS WATCHING LAST NIGHT  THAT VIDEO, AGAIN, AS THE  HEARING WAS GOING ON, AND I  REMEMBER A MEMBER OF CONGRESS  SAYING, THIS WAS NOTHING MORE  THAN

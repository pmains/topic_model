thank you mr chairman and members of the committee and thank you very much uh congressman cecilini for bringing this forward um we've talked a lot about the horrible horrible events that happened here at the capitol on january 6th and um i want to end with that but really start with the beginning of this president violating the law and urging others to violate the law in order to prevent the peaceful transfer of power because he was working on that before january the 6th he was working on that in georgia to try to have elections officials and elected officials find votes for him illegally find votes for him that was asking people to violate their oaths that was asking people to violate the law so that he could prevent the peaceful transfer of power to president-elect biden and vice president-elect harris well that didn't work so then what did he do he tried to get the vice president to go against his duty under the constitution in reporting on the electors and the vice president to his great credit refused to do it because he knew that that would be violating his oath and violating the law after both of those things failed he told a mom and it was a mob because we saw them when they came into the capital and as they were around the capital that it was up to them to save his presidency to save the country and have them engage in illegal actions three things three things that resulted in the desecration of this capital that resulted in the loss of life that threatened so many people's lives and put people in the hospital and he still has no remorse if that is not if those three things and that culmination do not rise to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors i just don't know what does and as bistro cellini has said what the house is doing here is not holding the trial this is an indictment this is presenting the evidence that would go to try and unfortunately we're at this point because the president has not admitted that he's done anything wrong through this entire pattern and unfortunately the vice president has said this evening he will not invoke the 25th amendment so what is left the only thing that is left is the authority of this house to indict the president for this pattern of inciting law lawlessness not just the violence that we saw here on the sixth but lawlessness all the way along after he lost an election that cannot be in a democracy that cannot be under our constitution we must impeach this president i am so happy that congresswoman cheney has agreed and has taken a very bold and brave stance it is our duty to do this and i thank mr sisolini for bringing this forward and with that mr chairman i yield back my time thank you very much

MR. PAPPAS: THANK YOU, MADAM SPEAKER. I WISH TO YIELD SUCH TIME AS SHE MAY CONSUME TO THE GENTLEWOMAN FROM TEXAS, MRS. FLETCHER. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE GENTLEWOMAN IS RECOGNIZED. MRS. FLETCHER: THANK YOU, MADAM SPEAKER. I AM DELIGHTED TO BRING MY BILL, H.R. 1917, THE HAZARD ELIGIBILITY AND LOCAL PROJECTS OR HEALTH ACT TO THE FLOOR TODAE FLOOR TODAY. I THINK CONGRESSMAN PAPPAS AND MY COLLEAGUES ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE ON TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE COMMITTEE FOR AGREEING TO MUST'VE THIS BILL FORWARD. I'M SO PROUD OF THE HELP ACT AND ALL IT REPRESENTS. IT IS BIPARTISAN, COMMONSENSE, MEANING. LEGISLATION THAT WAS BORN OUT OF A REAL PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL OFFICIALS IN MY DISTRICT IN HOUSTON THAT WILL BENEFIT ALL AMERICANS. AS MANY IN THIS BODY WILL RECALL, HURRICANE HARVEY HIT MY DISTRICT IN HOUSTON AND THE ENTIRE TEXAS GULF COAST IN AUGUST OF 2017, CAUSING GREAT DEVASTATION, DROPPING NEARLY 60 INCHES OF RAIN, CLAIMING 6 # LIVES AND CAUSING AN ESTIMATED $125 BILLION IN DAMAGES. IT WAS THE SECOND MOST EXPENSIVE HURRICANE IN UNITED STATES HISTORY. MEMBERS OF THIS BODY RESPONDED TO HARVEY'S DEVASTATION BE THE SPEED AND PURPOSE WE NEEDED FOR OUR RECOVERY, PASSING THREE SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS BILLS, SENDING BILLIONS OF DPLARS AID TO TEXAS THROUGH DIFFERENT PROGRAMS. BUT OUR RECOVERY WAS AND STILL IS SLOW. SLOWER THAN MANY EXPECTED. AND SLOWER THAN ANY CAN AFFORD. BEFORE I WAS SWORN INTO CONGRESS I MET WITH LOCAL OFFICIALS AT HOME TO TALK ABOUT THE IMPEDIMENTS TO OUR RECOVERY. HOW COULD WE SPEED IT UP? WHERE WAS RECOVERY KY LAYED? WHAT COULD THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DO? AND ONE IMPEDIMENT THAT HAD SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR RECOVERY WAS THE PROCESS FOR THE AWARD OF MITIGATION PROJECT FUNDING FROM FEMA. HERE'S WHY. AS MR. PAPPAS NOTED, SECTION 404 OF THE STAFFORD ACT PROVIDES THAT FEMA MAY GRANT UP TO 75% OF FUNDS FOR COST EFFECTIVE MITIGATION PROJECTS THROUGH THE HAZARD MITIGATION GRANT PROGRAM, HMGP. WHEN STATE OR MUNICIPALITIES APPLY THROUGH THE HMGP PROGRAM, PROJECT, REGARDLESS OF SIZE OR SCOPE, REQUIRE COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW TO MAKE SURE ALL REQUIREMENTS OF NEPA OR OTHER STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS ARE MET. IMPORTANTLY THESE HAZARD MITIGATION GRANTS DON'T ALLOW FOR THE REIMBURSEMENT OF COSTS INCURRED BEFORE THE GRANT IS APPROVED. AS A RESULT MANY AREAS RECOVERING FROM DISASTER MUST WAIT FOR THE FEMA REVIEW BEFORE PURCHASING LAND OR STARTING CONSTRUCTION ON A PROJECT DESIGNED TO MITIGATE DAMAGE. THIS FEMA REVIEW CAN GO ON FOR MONTHS OR YEARS AT A CRITICAL TIME FOR DECISION MAKING AND RECOVERING. IN THE CASE OF NATURAL DISASTERS, LOCAL GOVERNMENTS NEED TO MOVE QUICKLY ON PROJECTS LIKE LAND ACQUISITION, FOR EXAMPLE, BUYING LAND OR BUYING OUT HOMES THAT HAVE BEEN DAMMED OR OTHER LAND ACQUISITION PROJECTS. IN HOUSTON, THIS WAS TRUE FOR US WHEN WE WERE LOOKING TO BUY A GOLF COURSE TO CREATE ADDITIONAL STORM WATER DETENTION. THE CHIEF RECOVERY OFFICER FOR THE CITY OF HOUSTON TOLD US FEMA'S PRE-AWARD COST POLICY THAT NOT ALLOWING REIMBURSEMENT OF COSTS BEFORE GRANT APPROVAL IS A LIMITING FACTOR IN RECOVERY, ESPECIALLY IN CASES OF LAND ACQUISITION. THE HOMEOWNERS SIMPLY CANNOT AFFORD TO WAIT THE MONTHS OR YEARS TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT WHETHER TO REPAIR THEIR HOMES OR PARTICIPATE IN A BUYOUT. THE RESULT IS NOT ONLY INEFFICIENCY BUT REAL HARDSHIP. FOR EXAMPLE, HARRIS COUNTY FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICT RECEIVED $25 MILLION FROM THE HAZARD MITIGATION GRANT PROGRAM TO CONDUCT BUYOUTS TO REDUCE FLOOD DAMAGES IN AREAS LOCATED DEEP IN THE FLOODPLAINS WHERE STRUCTURAL PROJECTS REDEUCE FLOODING AREN'T COST EFFECTIVE. BUT THAT WAS NEARLY A YEAR AFTER HARVEY. IT TOOK A YEAR BECAUSE THE REVIEW PERIOD REQUIRED IT FOR ALL FMGH APPLICATIONS. MOST OHM HONERS DON'T HAVE THE LUXURY OF WAITING A YEAR OR MORE FOR REPAIRS OR TO DECIDE WHAT TO DO. THE QUICKER GOVERNMENTS CAN MOVE, THE MORE PEOPLE THEY CAN HELP AND THE MORE RESOURCES THEY CAN LEVERAGE. HAVING A ONE-SIZE-FITS-ALL APPROACH IS NOT EFFICIENT OR EFFECTIVE. IT NEEDLESSLY DELAYS CRITICAL MITIGATION WORK. THAT'S WHERE THE IDEA FOR THE HELP ACT CAME FROM. IT WILL ALLOW LAND ACQUISITION PROJECTS AND SIMPLE CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS THAT DON'T REQUIRE AN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT TO COMEBS IMMEDIATELY WITHOUT RISK OF LOSING THE POTENTIAL FEDERAL FUNDS. THIS WILL ALLOW STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO RESPOND MORE QUICKLY TO THE NEEDS OF THEIR COMMUNITIES AND TO PLAN DISASTER MITIGATION MORE EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY BY REMOVING UNNECESSARY DELAYS AND STREAMLINING FEMA HAZARD MITIGATION GRANT PROGRAMS. IT'S SIMPLE. IT'S STRAIGHTFORWARD. AND IT IS NEEDED. AT HOME I CONTINUE TO HEAR CONSISTENT CONCERN THAT THESE FEDERAL DISASTER RECOVERY PROGRAMS MOVE AT A SLOW PACE. THIS BILL ADDRESSES THAT AND WILL BE A REAL IMPROVEMENT FOR COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE, MR. MCCAUL, FOR WORKING WITH ME ON THIS BILL. DISASTER MITIGATION IS NOT AND SHOULD NEVER BE A PARTISAN ISSUE. THERE REMAINS MUCH WORK TO DO TO PREPARE FOR FUTURE STORMS THAT WE KNOW WILL COME. BUT I AM HOPEFUL THAT THE HELP ACT WILLED ASTATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHEN THEY DO. I URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION AND HELP OUR FAMILIES, BUSINESSES, AND COMMUNITIES RECOVERER FROM DISASTERS. THANK YOU, MADAM SPEAKER, I YIELD BACK. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THANK

I know that you're also aware well aware of my very strong interest in the development and approval of an artificial pancreas which would help people living with type one or juvenile diabetes to achieve dramatically better control over their blood glucose levels until a biological cures found and I want to start by commending you and your team for all your work to advance these critically important technologies by streamlining the review structure in approving outpatient studies in a timely manner an extremely important step was taken last year when your agency approved a low glucose suspend system which is considered in many ways to be the first generation of an artificial pancreas technology I can tell you from the long years of work that I've done with families with children with type one that they are so eager for a breakthrough in this area I know you're collaborating closely with the families and with stakeholders like the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation and wood medical researchers outside the agency but could you give me an update on your timeline your strategy for ensuring that these very promising new technologies reach patients as soon as possible well thank you for your question and your appreciation of how hard we've been working in this area I do think it's really a model for the importance of FDA working in full partnership with the scientific research community the medical care community and importantly patients and their families the development of an artificial pancreas would transform the health and the quality of life of individuals living with type 1 diabetes and of course for their families as well and it's not yet available anywhere in the world but we are really working hard to make it a reality we put forward final guidance several years ago to really lay out what would be the regulatory pathway to try to encourage manufacturers to move in this direction and ensure the right research and study we now also have I think 12 clinical studies some community based studies including it a one at a summer camp to try to really understand how this the the current prototypes would would work and you know we we want to move this as swiftly and surely as possible we want to make sure that the product is safe and effective because if you are relying on this for the assessment of your glucose levels in a continuing way and the delivery of insulin it needs to do it right but we think that the science and technology is coming together with an acute and currently unmet medical need and it's it's it's a very exciting and promising undertaking and I would just add that it also i think is a model for other areas of medical product development as well the partnership with key stakeholders and you know really trying to leverage the opportunities in science and technology today with critical unmet medical needs thank you

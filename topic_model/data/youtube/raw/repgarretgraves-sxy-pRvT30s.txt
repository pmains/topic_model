so very much to our culture and uh quite frankly financially down here is the energy issues and those I know keep getting discussed and you probably hear from us way too much about kind of finding that balance with energy and how we do that Keith no look yeah I don't think you can talk about this enough that what's going on with the energy policy in this country today this is the biggest driver on things like gasoline prices utility prices grocery prices the cost of living I saw a statistic the other day one in every four Americans are having to choose among paying for energy paying for food or paying for medicine think about that I mean that's a that's a false Choice thousands of dollars the average American family is now spending more on on things like utility costs than refueling their vehicles just today the White House released the statement beating up on OPEC all these Middle Eastern and foreign countries because they have decided to cut oil production and and they're beating them up the White House is and saying this is a bad decision and that they're a cartel and that it's going to cause prices to go up look the way that you insulate yourselves is you produce more energy I mean a few years ago the United States was entirely energy independent we have the resources in the Gulf of Mexico to to be independent together with other areas in the United States that have oil and gas and so it makes no sense for the United States to shut down stop prohibit energy production off the coast of Louisiana and then go to Saudi Arabia Iran Venezuela or whoever else and ask them for energy we just lifted sanctions on Venezuela that has kidnapped Americans I mean this just it it doesn't make sense it's not in Louisiana's interest and it's and it's absolutely not in in America's interest either so we're trying to push this this White House house back into sensible energy policy where we are actually entirely energy independent and really have excess resources to send to Europe and other places that economies are being weakened right now as a result of surging Energy prices which weakens NATO our military Alliance and it it weakens Ukraine so really important that we get this right and I'll tell you right now it's not right we've we've got availabilities in our own backyard just let us go get it right I mean you know we talk all the time with with some of the local leaders uh you know down in fouchon it just it's available just just let us go do it and we find some alternatives to Annex that great let's do that you know but right now this is what we're kind of dependent upon and just let us go get it let us get it a little cheaper because we can yeah Keith you'd have to go back to the Truman Administration in the 1940s to get to a point in time where they have leased or made available public lands and Waters as as little as they've done under this Administration The Truman administrative even Jimmy Carter who I wouldn't argue is a is a big uh conventional energy guy he leased 100 times more Acres of of lands and Waters for energy production than President Biden has at the same point in time during his administration I mean this is just it's crazy it's it's handing a gift to other countries that quite frankly aren't big fans of the United States and the thing that's most aggravating all of this is being done under this umbrella under the auspices of climate change and saying hey we're doing all this for climate change here's the fact the fact is is that under President Biden's strategy emissions have gone up yes they haven't gone down they've gone up right and under the previous administration emissions were actually going down an average of two and a half percent a year last year under Biden they went up 6.3 percent they're going to go up again this year I mean it just and then the other thing that just drives me crazy is that while we have led the world in reducing emissions in the United States for every one ton of emissions we we've reduced here China's gone up by four you're exactly right that new Energy Technologies win solar whatever look they're great when they make sense we shouldn't ignore them but you've got to put them in places and use them in situations where they make sense and in some cases they just don't make sense oil and gas is a proven technology natural gas has been the the reason we've led the world in reducing emissions and we've got to build on those successes and there are options to do that we just need and we appreciate you fighting for that

joining me now with south carolina congresswoman nancy mace congresswoman it's always great to have you on the program you know cuomo was gone but many democrat governors who ordered china virus patients into nursing homes they're still there virginia's ralph uh ralph northam he is still there his attorney general both you know found to have appeared in blackface that was a bit of a problem uh now the lieutenant governor there he also had a problem with two credible sexual assault allegations lodged against him and of course joe biden's uh getting credibly accused of bisexual of sexual assault by tara reid why do you think cuomo had to go when the rest of these these cats are escaping culpability i think he's an easy scapegoat for others who've been accused of the exact same thing and for cuomo to say today he wants to do the right thing well the right thing to do would have been last year when he put thousands of nursing home patients lives at risk into fatal facilities where they were spreading coveted to the elderly in new york he should have gone in but said he made millions of dollars aided and abetted by mainstream media um off a disastrous management of covet 19 in new york but he's an easy scapegoat today for others who've done virtually the same thing in other places around the country well we mentioned sizable number of republicans supported biden's infrastructure deal that actually balloons the debt by i think 256 billion dollars was the number i saw now conservatives say this is simply a down payment on alexandria ocasio-cortez's green new deal now the democrats are poised to pass another 3.5 trillion dollar budget busting spending bill question is is the modern day republican party equipped or inclined to oppose this current socialist democrat party well i can tell you conservative republicans in the house of representatives will absolutely a hundred percent oppose this quote bipartisan legislation because it truly is a down payment this 1.22 trillion nancy pelosi has made very clear she will not bring up the infrastructure bill for a vote until they determine and decide how they're going to spend another 3.5 trillion on aoc and bernie sanders socialist style spending spree that'll be coming up in the next few days or weeks in the senate for a vote uh so it absolutely is a down payment on a larger social spending package for the rest of the country which is so remarkably it astounds me that this is happening because the november election was not a mandate on socialism nancy pelosi only has a three-person majority in the house right now this is not a mandate on aoc and progressive policies yeah falchi out there on another network today saying that these are extraordinary times so they require extraordinary measures and he's talking about mandates vaccine mandates and the mass mandates are being issued by left-wingers contrary to certain governor's orders as you know governments are now mandating vaccines whether it be washington state or what they're doing to our military contrary to traditional vaccines which have decades of medical data to draw from that the china virus vaccines are literally months old are mandates wise with the deficit of data that we have on the virus and the vaccines well look the cdc was given 42 billion dollars last year and didn't do a single study on kids in masks or masks in the spread of covid19 none of that if you are afraid of getting and contracting coven 19 nothing is preventing you from getting a vaccination or wearing a mask or two masks or three masks today you can do that today the government doesn't have to tell you to do that this is a health care decision that individuals and families should be able to make on their own with their doctor or their health care provider to make the best decision for them not everybody the vast majority of people in this country do not live in hot zones right now and many of us are taking our own personal precautions based on uh the statistics and the data that we have out there which is what we should continue to do well and the hysterical left has resorted to now to rather extraordinary measures to shame people into either masking up or or or taking these vaccines local school board member in oklahoma said yesterday that she's worried that small children might quote murder each other by spreading the china virus without wearing masks watch if i were a parent of a young child i didn't know what i would do but i don't think we should put our parents in that position and if there's any way between now and the beginning of school that we can get this changed i hope we can because it's just not okay for kids to commit murder by coming to school without a mask and when it comes down to it it's possible they will ch they will cause a death of another child because they come to school without a mask so crazy i can think of one country causing murders around the world and that is china who started this virus in a lab in wuhan you know the far left they want to teach our kids that they're racist or that they're victims or that they're oppressed and now they want to teach our kids that they're murderers i mean this is such insanity i don't even know how this person is in any official capacity uh to make statements like that that's just that's insanity to me yeah there are communists out there that are the enemies of most civilized people to the american left the parents and kids are now uh the enemies congresswoman nancy mase always a pleasure to talk with you lady we'll talk again soon

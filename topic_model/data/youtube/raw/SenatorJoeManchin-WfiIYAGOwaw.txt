To have Bill come to the
state to see firsthand what he has observed all
over the world and the energy needs and what's
going to be the demand for the world in years to come
is going to be unbelievable. And they're
going to ask this little status to pick it back up
again, let's do it. Let's make sure we provide for
the rest of the country and basically show the
world how to do it and do it right, cleaner and
better. We went to see Glasgow today. Here's a
plant perfectly situated to have plug and play, if
you will. We have switch gears in there,
transmission's there, boom, boom, boom, ready to
go. We just have to have the power to support that.
Whatever we do here, it's going to be the safety for
the community, the community's gonna be proud
of any employment and tax revenues it'll produce.
It's going to be unbelievable. He sees the
need for basically the fossil fuel, the coal that
we produce, the natural gas we produce, and all
the things we're going to need for quite some time.
And we can do it cleaner and better than anywhere
in the world. We've proven that. The inflation
Reduction Act has given us so many opportunities with
the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill to
bring companies from all over the world. The United
States is the number one attraction for new
technology, investment in technology. I just think
it's endless what we can do. We can be a hydrogen
state, we can be a small nuclear reactor, we can
still have coal and natural gas production. We
can do everything that takes the horsepower to
run the greatest nation on Earth.

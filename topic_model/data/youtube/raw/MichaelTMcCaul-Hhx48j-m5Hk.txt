Senate House and intelligence committees will be briefed today on the National Security Agency's secret surveillance programs now the head of NSA was questioned on Capitol Hill Tuesday days after a former employee blew the lid off the top of the secret programs lawmakers have voiced concerns over the surveillance and also Edward Snowden's disclosures one of those lawmakers Texas congressman Michael McCaul who serves as the Homeland Security chairman he joins us now live from Washington a good morning congressman you do have some mixed opinions about the surveillance programs because you have been quoted as believing that they save lives and ported terrorism yet you can also understand why Americans might be mistrusting of the government you know correct Jose it's great to be on your program again yeah I mean it's a league legal lawful program reviewed by the what they call the FISA Court which approved of these activities so you have judicial review on the other hand I think on the heels of the IRS scandal targeting conservative groups surveillance from DOJ on Associated Press and fox news reporters it does come the optics come at a terrible time because of this sort of overreach and the part of this administration I think it boils down to initiative trust and I think a lot of Americans are losing trust in this administration in this president and I guess the question is do you want this administration have access to your phone records and you know I was a counterterrorism a prosecutor federal prosecutor in the old days we take that phone number and right through the private phone companies we never assembled a massive database of every phone record that exists with these phone carriers and I think that's part of the concern that's why we're going to be having oversight hearings on Capitol Hill talking about this we're getting briefed I got briefed on it last week on the program itself and you know it has save lives of prevented the New York subway bombing by mr. zazie and it stopped a couple of other attacks but I think there's a privacy issue here that we always have to weigh with security congressman now what's going to happen now that the programs have been made public and they were not supposed to have been made public is there any to worry about national security now well I think the leaker did some great damage in terms of something of the information regarding PowerPoint presentations and and exposing the program itself it has caused some damage that I'm concerned about as in the post Boston climate that we're in what this could expose us to I think I've always advocate this individual should be prosecuted you did violate national security law but I think it's a time for the American people to have a dialogue about this I think it's time for us to provide oversight and I think it's also time I think the NSA is planning to declassify certain elements so that they can actually talk about I think part of the problem is you know that it's it's a valuable program but but you're pretty much hamstrung when you can't even talk about it because it's classified so I think there's an effort to declassify so that more of the information about the program can be made and the case can be made to the American people a delicate balancing act that will have to be made in Washington one of switch gears now Major Nidal Hasan's trial coming up soon testimony should begin sometime next month he's defending himself what do you think about the judge's decision to allow him to question the victims well i think you know there's a statement from one of the victims that they continue to be terrorized by this individual and yet we won't call him for what he is a terrorist I I still harken back to the fact that what we're still calling this workplace violence when we all know that this was an act of jihad and act of terrorism of this individual major of sound was in touch with a locking in Yemen arguably the most powerful terrorist in the world asking him for permission to do what he did and now he's saying that he was defending the Taliban when he did this it is absolutely unconscionable I think the old saying the old adage a someone who represents himself has a fool for a client I think major son is not only a fool that a hard-hearted terrorist and he needs to be treated that way real quick if he's found guilty what punishment would you prefer listen I used to provide for site overall the death row appeals for the state of Texas when I was Deputy Attorney General and I've seen far less egregious cases than this one and go to the death chamber I think the death penalty is very much an order in this case congressman Michael McCaul thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule in Washington to join us here at Fox 26 morning news thank you say so they

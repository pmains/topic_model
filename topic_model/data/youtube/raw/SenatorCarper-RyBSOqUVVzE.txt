right um well to mr president today is a special day it's earth day and uh i was i had the privilege actually being the first earth day golden gate park a million years ago and the uh the speaker there that day was ralph nader and they're a huge crowd hundreds of thousand people were there ralph nader had made a lot of fame and fortune of writing a book uh called unsafe at any speed i bought the corvair manzo uh i that was my first car at corvair monza and as he was there speaking that day i couldn't help but think about how much i love my corvair monza and couldn't believe he wrote that book about it but he actually made a lot of sense and rallied certainly rallying points for people in this country who realized that we were going the wrong way in terms of the surveyor the cleanliness of our water i'd gone to ohio state navy watching midshipmen there and ended up in southeast asia i remember being over in southeast asia and on one of our deployments in the cuyahoga river up the road from ohio state and cleveland ohio caught on fire and they had too many people drinking dirty water the uh i like to run outside and i know our dining office was a big athlete as well and i know there are days that i would run outside in in the 60s and 70s and some places even now around the world that i was doing more damage than than good by by breathing the the air in those places but some amazing things happened in 1970 right around 1970 and the uh we uh saw the creation of the environmental protection agency i don't think it was done initially as a bill i think was actually done as there was an executive order richard nixon was a president then i think the congress came along a few years later and sort of passed legislation to to implement the executive order the the clean uh air act was uh signed into law clean water act was passed i think richard nixon vetoed initially vetoed the clean water act but they had huge support overwhelming support democrat and republican for both both both measures we didn't give a whole lot of concern in those days to the climate change nobody ever really talked in the 1960s and 1970s or the 1980s about climate change but some something started happening on our planet people said i think it's getting warmer the weather seems to be a bit more extreme as time goes by and then scientists reported that a hole was being formed in the ozone layer uh on the around the over north pole and uh it started off small and got bigger and bigger and bigger and people said people a lot smarter than me said this is not good we got to figure what's going on here and they finally figured out was something called uh cfcs chlorofluorocarbons which were actually in planned in our air conditioners our freezers refrigerators and uh they did a really good job in keeping things cool including us but unfortunately led to the hole in the ozone so some really smart scientists got to work and they came up with something called hfc's hydrofluorocarbons and hfcs did a really good job on keeping us cool uh the they also did a good job in terms of the hole in the ozone going away but uh the the bad thing about hsc's hydrofluorocarbon is there a thousand times worse for climate change the warming of our climate than carbon carbon dioxide so some good but some bad as well and we passed the legislation signed i think unbeknownst to him last december president uh legislation that phases down hfcs the hydrofluorocarbon so now we're going to have american-made products that will keep us cool and be good with respect to positive respect to to climate change create a lot of jobs tens of thousands maybe hundreds of thousands of jobs american jobs with american technology and uh strengthening our economy in a variety of different different ways so on this earth day there's a lot to be concerned about but the the hfc phase down that i just talked about was signed into law in this part of a much bigger package in december that is worth a half a degree celsius and your scientists will tell you what we want to be careful is not to see the the earth temperature go up by more than two or three degrees celsius and if we do this becomes sort of irreversible and we're in real trouble then on this planet but this one thing that we did voted on here in this in this chamber phasing down hfcs worth about a half to be celsius there's still more to do but that's a good start the uh the greatest uh greatest source of carbon dioxide in our planet is uh is not hfcs but it's the emissions from our cars trucks and vans our mobile fleet about 28 of carbon emissions come from our cars trucks and vans about another 25 comes from utilities you know power plants that provide electricity for us a lot of them are powered by coal or natural gas mostly coal and the uh another large source of carbon emissions is from industry think of cement plants if if you will you add those three together it's about 75 percent of the carbon emissions uh in our country it's just those three sources and uh so uh we uh there used to be a guy uh mr president used to be a bank robber his name was willie sutton uh you may or may not have heard of he lived during the depression before either of us and but he robbed a lot of banks finally got caught and they ended up in trial before the judge and the judge said that mr sutton why do you rob all those banks and willie certainly replied famously that's where the the money is your honor it's where the money is well one of the reasons why we focus on uh carbon emissions global warming emissions uh coming from our more multiple sources that's 28 of the emissions that's where not the money is but that's where the emissions a lot of them are coming from and uh we're on we're getting really exciting announcements from uh our american companies auto companies for gm has announced uh this year that uh they will uh starting 2035 they will not be presenting manufacturing car structure vans that uh they're burning gas saline or or diesel fuel they're just going to be electric they'll be using hydrogen fuel cells that's abused by 20 30 that's only like 14 years away ford has made similar kinds of of pledges i think volkswagen a number of other countries companies have made similar pledges and there's they're not pledges or things will take place in like 40 or 50 years i mean we're talking about like right down the road right down the road and that's great news because the uh the threat of climate change is imminent and we don't have a lot of time to to to to meet it one i was in a hearing this morning mr mr president and i'm on the serve on the committee one of the committees i serve on is homeland security and government affairs one of the issues that we have is we're responsible for is the postal service and uh i i think maybe for reasons it goes back to my time in the vietnam war being overseas in a war and how every week when we get the mail over there it was uh we led the best part of the week and hear from your families loved ones friends newspapers magazines care packages it was a great day and uh so i have this great affection for the postal service even today i love the idea of mailing voting and i know the uh i know my friend from georgia has some affection for for people being able to participate and exercise their constitution rights through the mail and hopefully we'll do more of that in smart ways like like that in the future but the the postal service still provides a valuable service for a reminder that during the the uh election last last year but uh the postal service the the men and women drive around and deliver on mail they uh they drive around the vehicles they're on average 25 years and older almost all of them are diesel or gasoline-powered and the postal service realizes that they uh they need to upgrade their fleet and they they need to do the do that sooner than later it is not cheap it is a not shaped thing to do with 165 000 uh mail trucks that need to be replaced in the next to several years there's a 10-year uh plan that the the postal service has put out how they plan to sort of return to if not their profitability or at least approved to improve over time to a break-even situation one of the things that that's in their plan is to buy and replace their existing fleet of cars trucks and vans mostly uh mostly trucks and vans the uh uh they are they are contracting and comparing a contract with a company up in oshkosh wisconsin called oshkosh and the idea is to to build a bunch of vehicles tens of thousands of them over the next decade or so the we had three nominees today mr president before who been nominated to be members of the board of governors of the postal service and all there are nine members of the board of governors nominated by the president confirmed by the senate they have three vacancies and we had the three nominees for to fill those vacancies before us and i wish them all a happy earth day and then i talked to them about the uh the what lies they had in terms of replacing 165 000 vehicles and uh the uh apparently they're originally the the first couple of thousand vehicles that'll be produced will be your gas and diesel and then after that the the vehicles could be gas diesel or electric or hydrogen for that for that matter there's a extra cost when you're when you switch to uh uh electric uh extra costs when you switch over to say hydrogen if that's the technique the technology that's chosen because you need the electric charging stations you need hydrogen fueling stations and it's easy to take your gasoline powered vehicle your diesel price vehicle to a gas station on the corner it's in your town but if you need to get the electric charge for your battery or you need the hydrogen for your fuel cell vehicle then that costs some money and it can't all be on the postal service you can all be on the postal service as we put together this next infrastructure package for our country and we're going to be debating here legislation senator capital and i the environmental public works committee have been working on with our team bipartisan team next week big package on uh wastewater treatment and on on drinking water clean drinking water uh we will uh be uh that'd be the first big infrastructure bill that we've passed i think in the senate hopefully next week but there'll be hopefully a lot more and part of that will be roads highways and bridges coming down the road and part of that will be charging stations and densely populated corridors all over the country for charging stations for electric vehicles charging stations or fueling stations for hydrogen vehicles which have a lot of potential too and i just want us to keep in mind when that day comes i want the postal service to keep in mind that uh we need for them to set an example postal services said example if they go out and they buy two thirds of the new vehicles they buy or gasoline and diesel powered shame on them and frankly shame on us in this body if we allow that to to happen but we we have to remember that postal service is fighting for its uh life and we need to be be there and be helpful in terms of helping to uh pay for via the infrastructure that they will need to when they buy these these new vehicles um i'll close with this uh mr president i uh i'm not sure where home depot is headquartered uh they're not him headquartered in georgia if they are waiting that nod your head i think they are uh i i love to talk about home depot and whenever i go down to south central america uh places like honduras guatemala and salvador called the northern triangle countries and we have something in place called atlanta alliance and it's alliance program it's designed to help direct corruption their crime their violence their lack of economic opportunity there and we provide the money from our from taxpayer money to help them these countries down there so people stop feeling like they have to come up here to escape the violence the corruption the crime and lack of economic opportunity and so we provide some money and we expect them for every dollar we provide to provide four or five dollars on their own we all want foundations to put up money we want businesses to put up money to help for this as well i say to the people of honduras go out in el salvador who live in some really terrible situations uh but when i talk to them about the uh the alliance for prosperity which has been in place now for several years uh you can do it you those three countries hundreds guatemala south you can do it we can help and i think we have a moral obligation to help and i think the postal service they can do it they can update their fleet they can do so in a way that's sustainable and is actually good for this planet this is the only planet we're going to have we've got to take care of it right now we folks face huge huge challenges so i would on this earth day mr president to my colleagues say the anniversary lies opportunity uh the postal service is going through its share of adversity as well but there's real opportunity as well as to help the postal service and men and women who work there do a better job more reliable job of delivering the mail to all of us but also to do so in a way that is good for our planet and that would be a very very good thing and make this earth day uh especially memorable with that mr president i'm gonna bid you i do a great weekend to you and the staff god bless you thank you so much tonight note the absence of a quorum clerk will call

energy on is on the minds of michigan residents this week as they prepare to travel for the holiday weekend unfortunately many of them have already told me they are skipping their usual plans because of the high cost of energy one of the most important sources of energy for my state is the line five pipeline that runs between superior wisconsin and sarnia ontario it's also a vital part of the strong relationship enjoyed between our country and canada the pipeline supplies energy to the midwest in michigan indiana ohio and pennsylvania one of the biggest products that is delivered is propane which is used to heat the homes of many of my constituents during the winter line five is crucial for the future of energy in the united states and canada and a plan to improve the safety and bury the pipeline underground has been approved however nearly four years later bureaucracy at the federal and state levels has delayed the construction of the tunnel and the high-paying union jobs it would create despite how vital this infrastructure is to the people of our two countries politicians in michigan and washington d.c have aligned themselves with activists against the pipeline canada has stepped in to defend this valuable energy resource invoking the 1977 treaty on pipelines between our two countries the amendment i am offering today will ensure the state department and the secretary of state do not impede the transmission of hydrocarbons by pipeline between canada and the united states my amendment will make it clear that this congress and the united states support affordable energy for people in the midwest and that we stand with our neighbors in canada to support the free flow of energy between our countries a vote against this amendment is a vote to jeopardize the future of key infrastructure infrastructure for our nation's energy needs irreparably harm the strong alliance we have with our neighbors to the north and put millions of americans in the midwest at risk of even higher energy costs at home and at the gas pump i urge my colleagues to join me in support of this amendment thank you

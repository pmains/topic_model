in London thank you so much here with me is the vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee Democratic Virginia Senator Mark Warner thanks so much for coming in this morning we appreciate it so this is the third terrorist attack in the UK in the last 10 weeks they've claimed the lives of 34 innocent victims what can you tell us what we know about the perpetrators of last night's attack and is there any risk to Americans right now beyond the normal risk I received a brief this morning from our national center counterterrorism center and basically they have pretty much the same information you've got an open source they still don't know for sure whether this was terrorist inspired or terrorist directed so whether this was homegrown or actually directed by Isis or al-qaeda I think that will take a little while longer in terms of investigation there is no specific threat against the United States but obviously we've seen our strongest ally Britain now hit three times our hearts and thoughts and prayers go out to them but I think what you're seeing in Britain is a resoluteness but also a recognition that as the British who went through three decades of IRA related terrorism they will carry on and I think in many ways that's what we need to do here in our country as well the British prime minister Theresa May said there's far too much tolerance for extremism in the UK do you think we have that problem here in the United States I think we don't have it the same way as the UK but it is it obviously a challenge in modern society to maintain free societies and freedom of speech but still recognize that we have to be on guard against some of the hateful venom that is oftentimes spewed over the internet why do you think it is that we see these attacks in London but we have not knock on wood seeing such a thing happen here in the United States I believe in many ways the Muslim American community is better integrated into our society there I think that's always been our secret sauce in America that you can come here first generation and if you accept our laws and rules become American that has not always been the case in so many of the European countries and I think we are seeing again the benefits of that and that's why it troubles me so much to see the kind of the type of tweets that the president has put out in the last 12 hours or so Prime Minister may also said that she thinks internet-based technology firms are giving extremism the safe space it needs to breed she wants new regulations of cyberspace take a listen we need to work with allies democratic governments to reach international agreements that regulate cyberspace to prevent the spread of extremists and terrorism planning Facebook Twitter Google do you think that these tech firms are doing enough Jake I think in my background as you know was in technology business before I came in went into politics I think we do have to re-examine these platform companies that for years have said they have no responsibility to curate the information that flows across their platforms they have started to change I would originally they change their policies as related to child pornography now they are changing their policies as related to terrorism I was just out on the West Coast last week talking with folks at Facebook they are now recognizing the weaponization of false information even around elections they shut down 30,000 fake accounts right before the French she's but this is going to require I think a much broader conversation than we've had to date you have a lot of big hearings coming up on Wednesday you'll have the Director of National Intelligence the head of the NSA the acting director of the FBI and the Deputy Attorney General and then Thursday of course the big one James Comey the former FBI director do you have any indication whether President Trump will try to exert executive privilege to block call me from testifying about their conversations I would hope that he would not I think he would be on shaky legal ground to say the least director Comey was fired by the president and you have the President himself making derogatory comments in fact at least reported to the press calling call me a nut job in front of the Republicans totally inappropriate yeah the question of the Russians I think in front of the West yeah which is again just regardless of what you feel about call me that's not how he should be treated and the question we have I think most Americans have is you know going back to Watergate there's a series of rules and kind of emerged at Washington one that a president shouldn't ask about an ongoing investigation particularly shouldn't ask if that investigation is connected to affiliates of the President and it would be absolutely unthinkable if the president United States asked the FBI director to basically back off an investigation that was directed at some of the affiliates of mr. Trump Hillary Clinton said something very interesting this week that reminded me of something that you said in a hearing not long ago she said that she believes that the Russians in their interference in the u.s. election must have been guided by Americans take a listen the Russians in my opinion and based on the Intel encounter Intel people I've talked to could not have known how best to weaponize that information unless they had been guided and here's a here's I defy America guided by Americans and guided by people who had you know polling and imagine is that true do you agree this is one of the questions we have to sort through again one of the questions I was asking when I was out on the west coast it does seem strange it appears that Russian paid internet trolls who created BOTS were then able to put forward fake news selected stories in a way that seemed targeted now targeted at certain state targeted it at certain states at certain demographics we don't have full proof of that so I'm not where Secretary Clinton is in terms of jumping to a conclusion but this is one of the many questions that we need to investigate one of the big questions of course is is there any evidence of collusion that you have seen yet is there well there is a lot of smoke we had no smoking gun at this point but there is a lot of smoke and again one of the questions that we will have not only for director Comey on Thursday but on Wednesday for a Director of National Intelligence Coates and NSA and Nationals is a director Admiral Rogers I'm going to want to ask them because there have been reports that the president also talked to both of them in terms of asking them to downplay the Russian investigation that would be very concerning to me have you heard any accusation yet that you think's if it is proven in terms of what the president has said either coats or Atma Rogers or James Comey that if it's proven it is obstruction of justice Jake I went to law school but I not a practicing attorney I'll leave that for much better attorneys than I but clearly it would be very very troubling if the president United States is interfering in investigations that are affect potentially the president and his closest associates we have seen already the NSA director the NSA adviser general Flynn get fired because he didn't fully disclose his contacts with Russians we've had the Attorney General Sessions afterwards himself because he did not fully disclose his connections with Russians we see other reports of mr. Kushner having a series of contacts with with Russians and others and the American people deserve to get to the bottom of this and what I hope our committee is able to do and we've I'm very proud of the fact that it's maintained its bipartisan approaches we're going to just follow the facts we're not going to be you know taken out by some of these one-off stories we're going to continue to follow the facts the FBI's probe of the meddling is also looking at the Trump campaigns data analytics operation which was overseen by Jared Kushner are you focusing on that we're going to follow all of the facts in terms of what kind of contacts and whether the contacts were inappropriate between individuals affiliated with the Trump campaign and the Russians their contacts that were made before the election there have been a series of stories about contacts between the election and the inauguration and then we've got these very troubling reports about the president intervening and in the case of director Comey fire him because potentially because of his activities with the Russia investigation Senator Mark Warner thank you so much for being here we really appreciate it as always

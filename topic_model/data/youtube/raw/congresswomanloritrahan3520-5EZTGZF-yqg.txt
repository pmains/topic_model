thank you Mr chairman ranking member shakowski for organizing today's important hearing you know like many of my colleagues on the day is I'm disappointed that we failed to pass the American data privacy and protection act in the Full House last Congress and I urge my colleagues particularly those who are new to the committee a committee to continue working in a bipartisan way to pass a comprehensive Privacy Law that meets the needs of the families we represent Mr chairman the federal laws that govern our privacy today in March of 2023 are the same ones that were in place when we held when we had a hearing on holding big Tech accountable a year ago in March 2022 they're the same laws that were on the books when the CEOs of Google meta and Twitter testified before this same committee a year prior to that in March 21. in fact they're the same laws that for decades have permitted companies to harvest our sensitive data things like medical symptoms that we look up on a search engine or our location that paints a picture of where we work where we send our kids to school and where we pray and sell that data to third parties or use it in ways that are contrary to what any of us would reasonably expect many of us have been sounding the alarm about this for a while in the past two years I've sent inquiries to phone and messaging apps asking about the misuse and sale of messaging metadata to data Brokers about the sale of geolocation data into online gaming companies about their treatment of data collected on our teens these companies can and should be doing better but without comprehensive privacy legislation like adppa they won't act and it doesn't stop there one type of product I want to highlight the desperate need for an update is education technology according to a 21 2021 study from Center for democracy and Technology 85 percent of teachers and 74 percent of parents believe edtech is very important to students education and more teachers are becoming aware of the need to thoughtfully consider students privacy however a majority of parents still have concerns about student privacy and a significant number of teachers still have not had training on privacy policies and procedures so Ms Givens with the family educational rights and privacy act or FERPA having passed nearly a half century ago back in 1974 and still being the law of the land when it comes to student data can you describe to what extent companies that offer Ed tech software are or are not covered by FERPA thank you for the question and for citing our report we spend a lot of time with Educators teachers in the classroom as well as students and their families and so we see firsthand the level of concern about how kids data is being used in this environment to answer your question FERPA applies to personal information from education records that are maintained by covered entities that basically means public K through tells 12 schools colleges and universities that accept federal student aid when edtech software vendors work with those covered entities they have to comply with FERPA but really importantly FERPA falls short in all of the other ways in which edtech vendors might be engaging in receiving information about students so first it doesn't come contemplate harms that might result from other types of information like when the vendor indirect interacts directly with the student and gathers that type of record second ferpur doesn't address any of the Civil Rights issues that can stem from algorithmic harms as we're seeing increasing use of AI systems deployed in education settings and third purpose enforcement mechanisms fall directly on schools and not on their vendors and the punishments are Draconian you lose your federal funding we need the burden for privacy compliance to sit not just with the schools which are so overwhelmed but with vendors in this space as well and so complementing FERPA with strong comprehensive privacy protections for those commercial uses of this technology is really important as well thank you uh you know in some cases Ed tech software um you know as you mentioned not offered through business to school contracts instead they may be a free online game or an educational app and the data collected while on these sites or apps can later be used to Target ads or sold to third parties particularly on our students who are under the age of who are 13 and older so the idea of consent gets murky as you mentioned when we are talking about a student or their parents deciding between participating in class while being tracked versus not participating at all can you speak to how the duty of loyalty and data minimization and adpa would be applied to these types of sites and apps you're exactly right so FERPA only applies to vendors when they're processing education records which doesn't include any of the many other ways that students are interacting with technology today I think about the experience with my own children and they download apps not going through those official channels they're sharing a lot of information and they're doing it to be able to have an educational experience again this shows why notice and consent is broken as a model because there isn't a question of consent you want to be able to access these platforms and sadly Kappa is falling short here too although of course it does offer some protections to Services targeting uh children under the age of 13. that too essentially rests on a notice in consent regime that is really hard to operationalize in practice so that's why we need the broader comprehensive privacy protection is to regulate those additional uses and create Baseline protections for students thank you thank you so much for your testimony I yield back

thank you Santa Murray senator from Alaska Senator murkowski thank you Mr chairman and I appreciate that you and the vice chair have called this meeting so so timely um as an Alaskan I am so angry I want to use other words but I'm not going to the fact of the matter is Alaska is the first line of defense for America right if you're gonna have Russia coming at you if you're going to have China coming at you we know exactly how they come they come up and they go over Alaska sometimes they go on the top sometimes they go straight across but Alaska is it and thank goodness thank goodness the Pentagon the Department of Defense have recognized where we sit on the globe to take care of the rest of this country and thank goodness that we have invested the resources to make sure that we have the eyes on the skies and every place else more fifth generation Fighters sitting there in the state of Alaska we know that we're proud of it everything that we do to to stay focused whether it's Cobra day and out in the aleutians or whether it's clear Air Force Base that has a long-range discrimination radar or out in Greeley where we have the ground-based missile defense we're ready we're ready man and to the point that Senator Collins makes it's like it's like this Administration doesn't think that Alaska is is any part of of the uh of the rest of the country here to get to the United States you've got to come through Alaska so when we see it first as we did as we all knew and as you have suggested Mr Royal I think you you suggested we knew we knew when we first got eyes on this that this balloon was not a weather station this was not collecting weather information we knew that and so think about it from Alaska's perspective you said you said Ms Dalton that the clear message here we sent a clear message to the PRC when we shot this down in our Sovereign Waters seems to me the clear message to China is we got free range in Alaska because they're not they're going to let us cruise over that until it gets to more sensitive areas tell me tell me where the sensitive areas are alaskans have stepped up willingly and and support our military but when we're talking about the Sovereign Waters and The Sovereign territories of this country Alaska is part of that so I I really I I know we're going to have an opportunity for more information in the classified brief I've already received one and it was pretty thorough and I think that the American public deserve more than they have seen in terms of transparency about why why this spy balloon was allowed to spend two days over our Waters and over the state of Alaska the state that is the guardian for everybody else and you're saying that at that time at that time there was not a threat to Alaska citizens or or assets that we have and that the risk assessment Rose later as it was coming into the rest of the the lower 48 there you know at at what point at what point do we say a surveillance balloon a spy balloon coming from China is is a threat to our sovereignty it should be the minute the minute it crosses the line and that line is Alaska

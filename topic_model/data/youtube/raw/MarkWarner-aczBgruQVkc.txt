and joining me now is the vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee it's Democrat Mark Warner of Virginia senator Warner welcome back to Meet the Press Thank You Chuck you're one of the few Democratic lawmakers who has at least been briefed after the fact the fact I know nobody apparently nobody other than Lindsey Graham may have gotten a briefing before the fact I want to focus on this on this threat that and and you heard what the Secretary of State said there how you've been briefed about what this threat was how a minute does it seem and is it any different than what sulla money's been doing over the last decade I accept the notion that there was a real threat the question of how imminent is something that I need more information on let's step back for a moment and look at what's happened America always has to be strong but also smart strong in the sense that we always need to protect our people and her interests and Salamone was a bad guy there's no question about that but we also have to be smart and there's three things that I didn't hear from the secretary and I've not heard from the administration first over the last month we've seen across the region great pushback against Iran not only in Iran itself from the people protesting against the regime in Lebanon where people were on the streets saying too much Iranian influence in Iraq even where people were protesting against the iranian-backed militias that anti-iranian effort now seems to have transformed as we've seen the images and over the last 24 hours into anti-american activity so you're concerned that Soleimani now is being almost a rally rallying force not only with within Iran but as we may hear later today even in Iraq where we may be now asked to leave let me just finish two other by the way there's breaking is them the prime minister of Iraq is recommending that which again how does that make us stronger secondly there is usually a congressional consulting process it's both constitutionally required but it's also important because one you potentially get members of Congress to buy in ahead of time and two they may ask that hard question that's not asking an insular group and three you consult your allies because we don't want to go this alone and what we've already seen by not consulting particularly with their NATO we've seen that the NATO forces in Iraq have already stopped training the Iraqi troops that again does not make us stronger how do we get out of this now the reason I say this is like you know sort of the what : pi used to call the powder brown wall it's broken soleimani has been killed the Iranians are going to retaliate how does the American can you imagine us not retaliating against that retaliation and would that be prudent well again Salah money taking him out was a big thing this is one of the top three leaders in Iran and thinking through all those consequences if you take this action that's what I want to hear from the administration that I've not heard so far I know the Secretary of State is trying in his own words to de-escalate I'm not sure the president by his kind of taunting tweets are necessarily trying to de-escalate I'm not sure how we will be seen as both stronger and smarter if we have our Iraqi allies asking us to leave if our NATO allies don't feel like they're gonna be informed before we take this kind of action and frankly if the people in the region that were against the Iranian regime all across the region are now rallying against America let's say there's a Democratic president coming next how does the next administration rants are gonna deal with any presidential administration for a while then I kind of trust anything what what so it feels like we're we're gonna get backed into something here backed into a military conflict whether we like it or not I hope that's not the case but how we get a path off this in a way where you can bring the American people you can bring allies you can bring people in the region those are the questions that I think we all Democrats Republicans need to ask the administration this week I know diplomacy is never supposed there's never supposed to be that's never too late for diplomacy but with this Iranian regime is it well there was a reason why under regime under administration's Democratic and Republican alike in the past President Obama both President Bush's President Clinton you go through that process of working with your allies you go through the process of consulting with Congress you don't always get it right but you always try to be both strong and smart taking out Soleimani it may have some short-term benefit but the smartness in terms of in the region with our allies and bringing along the American people I think the jury is really out on that all right let me ask you a question I think many viewers are probably wondering for any of these senators for any of you senators right now they're supposed to be in a Pietschmann trial at some point we've got this situation with Iran what should what should be the focus of Congress right now I think Congress has to do both of our constitutional responsibilities one protect the American people and the coracle branch of government with the administration to make sure that we keep Americans safe secondly we also have to take on the responsibility of what's going to come over at some point from the house and that's to conduct a full and fair trial and you said at some point it should speaker Pelosi send these over tomorrow I think I still have hopes that as we all step up and take that oath and to be impartial jurors that there can be agreement amongst the Senators all of our colleagues that we ought to make sure we get the facts and part of the facts ought to be let's make sure we hear from people with direct knowledge of what happened in the case of the situation with Ukraine we've seen already in the last couple of weeks over the holidays where information is trickled out with additional documents why wouldn't we want to have that information before we here this could excope this could actually exonerate the president but you've got to be able to have that information these individuals come forward right I guess do you still advise do you think the speaker should withhold the articles until she gets some assurances on what the trial looks like I still think when the Senators come back take that out to be impartial jurors that the responsibility that that will put upon us that we'll find a path to get the information we need just to have that full and fair trial I want to get this behind us but we've got to have the information you didn't directly answer this question do you think this is a good strategy by her or not I'm gonna let the speaker decide that I am gonna also say though that I think the seriousness of this particularly when we've got these issues involving Iran and you know the protection of Americans at stake I hope we'll all take a deep breath and say let's go through this in a full orderly responsible process and that's gonna require frankly acts some of these documents in at least letting the people who were the president's own men have a chance to come in and tell their story mark one of the ranking member of the Intelligence Committee thanks for coming on and sharing your views happy new year sir thank you you got it

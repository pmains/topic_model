I'm so glad to be here today with my friend Tina Smith um we're both working together in the Senate on the issue of child care it was bad before the corona virus hit but now this is a really huge problem in America we're both moms who understand what it was like to struggle to get child care now that problem has gotten a whole lot worse so Tina I'm so glad you're here to talk about it well thank you Elizabeth it's great to be talking about this with you too and I know that both of us have seen the impacts of a lack of childcare firsthand you know I was just telling you I'm gonna become a new grandmother one of the first things our kid had to do was to start to get in line for a childcare center in our community because there's such a shortage and do you know that in Minnesota 2/3 of the zip codes in our state had a shortage of childcare they're called child care deserts because they have only one child care slot for every three children I think it's the same nationally as well in more than half the states in this country child care costs more than going to college families just can't do that it's so it's such an expense it could be you know 20 30 40 percent of your annual income you know a lot of people don't realize this but an average childcare provider the workers in these childcare centers mostly women many of them women of color are only making about $11 an hour which is not enough to support a family so you have women working in childcare centers that are literally unable to buy their own groceries while they're taking care of other people's children and this is all part of the big problem before coded took over and has wreaked havoc on daycare providers this is a real problem and it means lots of childcare centers are just flat going to go out of business and so this is Elizabeth why you and I have teamed up to try to come up with a solution to this problem it doesn't just hope and pray that these centers will be there when we need them but and realize that we have to all be in this together to help them through this really really challenging huh that's right and we have a plan for that and the plan starts with money because we need to put more money into our childcare centers this is basic infrastructure in this country if we want people to be able to go back to work we want to get this economy started again that means it's time for a federal investment and the experts told us that we need to spend a minimum of fifty billion dollars in order to shore up this system and you know you might be listening to this and saying holy cow that is a lot of money how can we afford that but I want everyone to think that we have just recently said that it was worth it to spend 50 billion dollars shoring up just one industry in the chair's Act and this is a sector that is million thousands of jobs around the country so I think it the question is can we afford not to do this in this moment that's right you know we're in an emergency and a big part of the bill that you and I have put together is to say that essential workers will be able to count on that child care and that the rest of us are going to help pay for we're also going to make sure that the child care providers have the money they need to need the new expenses the kind of cleaning and distancing that it's going to take to run childcare centers going forward I've been talking to child care providers and you really do hear when you talk to the teachers both how much they love the work how much they want to be there with the children how much they want to be there to support the families but also how grinding it has been to see their revenues drop to see what was already a business that was just barely profitable go into the red week after week after week it's time for us to pass our child care bill and make sure there are enough resources in child care centers that they're going to be up and operational safe and healthy places for our children all across this country we're going to do this thing together Tina Elizabeth let's make sure that we get this done and we need everybody to lift up your voices and tell everybody how import this is so that we can get this bill passed and we can make sure that those childcare centers are thriving on Main streets across this country just like we need tell your story about why childcare is important to you and why you support putting more resources into trial care awesome all right thank you Hey very good work good I like this

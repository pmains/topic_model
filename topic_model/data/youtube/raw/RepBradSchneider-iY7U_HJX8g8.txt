I rise today deeply disappointed that this
House has again put attacking women’s health over the important priorities the American
people sent us here to address. More than 4 million individuals across the
country, many of them low-income, uninsured, or young, depend on Title X for family planning
and related preventive care. This is life-saving care: birth control, HIV
and other STI testing, and cancer screenings to name but a few. The resolution that passed today allows states
to deny trusted reproductive health care providers from receiving Title X funds for purely ideological
reasons. Already 14 states have taken official action
to exclude Planned Parenthood and other critical reproductive health care providers from serving
patients through the Title X program. This shameful legislation puts politics ahead
of women’s health and does a disservice to women and families across our nation.

michigan but we've got a really special member of congress who's who's up next freshman member congresswoman deb ross from north carolina for five minutes thank you very much madam chairwoman and thank you so much to everybody who's testified today on this crucial crucial issue um i represent the second district in north carolina which is the research triangle area and we are a very stem-focused area as a matter of fact yesterday i was the special guest for a stem charter school um that drew people from several municipalities several counties and let me tell you the diversity of the young women at that charter school was something to behold um but i have north carolina state university in my district land grant stem um university that gets a fair amount of money from the national science foundation and is doing really really well i was with them and uh the second gentleman and uh the secretary of transportation last week seeing all the amazing work that they're doing um in engineering and other areas i also represent two hbcus that used to have medical schools and they very much want to be able to benefit from research funding and offer more stem to their students but both presidents of these hbcus shaw and saint oggs said that they simply do not have some of the infrastructure and the equipment to do that kind of research and so i'll direct this first to uh dr blasey and then anybody else who wants to pipe in um how can nsf help with that fundam just the capacity building because the talent and the students and the desire are all there yes uh thank you for that question congresswoman russ well it gets back to that partnership to build the intellectual capacity it's not enough for students just to visit and it it takes time for the faculty to learn the technology and the intellectual aspects of a new topic so one way is fellowships with the already established universities and then those individuals those faculty members those scientists can take back that uh expertise back to their school and these days the partnership can be virtual so but i think really a partnership to get the intellectual expertise infrastructure is a problem for uh emerging research institutions nsf does have a program major research instrumentation program and medium scale and i think the answer is to increase the funding for those programs which is in the bill but to be mindful of how those resources are distributed to broaden research opportunity okay i also have a question um for dr farooq um also at nc state which gets a fair amount of nsf funding international students make up 35 of their graduate student population as a matter of fact my husband got his graduate degree in engineering there and he said he was one of the only us citizens in his graduate program um and but we need all of these graduate students for the research that we do here and in your um testimony you talked about um how in your words you were an early contributor to the leaky pipeline problem in stem how can we be more inviting of those graduate students i also serve on the judiciary committee and we're dealing with some necessary changes i hope to our immigration laws but uh tell me how you think we can keep this talent here in the united states after we've educated these wonderful people well thank you for that question um the stem problem that leaky pipeline problem that in my time is actually very different from the stem problem that we are seeing now for instance you know i have a student who graduated from carnegie mellon university in computer science and he worked for intern with apple intern with darpa and he is now doing touring with the bands to do their sound system because he just does not find what our big tech is doing as it doesn't agree with his moral or ethical position so a lot of there's a lot of concerns that about big tech that that that fresh graduates they're feeling and that's why there is a network of 31 universities called public interest technology university network that the new america foundation started and my institution is a part of they're trying to address uh this this this gap that you know our technology is obviously meeting our market needs but not addressing our societal values so so that you know we can retain because the nonprofit sector is not big enough for these talents now in terms of uh retaining uh students the competition in abroad is is very different now because there's a lot of places a lot of options to go for people so we need to be actually trying to grow our home talent here at home as much as we can and to go back to the question about hbcu and community and and also the previous question about community college we need to give them an infrastructure to participate you know when i was at the city university of new york which also has a group of community colleges and we had a two-tiered granting program where the community colleges competed with community colleges because what happens in when they come in and big grants as a partner the large universities dominate and they don't have any opportunity to participate when i was at purdue university i was part of the university transportation centers we had members of martin university for example in indianapolis they they just did not could not participate in any of the activities on any of the research projects we were doing so it's kind of bringing also an equity in the system for for the for for these uh uh also part of our r d system for them to participate because they're going to become very very important as we make this transition as the point made earlier that about two years colleges as we transition people are not going to go back and get a four-year degree and this will be the quickest way to through a changing career so future of work and so forth so i think uh nsf can pay attention to that and look at examples that are around thank you very much and i've exceeded my time madam chair i yield back

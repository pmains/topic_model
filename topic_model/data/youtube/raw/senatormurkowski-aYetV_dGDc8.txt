on the fire as i mentioned what we're seeing up in the state right now 512 fires this year covering 2.8 million acres of land um interior received 1.5 billion in the infrastructure bill for wildland fire or wildfire mitigation and preparedness i think it goes without saying but we certainly need funding to conduct the hazardous fuels reduction can you tell me how much of the infrastructure money has been distributed and and how soon you expect to see that funding get out the door thank you so much the bipartisan infrastructure law provided over 1.4 billion for interiors fire programs over a five-year period wildland fire management program allocated 407 million in 2022. uh the interior and u.s forest service recently announced 120 million will be paid out as a supplemental salary payments to wildland firefighters that that was so we could raise um everyone's pay to 15 an hour some programs will take longer to implement fully because of upfront planning and other requirements and can i stop you on that because when when i asked a similar question uh in the energy committee recently uh to to chief moore he said you need to have a plan this this is this is an issue where again i think the states have have plenty of plans that are out there and so i'm not sure where where the issue is in in getting these these resources directed out to the states so um i'm i'm trying to follow this through uh with forest service so um if there's if there's still some delay if we're waiting for plans in the meantime places are on fire um so can you help me in in understanding what more we can be doing to get these funds out the door i i don't i mean i'm happy to go back as you know we have um we work with the forest service um quite a bit with respect to wildland fire um i'm happy to have someone follow up with with your staff on this issue and make sure that everything is in place and and willing to to do whatever we can to make sure it happens i appreciate that

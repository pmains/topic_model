Thank You mr. Speaker I rise today to recognize the 100th anniversary of the Scottsbluff national monuments official designation having grown up in Goering Nebraska I'm proud of the monument and the uniquely American story of the role it played in our westward migration as one of the highest points in Nebraska dominating the landscape it stood as an unmistakable part of the Oregon Trail when I look at the monument I can't help but think of the brave pioneers of the Oregon Trail stunning sights an Oregon Trail landmarks such as Scottsbluff National Monument must have been a source of awe on the arduous journey west it had to have served as motivation to keep going and a relief to know they were well on their way Scottsbluff was named for Hiram Scott a fur trader who died nearby in 1828 just as the monuments name comes from early economic activity in our region the monument is still important to our regional economy trying 150,000 people from across America and around the world each and every year I would like to thank the great folks who dedicate their time and hard work to keep the park in great condition so others may enjoy enjoy it for generations to come it is with great pleasure I join with all Nebraskans to celebrate the centennial of this Oregon Trail icon Thank You mr. Speaker I yield back

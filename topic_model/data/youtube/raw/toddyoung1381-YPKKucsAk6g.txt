so when we when we respond to an overdose the opioid usually has rendered the person unconscious and then what actually they quit breathing we had one run a while back and we had to wake this girl up her dad was actually doing CPR on her because you know he couldn't feel the pulse and she wasn't breathing so we were actually able to revive her with the narcan and she was 23 weeks pregnant so we actually ended up picking her up two or three times within a three-month period but she was so hooked to this see this so although she was 23 gets pregnant she couldn't take that happen she couldn't kick to have it her I think the opioid crisis this is for so many communities issue number one I'm here in Greenfield Indiana to learn more about what I can do is a federal legislature to make sure that every Hoosier and every American has a fair shot at success regardless of the challenges they might be facing you're on the frontlines your first responders you are seeing people are trying to kick the habit of opioids or hooked on opioids or in crisis situations every day we need to make sure that together we can help people kick the habit and help everyone realize our Parishad and so it takes just a person to it takes it takes community that help these people to get there but what these community heroes are doing to the roof wise is so important whether it's addiction to opioids or other substances we want to make sure that we can help remove those barriers so that people can pursue their dreams [Music]

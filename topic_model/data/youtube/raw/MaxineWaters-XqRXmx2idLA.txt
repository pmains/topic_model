i would like to express my concerns with the department of justice review of the proposed comcast nbc merger over the past 20 years our federal and our trust laws have been so eroded that many believe that our regulatory agencies will simply rubber stamp any large transaction that comes before them corporations and institutions do not uh become too big to fail overnight at some point there is a failure of oversight i just heard someone commend you for the changes that you had made but i'm not aware of them and maybe you can talk a little bit about that today moreover many legal experts argue that the guiding principles that have historically framed doj merger review proceedings are obsolete and there is no real way for the american public to gauge how doj will review transactions such as comcast nbc merger in fact many industry insiders believe that ultimately the doj and fcc will approve this merger without fully considering the public interest comcast corporation is already airing commercials advertising uh commercial advertisings given the impression that its merger with nbc universal is a done deal and you need to know that we did get the cooperation of the fcc to extend the comment period and now we are organizing and about 60 members of congress have signed a petition to get public hearings and i hope that before doj makes this decision that they would ask the fcc if in fact they're going to hold those hearings and you have the benefit of that information therefore to the extent you're able to discuss i would like to hear from you about what this dog doj is doing to ensure that federal anti-trust principles are respected within current and future merger reviews and more broadly and i trust the big one the media merger the uh purchase of nbc by comcast um and um how you view these things uh we're concerned because of the size of uh this uh this purchase and we're concerned that this consolidation will cause comcast to own movie studios uh internet um cable uh broadband you name it and some of these mergers they don't have any public hearings on we worked with um the fcc and they did agree to extend the comment period now what is your responsibility well we certainly look at these uh for their impact on competition and whether or not they um unnecessarily consolidate uh things that should be separate the justice department does not typically hold hearings or does not hold hearings when we conduct our anti-trust investigations i understand that the fcc perhaps has had one or is planning to have one and that certainly um i think is is in there for them to decide the work that the justice department does uh is typically done in a non-uh public setting would you be advantaged in any way if you had information from a public hearing from uh all kinds of production groups and people involved in media about the lack of access to ownership and programming and management and all of that would that help you in any way with your decision sure i mean we make our best decisions when we have access to the greatest amount of information so public hearings that would draw this information out could be helpful to you is that right they could be but we will be taking our own steps to try to reach out to effective potentially affected parties and individuals can get information from them but certainly anything that develops the record that gets more information out there that we have that we can have access to would be something that would be good and can i have my staff talk with you about what steps you will be perhaps we could be of assistance uh coming from the los angeles area where we have lots of people in production et cetera that's really concerned about this uh this purchase okay sure be glad to talk to you enough but again there are limits that when we have ongoing investigations there's only so much that we can discuss but i think in terms there may be uh whatever you can do maybe things we can discuss though

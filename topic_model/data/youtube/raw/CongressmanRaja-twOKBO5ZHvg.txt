these records that the fbi got from mar-a-lago have classifications that include top-secret and sensitive compartmentalized information which is a category that's designed to protect secrets that which if revealed could harm u.s interests the fbi executed this search warrant and they did that based on these several laws as we've reported but we don't know who would be targeted or if this was as we were discussing with our experts at the top of the hour just a focused effort to recover materials and there might never be any charges donald trump had the power to declassify which certainly complicates some aspects of this although it's not a blank check for anything after he left office given the issues of intelligence here having done what's in there in the receipt and what's the law we turn to well a coequal branch of government that also deals with intelligence congressman raja krishnamurthy of illinois is on the house intelligence committee thanks for making time tonight thank you ari um when you look at this as a security matter almost putting to the side uh the difficult intricate questions around the criminal enforcement of the intelligence laws which as we've reported have been used against many senior officials democrats like sandy berger the clinton administration general petraeus who served both parties but was cheered by republicans let's put that to the side and just ask you what do you see as the national security risk here if any based on the new information we have i'm looking to pick it back up based on the new information we have uh in this rather remarkable list well i think that uh what draws my attention more than anything else are the statutes that are at play here including the espionage act and the portion of the espionage act related to defense information and when you mix the classification ts sci and the words defense information that raises a big question because um you know i members of the committee intelligence committee such as myself and others we deal with these ts sci documents every day but there are literally people looking over our shoulders as we review these documents and never have we ever taken those documents out of a secure facility in fact they take they keep an inventory to make sure that every single document remains in the possession uh of the folks who are the custodians in the secure facility would they have a specific material but again we're we're not asking you to reveal what you can't or speculate on what's in there we've been careful about that but because we're in we're in acronym soup now here you give me five letters twice if we were in a movie or a hypothetical are we talking about an assessment are we talking about the locations of things what kind of thing are we talking about it could be any any of those issues it could also be about covert action programs it could be about in fact it could be about programs that not even all members of the intelligence community at even senior levels are aware of that is how sensitive that information is when they say compartmented that means that only certain people even within the intelligence community are allowed to see those documents and others are not so we're talking about stuff that um quite frankly our adversaries should never get a hold of yeah republicans have had a couple different points of attack this week take a listen when you've got an attorney general that has a history of going after parents because they go to a school board meeting but not to talk the american public that creates real problems i do not trust uh the fbi i don't trust the upper leisure echelons the department of justice this corruption has run deep it's been running deep since the hillary clinton email scandal the fbi rate of president trump is a complete abuse and overreach of its authority so before you jump to conclusions and just accept information from un from sources who are not the attorney general who are not the director of the fbi let's see what the facts are let's see i mean this is what i guess some people didn't know that it would come out and it would appear again this is subject to the courts and uh i will report if there's a court proceeding that casts doubt on any of this if this material is not substantiated we will go beyond the warrant but we already have more information now than we did yesterday that does suggest that the fbi found a lot of material that was in their view improperly taken or stolen by donald trump or others around him and held even after it was under subpoena and that's what they took now if they took any of mr trump's personal property for example that they don't have access to as you know and i think viewers understand he can go to court and try to get it back um what does evidence here show you in response to what we just heard from some of your colleagues well look i don't think the fbi was there to take his bowling trophies from the white house i think that this was stuff that obviously they at some point they asked for it back it appears uh it appears that the national archives working with lawyers trying to get it back even had a subpoena issued for this information and it didn't get returned and so given all the other concerns we have about the president people who are surrounding him their extensive foreign ties their financial distress there's always been a concern about uh just the counterintelligence risks associated with people like that especially when they have access to such precious information can i just address one other thing that was mentioned in some of those comments which is you hear a lot of vitriol and you hear a lot of rather sometimes violent rhetoric from these folks and when they do that it leads to the problems that we saw yesterday at this fbi field office in cincinnati and i think that they really need to cool their rhetoric big time are you saying are you saying that we just heard from uh house leaders mccarthy stephanie are you saying they contribute to the environment that caused that violence yeah it it kind of feeds a a climate where pretty much uh people engage in uh what i what i think is politically violent rhetoric and we all know what that what happens when you have a uh kind of a echo chamber of this stuff especially on social media there are nuts out there who will basically act upon that rhetoric yeah i appreciate you raising that we've been we've been covering and tracking all of that final question uh these are major intelligence breaches according to the fbi uh what if anything will the intelligence committee that you serve on do about this well i think first of all we'll probably want to ask for an update or briefing on these materials in a little more depth and what if anything is being done to make sure that anything related to those issues is safeguarded um and of course we want to know if there were any consequences associated with any potential breaches that occurred here um suffice it to say that i'm sure that they're professionals right now as we speak in the intelligence community who are trying to figure this out and of course as part of the intelligence committee we we have to exercise oversight with regard to that process understood a congressman thank you for making time here on friday evening a big breaking story we are going to fit in a break you are watching

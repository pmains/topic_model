joe biden's so-called america is back foreign policy plan is already looking like a complete and total joke biden botched the withdrawal of u.s forces from afghanistan allowing the taliban to take complete control in just a matter of days biden's afghan mess is also a failure for the media who propped him up remember how they endlessly screamed that donald trump was destroying the u.s global reputation pretending biden was some type of savior well joe has now managed to shame our country in just a matter of weeks with some experts raising a red flag that our adversaries will capitalize on the chaos warning the u.s has tarnished its credibility with allies like taiwan and hong kong joining us to discuss is retired navy commander and florida congressman scott franklin congressman thanks for being on the show tonight we appreciate it thank you jen good to be here with you oh congressman i want to play a clip from cnn a taliban leader speaking about their end goal essentially let's take a listen it's our belief that one day mujahideen will have victory and islamic law will come not to just afghanistan but all over the world we are not in a hurry we believe it will come one day jihad will not end until the last day now of course so many americans sitting at home watching these horrific videos play out in afghanistan and many saying what does this mean for me here in the united states what does this mean for americans uh they've released all these uh afghan these taliban prisoners al-qaeda prisoners uh what's what's next for america well we should be very concerned i mean this is exactly what our adversaries have hoped for that's what they expected and sadly uh that's what they've gotten i'm angered i'm frustrated uh incredibly disheartened at how rapidly this situation has changed but it's completely of president biden's own uh infliction uh he i don't know if what sort of advice he got but it was bad advice we look to get to the bottom of that in time but right now we've got a commitment uh to get the people out that helped us uh over these past 20 years we cannot cut and run on them like we're doing now and you know congressman also on president biden are the women and children left behind in afghanistan many of them they've been educated women who've had jobs that are now fearing for their lives as they should be yeah this is a ruthless regime you know people some are saying that this is not al qaeda this is taliban these are all terrorists they brutalize their people they have before and they will continue to do so and we've set them up for it what do you say to families congressmen who have lost their loved ones in this war that's a tough one you know it's um you look back now over the over the past 20 years and the thousands of lives that we've lost and it's not just american lives you know for for every american life there have been a couple of dozen uh town of afghani lives so for the president to say today that the the afghanis don't have the will to fight and then basically imply that they're cowards uh it's just it's shameful for a man who has never spent one day in uniform in his life serving any country much less the united states it's just shameful that he would say things like that but these people have a right to live to be in fear now yeah well americans are watching closely as the biden administration takes a vacation it seems these next couple of days congressman franklin thank you so much for being with us tonight thank you as we watch the taliban rapidly destroy freedom in afghanistan we are seeing it die slowly in the united states

point five trillion dollar spending plan that we've been talking about for the last several months here on wake up including raising the corporate tax rate from 21 percent to 26 and a half percent for more on this let's welcome in iowa congresswoman and member of the house budget and appropriations committee ashley hinson good morning congresswoman good morning thanks for having me on of course so this proposal includes top corporate and individual tax rates of 26.5 and 39.6 what do you see as the biggest problems with this bill well it's coming at a time when our economy needs to be unleashed and this is not the way to do that i just did a main street business tour in my district and we're seeing incredible inflation the highest in more than a decade and year over year the highest we've seen so this is not the time to continue that spending spigot that the democrats have rolling and have been rolling on this idea that we need to be spending we don't have on priorities americans don't want or need right now so these small main street businesses are the ones who are truly suffering right now and then you add a corporate tax rate that makes us more taxed than china it puts us at an incredible disadvantage so again americans don't need these kinds of tax hikes we need to be unleashing opportunity we need to be unleashing freedom we need less government not more government yeah the philosophical difference here i i agree with you congresswoman a broad definition of inflation is too many dollars chasing too few goods i made a quick little list just of some of the price differences year over year car rentals up 73 gas prices up 98 cents nationwide right now hotel prices up 24 if you're buying pork ribs or steak at the grocery store 13.7 percent if you're a parent like i am and i've got young kids that drink milk i'd be better off buying a cow because milk prices are up almost nine percent right now and every time i go i'm like six dollars for a gallon of milk um joe manchin says he's gonna vote no for this bill does that make this bill instantly dead in the water yeah well i think the way it's written now it absolutely is dead on arrival in the senate and so i think democrats need to come back to the table again we should be focusing on priorities that americans want to talk about right now holding our administration accountable for what's happened in afghanistan and talking about policies that actually will help our businesses as we're you know talking about this pandemic continuing i respect senator manchin in speaking out about being responsible for future pandemics and future spending challenges that we may face we need to be putting the brakes on this on this package because ultimately as we know the way that the house progressive democrats want this 3.5 trillion isn't even enough so um so i'm hopeful that they will come to the table and and have some serious conversations about uh stopping this this spending spree that they're on but again this is about um you know making sure that the american taxpayer is respected they're darn tired of these continued talks about taking more and more of their money again this is affecting your your main street businesses your mom's driving a minivan just like me when you're talking about the price of milk going up i've got a 10 and 8 year old boy who go through a lot of milk so i understand those grocery shopping trips and how much they cost and ultimately that just takes away any resources any family might have to go on a family vacation or go support a main street business and um so that i think is going to be um it's just i don't know what universe they're living in where they think this is a good idea right now yeah you talk about main street right and and these tax hikes these potential tax hikes a lot you hear from the body administration say well this is just going to affect the rich but it really doesn't does it it does affect everyone yeah inflation is a tax on every every american and i think we've seen and we've been sounding the alarm on this for months that you talk about spending and then supply we have a supply chain that's broken we should be looking at policies that can help fix that we shouldn't be moving toward electric vehicle only which is uh putting our biofuels producers in iowa at an incredible disadvantage we have green fuels ready to go um and we should be focusing on those infrastructure conversations rather than again spending on pie in the sky ideas that just insert more government in your life from cradle to grave all right congresswoman ashley henson thank you so much for joining us we appreciate it hopefully

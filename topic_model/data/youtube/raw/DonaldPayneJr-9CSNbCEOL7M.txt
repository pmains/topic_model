 MR. SPEAKER, WHEN   SPEAKER PELOSI TOOK THE GAVEL  ON JANUARY 3, SHE WAS  SURROUNDED BY CHILDREN, AND AS   SHE BROUGHT DOWN THE GAVEL TO  COMMENCE THE 116TH CONGRESS,   THESE WERE HER WORDS -- I NOW  CALL THE HOUSE TO ORDER ON   BEHALF OF ALL AMERICA'S  CHILDREN.  THE IMPORTANCE OF SPEAKER  PELOSI'S WORDS CANNOT BE   OVERSTATED.  LAST YEAR WAS HORRENDOUS FOR   CHILDREN IN OUR COUNTRY. IF WE LOOK AT GUN VIOLENCE OR  IMMIGRATION OR HEALTH CARE OR  POVERTY RELIEF, CHILDREN   SUFFERED YEAR -- LAST YEAR   UNDER THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION   AND A REPUBLICAN CONGRESS. ON FEBRUARY 14, 2018, A GUN MAN  WALKED INTO MARJORY STONEMAN   DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL IN   PARKLAND, FLORIDA, TO COMMIT   MASS MURDER. 17 PEOPLE WERE KILLED. ANOTHER 17 WERE INJURED, AND   MOST OF THEM WERE CHILDREN.  THE PARKLAND SHOOTING WASN'T   THE FIRST SCHOOL SHOOTING IN   OUR NATION'S HISTORY, AND IT   WASN'T THE LAST. BUT THE PARKLAND STUDENTS,   STANDING ON THE SHOULDERS OF   STUDENT LEADERS BEFORE THEM,   STOOD UP AND MARCHED.  THEY BOWED TOGETHER IN THE   INTERSECTIONAL NATIONWIDE  MOVEMENT TO DEMAND THAT  CONGRESS AND THE PRESIDENT DO  SOMETHING TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY  SAFER. UNFORTUNATELY, THEIR PLEAS FELL  ON DEAF EARS.  THE PRESIDENT AND HIS  ADMINISTRATION WERE TOO INEPT,   TOO COWARDLY TO CONFRONT THE   N.R.A. AND BECAUSE MY COLLEAGUES  ACROSS THE AISLE WERE TOO INEPT  AND TOO COWARDLY TO CONFRONT   THE N.R.A., WE WITNESSED   PREVENTABLE SHOOTING AFTER   PREVENTABLE SHOOTING.  THEN, WHEN THE TRUMP   ADMINISTRATION FINALLY DID   RELEASE THE SCHOOL SAFETY  COMMISSION REPORT, IT  COMPLETELY IGNORED   EVIDENCE-BASED VIOLENCE AND  PREVENTION STRATEGIES. INSTEAD, THE REPORT SUGGESTED  ROLLING BACK CIVIL RIGHTS  PROTECTIONS FOR STUDENTS AND   MAKING GUNS MORE EASILY  ACCESSIBLE IN SCHOOLS. LOOK, THERE IS A COMMONALITY   AMONG THE MASS SHOOTINGS IN  AMERICA'S SCHOOLS AND EASY   ACCESS TO FIREARMS.  RATHER THAN ADDRESS THE ROOT   CAUSE OF SCHOOL SHOOTINGS, THE   TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SUGGESTED   THAT WE PUT GUNS IN CLASSROOMS   AND AS IF TEACHERS ARE SECURITY  GUARDS AND SCHOOLS ARE PRISON  -- AS IF TEACHERS ARE SECURITY   GUARDS AND SCHOOLS ARE PRISONS.  NOBODY THINKS THIS IS A GOOD   IDEA EXCEPT FOR THE N.R.A. MEANWHILE, EDUCATORS ACROSS THE  COUNTRY ARE CLAMORING FOR  FUNDING TO INSTALL NEW LOCKS ON  CLASSROOM DOORS, HARDEN SCHOOL   ENTRYWAYS AND SECURE SCHOOL  FACILITIES.  THE 116TH CONGRESS WAS CALLED  INTO ORDER ON BEHALF OF ALL  CHILDREN, BECAUSE DEMOCRATS  WILL LISTEN TO TEACHERS AND  STUDENTS, NOT THE N.R.A. THAT'S WHY WE PASSED TWO BILLS   IN FEBRUARY TO INCITY TUITT  UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND --  INSTITUTE UNIVERSITY BACKGROUND  CHECKS AND CLOSE THE CHARLESTON  LOOPHOLE.  THAT'S WHY I INTRODUCED THE  SAFER NEIGHBORHOOD GUN BUYBACK   ACT TO SAVE CHILDREN'S LIVES.  WE WERE CALLED INTO ORDER ON   BEHALF OF ALL CHILDREN,  INCLUDING THOSE WHO ARE AT OUR   BORDERS. UNDER THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION   AND SECRETARY KIRSTJEN NIELSEN,  BOTH OF WHOM WERE EMPOWERED BY   MY COLLEAGUES ACROSS THE AISLE,  THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA   RIPPED CHILDREN AWAY FROM THEIR  PARENTS AND PUT THEM IN CAGES. RIPPING CHILDREN AWAY FROM   THEIR PARENTS AND LYING ABOUT  IT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WAS  EVIL, PLAIN AND SIMPLE, AND IT   SHOULD HAVE ENDED SECRETARY  NIELSEN'S CAREER.  I FEEL SECRETARY NIELSEN IS  INCOMPETENT, INEPT, AND IS NOT   UP TO THE TASK OF SECURING THE   HOMELAND'S SAFETY. ANYONE THAT WOULD PUT CHILDREN   IN CAGES, FENCED CAGES, TAKEN  FROM THEIR PARENTS CAN JUST NOT  BE TRUSTED.  PRESIDENT TRUMP'S DEPLORABLE,  INHUMANE ATTEMPT TO CHANGE OUR   IMMIGRATION --   THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE   GENTLEMAN'S TIME HAS EXPIRED.  MR. PAYNE: HAS KILLED PEOPLE.  AND WITH THAT, MR. SPEAKER, I  YIELD BACK.  THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE   GENTLEMAN'S TIME HAS EXPIRED.  MEMBERS ARE REMINDED TO REFRAIN  FROM ENGAGING IN PERSONALITIES   TOWARD THE PRESIDENT.  THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES THE   GENTLEMAN FROM NEW MEXICO, MR.   LUJAN, FOR FIVE MINUTES. MR. LUJAN: THANK YOU, MR.  SPEAKER. I'M PROUD TO STAND BEFORE YOU  TODAY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF H.R.  1. I WANT TO START BY THANKING  CONGRESSMAN SARBANES AND   SPEAKER PELOSI, CHAIRWOMAN ZOE   LOFGREN, AND MY COLLEAGUES FOR   THEIR WORK ON THIS ISSUE.  H.R. 1 IS HISTORIC LEGISLATION.  IT WILL RESTORE TRANSPARENCY IN  OUR GOVERNMENT AND PUT THE   POWER BACK IN THE HANDS OF THE   PEOPLE.  IT WILL REDUCE THE ROLE OF DARK  MONEY IN POLITICS AND MAKE IT  EASIER TO VOTE.  PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY, IT   WILL REAFFIRM THAT THIS IS THE   PEOPLE'S HOUSE, AND OUR WORK   HERE IS FOR THEM.  THERE CAN BE NOTHING MORE

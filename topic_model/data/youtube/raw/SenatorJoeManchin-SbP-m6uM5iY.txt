Putin's war on Ukraine
with the energy - it's an energy war. Putin's war on
Ukraine and what we're going through there. And
also seeing us now, I have I have a little bit of a
concern with the administration's position
on the energy we produce in our country. And we
could do a little bit more working with our Canadian
and our Mexican allies. With that being said, the
Iran, the Iran situation that we're talking, I
think things have stalled there on the Iran deal
again, but also, I'm concerned about Iran the
way we, the last deal that we made with Iran was not
made on basically winning or earning your way back
into a productive society from the standpoint we
were giving them too many reliefs on their sanctions
upfront, and then everything would come
through. With Iran's situation right now and
the oil that we have in a sanctions that moved Iran
back into the old business or bigger, and also in
Venezuela, what effect do you think that would have
on the Iranian government for them to have that flow
of cash again? Senator, I'm probably not
the best witness to answer that part of the question.
I can tell you from a military stability
perspective, which I am competent to talk about,
my principal interest in Iran is ensuring that they
don't attack us or our partners in the region,
directly or indirectly, to keep Iran deterred from
undertaking those kinds of activities. We have had
some success doing that over the last couple of
years, not complete success. But they're still, I mean,
indications they're still basically one of the
largest proliferators of terrorist attacks in that
part of the world, correct? That is absolutely
correct, Senator. And basically with Yemen
and all that they're still very much involved there,
supplying them. Iran is the principal
reason that the conflict in Yemen can't be brought
to a conclusion, in my judgment.

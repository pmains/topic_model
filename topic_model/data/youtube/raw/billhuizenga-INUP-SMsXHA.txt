russian dramatically it changes it because we know we can't i think as my friend trey had said punt pass and kick it down the road we have to deal with things we have to deal with our spending decisions and we have to make some very difficult decisions about what we're going to do with people's taxation and what we're going to do with their spending and their benefits that is what this is about number of weeks ago a month and a half or so ago when i believe all of us were here at the white house with the president president said there's nothing i could propose that you guys would go along with and myself and a couple of others we stuck around afterwards there's actually a photo that was uh that was uh put out by the white house of just the president and i talking and i was telling him that's not true that's not true i'm here for a solution i believe that solution can include an increase in the debt ceiling if and only if we are going to deal with these long-term issues so if we're going to get our way through this we have to have a plan that is going to cut our current spending it's going to cap our future spending and it's going to bring into balance the budget and the in the expenditures that the american people want they want it in michigan and i know that they want it in the united states as well and that's not too much to ask that we bring this option of state saying yay or nay to a balanced budget amendment for the u.s constitution thank you if all else fails what do you guys

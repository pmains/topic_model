hi everyone this is congresswoman kenny porter i represent california's 45th congressional district i'm in orange county california and what i wanted to do today is talk to you about the american rescue plan and the first thing i want to say about this is this is a rescue what this bill fundamentally is is disaster relief because the copa 19 pandemic has been an economic and a health disaster so we called it the american rescue plan because our economy our health our schools so many areas of our country need help so this is a disaster relief bill and that's how we're going to be thinking about what it does what are the problems it's trying to solve i'm going to walk you through what it does sometimes what it doesn't do and then be able to take some of your questions so thank you everyone for tuning in again i'm representative katie porter breaking down for you the big bill that was passed today by the house of representatives the american rescue plan so the first question you might have heard about this bill is it's big how big it's big it's big it's one point trillion it's 1.9 trillion how big is too big the bill totals about 1.9 trillion dollars in spending why is the bill so big because the problem that we're dealing with in our country is really big we're dealing with very high unemployment particularly among women of color and in certain industries our schools in many areas are closed food banks hunger record highs and of course people are still getting sick because of kova 19. so yes the bill is big but you know that phrase a day late and a dollar short congress was definitely a day late in passing this bill we were many days late it took us months and months we had to elect a new president to even pass this bill to help the american people so we might be a day late but we didn't go a dollar short we tried to make the bill meet the size of the problem so what's in it where does this money go and how is it going to help our economy and our society so i want to start with this the survival checks and this has been probably one of the most talked about parts of this bill these survival checks are the payments that you're going that you've been hearing about that you're going to be getting automatically now the amount of those survival checks is going to be 1400 in most instances and if you recall congress previously passed a six hundred dollar payment so you're gonna get fourteen hundred dollars and this applies to about 85 of households in the united states so we're talking about a big amount of families getting help that's important because a huge number of families have been hurt by covet 19 even those who maybe haven't lost their income have seen increased expenses more expenses for child care more expenses for commuting because of no public transportation things like that so those 1400 payments will go again to 85 of american families and there is a cutoff when your income gets above a certain level you don't get the payment so where is the cutoff if you're single the cost of which you'll receive no payment is 80 000. if you're like me a single parent or you file as head of household the cutoff is going to be 120 000 and if you're married and you file jointly the cutoff is going to be 100 nope that's wrong 160 000 all right now one of the things that i criticized about with this bill is that um you know i think that different families this doesn't necessarily line up there are families who are heads of household who are in real trouble there are families who are married who both kept their jobs but this is the basic threshold so if your income is below this you're going to get the survival check do you have to apply no they're going to automatically send you this money and it's going to be based on your last file of taxes so if you filed in 2020 for your 2020 taxes already you'll get it based on that if you filed for 2019 you'll get it based on that if your income's changed they'll send you a plus up down the road so you should be watching for these payments president biden has made clear he knows that there are families who are not able to make the rent are not able to put their food on the table and they want to get this money out as fast as they can all right so watch for these checks and if you're below this income you should be getting a check hopefully in the next three to four weeks so be on the lookout and make sure you watch for it all right so that is the survival checks all right now the next thing i want to talk about is probably my personal favorite part of the bill which is the child tax credit now the child tax credit i don't admit anything that has tax credit in the title doesn't sound super super exciting but trust me on this the child tax credit is amazing because what we're going to do with this one part of the american rescue plan is cut child poverty in half we say that again we're going to cut child poverty in half and we have very high rates of child poverty in the united states compared to other countries this is an investment not just in people who have kids but this is an investment in our future workforce in the workforce that's going to be giving us american jobs and creating things for our future so how is this going to work families that have children will receive a 3 000 child tax credit um for their children per child okay if your children are six to 17 years old all right this does not look very good hang on all right and then if you have a little child a little a younger child you're going to get 3 600 per we're going to call these babies to 5 okay up through age 6. they're going to get 3 600 and this is a you know this is a big increase in the child tax credit uh it's gonna be based again on your last filed taxes either 2019 or 2020 um and this is really a big big deal um and so we're going to cut child poverty in half for so many of you i have heard over and over again you're struggling with the costs of child care the cost of putting a child in daycare for a young child can be 12 000 or even more in some states it's more than in-state college tuition that was my situation my daughter betsy's preschool cost more than her college tuition would have at the same time if she'd been at the university of california so you're going to be getting these benefits now one thing i want to point out here is something that i like to call a single parent penalty and this is something that i am continuing to work on i'm not going to give up but the way these tax credit the child tax credit is structured remember here how we saw single people can make up to 80. married people can make double that heads of household those single parents halfway in between it's the same structure for the child tax credits the numbers are a little bit different um we're looking at uh let me put this down here we're looking at 75 000 for single all right we're looking at 112 000 500 for those heads of households and we're looking for here i'll be 150 000 for marriage so what the issue i have here with this cutoff is that this is a child tax credit it's about the cost of having a child and no child should get less of a benefit just because the marital status of their parents is different so if you're a child living in a single parent family you are less likely to get the tax credit and you will get a smaller amount in some cases than children who are living in families with two parents a married couple and so this i call the single-parent penalty but to be clear who's really being punished here is children in single um single-parent households and those children all the research tells us need the most help trust me there is no discount for being a single parent i say that to you as you know the last congress the only single parent of young children serving in the in the congress if you know of any chain stores anything that gives a discount to single parents text me because i want to start shopping there so the problem with this is it's not going to give equal child tax credit to children in single-family households but you still will qualify if you're below these income limits um and so certainly for children and near the poverty line this is going to make a huge huge difference all right that is our child tax credit okay i'm going to move over to the other side here so i can tell you about the next part um which is unemployment the reality is the pandemic has caused really really high unemployment um unemployment rates in this country hasn't seen since the great depression and what we have done here in the american rescue plan is providing a continued increase in the unemployment benefit that people get now remember unemployment is something that we all pay into when we're employed it's called unemployment insurance for a reason it's not a giveaway we all pay into this system so that when we become an employee it will be there for us but in many cases that unemployment amount is not enough to allow people to keep a roof over their head and food on the table so what we've done in the american rescue plan is to add 300 per week to the unemployment benefit and that is going to continue until september 6th all right so throughout the summer as we're continuing to fight the pandemic to get people vaccinated those who are still unemployed are going to see this additional three hundred dollars and that's going to go till september 6. meanwhile we want people to get back to work we want to get our economy open is until alright the virus under control we don't get the virus under control our economy can't fully open so how are we going to do that all right this first part by the way you can think about as money in the pocket um i don't really like to think about it as money in pockets because i think people need to spend this money to live and to make ends meet but this is sort of the money in the pocket part now i want to talk with you about shots in arms what are we doing to actually give people the shots and the care that they need so the american rescue plan we think about these shots and arms right in vaccines what is it doing it'll last 20 billion dollars for vaccination for vaccine programs so many of you are waiting and waiting and waiting to get vaccines this 20 billion dollars is going to make that more possible for those of you who are just joining just to remind you i'm representative katie porter i represent orange county california the 45th congressional district and i'm using this big white board to break down for you what's in the bill that passed the house of representatives today that will be signed by president it's called the american rescue plan but what's in it what is the plan americans deserve to know so i'm going through what's in it survival checks child tax credit increase in unemployment and now we're talking about the health benefits um the shots in arms so you're going to get 20 billion dollars toward vaccines just because we're vaccinating in the meantime we have to keep testing and we have to keep tracing we have to keep doing things to help um and so testing and tracing here 51 billion and so this is really part of how we're going to get our economy open and not need so much um not need so much financial assistance as if we fight the virus all right now we said money into people's into people's wallets shots into people's arms this is my favorite part of the plan as a mom of three kids in school gotta get that happening really really soon kids in school so what's going on there what the bill does is provide 130 billion dollars to state departments of education and what they're going to do is in turn give this money out to school districts they're going to provide extra resources and the goal here is not to open schools it's to open schools safely and that means having money for modifications that might need to be made to classrooms for additional ventilation to make sure we can space kids out more for personal protective equipment if needed and we're going to be able to get those kids in school now if you have younger children who are not in school you're worried about the cost of child care i've got a round table here in orange county california talking with child care providers they're closing they're struggling the number of students they have is going down it's estimated that a lot of these child care centers are going to close for good so we don't want that we already have a shortage of affordable quality child care in this country so what the bill does for younger kids all right so that's what it is for older kids for younger kids it provides 39 million [Music] for child development black grants um and then additional money as well into the child care stabilization fund so again i'm representative katie porter i represent orange county california the 45th congressional district this is my biggest whiteboard and i'm using it today to talk about the american rescue plan the bill was passed the house of representatives today what's in it and how is it going to help address both the virus and our economic problems so we've gone over getting money to people who need it unemployment help to households help to those with children money to people who need it we've talked about vaccines shots in arms testing tracing public health now we're talking about kids and this is both kids in school and child care i should also add um there's a chunk of money there around 40 billion similar to the child care amount to go to higher education now most of that money is targeted for emergency financial aid a lot of our students because of the high cost of college they're working to help pay for their tuition a lot of them worked in restaurants and in bars on this servers and a lot of those jobs are gone so emergency financial aid to help keep kids in college so they can finish their degree all right these are the major building blocks of the plan let me grab my notes and see if there's anything else i want to tell you about oh yes this is really really important um what would have happened what's going to happen when we do this what's our goal so obviously it's to fight the pandemic to get kids back in school to recover our economy what does that really look like with the american rescue plan what economists say is that we can return to full employment in about one year one year now that's still a long time that's why we provide this increase in unemployment through the fall that's why we're providing these survival checks but in about one year with this investment we should be able to get people back to work at the same level if we didn't take this action it would take more than three years to return employment to the pre-levels so this is an expensive plan it's money that we're making investing into families into children into schools into public health but the cost of doing nothing here would be to leave our economy in a devastating situation for more than three years we can't afford that families are going hungry kids are struggling but we also can't afford to fall behind every country in the world who has been able to get this virus under control and begin their economy back up so i want to encourage you to ask questions if you have any questions please type them in i'll do my best to answer them i even got the entire bill pulled up so i can try to look up and answer your questions but this is certainly not everything that's in the bill but if you think about the big building blocks where is most of the money going it's going to these things money for families shots in arms vaccine taste testing tracing getting kid helping kids get back in school child care and college and the effect of all of these things together is to be able to return people to jobs and that last point people in jobs there's an additional part of this bill that is targeted particularly to our service industry to restaurants there's a particular program to help assist restaurants and being able to stay in business even as they've had to close for a while and that'll help keep those restaurants open and keep those restaurant jobs alive so that's a big chunk of what we're going to be doing there also is some money um in the program um in addition to restaurants there's some money in the program 15 billion for economic injury disaster loans this is a small business program this was part of the cares act it was part of the second package that we passed and now it's part of the american rescue plan so if you are a small business please reach out to your local small business development center we have one here in orange county in irvine and these are free services of the small business administration to help you navigate figure out if you're eligible for one of these economic injury disaster loans figure out if you can apply for a paycheck protection ppp loan how to how to find a lender how to go through the process so if you're a small business that needs help and didn't get me or you need help and you need a little bit more reach out to your small business development center you don't need to pay anyone to help you get help your local small business development center is there for you um somebody asked a question about vaccines and they said are vaccines free yes vaccines are free period full stop you may be asked to provide your insurance card if you have insurance but nobody should be denied a vaccine because of inability to pay you shouldn't pay a site fee a visit fee a doctor's fee an equipment fee we all know that health care sometimes comes with a lot of these feats the vaccine and the process of getting that shot in your arm is free for every single american and i want to encourage people to get their vaccines when they're able to and on that note i want to remind people that with vaccines we're going to more than double in the month of march the number of vaccinations that we have put together in december january and february so i know i know you've been waiting and waiting refreshing apps signing up trying to get onto pharmacy websites calling your public health department but know that we've already vaccinated at least one dose 20 of americans and we're going to more than double that number in the next month so that's going to be a huge huge increase so please keep wearing your mask please stay home if you can please go outside stay safe limit indoor gatherings because the next four to six weeks we'll see most americans be able to get vaccinated by the fourth of july here in orange county our county public health department says by the fourth of july they hope to have been able to vaccinate everybody even children as they're waiting for that testing result so hang in there um somebody asked um i wanted to talk about this other big important pillar and i can't believe i forgot this part it's really really important see my marker there it's not bold enough for how important this is state and local funding all right the bill has a big chunk of money in it for state and local funding um the overall united states amount is about 350 billion some of that will go to departments of education um california where i'm standing today here california is estimated to get about 43 billion dollars why is this important why are we giving money to state and local governments because if we don't state and local governments will have to have dramatic layoffs of public employees they're going to make dramatic cuts to the very programs that people need right now programs like public health departments programs like child care programs like meals on wheels first responders law enforcement we don't want to worsen the unemployment that we already have by seeing state and local government lay people off and so money is going to go to each state larger cities will get their own amount of money and the state will dole out money to smaller cities we did this once before it was very very effective and i will tell you here in orange county um i represent the 45th congressional district and i'm most of my mayors most of my city council members most of my county commissioners are republicans i'm a democrat and let me tell you across the board what i've heard is that our cities need this money our counties need this money and our state needs this money they don't have the ability to to to deficit spend and so we need to be there as the federal government to backstop them and so that's a really really important part so to repeat california estimated to get about 43 billion every state is going to get money larger cities will get money and then smaller cities will also get resources and what's that going to do it's going to help keep people in jobs it's going to help keep our schools open get them open if they're not open and it's going to help provide critical social services to people all right let's see um what other questions we have um somebody asked about vaccine again we talked about the vaccine being free um and somebody said well some of these things that you've got up here depend on your income you get a different benefit depending on your income is there an income effect can i can i not get the vaccine do i have to pay for the vaccine if my income's too high no every single american is eligible to get a free vaccine so please watch out for any scams do not pay for your vaccine everybody is eligible to get a free vaccine regardless of your income and the vaccine is safe it's effective we have several more months of people who've gotten the shots they're not getting sick and most importantly the vaccine will protect you from being hospitalized and from dying of coving 19. period all three vaccines that are improved right now we have madera pfizer and johnson and johnson take whichever one you can get because all three of them are going to dramatically lower almost eliminate your risk of dying or being hospitalized from coping so please i know a lot of you want the vaccine and are trying hard to get it keep patient as the next couple weeks march april we are gonna see a lot more vaccine become available to younger people people with disabilities we're already vaccinating teachers in a lot of places so hang tight but no charge for the vaccine regardless of your income okay next question i have um is about affordable care act subsidies when people lose their job in this country they often lose their health insurance and so this additional amount of unemployment it helps but it's not enough to cover the really prohibitive costs sometimes of getting health care so what we did in the american rescue plan um is we added funding so that everybody um can get at least a silver plan remember there's bronze silver and gold on the affordable care act i get my health care as a congress number on the affordable care act um and so everybody can get a silver plan without having to pay the most you'll have to pay is 8.5 of your income so we're basically subsidizing that cost to make sure people stayed and stay insured even though they might be unemployed because we really want everyone to be going to the doctor taking care of themselves not being afraid to go get a test you know because of a lack of insurance um another question we got was about um the child tax credit when will it start um and how will you get the money um it's gonna start july 1st of 2021. one important thing about this child tax credit is that it's going to be refundable so even if you weren't paying any taxes say because you're unemployed you can still get that child tax credit um and that's a really important point oh the other thing i wanted to add here um about unemployment i'm going to erase this because this is an important point i said 300 additional week until september 6th another really important thing is 10 200 of unemployment will go untaxed so that is really increasing the amount of that unemployment that you get to keep it's a recognition that it's really hard to make ends meet on unemployment um and so we're going to add that amount in and let me see if there are any additional questions anything else last questions um again american rescue plan money for people the child tax credit um it's that someone just asked a question about how long will the child tax credit last so that's going to be a couple years um and then we have a proposal though to make it permanent so this is a short-term increase in the amount of the child tax credit um from two thousand dollars up to either three thousand or thirty six hundred um it's not permanent but congress has legislation to make it permanent one of the exciting things about the child tax credit i mentioned earlier the proposition of having child poverty cutting it in half the other exciting thing about the child tax credit is it had strong bipartisan support both republicans and democrats even with all the division in washington can see that the child tax credit is a smart investment in the next generation and lifting children out of poverty helping parents address the costs of child care of feeding i have you know two teenagers i'm a very hungry nine-year-old i go through a lot of cinnamon toast crunch in a month at my house so the idea here is to really make it easier for people to make sure their kids have adequate housing nutritious food and quality child care so this is temporary but then you have a bill to make it become permanent based on how many republicans supported this part of the american rescue plan i think we're going to be able to do that um last couple questions we talked a lot about food about about money and what you're going to do in the pocket about being healthy um i want to talk a little bit about keeping a roof over your head and keeping food on the table because i know that's been hard even the essentials during this time the bill provides for 27.5 billion dollars in emergency rental assistance a lot of this will be administered through your local cities so make sure that you're paying attention to any mailers you get um you can apply for these and then we're in terms of food we're adding about 1.1 billion dollars to snap which is somewhat supple snap supplemental nutrition assistance this is extra food for people to buy um and we're also adding 740 million for food for seniors meals on wheels seniors who are unable to leave the home because of covid because of disabilities it's really really important that we want to make sure that everybody has enough to eat in this country and i have been in orange county to the food banks i know it's a crisis for a lot of people and so continuing to have that bigger benefit for meals on wheels additional funding because they have seen more and more seniors ask for that nutrition help and bigger benefits for snap for the supplemental nutrition program so that is kind of a summary thank you so much for tuning in please ask questions and if you have questions reach out to your local congressperson they should be providing you with more information about what's in this plan um complete your taxes uh make sure the irs has your information on file your current address so that you can get your survival check um and thank you so much for joining me katie porter to talk about the american rescue plan thanks everyone

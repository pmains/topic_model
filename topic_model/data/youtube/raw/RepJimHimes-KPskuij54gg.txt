Washington journal continues both congressman jim Himes Democrat of Connecticut serves on the Intelligence Committee let's begin with the intelligence that was unveiled to reporters yesterday about the downing of Malaysian airline flight 17 front-page The Wall Street Journal says US intelligence officials with reporters laid out the case against Russia what do you know as a member of the Intelligence Committee well at this point Greta there's very little doubt that this attack was undertaken by Eastern Ukrainian separatists and there's very little doubt although you know if this were tried in court you want a little more evidence that we have because of course you know the separatists and the Russians have dragged their heels on letting the international community into the site where you might find missile parts and that sort of thing but look even that said there's very little doubt that this was done by the Eastern Ukrainian separatists that they this is not something you look at these guys these this is not something they pulled off on their own at a minimum they got training and assistance and so one way or another Russia's hand is very much involved in this tragedy where's the evidence well you know as the bodies are examined and as the wreckages examined you know even from a distance we can look at for example the side panels of the aircraft and see that there was shrapnel that helped bring down the aircraft very consistent with the use of an sa-11 missile and as you get closer and more opportunity to as i said look for missile parts to look for other forensic evidence on the site what happened will be pretty clear and look there's enough sort of eyes and an antennas in the region picking up who's talking to whom optically looking at what actually happened that again I you know I can't get too into the details but there's not a lot of doubt about what actually happened there how many briefings have you had well remember we went out of session sort of just as this at the end of last week just as this happen so there was the staff of the Intelligence Committee has been kept constantly up to date the leadership and we have been provided with when we all came back yesterday we've been provided with the latest on what our intelligence community thinks and again that's why I say what I do that there's just not a lot of doubt about what happened what then what should be done what should be the next step from the United States if this is the case if the evidence points to Russia's involvement well the key thing here is you know the president United States it was just two days before this tragedy that the president announced new sanctions by the United States and that's good and that's important and it with the real linchpin here though is will Europe go along you know Europe trades a lot with Russia Europe gets about thirty percent of their energy from Russia so they're doing exactly what they've been doing all along which is making a lot of noise but being very careful that they don't ultimately damage their relationship with Russia and by the way you know what happened here is appalling and Putin needs to be called out for it but we also need to remember here that we are engaged with the Russians and some terribly important things that are absolutely essential to our national security and of course at the top of that list is the ongoing negotiations with Iran on making sure that they don't ever get a nuclear weapon so yes we want to push the Russians hard we want to call Putin to the carpet but we don't want to so Scotch that relationship that our ability to work with Russia and making sure Iran never gets a nuclear weapon is compromised do you have concerns that the president appears weak well of course you know it's now become a cottage industry in this town you know you can pretty much assume exactly what any Republican in Washington is going to say because it will be the opposite of the president or critical of the president which is sort of sad because in foreign affairs you know I'm old enough to remember a time when we had tough fights about you know taxes and spending and domestic issues but it used to be that partisanship ended at the at the water's edge this time of course there you know the president's critics are saying it's all his fault which is absurd right i mean the notion that you know the situation in Ukraine or even our ability to dramatically influence what's happening in places like Syria is somehow the president's fault you know the president I think if you look at his time in office can be criticized for specific things but you know this you know you notice the president's critics when they say he's looking weak and then the journalist says well what would you do and you know people like Senator Graham come up with pearls like well he needs you know the president needs to call Putin a thug well okay that's not exactly advanced foreign policy the headline in the New York Times this morning Putin pledges to help but sees limits on his role telling the Russian people that the the other countries have asked Russia to have influence over these separatists he says that he will try to exert that but sees his role as limited Bologna look he controls the separatists right he arms them he trains them without Russia without Putin the separatists are a bunch of drunks with with with 1950s guns and so you know that that statement is just crazy and you know he's put himself in a box now right I think domestically in Russia this you know the taking of Crimea and the ongoing sort of fomenting of rebellion in eastern Ukraine had served him very well domestically you know Russians are feeling strong you know they had a strong leader but you know supposedly strong leader this is the long run game for Putin is not a good one guess what Europe is smart enough to figure out that they can't continue to get thirty percent of their energy from Russia that's already changing so Putin maybe in the short run has very high domestic approval ratings but but he's he's leading his country into into even worse economic straits in there in today what how do you how do you get inside Russia into the Russian people when we hear these news reports from Russia TV that making these claims that the United States is really responsible for mh17 and all of these other reports that seem erroneous well look all you can do is tell the real story and you know people will always be subject to the propaganda of their own government that happens you know in Gaza it happens in Syria it happens all around the world eventually the truth prevails and you know we'll do our best to make sure that that's what is really happening in Ukraine and what happened but you know Putin is a you know he was a spy for a long time he understands how to do propaganda and you know he's going to continue doing it yesterday several airliners us airliners canceled flights into Tel Aviv FAA followed up later saying we will not allow us airliners to go there for 24 hours what intelligence did they have that there was a threat do you think that was a wise decision by the government well it was certainly a prudent decision by the government it's not you know you don't need intelligence genius to know why there's concern I mean Israel you know not a lot bigger than the state of Connecticut which I represent but it's a tiny place and you've got Hamas and Gaza launching rockets you know several an hour all of which have the range easily to hit ben-gurion airport in Tel Aviv so again you know it's not like Hamas has the kind of missile that brought down the Malaysian airliner over Ukraine but they are constantly launching missiles and that of course poses a very real threat to aviation in and around Israel so I think the decision as long as missiles are in a position to reach those aircraft or to reach the airport is probably a prudent one which brings us of course to the need to bring that conflict to an end more issues to talk about with you because you wear several different hats in Congress but let me get to some phone calls first Todd in Robinson Illinois independent caller hey Todd you are on the air hey good morning y'all yeah congressman I just want to know how you can be so absolutely certain that Russia did this I'm not saying that that they didn't all I'm saying is there has been no investigation whatsoever you know the black boxes haven't even gone to the Malaysians yet you know and and here we are we're doing exactly what we did with Iraq we're doing exactly what we did was serious when it turns and you know you know would we let the investigation happen before we start pointing fingers before we get into another war let the investigation happen yeah well Todd look it's point a lot of people remember the was supposedly watertight case for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and so your instinct i think is the right one you know before before we do anything dramatic let's make sure the case is is is locked and you're right about that the look nobody's talking about going to war the idea that we're going to do what george w bush did and send troops into the ukraine as he did in Iraq it just isn't happening but and you're right at the end of the day and I think I mentioned this when I was talking about it if we had to prove what happened in the court of law we'd probably need a little bit more evidence but look you know the bringing down of an airliner is not something that happens quietly and you know for obvious reasons I'm not in a position to discuss all of the evidence and intelligence that's uh that's out there but at this point we're pretty close to the point where I think a case that the the separatists did this would hold up in court but the important point I think of what you said is and this is why it's so frustrating that doesn't mean there's a button that we can push where all of a sudden the situation has changed or better because we're not doing what we did in Iraq which was rely on a case in order to go to war that's just that's just not on the table you said the US will not be sending troops there is a this story in the front page of the Washington Times that the u.s. is going to help Ukrainian military the Defense Department saying that a group of representatives who specialize in strategy and policy will head to Kiev to evaluate specific programs that the u.s. may want to help bolster yeah which is a very different thing than what we did in Iraq you know putting hundreds of thousands of people on the ground to fight a war look the long-term answer and I think everybody recognizes this is for first of all Putin to stop supporting these guys in eastern Ukraine and for some arrangement some peaceful arrangement to be made between Eastern and Ukraine and Kiev I think the theory here is your you'll recall two months ago the Ukrainian military was just a disaster they were everywhere are you know failing abandoning their posts they have since been much more aggressive and much more competent we're going to create the kind of stalemate that leads to negotiations and by the way I think Putin will jump at those at that kind of a stalemate now given what he's brought upon himself we're going to need to make sure the Ukrainian military is in a position to defend their own country but what about in Michigan Republican caller hi Bob solar morning go ahead okay I got a few things here I've got written down I'd like this guy to try to attempt to defend Benghazi dumping illegal lying about illegal deportations the NSA the AP James Rosen fast and furious Bowe Bergdahl the IRS the VA ATF Russian reset Syria healthcare Keystone EPA climate unchanged government shutdown the president shut the government down a peg grills Eric Holder we have a marine in the in jail in New Mexico and this guy's flying around at fundraisers Andrey Louis Gates voter suppression that's all on your side not on our sir damn Jones communist no he so desires okay so so so Bob what's what's the point in employment or any other president would have been left out of office by now Peter been a Republican this guy gets away with murder okay congressman that was quite a list I will try to attempt it defendant actually I'm not going to look with all due respect Bob maybe a little more c-span and a little bit less fox news that was the you know a grab bag of everything that fox news and my friends on the Republican caucus in the house in particular have tried to hang around this president now you listed about 20 things there that would take the rest of the show to go through it but look let's start with your first one Benghazi Benghazi was a real tragedy it absolutely was four Americans killed I sit on the Intelligence Committee I've had the opportunity to interview in detail pretty much every person who was on the ground in Benghazi and guess what the kinds of things that bob was suggesting and we heard every conspiracy theory every wacky out there they were dealing drugs out of Benghazi that they were handing a shoulder fire anti-aircraft missiles to people in Benghazi the president was helping out Qaeda and Benghazi all of it is utter baloney and again either that that comes from somebody who spent a lot of time talking to people who are on the ground it was a tragedy the State Department did not have the kind of security that they needed there that should have been there now Bob frames that in a very partisan way as the president's fault well guess who supplies the money that allows the state department to provide security it's the Congress of the United States which is you know in the Senate a Democratic Congress in the Republican House of Republican so these are those are attack points against the president most of which in some cases have some reasonable basis in reality Benghazi was a tragedy none of the conspiracy theories were true what happened at the IRS was was appalling the fact that emails got lost was nothing short of appalling and a massive failure at that at that agency but the point is Bob's line of thinking as this is all about the president there's been absolutely zero evidence that the President had any hand in any one of these particular so-called scandals that that the Republicans have desperately been trying to promote why are they doing that they're doing that because you know what the economy is actually doing an awful lot better than when this President took office nine million jobs created the Affordable Care Act isn't it's sort of interesting Bob didn't mention the Affordable Care Act and that's because they're not talking about the Affordable Care Act all that much because um you know there's millions of Americans who are benefiting it from it today so anyway we can't go through the whole list this president has had his weaknesses and his mistakes but the idea that he's shown out of the White House manufacturing conspiracy after conspiracy is just a figment of Fox News's imagination let's go to our line for Democrats Jack Providence Rhode Island yes good morning can you hear me we can go ahead I representative Himes over there was a very rude dismissal of that gentleman who happens to be a Republican from Michigan I really didn't like it was kind of arrogant okay I'm a Reagan Democrats I didn't agree with Ronald Reagan on domestic policy but I agreed with him on foreign policy completely the way he handled the old Soviet Union now the IRS first wine over getting off subject care that is not just eres there is definite criminal culpability that particularly by Miss Luna who is nothing but scum okay secondly Barack Obama is not qualified for the job to be president he doesn't have any real management experience and he's overmatched by Vladimir Putin Vladimir Putin is a highly intelligent trained KGB officer okay my heart stopped for intelligence mr. Himes well I disagree with the conclusion Putin uh may in the very short term be popular with his people but his he's driven his own economy into the ground and your critical the president and as I said there's there's reasons to be critical the president but in the five years that he's been president the recession has turned around into you know nine or ten million jobs created in the private sector stock market at record highs businesses more confident Putin has taken his country in exactly the opposite direction where the Russian economy is on its knees and he may have a temporary burst of popularity in Russia because he took the Crimea but in the meantime the Europeans are saying guess what we're going to get our energy somewhere else we're not going to 10 years from now be importing most of our natural gas from Russia you know what Russia has to offer Europe natural gas that's it you know you don't see a lot of Russian you know high technology biotechnology Russian entertainment Russian education you know Putin I think he may have high popularity ratings in Russia today in the long run he's absolutely disastrous for his country and look with respect to the president again you know like any president he's done some things right he's done something wrong but you know in the face of some of the worst economic times any modern president has faced since there were since the depression in the night this guy and and has helped turn that around in the meantime you passed legislation which reigns in some of the irresponsible behavior and on Wall Street he passed a universal health care law which of course is quite controversial still but which is providing benefits to millions of Americans he's taken steps to reverse the discrimination against gay people in this country I mean the list goes on and on and when that list actually looks pretty good by the way he killed Osama bin Laden right I mean the list goes on and on so so the opponents and I certainly didn't mean to be rudaba but he ran through the tick list of these things that they're trying to hang on this president some of which are rooted in reality as i said the IRS thing and lois lerner that was appalling absolutely appalling but you know it's important also to recognize some of the progress that this president has has made via on twitter says when you get away with blaming everything on your predecessor you can do whatever you want and victor says whoever said Putin was a chess player never saw mh17 coming and the toll his incursion into the Ukraine is costing Russia let me go to William in Marion Indiana independent caller hi William yes represent my name's Jim can you hear me knocking hey yeah I am a member of the nation but I have been successful about three state economies and I would like to know why President Obama has not sent into the the intelligence into Ukraine already through the forced retirement of captains in the Warriors and the battles of the business campaigns and why is that Commonwealth not used in the AKA as first seated by the judicial judgment 18 months ago and I would just like to say that I am a strict Democrat because of a for strict economy in the state of Indiana that that ok William you got a call in on the Democrats line then congressman were you following that uh not really it sort of sounded like William was asking why we don't have more people on the ground in and you you know again as you pointed out Greta we are providing some assistance the Ukrainian government I think it's very much in our interest to help this country in remember this is where this all got started right it all got started as Ukraine was trying to figure out are we going to go more the Russian way and participate in whatever Russian you know free trade area not that that really means much or are we going with the European Union and you know trading with them and sort of adopting their political approach that's the answer right of course and by the way that's where they're going you know we need them to kind of integrate into into Europe and and not go the way of this you know what is rapidly becoming a rogue name led by a guy who is making again you know people are saying he's strong there is no strength in in violating international law and fomenting terrorist activities and countries next door eventually that comes back to bite you let's hear from Sam necks in Manassas Virginia Democratic caller hi Sam he has good morning morning only two representatives it's interesting we're a nation of justice and freedom but yet you represented his house continue to support Israel in the disruption of the Palestinian tres blue this is a nation the Palestinians are people we derived to exist coexistence with the Israelis let don't forget after the Second World War when the Jews came to America nobody tell them they could they could create a Jewish land in the United States why are you supporting Israel to pass a law that makes digital a land of the Jewish people will say let's get the congressman's take on the israeli-palestinian situation sure um you know and Sam is concerned about my support for Israel I I do support Israel you know Israel is a remarkable story and it's it is the one democracy though in a terribly chaotic land they are our allies and you know they're in a heck of a tough spot right now in a in a brutal conflict with her astorga nization now the interest here of course is to make sure that just as in Ukraine that that conflict is reduced to a point where negotiations can resume and you know it sounded like Sam was kind of going in the direction of trying to you know point fingers establish blame and you can spend a lot of time doing that you need to revert to the fact that that you know there's been an awful lot of loss of life in the in the in the region and it's and it's tragic particularly the innocent life but Israel has abided by the ceasefires that that the Egyptians amongst others have called for they have been attacked their civilian centers have been deliberately attacked by Hamas which puts their missile launchers and puts their activists in schools and mosques so that when Israel goes after them there is civilian death and you know the right thing to do here of course is to step back and say what is happening is a tragedy let's pull back and and get back to negotiations around a way to live together in the long term should Israel agree to some economic relief for for Gaza look we should always be open to humanitarian relief for people who are suffering and there are a lot of people who are suffering in Gaza a lot of innocent civilians who are suffering we also need to make very sure that if that happens this is not relief that falls into the hands of Hamas for use with their militants or that gets sold on the black market so that they can buy so that they can buy guns you know Hamas is their behavior with respect to how they have treated their own civilians using them as human shields is appalling and so of course anytime you have a civilian population that is in dire straits as many Palestinians innocent Palestinians are you want to look for ways to alleviate their pain p and oka chibi Okeechobee Florida Republican I don't think I said that all right all right at aldi go ahead I know that's fine it's like a coby another game I just want to tell mr. Himes first off you know you have a really great set of talking points you know why you speak from the heart instead of Obama's talking points I mean you you guys you liberals got these points man down so Pat you can practically do them in your sleep okay need to stop that crap as far as Russia's concerned now my personal opinion is Obama okay he has been after Russian president mr. Putin ever since he cutin he kinda sobayed Obama when he wanted to get Snowden back that's when he started going after Russia no matter whether he had to fax or not the minute something happens it's all mr. Putin's fault all right let's get a response d from the congressman well I don't quite know what gene J means by the president was going after Russia I'm not quite sure what she means by that you know Putin for you know Ukraine is not the first time and remember he let's be very clear what happened here Putin went into a neighboring country and took part of it the Crimea is illegal the president didn't go after him for that he criticized him for that he imposed sanctions for that but Putin did something that was blatantly illegal and it's not the first time I mean you know Putin has always sort of you know sort of in the in the countries surrounding Chechnya other countries surrounding Russia been very very aggressive so I'm not sure I agree with these characterization that the president has it out for Putin Putin is a rogue actor and it's not just the president's concern it's ultimately very much Europeans concerned about how this guy gets brought back into some semblance of a normal relationship with his neighbors Reuters reporting this morning Ukraine to impose sanctions on Russian individuals and firms Steve in Nocona Texas Republican caller you're on the air with Congressman Jim Himes Democrat of Connecticut oh good morning morning morning well I just I'm a proud American I love this country and about prior to this country for years and years and I've always asked them and I just believe that there's absolutely zero fear of God in the Democratic Party in that they've endorsed all these different things that appoint to god and i am a an American Indian a Cherokee and our president has wanted to enable the races through racism you know they want to say that we have been that it's racist to be like a [ __ ] fan well we adapted to the white man the church he did stick can I think it can I ask you to get your your point your question for the congressman yeah well I just feel that there is a reason for all the upheaval in the world and it's been be of good cheer that that we went in the end and it's square pegs in round holes if they just don't fit this administration is gotten off centered okay all right congressman you have any thoughts on that well you know we disagree over a lot of things and often you know comes up in these conversations and we should the strength of our system of course is that we don't agree on a lot of things when we come together and that you know big white dome building just up the street here and have those debates and we should that's a strength but one thing I hope we don't do is you know Steve started his statement by saying he loves this country I think that's true of everybody who's here we all love our country and I think we all try whatever God we worship to to do right by that God's ideals you know I'm reminded of something Lincoln said you know I forget the context it was a I think during the Civil War when Lincoln said you know we should never pray that God would be on our side we should pray that we would be on God's side and that's probably a little better way to think of it than trying to determine whether the Republicans or Democrats are more consistent with with God's will you're you are the national finance chair for the d-triple-c here is a headline in the Washington time morning Obama raises funds while international crisis looms his trip drawing criticism headed to the west coast yesterday for three fundraisers that some of that money going to the d-triple-c for the midterm elections should he be doing this is it appropriate well um you know is the whole system a good system that relies on huge amount of money to influence our our elections absolutely not i've been a staunch opponent of the Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United the Supreme Court's decision in the McCutcheon case which is bringing huge amounts of money into our political system millions of dollars into Senate races and House races that's a bad system that said it's the system that we've had for a long time though it has gotten worse and you know again this is another one of these things like oh well Obama's doing this Obama's playing golf you know you know during the Iraq war when we were actually at war the president at the time George W Bush raised money for his party and you know this has been true for a very long time that much money has the president raised for the d-triple-c you know I don't I don't know the actual number that the president has raised for the d-triple-c you know the d-triple-c gets its funding from Democratic members of Congress it gets its funding from from huge numbers of grassroots supporters all over the country but the president obviously when he holds a fundraising event attracts a lot of attention and helps to go to Jan in California Republican hi Jan good morning I agree with one thing and I disagree with the other my disagreement with you is on Benghazi because I believe the president should not have been at one of the campaign raising fun in with the with these movie stars and hundreds of bottles of champagne on the night after our boys were murdered and and 48 hours waited for help from the United States military and knowing I listened to the hearings and during those hearings it was brought out that there was a neighbor they paid us and that's why our people in in Libya asked for help in Benghazi because they wanted guns on top of their buildings and because of the appearance they didn't get it from Obama congressman can you address that those those things she's those items she just laid out well it sounds like jan was saying that there was that the people on the ground made a call for help that was and I hear this this is another one of the many sort of conspiracy theories that somebody may be the president may be a senior military officer said no we're not going to help that's just flat out wrong just plain wrong and and look we've had uh seven or eight investigations some within the Congress some the ambassador Pickering and Admiral Mullen led an investigation that completely refuted these many many conspiracy theories that are out there now let's be very clear here you know no there wasn't a call that web for help that went out if people take the time to learn what was going on our military assets in the area were far far far away in some cases Italy northern Africa in ways that you know would have made it impossible for them to get there for an event that was happening in you know a one hour two hour time frame but you know let's not forget that this was a tragedy and we can learn from it those who continue to try to suggest that it was the president's fault uh you know that's that's going to stop us from learning what we should learn from which is that in de you know in in in very dangerous areas we need to adequately secure both our facilities in our ambassador and it's up to Congress in both parties to adequately fund State Department security and other security keep our people safe coventry Connecticut Jim Democratic color yes good morning Frank good morning IG Connecticut yes under mr. Courtney I my question my three quick statements up everybody keeps you in Vulcan huh big top Ronnie Reagan was who I voted for twice and I dope or again because he did right for the country period and Benghazi Ronald Reagan got 250 Marines and sailors killed and Beirut Lebanon by Hamas house Hamas doing today look at the big picture every president makes mistakes and to squawk about Benghazi which is a tragedy and it happens they look at the history the ignorance of the history of America is unbelievable okay they were not the Republicans were in charge from the second you take the oath of office your number one job is to protect the people of the United States of America and you allowed the largest attack on American soil in my lifetime I'm 54 years old and you got some nerve to squawk about Benghazi which was a tragedy okay Jim I'll leave it there move on to Steve in littleton massachusetts an independent caller Steve welcome to the conversation well thank you and you know I you know I had to I had to sigh when I heard the congressman you know talking about Putin having not contributed to anything really to culture the arts and the extension yeah I'm having a bird something there i'm not sure what it was for that any rate not contributing to the United arts and entertainment the United States what have we been doing we've been promoting and exporting pornography and ghoulish violence you know demeaning are young people demeaning families and and women promoting utter decadence and in the name of women's rights what have we been doing within demeaning women look at sily Myra so whatever her name is Cyrus Miley Cyrus you know and you know the Democrats seem to be promoting this fully why would land here how's that well it to the extent that they there's no objection to it and the congressman here is is is holding american exceptionalism up as though we are you know the virtuous beacons of liberty ok ok i don't think i commented on Putin and arts and entertainment i actually have never really thought about that you know one of the sad things and I guess I guess I guess what I would say to steve is a gosh you know you think back on russian history russia has massively contributed actually to culture and music Tchaikovsky check off just remarkable Stravinsky and the same is true of the United States you know jazz was developed in this country Aaron Copland you know the blues you name it you know huge contributions is there lowbrow stuff of course there's lowbrow stuff probably the lowbrow stuff and Russia is bad or worse as it is here you know it's not it's it's may be up to us as fathers and community leaders to say we like this stuff we don't like this other stuff it's certainly not up to the government to say that you know the First Amendment to the Constitution says that guys like me elected officials the government don't get to tell the people of the United States what they get to listen to and watch which I think at the end of the day is a good thing but yes it means that there's some stuff out there that some people will consider real garbage Jimmy winston-salem North Carolina Republican collar hey yep my thing is that from what I've seen it looks like the laws of the United States for seem to start depleting a little bit and one of the things that I would like to know is you keep protecting the president on the things like Benghazi things that he does oversee there are our oversight committees for this and what I want to know is why everyone always comes back and says the president is the one that got bin Laden our special forces got bin Laden they trained to do things like this whole thing I President does it says go I want to see our military strong we need to finish in Iraq instead of stopping like we did in Vietnam and I hope goes back to a moral standard to where everybody is equal how do you feel about that well I Jimmy I appreciate you pointing that out your abs it was some incredible men and women in our military and n CIA and intelligence community was actually a lot of people who helped can get bin Laden nobody has any doubt about that the president also as you point out he says yes or no he said yes and that by the way is a massively consequential decision for his presidency he didn't have a hundred percent proof that bin Laden was in that building if that building had not had bin Laden in it or if we'd lost four was just to use the same number as we're at Benghazi that guy's presidency would have been very much in jeopardy look what happened to Jimmy Carter when he gave the go-ahead for the hospital hostage rescue mission in Iran that forever crippled his presidency so you're absolutely right Jimmy it was our young men and women in uniform who actually did the work on the ground you know bought about that night but this president put it all on the line to accomplish something that had not been accomplished four years prior in terms of getting and bringing to justice the man who led the most horrible terrorist attack on US soil in our history on the domestic side to lower courts yesterday had conflicting rulings on the Affordable Care Act the DC Court appeals court saying that subsidies should not be going to for the federal exchange here is the Washington Times editorial board Obamacare is now in intensive care is what they think and the wall street journal editorial board saying this that the DC Circuit Court of Appeals held that the administration violated the Affordable Care Act by expanding subsidies to the 36 insurance exchanges run by the federal government the plain statutory language of Obamacare repeatedly stipulates that these credits shall flow only through and exchanged established by the state your take well um yeah so so you know you read from two very conservative newspapers the two judges and the DC Circuit Court of Appeals and it was two of three judges who voted the way the Wall Street Journal the Washington Times would want them to vote we're can appointees and guess what the one judge who opposed that those two judges was a democratic point so we have politics at work here more than legal issues there's two ways to think about this on the legal side the language is ambiguous you know there is they talk about state exchanges when language is ambiguous and this has been true for 240 years in this country say okay it's not clear what the language says what was congressional intent there is absolutely no doubt and I was there that the congressional intent was to provide subsidies for all Americans not just in in in two Americans and states that decided to start these exchanges so I think that when the when and remember as you pointed out two courts when in opposite directions on this in the DC Circuit this is now going to be heard by all 11 judges within that DC Circuit I think eventually what they're gonna do is and say look what did Congress intent and there is absolutely no doubt about what Congress intended step back for a second from the legality of this though because we're in this ongoing fight where an awful lot of people just you know want to do away with Obamacare the Affordable Care Act in its entirety step back away from the legalities and say as I have always said I voted for the Affordable Care Act and I have always said that there's things in it that doesn't that don't work that we should fix at this point those who delight in the possibility of the failure of Obamacare let's let's just imagine that I don't think this is going to happen but that this Court is upheld this decision is upheld that will mean that millions of Americans in 36 states now no longer have health insurance they no longer have access to hospitals and doctors take the can't kid take their kids to doctors if they can't afford it is that something to celebrate is that's something we want for the American people you know governors in this country in those 36 states said we're not building static sorry in many of those states said we're not expanding Medicaid Medicaid is the program that provides health care for poor people poor people in this country are sick and dying because of the political decisions taken by those governors why did those governors decide that let's just let's just let's give them the best let's assume the best of their arguments afford it really the greatest most powerful richest nation in the world that can fight wars in Afghanistan and Iraq we can't afford to keep poor people from dying by expanding Medicaid I just you know let's let's hash this out in court but let's remember what it is that we're talking about we're talking about whether we want to support the most vulnerable people in our country by the way the New York Times editorial board called the DC circuit court's decision and ominous health care ruling and the Washington Post editorial board also weighing in saying the courts addictions to federal appeals courts rule on obamacare and the washington post saying the Virginia Court got it right in favor of the health care law Pat Baytown Texas Democratic caller hi Pat morning Pat you're on the air with Congressman Jim Heintz Democratic Connecticut oh I lost him that's not supposed to have him go to Tony in Chapel Hill Tennessee independent collar hi Tony good morning glad talk to you all I've been watch these sample long time ready don't cut me out fishy your bad about cutting people off when you don't want to hear what they have to say I have a statement and a question my statement is people this is the very reason we need to get rid of being Thomas this man right here and all of them just like it's not just him it's Republicans alike I haven't elected I don't think but two people to my our Congress is said it because I'm vote for the independence and of course they lose everybody says well you lose your vote don't be stupid vote for the independence and my question is when in the devil are we going to stop blindly following Israel Israel killed 16 year old with a bulldozer come on people well Tony I appreciate your comment the good news is that in just about a hundred days the American people will have an opportunity to throw the bums out if they want to do that every single one of my 434 colleagues is up for re-election in November and the beauty of our system and it's not a system that existed or China or Iran a lot of places around the globe is that you'll have your opportunity to weigh in on who represents you here in Washington in just in just about three months so that's a that's a good thing and obviously I know how it might consider I hope my constituents will vote but most importantly I just hope that everybody out there will make their voices heard and exercise the right to vote on election day before Congress adjourns here in August and then again before the November elections it sounds like border security the southern border in particular needs to be addressed funding why's that there needs to be some emergency funding passed the stories this morning that there's two dueling bills the Senate's going to have a bill that's 2 billion less or 1 billion less than the president wants and the house is going to have a bill a bill that's about a little less than 2 billion yeah yeah and this is this is Greta like so many of the issues were facing a really a really challenging issue it's not a situation that we necessarily want to find ourselves in the way I think about this as you know a lot of our callers this morning I sort of talked about being morally right and being right with God let's start there let's let's let's step back and consider that this is not a partisan issue this is not a US vs mexico issue this is a humanitarian crisis I mean it's almost biblical in the sense that we have children innocents showing up on our border and how we deal with that I think 20 years from now this is a moral test it's almost a biblical moral test you know and people say well it's you know I saw a sign in Murrieta California not our children not our problem you know again back to the Bible those who God has favored have not always wanted to assume the burden that God has placed on them Abraham Moses you name it but how they assume that burden really defines who they are so we start with the I think the premise that we've got it we've got to do right by these children and not quickly send them back into harm's way and El Salvador Guatemala where they may be killed and doing that right forward of course in legal circles is due process what that really means is you know case by case we're going to have to take these children and make sure that word that we are not you know the law requires us to eventually send them home but we need to do that in a way to make sure that we are not sending them to a neighborhood or to a community where they will be killed and that's going to require to your question is going to require some funds and it is up to Congress to make those funds available Washington Times front page this morning with the headline that the House GOP wants the National Guard on the border to help the influx of these young illegals House Republicans will call Wednesday for decisive action to end the border crisis proposing a deployment of the National Guard troops and accelerated deportation hearings for unaccompanied children well so there's no question and I agree one hundred percent that our borders must be secure and there and we've got some work to do in that regard I don't think a lot of people disagree with that but I'm not sure that that fully answers the question so and by the way there's a lot that we haven't talked about that we need to do we need to be working with countries like Guatemala and El Salvador to make it very clear to people there that you can't show up on our borders and expect to be made a citizen or you know stanching these rumors but so let's imagine we have a perfectly secure border and we have Americans staring across a fence at twenty children who are dying of exposure and and thirst or whatever because this is of course a very rough area what then does what do we do do we just say this is not our problem we're just going to watch those children died so I'm all in favor of a totally secure border and if you know if we if we need to do a lot more work as I do that's fine but let's not kid ourselves that that alleviates this almost biblical moral obligation that has been put upon our shoulders to make sure that's very vulnerable and innocent people are taken care of front page of the Houston Chronicle courtesy the newseum says the National Guard can't stop the border crossers they don't have the authority to arrest them but the advocates of putting the border the guard there is that it sends a political message great right so that's what we're gonna do in a humanitarian crisis send political messages I again you know let's focus on what we need to do here which is deal with a humanity a way that will make us as moral beings feel good about how we did that will go to chap and Columbia missouri republican caller morning Jeff good morning uh I want to share all the time it's great hey I was wondering when are you guys going to start doing something about the domestic terrorism through the internet with hurricanes invasions of privacy tornados ice storms mind control Jeff what it what do you what are you talking about well I'm talking about things have been going out for last five administration's with the internet all right go on to let me go on to dog in Niles Michigan Democratic collar down here on the air go ahead good morning mr. Himes hey uh i think is priceless a little less fox and a lot more c-span that's I need to put that on the license plate hey but I just want to say this morning how is it that so many Americans can profess not only domestic affairs but foreign policy as well I don't get this they must be in all the meetings that you're in in the mornings I just want to say that this morning just and get it thanks Doug I'm not sure I caught the question but appreciate the comment this morning the finance services the the Finance Committee which you're a member of finest financial services is having a hearing on the dodd-frank yes legislation what's the hearing about what's going on with this with this law so I think this will be a real interesting hearing as you point out there's a panel to talk about dodd-frank four years later we're at the four years at four year anniversary of the passage of dodd-frank and actually Barney Frank who was chairman whose name is on that bill will be there on so I think it'll be really interesting night and I hope a good discussion you know like so many other things that we've talked about this morning you know dodd-frank has done some very very good things you know these toxic mortgages that were sold to people you know that where where the person who sold that mortgage knew that the family had no choice of ever repaying it that's a thing of the past you know derivatives which were a big and kind of either massive market are now regulated that's a good thing but of course you know no law is perfect and there are there are criticisms of dodd-frank and hopefully those get outed today it's a good opportunity now hopefully hopefully it's not all about the politics hopefully it's actually about this since where we can reflect on what's gone right and what's gone wrong in that law and how do we need to adjust it because you know Wall Street of course that's the those are the words you use when you want to scare people and appropriately so because Wall Street went pretty well out of control in 2008 but we need to remember that the balance is important because yes on the one hand we need to make sure that the catastrophe of 2008 never happens again all of a responsibility that malfeasance never happens again on the other hand you know banks are what allow us to borrow to send our kids to school to borrow to buy a home to borrow to start a small business we need to make sure that that stays vibrant we will be covering that hearing by the way so at ten a.m. eastern time if you're interested go to see span org you can watch it there we'll hear from Judy she's our last year for the congressman in Shelbyville Tennessee Republican caller hello how are you hi Judy hey I have a couple of things first of all I am disappointed that presidents are I feel like I don't have a president of united states that he is strictly for Democrat I don't believe in all the Democrats do a bad i don't believe that the republicans are always right but i think that when the president's out campaigning hard using our taxpayer dollars for millions of dollars to be flown here are there to campaign i think it's wrong regardless to what President it is also bonnie from the housing mortgage the interest rates are so long so low that we as elderly and we're elderly can no longer earn money on our cds you were down to what not even percent for the ones of us that come out of forward to be in the stock market to take the chances of it up and down all right you didn't leave it there and have the congressman respond will run out of time yeah dude is absolutely right about the interest rate things and you know for our senior citizens and others who rely on bonds and savings accounts for that income one of the real tragedies of low interest rates and of course we have low interest rates today because that's supposed to help the economy recover but there's a terrible cost that is borne by people like Judy who rely on interest and Judy the only thing I would say about I also agree with your other statement you know this takes us back to the conversation about how we elect people in this country you know I hope that at some point we get to a point where we all agree that no president that no member of Congress no senator should spend most of his or her time raising money one thing you should know Judy though is that whenever Republican or a Democratic president is flying around the country doing fundraisers and I'm not saying these fundraisers are good I look forward to a day when they don't have to do that but when they do that Republican or Democrat the parties reimburse the military and and others for the cost of actually moving the president around if it's political real quickly you have some housing legislation that where does this and what would it do so I'm representative Delaney and kearny of Maryland and Delaware and I have just a proposed a reform of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that basically would have the government there as a backstop to the housing business but would have it in a much more disciplined way than it was there in the past in other words you'd have the private sector participating in guarantees and bringing discipline to a market that in 2006-2007 was very very undisciplined so that's the idea behind this legislation it's cut kind of one of the great undone things from 2008 the reform of these entities and we're hoping that maybe we can get good bipartisan support for the idea you can learn more if you go to the congressman's website Himes house gov one thank you very much for talking to reviewers basically coming up next we're going to talk with Kansas Republican tim Huelskamp a member

points and the chairman was quite indulgent with him on time I hope that inspires a whole new approach well it's certainly with respect to mr. brad Sherman at desk so it already because I do want to deal with some of the points he raises but before I do that in some minds the picture of the Islamic Republic of Iran this regime is the smiling face of its foreign minister javad zarif dapper debonair in Geneva the real face of this regime the real picture of this regime is Alan Kurdi that three-year-old boy on the beach in Turkey on the Mediterranean one of four hundred thousand Syrians who died as a result of the Islamic Republic's support for the butcher in Damascus I for one don't think that we can excuse ah Russian arms sales to Iran on the theory that we're going to achieve regime change anytime soon we've watched the Arab Spring we've seen which regime survive and which don't those regimes that have 50,000 thugs willing to machine-gun their own citizens survived those whose army is unwilling to do that and were confronted by their own people don't and we've had other panels so I want to ask this panel I have been assured by other panels that there are tens of thousands of codes force upward soldiers willing to machine-gun other Iranians if that's what it takes to keep this regime in force the gentleman from California says that the weapons that Russia is selling their only defensive it wouldn't affect us but of course the s-300s are the anti-aircraft weapons that make it much more difficult for Israel or even the United States to take out this nuclear program if that becomes necessary and the fact that all options are on the table is the only thing that keeps Iran from not cheating more on the jcpoa and one of the only things that got him to sign it but i want to focus on the gentleman from california's idea of buying a nuclear weapon he mentions Pakistan but Pakistan might well listen to their friends in Saudi Arabia if they have a bomb for sale maybe they would sell it there I there in Middle Eastern country or nearly one and would be directly affected I want to focus a little bit about our friends in North Korea um the death of Kim jong-nam illustrates that we should never have put taken North Korea off the state sponsor of terrorism list North Korea provided the kit that was used to create a nuclear bomb making facility that was destroyed by Israel located in Syria destroyed by Israel last decade do any of our panelists have any idea how much money North Korea got in return not for a nuclear weapon but just a kit to build one technology I'm seeing for shaking heads but I would point out that North Korea is in need of cash some of we the ram has some already loaded on pallets wrapped in cellophane and i would i know that iran would want the indigenous capacity i know that they would want more than one weapon but will any of you comment wife's North Korea why has Iran not purchased a weapon from North Korea knowing now that North Korea has a few more weapons than they need to defend themselves from us they could afford to part with one mr. Albright yeah i think there's worry i mean it and the and a nuclear weapon can be transferred in different ways doesn't have to be a fully commissioned yeah it could it could be just the physical Phil the fissile material they could sell the weapon they and I will do separately yeah and I think there's a lot of worry and I think it needs to be looked at just what is the level of cooperation I mean I I can't I don't know of credible evidence right now saying that Iran and North Korea cooperate on on nuclear weapons-related or nuclear weapons issues but there's a lot of cooperation on missiles to have well I'm an enemies and I think it needs to be looked at much do any of you have an opinion on whether the Syria North Korea a transaction of last decade would have inevitably involved Iranian observers advisors or cash anyone have an opinion there's been statements or some evidence that Iran would have had some involvement in it I was never able to confirm direct involvement but a given the closeness of Iran and Syria fortunately that reactor doesn't exist anymore and there could certainly the cooperation could i'm going to try to sneak in one more question which is indulgent of the german but a in comment that we need to prevent US banks from financing any aircraft sales to Iran because that creates an incentive for US banks to come here and lobby us in favor of Iran to make sure they get repaid the the press reports are of a discussions of a 10 billion dollar military hardware deal between Russia and Iran including tanks artillery and aircraft the jcpoa says iran can't buy those kinds of weapons without the approval of a secret five-membered a committee that operates in secret but we have a seat on that and can veto such sales is there any possibility that the United States would approve any or or fail to veto any transfer of weapons from Russia to Iran yeah I don't think so if I could say the problem is that man ends after five years or earlier if the ia issues its broader conclusion on the Additional Protocol so I think it's one of the really this duration issue transcends nuclear the conventional and ballistic missile and it's something the Trump administration is going to have to factor in strongly into its policy review on Iran of how do we deal with these these these exemptions that in essence take place in in not that distant future okay one more coming in I yield back no no I will you let's do this let's I went back to five minutes and let's start with Steve Chabot on that front of all

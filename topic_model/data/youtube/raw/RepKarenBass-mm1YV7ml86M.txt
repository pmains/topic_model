children at the border are suffering in inhumane conditions and it seems like of all of the problems that one should be easy to fix but there is infighting over money here is how one Democratic leader describes the crisis at the border in a tweet congresswoman Karen bass explains if a parent locked their child in a cage without soap or toothpaste they would be charged with child abuse if a parent were to put their eight-year-old in charge of caring for a toddler they could be charged with child endangerment then the parents could go to jail the Trump administration is guilty of abuse and neglect this is state-sponsored child abuse joining us now to discuss is that Democratic congressman Karen bass she serves on the Judiciary Committee she's also the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus congresswoman thank you very much I know how strongly you feel about this you've been tweeting what is the problem how hard is it to approve money to get these kids soap and toothpaste and some beds well see first of all we definitely need to approve the money but I do not think that is the issue at all you cannot tell me that the federal government does not have money for toothpaste and soap this is inflicted on these children as punishment to try to bring Democrats to the table to compromise on the border wall I think that is absolutely important the other thing that I think is critical is that we need to stop saying that the policy for family separation has ended it has not since when is a grandmother an aunt or a sibling not considered family only at the US border you make such a good point because some of the watchdog's have gone down different professors say from universities who've gone down to interview these kids let me read to you one of the one of their assessments listen to this a bracelet on a second graders wrist had the words us parent and a phone number written in permanent marker we called the number on the spot and found that no one had informed her desperate parents where she was being held some of the most emotional moments of our visit came witnessing children speak for the first time with their parents on an attorney's phone yes children are still being separated you know this is a human rights abuse this is such a stain on our country I have spent the last 20-plus years working to in transform our nation's child welfare system and this is a situation like my tweet said if any parent did anything that is going on on the border the children would literally be taken away and put in foster care you can't tell me that this problem cannot be solved you remember that President Trump just a few days ago said well he was going to cancel education cancel recreation cancel the the hygiene needs this was deliberate how dare you torture children to try to get a compromise out of Democrats and I am sorry but looking but hearing about children walking around in soiled diapers hearing about children taking care of toddlers you are talking about straight-up child abuse and I think that this needs to be condemned internationally frankly well look the Trump administration some in the Trump administration even Jeff Sessions at the time admitted that they were separating families as part of a deterrent they were hoping their word would get back to the Central American countries and that people wouldn't come that hasn't happened the numbers have spiked as we know under the Trump administration however congresswoman it's not like the Democrats have solved this problem in fact there was are these reports that last night Nancy Pelosi the speaker had this three hour sort of contentious meeting it was described as very tense with high decibel levels of people you know yelling at each other or whatever exchanging ideas so what is making it why is it so hard for Democrats to figure out what you do right now well you know I wasn't in the meeting so I'll be anxious to hear we have a caucus meeting this morning and I'm sure then it will be reported on but I know that my colleagues are struggling over you know money for the border wall money for security when the primary resources need to be targeted to humanitarian needs you know the other thing that the president did that is just exasperatingly is situation is he cut the assistance to the Central American countries which is why people are leaving to begin with yes I understand we have to get I'm sorry in trouble I understand that he's not solving the problem at the root and a lot of people believe that they should but it does sound like Democrats why squabble over money why are you all still squabbling over money when the kids need the soap today I mean why was that meeting among only Democrats so contentious last night well again I wasn't in the meeting so I can't tell you that but what I can tell you is that my colleagues that are fighting to make sure that these families are no longer separated that the children are cared for looking at how those resources are distributed is absolutely critical because they don't want to give the Trump administration money that then they will allocate in some other direction and I know that they're fighting to make sure that the money goes toward the children goes toward humanitarian efforts and also doesn't go for for-profit facilities one of the things that we're going to look at as at some point is who is getting extremely rich off of this situation so I know that those are some of the issues that my colleagues were concerned about for-profit facilities the money's not being diverted the money's focusing just on the children and so I'll find out later what any further specifics are I mean meanwhile the office of refugees and resettlement runs out of money at the end of this month but some children are still being separated from their families and so those children that are there they need to be connected with families a two-year-old a three-year-old a five-year-old did not walk across that border alone who brought them there and since when are siblings and grandparents and aunts not considered families and by the way they're being cared for as we know from again the watchdog's that by teenagers you know for who are not related to them so if we enter our law that is against the law so if it is child abuse for a parent our child neglect why is it okay for the government to do that so I know you weren't in the meeting last night but do you have hope this week the Democrat that the house will have a bill a funding bill that will work with the Senate's and that there will be money I do have hope that that will happen but I will say again the money that we allocate is no excuse not to provide basic humanitarian resources for children it is no excuse as far as I'm concerned it has nothing to do with our vote this week we have plenty of money in this government and you cannot tell me that you can't take care of children and feed them properly if you reunited them with their family you wouldn't even have to have these concerns because their family members would be taking care of them congressman Karen bass thank you very much for your perspective we look forward to hearing what happens today

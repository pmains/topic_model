well thank you Mr chairman and just to respond to those comments we appreciate the relationship we've had and the work we've gotten done this committee has done a lot on a bipartisan basis and some of it doesn't get any notice because it is non-controversial by the time we we finish our process but in the process I want to thank you and all the members of the committee for working with us to pass dozens of bills that are making an important difference to our constituents and to you and to David Weinberg of your staff not Tom but David we want to thank you for your willingness to work with us again we haven't agreed on everything but we've been able to find common ground where possible and move the country forward so thank you very much for that today is my last hearing as ranking member and it's appropriate that it'd be this hearing because it is so important to the oversight responsibilities of this committee and more importantly important to our country right now we have unfortunately a proliferation of threats facing the Homeland and I appreciate the fact that the right people are here today before us to be able to address those concerns and particularly to talk about what the administration is doing to counter those threats so welcome to secretary mayorka director Ray and director evaze we look forward to hearing from you as the respective leaders of your agencies you are responsible for overseeing thousands of career employees men and women who wake up every day at DHS FBI the national counterterrorism center with a mission to safeguard our nation and on behalf of the entire committee I want to thank those employees who are Patriots and are doing their best to further that mission every fall since the terrorist attacks on 9 11 we've had this hearing we're a little late this year because of scheduling issues but I think it's really important that we hold it because it is a time to stand back a little bit and reflect on where we are and how we can work together to address these potential threats and active threats I can think of No Greater priority for this committee I'm going to start with the crisis at the southern border because sadly I'm leaving at a time when we really haven't made the progress we should have made on a bipartisan basis but again we have to raise these issues and attempt to solve some of these very significant problems the failed border policies from this Administration has ensured that not only do our nation's borders remain unsecure but foreign adversaries transnational criminal organizations and other nefarious actors can too easily enter our country now and therefore threaten the safety and the security of our of our public so uh this issue has not gotten better it's gotten worse and in the past year the border patrol apprehended more than 10 2 million total unlawful migrants that's up 143 percent since 2019. this chart behind me shows uh in color kind of the the blue green and red of where we have been um FY 21 and FY 22 figures are on the right we just got the final figures for fiscal year 2022 and unfortunately it tells a very dramatic Story of Us failing to secure that southern border this does not include the number of gotaways or individuals who are not detected what we hear from the border patrol is that the number of gotaways has increased significantly as well these are criminals often who engage in human trafficking criminals who involve involve themselves in the drug trade and so this is about people but it's also about the fact that we have a record number of Fentanyl shipments coming through the border both the ports of entry and between the ports of Entry now we know this from anecdotal evidence but also because there's a record number of seizures of these deadly fentanyl shipments into our communities and Fentanyl of course is what's causing the most number of Overdose deaths at a time we have a record number sadly of Overdose deaths in our country in Ohio we think it's between two-thirds and three-quarters of the deaths are related to this one drug deadly fentanyl which is primarily coming across the Mexican border now so this has been a tough uh a tough couple years the worst two years of unlawful migration and the worst two years of drug seizures in our nation's history so I look forward to talking about that we've got to figure out how to move forward again on a bipartisan basis we've got to figure out how to fix what is clearly a broken system another issue I want to address today is the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan and what that means in terms of the United States Afghans who stood with us and our allies were left behind to suffer under Taliban Rule and meanwhile more than 36 thousand Afghans with no record of ever having partnered with us some of whom may have ties to terrorist groups were paroled into our country without proper screening and vetting and I appreciate the fact that director Ray you're here to talk about that in addition to uh secretary mayorkas because you know this is one again where I think we made mistakes and we can correct those mistakes uh we can go back and I know you're starting to do that from testimony we've had book publicly and privately but uh you know we we had this unfortunate uh chaotic and precipitous withdrawal that caused a lot of issues but one was throwing people into our country who weren't properly screened there have been three reports now from two inspectors General documenting the failures of DHS vetting and then paroling known or suspected terrorists into our communities and yet we just don't have an acknowledgment of that problem from DHS so President Biden requested and received an additional 15 million dollars for the FBI to conduct counter-terror investigations of known or suspected terrorists among the Afghan evacuees released into our country by DHS in other words he asked for 15 million dollars to give to the FBI to do this additional vetting and yet the administration says it's not a problem those two are inconsistent of course so perhaps we can talk about those diversion views on this panel this morning we all recognize the great threat posed by our adversaries such as Russia Iran and China who rely on disinformation tactics to weaken our democracy I think there's a consensus about that but at home we've got to be much more careful around issues of domestic speech we must respond to imminent threats of violence of course I don't think anybody in this committee disagrees with that but censoring constitutionally protected speech is an entirely different matter to be precise that should be a red line and I hope we can all agree that the United States government should not censor the speech of our own citizens America's speech differences of opinion and political viewpoints are not a threat to democracy but actually a Bedrock oven we know now that DHS disbanded its disturbing disinformation governance board after significant public outcry but we also know that it has continued its efforts to curb speech under the guise of countering misinformation or disinformation the entanglement of the FBI and DHS with social media platforms for the purpose of controlling narratives is something we need to talk about today I think it's a deep concern that all Americans have that we not cross that red line recent reports allege that DHS is colluding with big Tech to moderate content in a way that conforms with the Biden administration's political views including on the Afghanistan withdrawal and things like the origin of covid our democracy it's also under threat because Congress and the administration have been unwilling to confront the systemic threat of U.S intellectual property by China that is undermining our national security and our Economic Security secretary Ray has been outspoken on this his quote is there is no country that poses a broader more severe threat to our Innovation or ideas and our Economic Security than China end quote I couldn't agree more but every day China reinforces the findings of our various investigations of this committee showing the Staggering extent of the Chinese government's efforts to conduct influence on Espionage operations in our country and to steal American Technology research and information for their own military and economic benefit so addressing what the Communist Party of China is doing he's more urgent than ever and yet the safeguarding American innovation act which is reported out of this committee has been blocked from becoming law because of the unwillingness of Congress to confront this issue cyber attacks are another significant issue facing every sector of our country we talked about this a moment ago with Senator Peters we have made some progress here in this committee I appreciate that but cyber attacks are growing and they are a force multiplier for adversaries so we have to understand that this is an issue that they're going to continue to use our economic and security is depending on technology on technology and we've got to be sure that that we're not vulnerable here compounding that problem is the inherent difficulty of attributing cyber attacks to specific nation-states or criminal groups terrorism and targeted violence also remain a serious threat to our country this year an Islamic terrorists gained entry into the United States and attacked a synagogue and Colleyville Texas in a separate incident in ohio-based Islamic State operative plotted to assassinate former President Bush who were not out of the woods in terms of the Islamic terrorist threat I remain convinced that we can deal with these issues on a bipartisan basis uh where as we have in the past but I am concerned about the threat posed by Foreign terrorist organizations especially in the wake of our withdrawal from Afghanistan Al Qaeda continues to impose a threat the Islamic State continues to expand and mobilize iranian-sponsored geo-terrorist groups Target key U.S interests and government officials consistently we must remain Vigilant as these groups organized and organizations regroup and evolve we must restore confidence in the American public that we're committed to protect our nation from terrorism Espionage and other Homeland Security threats and this should be a bipartisan effort we all have the same goal a safe secure American Homeland so with that said I look forward to the testimony this morning Mr chairman both most importantly the response is to questions regarding the record of the administration addressing these threats what we can do going forward together I will note that only last week did we receive overdue answers to questions that we had from last year's hearing it took over a year I would hope that in this case we'll get more prompted responses to committee questions that are posed thank you Mr chairman look forward to the testimony

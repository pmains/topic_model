joining now is the democratic congressman tom malinowski of new jersey congressman malinowski is a member of the foreign affairs and transportation and infrastructure committees and he served and as an assistant secretary of state for democracy human rights and labor during the obama administration congressman malinowski thank you for being here uh there are various reasons for calling for the impeachment or resignation of donald trump one is punitive as a punishment for being involved in an insurrection one is to uh be a deterrent so that no other president does that but there's a third one that's valid today and that is he's got 10 days in office and he does damage to democracy on an almost hourly basis there is a great deal more that that donald trump can do in his 10 days in office well that's that's absolutely right and you know we we talk about the assault on the capital that occurred on wednesday but it's an ongoing assault these people went home feeling emboldened by the fact that they had gotten into the capital they're living in a this world of unreality in which they believe thanks to the leadership of the republican party which has emboldened them in this belief that they are part of some sort of righteous revolution and they are planning to come back to the capitol around the inauguration of joe biden so this is a an ongoing clear and present danger to the security of the capital and of course to the integrity of our democracy and i'm tired of playing defense i don't like seeing fences go up around capitol hill in the white house we may have to do that but that's defense we need to be playing offense we're we're done playing with these people it is time to start drawing the line that donald trump has been erasing in this country between lawlessness and the rule of law uh there's a poll that uh was put out today by abc news in ipsos it was taken between january 8th and 9th uh it shows that 67 of americans think that donald trump deserves a great deal or good amount of the uh blame for the riots 33 say not so much or none it's heartening that most americans do think so what's up with your democratic colleagues there are a few senators who have indicated that they think that what donald trump has done is impeachable or should be he should be removed from office but in the house nobody but adam kinsaker yet yeah you mean my fellow republicans uh i'm sorry your fellow republicans correct thank you it's more than adam kinzinger although he he deserves a tremendous amount of credit for the courage that that he has shown i believe we would get um well i don't know how many but we would get several republican votes if the vote were today and you know the seven uh members republican members you just criticized they all actually voted with us to certify the election of joe biden they would agree that donald trump is responsible but they're still stuck in this fear this intimidation that he has imposed on on the party you know i don't know how many conversations i've had with these guys over the last two years in which they say you know we know we know we know what he's doing but if you confront him directly he'll just get worse his supporters will just get worse their basic argument is if he shoots a guy in fifth avenue five times we've got to forgive that and move on otherwise things will get worse and and at this point we're just you know i've enough of that they have no alternative they're not proposing any other means of holding them accountable and of drawing this line and we're going to put this to a vote and they are going to have to choose um i think what they're what what you're getting from this fear they're all getting death threats now by the way there's right i'm used to that yeah and there's another uh piece of this poll uh in which they ask should donald trump be removed from office before the term ends 56 percent say yes you'll recall in the last impeachment it took a while to get to that the people a lot of people didn't think it was impeachable and then they got to that so that that that clearly shows that it's across party lines people who think that something needs to be done the argument that a number of your republican uh colleagues are making is that it will divide the country further impeachment is uh divisive there's no question about that but but there's something else here that needs to be achieved and that is the danger of the the the man in office how do you square those two things it will be divisive we're divided yeah yeah well i you you made the point that staging an a a violent assault on the united states capital to stop the congress from doing its job is divisive and we cannot have a relationship with the president of the united states in which he repeatedly violates the law he repeatedly commits outrageous unspeakable acts and then we take it upon ourselves to move on to avoid disunity in in the country for four years that's been happening at least that's what the republicans the mainstream republicans have been advocating and it's gotten worse and worse and worse and worse so you know my message to them is you don't want us to impeach them what else are you willing to do you know remember the reason we didn't impeach richard nixon was republicans went to the white house and they said it's time to resign man now if if these republicans were willing to go to the white house and tell trump to resign you know i i might let them take the lead right but they're not doing that either they just want to move on as if this didn't happen and that's absolutely not possible not in a democratic rule of law republic when something like this happens congressman good to see you again thank you for joining us this morning

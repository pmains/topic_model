as the US Congress done in that time let's ask House Minority Whip congressman Steny Hoyer good morning congressman hi how are you I'm doing well so let's talk about what Florida first has put on the governor's desk they here's what the conditions are of this legislation they want to raise the minimum age for gun purchases to 21 require a three day waiting period ban bump stocks give police more power to seize weapons those sort of temporary restraining orders if a family member or friend flags that somebody is a danger to themselves or others allow additional funding for armed school officers and allow school staff meaning teachers you know those who are trained to be armed so that's what Florida is doing we'll see if the governor is gonna sign that what's happening in the halls of Congress first let me say obviously those are some positive steps I don't be with every one of them particularly the arming of teachers which i think is a mistake but having said that I think it's some movement there has been no movement however here and that's unfortunate we have been trying to get comprehensive background checks which the overwhelming majority ninety-seven percent of the public supports taking steps so that everybody has a background check and we can preclude those who are criminals multiple misdemeanor offenders people who are on the terrorist watch list people who are mental health problems from getting guns we can't get that piece of legislation over one when we supported by the American people on the on the agenda why not on the floor it'll will pass because the Republicans refuse to do it just explain to us why as you point out everybody talks about background checks that seems to be something that there is wide consensus on so what's the sticking point well I think the only conclusion one can draw is that the NRA is opposed to it and they don't want to offend the NRA I think that's a tragic frankly it's against the will of the American people it's against the safety of our children it's good against the safety of people going to concerts going to night clubs going to churches going to other places where people gather where people can and very frankly I don't know any other explanation other than the NRA says they're opposed to it yeah and that's unfortunate we ought to get rid of the bump stocks I'm glad to see that the Florida Legislature did that as well I frankly think there's no use for an ar-15 a weapon that can shoot a lot of bullets very quickly which is designed to kill a lot of people very quickly and that's that's unfortunate but we ought to be considering those on the floor of the House of Representatives and the United States Senate the NRA has a new video out that strikes many as a threat so let me play this for you we've had enough of the lies the sanctimony the arrogance the hatred the pettiness the fake news we are done with your agenda to undermine voters will and individual liberty in america to those who stain honest reporting with partisanship to those who bring bias and propaganda to CNN The Washington Post and The New York Times your time is running out the clock starts now your time is running out what does that mean well I did it sounds to me like a threat but the irony is that in that ad they say undermining the voters will the voters will is overwhelmingly for taking steps particularly on the background checks but also the majority of Americans believe that these rifles that can shoot a lot of bullets very fast and kill a lot of people very fast should not be on the market should not be available so the only one on the only thing that one can conclude is the AR a and and the NRA and that threat that you Jews point to is intimidating the Republicans and that's therefore they don't act because it's certainly not reflecting the view of the American people who want to see action the father of one of the victims from Stoneman Douglas Fred Guttenberg who we spoke to several times when we were down there he his daughter was Jamie he was on Capitol Hill yesterday speaking to many of your Democratic Senate colleagues and here's how he hears that video of the NRA let me play this for you I asked you a question if this was put out by a terrorist organization we would be raising the terror threat level in this country why are we letting this lobby have anything to do in DC I don't understand it what's the answer to that lunch I understand his frustration now the NRA is a terrorist group and we have the First Amendment and I think we honor the First Amendment they're free to say what they want however as I said the irony is they said something about the voters will the voters will is in fact being thwarted the voters will overwhelming were reflected in polls is that they think we ought to take meaningful action certainly on the background checks overwhelming but also on assault weapons the bump stocks the mental health clearly is a criteria which ought to be used in terms of background checks and there ought to be a waiting period to buy guns I think the Florida legislation has that I think that's up step forward yeah but very frankly the Republican leaders in the Congress of the United States ought to have the the courage to respond to the people's will and at least put it on the floor at least give the representatives of the American people the right to vote on legislation which will help protect them and their children all right so senator thank you appreciate it thanks so much Chris all right so the Trump administration is escalating its immigration fight with California the Justice Department is leading the way suing to block three of the state's

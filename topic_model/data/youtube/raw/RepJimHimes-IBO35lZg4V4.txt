mr. chairman and welcome director Cordray I'm glad you're here I was very heartened by the lengthy discussion we had some time ago in which you were obviously committed to your mission and had an appreciation for the limits of your mission in the need you had of course to not overly regulate in ways that would be harmful for our economy I'm glad you're here you will sense that that is not a sentiment universally shared in this room as the chairman said they offered up the opportunity to the American public to offer stories about the work you do I got reading this survey apparently you can help they helpfully point out that you are engaged in a massive data collection effort gathering confidential financial information on millions of Americans adding piles of new burdensome regulations on job creators it goes on and on in my business this is called push polling it is certainly leading the witness it is certainly fear mongering and apart from the entertainment value of this white-hot partisanship I got to thinking what about the stories that can't be told how does one tell the story of a predatory loan that didn't bankrupt an American family how does one tell the story of a liar's loans that didn't get made and of a family that's not sitting on the curb bewildered surrounded by their meager belongings this is of course where we were where the majority would put us back and I think it's worth remembering that it's also worth pointing out that the Dallas Fed produced a report just recently putting a price tag on that tragedy and they said the Dallas Fed that that price tag / american household was fifty to one hundred and twenty thousand dollars per household doc director Cordray I thank you for the efforts you were going to make to make sure that that never happens again and I yield back the balance of my time

lawmakers on Capitol Hill are working to address an often-overlooked problem that's hurting our military community 38% of military spouses are underemployed compared with about 8% in the economy as a whole about 12% are unemployed nearly three times the national rate it can cause huge financial hardships for military families Jan Crawford met with two military spouses and a u.s. senator pushing for a change she's in Washington Jan good morning well good morning so you know there are a lot of demands on our servicemembers they've got the frequent moves those long assignments away from home so we don't always think about how hard it is on the military families and it shouldn't be that difficult so now some lawmakers here on Capitol Hill are trying to do something about it is that good Lakeisha coal is a mother and small business owner whose husband has served all over the world in the Marines we relocated six times we've had about fourteen addresses or manager six moves yes Aaron Ward is a real estate agent who spent more than two decades on the move as an army wife fast forward 19 moves later 819 moves 19 20 and 24 years while their husbands served our country these women made sacrifices of their own especially in their careers where frequent moves meant frequent job changes I waited tables at Red Lobster I worked at day care centers I've worked in government contracting I've done everything from sell insurance to work in radio so if you were to look at my resume and see that I've had you know 25 different jobs that doesn't look very good right you're like who wants to hire that person that's not gonna stick around have you heard that personally from an employer like are you a military spouse yeah are you gonna be you know I had someone say well if someone was to look at your resume they would assume that you're unstable unstable yeah because you've had so many different jobs for professionals who require state licenses uprooting your career can be difficult if not impossible now I've got to put my business on hold because it's gonna take me six months to get my license because I'm you know moving from Texas to Florida in Florida you know may not recognize Texas as licenses the same thing happens we know it's her knees and teachers yeah dentures which all contributes to this reality in a recent survey 77 percent said being a military spouse had negatively affected their careers more than half of the spouses in the survey said they bring in no income and nearly half the families had less than five thousand dollars saved after years of frustration both Cole and Ward took matters into their own hands starting their own businesses I don't know what I would have done had I not chosen entrepreneurship as my career path I probably still be stressed the hell somewhere rolled up in the ball in the corner somewhere when you first started hearing about some of these stories what was your reaction just a sadness that that I hadn't thought of thought of it before Virginia senator Tim Kaine represents more military families than nearly any other senator the veterans unemployment rate came down because there was a patriotic desire to these people sacrifice we should figure a way that we can help them we have to create the same patriotic mentality about these military spouses there are signs that change is coming with my signature at the state level Nebraska governor Pete Ricketts recently made it easier for teachers who are military spouses to find employment and outside groups like the US Chamber of Commerce host career fairs targeted at military spouses Kaine is also pushing bipartisan legislation at the national level arguing that addressing the problem will benefit the military in the long run I have a kid in the military and you know the brass always tells you that you know it's the soldier or the Marine that makes the decision to come in but usually the in reenlistment decision is made by an entire family we are the backbone of the military and I think if we had more people standing up behind us and saying we believe in you and we're gonna put the money behind it yeah it's not enough just to talk the talk we want to see people walking the walk why is this such an important issue why why should we try to fix it I think we should try to fix it because it is the right thing to do I like to say we're the heroes on the home front you know we're home keeping the kids together we're the counting we're the housekeeper you know we're all of these professions on a daily base just so that our spouses can go to work and serve the country now Aaron and Lakeisha told us that the problem has gotten so bad that more couples are actually living apart so the spouse can stay behind and work senator Kaine and his colleagues say they hope that Congress can pass a law later this spring that will help fix that problem

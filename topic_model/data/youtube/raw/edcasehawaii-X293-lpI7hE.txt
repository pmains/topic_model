friends and fellow oahu democrats aloha i'm former congressman ed case asking to serve you our party and our hawaii as your next united states senator let me start out by thanking tony gill and the oahu dems for continuing to build our party right here on this incredibly important island you've done a great job and you've put us in a position to win county and statewide elections i want to apologize for not being with you in person today i'm on the big island my home island speaking to the hawaii island the democrats and doing other campaign events that i'd committed to over there and hope to join you again soon i'm also sorry that i can't stand with you side by side with maisie at your county convention as well as our state convention to debate the issues and to present our candidacies debate is good for democracy it's good for our party i hope she changes her mind i don't think i have to tell you how critical this election is to our party and to our country this is a critical election for our hawaii because it will determine effectively who will serve as our next united states senator for a generation and in our country this is a critical election because as recently as this morning the national rating services of the u.s senate elections call the senate 50 50 50 republicans and 50 democrats with hawaii assumed to be a democratic seat and i think we can all agree that that assumption is an assumption that we cannot rely upon for our hawaii then the november general election will be critical not just for our party in hawaii but for our party and our future in our country and the august 11th democratic primary election is critical for our party because it will determine whether we put the best candidate up against a formidable candidacy of linda lingle how big are the stakes really well let's just take a look at some of the issues that our country is facing in washington dc and how those issues would be affected by whether we have a republican or a democratic senate let's take president obama first of all do we want president obama to have a majority democratic senate of course we do because if he has a republican senate majority his next four-year term is going to be a very very difficult term not only for his initiatives but for all of our initiatives let's take labor let's take the gains in labor over decades and decades that are under attack right now and that would be eroded if there was a republican senate majority let's take the environment where we fought so hard for so long not just with uh with marine and terrestrial environmental issues but now the incredibly difficult problems of climate change let's take women's issues women's issues which have come so far rights of women so far in a generation or two those are under attack across our entire country right now and you can believe that they will be under attack if we have a republican majority senate i could go on and on the list is long i could talk about gay rights i could talk about the rights of minorities i could talk about the protection of social security and medicare and a safety net that has served us very well all of these are under attack right now in the united states congress and would be under attack with a republican majority and so we can see that the ripple effects of this election will be long and broad not just in our state but throughout our entire country and that's why this is such a critical election both the august 11th primary and the general election in november my candidacy offers you a democrat who has fought for our values throughout my history my kennedy candidacy offers you a democrat who has stayed in touch with my 172 talk stories as your congressman and i would do that all over as united your united states senator my candidacy offers you a democrat that will fight for our state and our country in washington d.c over the next generation and finally my candidacy offers you a democrat that will beat linda lingle in november and will contribute to a continued democratic majority in the united states senate we ask for your consideration in this election we ask you to just think about it don't let anybody else tell you who i am or what i've done what my record is or what my agenda is go find out for yourself we ask you for that we ask you to think about it i welcome your questions and comments we have information at www.edcase.com and you can email me directly at edcase eddcase.com i look forward to seeing you in the weeks and months ahead in this campaign and of course to serving as your united states senator mahalo

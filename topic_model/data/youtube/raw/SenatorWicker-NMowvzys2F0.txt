thank you thank you so much mr president um we'll soon be moving to a vote on the so-called chips legislation it's had it's had several names during its consideration in the senate and in the house i prefer to call it the chips and science act but it is an important bipartisan piece of legislation and i urge its adoption is my friend from vermont seeking recognition so i i urge my colleagues to vote yes on this legislation it will expand american semiconductor production create new opportunities for research into cutting-edge technologies and enhance our ability to compete with china there is no more important competition than the one for technological supremacy between the united states and china the outcome will shape the global balance of power for decades and will impact the security and prosperity of all americans regrettably at this moment we are not in the driver's seat on a range of important technologies china has china and other nations are increasingly dominant in tech innovation posing a massive threat to our not only our economy but to our national security mr president but with today's vote congress has a chance to move us back in the right direction and put america back into a place to win the game this legislation the chips and science act i'll call it will provide a historic boost to our semiconductor industry which for too long has played on an uneven global playing field increasing american ship production is absolutely vital giving the given the importance of chips to our economy as well as our national defense the pandemic taught us the hard way that we cannot be dependent on semi-conductor production halfway around the globe but of course chips semiconductors are not the whole ball game this legislation goes much further advancing american innovation in quantum computing advanced robotics biotechnology advanced materials and artificial intelligence the full suite of technologies that we need to out-compete china and instead of limiting those investments to a small handful of institutions in five wealthy states this bill casts a wide net enlisting the talent and expertise of stem researchers nationwide this legislation will guarantee that epscor a program designed to stimulate competitive research in 25 predominantly rural states receives 20 percent of all r d funding from the national science foundation up from the current 13 13 now 20 percent when it's finally ramped up the bill will also reauthorize the national science foundation the gold standard for funding basic research and it will establish a new directorate for technology innovation and partnerships called tip at nsf to supercharge the process of translating basic research into technology development and then to the commercial market enabling us to compete better with china across a vast range of technologies this legislation would not be complete without new safeguards against espionage which we know is taking place right now against intellectual property theft for which the chinese have become notorious i'm pleased we were able to include a number of long overdue reforms to protect the fruits of our nation's r d investments even so there is more work to be done to protect american research across the whole of government and i commend my friend senator portman from ohio for moving forward with his initiative which i hope can be incorporated into the statute at some point mr president this moment has been a long time in the making and i want to i want to issue some bipartisan congratulations and and words of thanks my dear friend and colleague from the state of washington the chair of the commerce committee senator cantwell is on the floor and i congratulate her and commend her and thank her for her cooperation with me on this issue i want to thank leader schumer and senator young the original co-sponsors of the endless frontier act as well as senator cornyn senator cinema and many other colleagues who helped make this a better bill and i i also want to congratulate and commend officials from the previous administration from the trump administration who are also telling americans about the importance of this legislation this is a bill that will be signed by president joe biden but it's also endorsed by ambassador robert lighthizer president trump's international trade advisor by mike pompeo president trump's cia director and secretary of state and by robert o'brien former national security adviser to president trump so three distinguished and knowledgeable national defense officials and foreign policy officials are saying this about the bill we'll soon vote on ambassador lighthizer of the trump administration said on kudlow two days ago we are in this existential competition with china the battleground of that competition is technology and chips that is where we're going to win it or lose it and he goes on to point out that the bill while not perfect um is uh exactly the bill that we can get done right now and i don't know of any bill that is ever perfect mike pompeo secretary of state a stalwart in the last administration on national defense says this and i quote congress must pass the chips act for both our national and economic security we have to become less dependent on china for critical technologies and this is how we do it a bipartisan bill supporting r d for semiconductor chip manufacturing is essential to security securing vital technologies for our economy and our military that's mike pompeo president trump's secretary of state and then robert o'brien former national security adviser to president trump said america needs this legislation without delay so i want to i want to also say a note of thanks to to my own staff my personal staff and my committee staff for their tireless efforts over the last year and a half on this issue this is the culmination of a great deal of work by some very very talented personnel countless meetings a legislative hearing in april a mark-up in may a final vote by the senate in june after days and days of debate on the floor all of these staff members work nights and weekends considering and helping manage almost 1 000 amendments mr president through the committee and the floor and all of them contributed in many ways i will single out for recognition my policy director james maisel who was absolutely vital to us in putting it all together and his entire team so thank you very much mr president i urge a yes vote i think the strong 64 vote we had yesterday on cloture was indicative of the support and i anticipate its passage and look forward to a successful passage in the house of representatives i yield the floor

very much mr. chairman mr. Hoek the reason that Senator Udall is asking you questions about Rudy Giuliani's requests on behalf of Reza's Arab I think it's twofold one we are very concerned that there is a shadow foreign policy operation that exists being conducted by the president's personal lawyer a representative of his political interests we know that because we have transcripts of phone calls in which the president tells foreign leaders not to call your boss secretary of Pompeo if you if they want to deal with the United States but to call Rudy Giuliani but we're also concerned about this particular case because it seems as if it is evidence that the president's personal lawyer his shadow Secretary of State is working to undermine American sanctions against Iran the very sanctions that you testified to us that are crippling their economy and so let me ask let me ask senator udall question a different way have you spoken to Rudy Giuliani about US sanctions policy towards his client Rezanov this meeting was a couple of years ago I was in listening mode as I said judge Mukasey asked for the meeting and listen to what they had to say there was no action taken but you you did have a meeting with Rudy Giuliani specific to his representation of a client who was seeking to get out of US sanctions no I had a meeting with judge Mukasey who was the lead and judge Mukasey raised a consular issue with me and there was no action taken there is a report from three people familiar with a meeting between President Trump and secretary Tillerson who you were working for at the time as perhaps his closest advisor in which President Trump asked for secretary tiller scence help to work to drop the case against zurab are you familiar with this meeting or the request that was made I was not familiar with the meeting okay mr. chairman I think it's important too set the broader record straight here with respect to some of the things that mr. hook has said about our policy visa V Iran and its connection to the recent developments in Syria I appreciate that you do have a tough job to do and I don't imagine that you would have given counsel to the President to abandon our Kurdish partners in Syria but it is simply not credible to say that we didn't have a counter Iran element to our Syria strategy in fact multiple individuals testified to that before this committee and would still testify to that before the committee it is not credible to say that abandoning the Kurds doesn't change the efficacy of our Iran strategy Iran absolutely benefits unequivocally from a new alignment inside Syria in which the Kurds are forced to align themselves with Bashar al-assad and it is also not credible it just doesn't pass the straight-faced test to try to convince us that Europe is helping us with a maximum pressure campaign on Iran and the extent that I have a question on these topics I'll give you one to try to clarify the record I know you have this list of actions that Europe has taken but let's be honest Europe is attempting to work around our sanctions Europe is trying to create financial vehicles so that their businesses can continue to trade with Iran they're talking about a new line of credit to prop up the Iranian economy they still have diplomatic relations and it's just it doesn't pass the laugh test to suggest that the Europeans are working with us and so I just want to put this question back to you again I mean are you really trying to convince us that the Europeans are assisting in our maximum pressure campaign when we know that they are actively engaged in trying to help their businesses work around US sanctions so you said that Europe is working around our sanctions and I think maybe just to be a little more precise Europe is European companies is what we're talking about European companies have have made a clear choice to choose the United States market over the Iranian market the EU does more trade with Kazakhstan than it does with Iran it's not even in the top 30 of trading partners and so we have seen nothing but full compliance by European companies on our sanctions regime European governments are frustrated that Iran has lost some of the benefits under the Iran nuclear deal with our departure but that is a secondary consequence as it pertains to European companies there's no daylight there's more daylight between European companies and European governments and there is between the US but I think what you were trying to you were sending us a list of actions that European countries had taken and I think it just trains credibility to suggest that you have had success in convincing other nations especially those in Europe to rejoin the pressure campaign the pressure campaign is unilateral it is not as effective as it could be if you were successful so our unilateral sanctions have been much more effective than the multilateral sanctions that were in place prior to the deal indisputable on that the second thing is on the so when you say it is true and maybe maybe this is just a matter of sort of making distinctions there is our pressure campaign and then there is Europe working to confront and address Iranian threats to peace and security and sometimes those overlap and sometimes they separate but when I look at this list of European actions it is dozens of actions that I mean everything from as I said these statements the Austria Austria Belgium France and Germany exposed an Iranian plot to bomb and oppositionist rally in Paris and they arrested several Iranian operatives the Netherlands expelled two Iranian diplomats in connection with an assassination the French Foreign Minister condemned Iran's attacks on US diplomatic missions in Iraq Serbia revoked visa-free travel for Iranian citizens belgium extradited i'm at this is a I do it I would welcome you reading this Europe has done a lot in the time that we have left the deal to try to raise the cost of Iranian aggression they have not joined our maximum pressure campaign but they have adopted our position that we need a new deal and Boris Johnson said that the Iran nuclear deal is a bad deal with many many I would just say listen the proof the proof is in the pudding Iran is not at the negotiating table you have a year left on your term there malevolent activity in the region is worse than ever before if you had evidence that all of these actions were bringing them to the table um we might be in a different conversation but there is absolutely no evidence that this has actually gotten us to a point where you can effectuate a negotiated settlement and you only have 12 months left on the term we are just not going to get the agreement that you have sought with the time that you have left or without European partners I know I'm Way over my time Thank You mr. chair

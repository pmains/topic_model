wisconsin congressman scott fitzgerald who sits on the house small business committee congressman thanks for being on the program are the people of your state of wisconsin and the people of america in general buying this spin by the white house and of course their allies in the mainstream media on what a recession is no todd when not back in the district and when you talk to people they're hurting right now you know it's obviously the gas price but beyond that you know what they're seeing at the grocery store certainly i think what they're experiencing it just doesn't match up with what the white house is trying to sell jared bernstein and his comments about listen you should be happy that gas has come down 74 cents it's it's comments like that i think that show that there's a real disconnect between where the president is and where the white house and his spokespersons are compared to where the reality is congressman wall street journal editorial board had this to say yesterday president biden inherited a growing economy primed to roar back from the pandemic and in barely a year and a half has dragged america back to the 1970s the best word for what we have now is stagflation the ugly combination of slow growth and rapidly rising prices this is what the policy mix of trillions in federal spending heavy regulation the threat of higher taxes and easy money has wrought time to do the opposite they say only problem there is the president wants to double down on those poison pills extra spending and this reconciliation bill to the tune of billions of dollars also a corporate tax hike so if this bill passes what happens to the economy and when will we feel those effects yeah the wall street journal nailed it i mean basically what they're describing is what unfortunately schumer and manchin have now cut a deal on which is to pour more cash into the economy and it's simply going to have the opposite effect we're going to see inflation go right through the roof and then later on they're going to say well it was worth it because it was under the guise of the uh environment and doing better when it comes to the environment again something that the american people aren't going to feel and i think it's going to show up in november when people go to the polls i mean i think the democrats are are going to have to take the responsibility for for what's going on right congressman real quick do you think that bill is going to pass right now you know i i would trust uh senator cotton and some of the other members that are looking at the numbers a little bit closely it seems like it's still kind of up in the air interesting i think you have to also pay attention to the salt that's taken off a lot of the tri-state area here individuals senators right but we'll see what happens um the white house seems to be pinning its hopes if you listen closely on the jobs market that's sort of their main defense when they get attacked on this isn't that a dangerous strategy though congressman with cracks in the quote-unquote robust job market beginning to show listen it doesn't match up again with what's going on i think across the nation if you talk to employers right now they're looking for workers they're looking for anybody that will even do on-the-job training when it comes to truck drivers or certainly light manufacturing whatever it might be i mean it just doesn't match up the white house message is completely out of sync with what's going on across america right now

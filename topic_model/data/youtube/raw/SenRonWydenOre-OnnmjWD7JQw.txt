joining us now from Capitol Hill Democratic senator from Oregon and member of the Senate Intelligence Committee Senator Ron Wyden it's good to have you on the show this morning senator thank you for having me back so you're part of the bipartisan group that is called for more information on drones you've tweeted saying that every American has the right to know when their government believes it is allowed to kill them it does though remind me of debates from past administrations where the answer might be you would be affecting impacting perhaps even hurting our national security if we release too much information well that's right and this has always been a debate about how we can ensure both our security and our Liberty and I simply believe that we can strike a better balance than we have in the past now last night's us step by the president is an encouraging one there's certainly a lot more to do what's your thought the wall street journal today came out with an editorial actually supporting the President on the drone issue and is concerned about the prospects of actually having to fight a type korte that you you pass certain suggestions regarding drone strikes through judges what's your position there well first of all Joe what a member of the committee can say about the details of the drone program are very very restrictive and in fact in that clip that you all ran I heard John Brennan mentioned twice remotely piloted aircraft as far as I can tell he has actually only used the word drones once in public now what I'm going to be pressing for today and in the days ahead is be classifying more information about those issues I think we can do it consistent with that with national security and that's the next step Walter so Walter the White House doesn't like to talk about the drone strikes obviously you even have Brennan who doesn't like to use the word drone yesterday Jay Carney was turning cartwheels to avoid getting specific there have to be more transparency if this is really going to be the center of our anti-terror program yeah and I think at some point we have to decide what do we going to do as a nation and as a world to have certain protocols certain rules of the road certain rules of engagement for Jones just like we do for mines and atomic weapons and chemical and biological I actually think that there is a very valid reason to use drugs to use pilotless aircraft in a war when you have a declared war and you have a declared you know targets but but but you want to have an open discussion of how we're going to put this into the context of the type of weapons we can and cannot use alchemic I think good senator is it not a real opportunity for those of us that were concerned about the lack of transparency on the george bush and others to set policy now to show that we are going to have a a a policy where we're open as long as we're not compromising national security and where civilians would not just be arbitrarily at risk with being killed by United States missiles are you and Joe are touching on the key point and that's transparency and accountability and you're absolutely right this is the time we're living in an age where in effect the military and the intelligence lines have really blurred we've got to have much more robust a congressional oversight and I do think this all has to lead to a more informed public debate now I was encouraged last night when the president called and he said as part of this effort he is going to try to drive a more extensive discussion about these issues I think both you and Joe are touching on the fact that without transparency and with it without accountability we can't strike the right balance between security and liberty senator Donny Deutsch who am I missing here what Americans are going to be targeted by drones unless it is such an extreme definitive circumstance am I missing something here well Donny you can't get into the details of any operation and that why I pushed so hard for more than two years to actually see the legal analysis I have felt that the committee and their 15 of us on the Senate committee there's a House subcommittee as well we've really been in the dark on these kinds of issues and by law we are required to do vigilant oversight and in a couple of hours i'll be going into a look at the legal underpinnings of this program will have more to say about it then well let me ask the senator question outrun well you more concerned about the possibility of americans being targeted or you can turn most about the general use of drones without rules of the road every American has the right to know when their government believes it's allowed to kill them I don't think that as one person said that is too much to ask and this idea that security and liberty are mutually exclusive that you can have only one or the other is something I reject so we're now going to have to begin the heavy lifting the congressional oversight process by examining the legal underpinnings of this program and to make very clear I am going to push for more declassification of these key kinds of programs and I think we can do that consistent with national security Senator Ron Wyden thank you very much we'll be watching thank you Ron thanks for having me

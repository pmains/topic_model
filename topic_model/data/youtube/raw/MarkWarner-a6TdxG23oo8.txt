again what is the SCC order - it basically sets three basic rules for how network owners ISPs must handle Internet traffic first it offers greater transparency about fixed and mobile network management practices to both consumers and content providers this is terribly important without that transparency without that knowledge to kind of see what you're getting as a consumer or if you're a content provider making sure that your traffic is not being bumped out of line by some large network operator is terribly important second it prevents fixed and mobile network providers from blocking traffic generated by competitors to varying degrees again what does this mean it means that if you are a network manager if you're a network provider and many network providers are now starting to also own content as well you want to make sure that if you are a competitor in terms of content provider that your network the network that you may be putting your traffic on that has its own set of content isn't allowing its network to own content to get priority to get an unfair advantage again in terms of if the networks are going to be in effect kind of open accessible and neutral networks that we've all come to expect from our telecommunications networks in the past you know how to make sure there's no bias the second part of what the FCC's order does is tries to make sure that these fixed and mobile network providers aren't able to block traffic and give their own content priority third it prohibits fixed broadband providers from unreasonably discriminating discriminatory practices again this is about both content but it also tries to get at that issue of what do you do how do you deal with those folks who have huge amounts of content that in effect try to flood the network that and cause clogging of the network you got to make sure that well we want to have open access you can't have people so overwhelm the network with their particular content without some ability to price that into the into the network providers basic service offerings again I know many of them are colleagues made their eyes are starting to gel I even see that some of the pages eyes are starting to gel as we dive into some of the intricacies of telecommunications practices here but at the end of the day what the FCC did in 2010 which will be implemented later this month unless the Senate and effect rejects it and throws the whole all the work out the window and says let's go back to square one which I think would actually do great harm to the progress made and provide even greater uncertainty to one of the fastest-growing areas of our economy telecommunications and broadband if we if we reject this Senate joint resolution six which I hope we will allow this compromise that the FCC's looked at to move forward I do believe it will allow the kind of a broadband growth the kind of internet growth that we've all come to want expect and that will help generate jobs in this in this country again the wireless issues one couple of final points the wireless issues in this area particularly challenging Wireless at least in terms of broadband is a newer technology and again the FCC in this area decided to a dot adopt a lighter hand of regulation than the more strict full telecommunications regulation of the of the 1996 Act in terms of mobile and we've seen this tremendous growth in mobile as of December 2010 26% of US households were wireless only compared to about 8% of the households five years ago the point here is a dramatic one I think about my kids who as they start to move into their own homes or even a college don't even have a fixed wireless phone in their apartment in college they rely entirely on wireless we've got to make sure that we can continue to build out these wireless networks in the most robust way possible and again I think the SCC basically got it right by by not putting a more heavy hand of regulation on this wireless build-out but by putting the lighter hand of regulation again in closing that to me the real issue here is how do we ensure that consumers and content providers are treated fairly the internet was designed as an open medium where every service and website had an opportunity to gain a following and to be successful this philosophy allows bloggers to compete with mainstream media and entrepreneurs across all sectors to complete globally small and medium businesses that rely heavily on web technologies to grow and export two times as much business businesses as those that don't according to McKinsey now some have argued that neither the Congress nor the FCC should do anything in this area because there isn't a widespread problem currently it is important to remember that the reason that the Internet has been success so successful has been the fact that no one has been able to control it no network provider alone no content provider alone I hope that never changes and I do believe that the resolution that the FCC reached in their order in December that again my hope is that the Congress will move forward on and allow to go into action they again helped set those minimum rules of the road that will allow both internet growth that allow broadband growth that will allow mobile growth all areas where the United States can regain the lead and in regain that we continue to create jobs and advance prosperity with that mr. president I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum

very much madam Speaker I thank the gentleman for yielding I thank him for his leadership on this important issue not only as this legislation comes to the floor but for the past couple of decades on the subject I commend the maker of their motion to accept the Senate bill congresswoman Gwen Moore for her sincere leadership on this issue as well let's just speak a madam Speaker 18 years ago members of Congress came together some of us gathered in this room in this chamber right now came together to make history with the original passage again of the Violence Against Women Act we helped ensure that no victim of domestic violence has to suffer in silence I want to specially salute our Vice President Joe Biden who was chairman of the Judiciary Committee in the Senate at the time worked with our Chairman and many members on both sides of the aisle to pass that legislation again making history the original Violence Against Women Act took domestic violence out of the shadows and shone bright pine on it in the year since domestic violence has decreased by more than fifty percent more than fifty percent what a remarkable outcome twice in the intervening years we have come together in a bipartisan way to reauthorize and strengthen the law today this year and today and now our colleagues in the Senate acted similarly passing strong a strong bill with a strong bipartisan vote of 68 21 including the support at every single woman in the Senate Democrat and Republican Democratic and Republican alike in doing so they not only built on the history of the past but they made progress for the safety of American women in sharp contrast sadly while there was a strong bipartisan bill in the Senate and our substitute that we requested from the Rules Committee was to be able to put forth the Senate bill so that would be Senate Democrats and Republicans House Democrats all in agreement unfortunately in sharp contrast House Republicans have brought to the floor today a bill that is controversial and that it will weaken the protections we have given to those who suffer domestic violence sexual assault or stalking this legislation on the floor fails vulnerable people members of the LGBT community Native American women and immigrant victims all people deserve to be protected from domestic violence there should be no exceptions to this law we can say women of America were passing a bill to protect you not so fast in your applause if you happen to be a member of the LGBT community and immigrant legal or otherwise and a a Native American because the Republican bill is a step backward from the current law of the land more than 300 organizations have spoken out in opposition from the American Bar Association to the YWCA and I would like to submit that list for the record pages and pages of organization objection for the record local law enforcement officials has said that this Republican House bill will impede criminal investigations undermine prosecutions and interfere with victim safety I repeat the quotations the local enforcement officials have said this bill quote will impede criminal investigations under my prosecutions and interfere with victim safety end of quote religious organizations such as the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee service and the National Association of Evangelicals have also expressed strong opposition to certain provisions of this legislation the many advocates and experts who work day in and day out on this issue on the issue of domestic violence have also opposed the House Republican version of violence against women act Republicans have chosen not to listen to the professionals in the field and are failing to give the many organizations serving battered women the tools that they need madam Speaker again I thank you for accepting the full list of groups opposing the bill to be entered into the Republican to the record the Obama administration has said in their statement of administration policy that the legislation rolls back existing law and removes long-standing protections for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault crimes the hominin tlie affect women that is why the president seniors advisors have said they would recommend that the president veto this bill today this House of Representatives has heard powerful statements from women members of Congress about the need to pass a strong violence against women bill whether it is action on and I hope that the safety of women will be high on the list of our colleagues as they determine their vote for nearly 20 years the Violence Against Women Act has strengthened communities and provided critical life-saving support to victims of violence because of this law more victims get the help they need and domestic violence rates have decreased not only has valla saved lives it has saved money all Americans are entitled to feel safe including in their own homes every one of us yet too many women continue to live in fear that is why we must strengthen never weaken the Violence Against Women Act and I want to commend the members of the Judiciary Committee my colleagues on the house side that a democratic side who have brought such a tremendous intellectual resource to this legislation the listening to those who minister to the needs of women who have been victims of domestic violence and to those who were trying to protect it I know that everyone in this body Democratic and Republican alike has the same goal which is the safety of women we not only want us all to have the same goal we want us to have the same goal for all women in America and that's why we must strengthen never weaken the Violence Against Women Act because all on the floor currently rolls back current law and fails to protect all victims of violence I urge my colleagues to oppose it and yield back the balance of my time gentleman's gentlewoman yields back the gentlewoman from Florida I yield three minutes to the gentlewoman from South Dakota miss gnome who is also a co-sponsor gentle gentle in South Dakota is recognized for three minutes thank you madam Speaker

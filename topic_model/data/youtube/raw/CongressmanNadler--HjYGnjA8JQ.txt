Democratic dear congressman jerrold nadler join see right now hey congressman how are you I'm very good thank you where is this going thing well where it's going i assume it's to an investigation to see whether the allegations are can be substantiated the allegations being that the walmarts subsidiary in mexico paid large-scale bribes in a systematic basis to mexican officials and that when this was brought to the attention of high-ranking people wall mark have they covered it up if that proves to be true and there are to be indictments well what is the punishment for this sort of thing I mean um you can go to jail right for this source you certainly can I assume I don't know the exact punishment but these are felonies so there is one major this is a lot of Walmart sympathizers and supporters say if this was business as usual next I don't know one way the other if it is um why target walmart because of its size or because it doesn't have any union well i don't think that either reason is the reason that wal-mart is being targeted by these investigations these investigations are occurring because evidence came out that wal-mart de and high executives in walmart systematically broke the law now I don't know whether it is true or not that the kind of bribes they were doing if they were doing them uh you have to make that caveat they're not proven guilty yet right but if they were offering these kinds of bribes I don't know that that's the way they do business in Mexico every day but even if it is we passed I shouldn't say we i wasn't in congress 10 to 30 years ago they were there was a lot of embarrassment to american foreign policy into the United States when American executives were caught the systematically bribing foreign officials a lot of countries and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act was passed to say that we are better than our corporations can compete without systematic bribery and if we want people around the world to look up to us and we want to be able to compete with others we have to do it honestly and if Walmart wasn't then they ought to take the consequences no I remember quite well what you're saying and then there was the Lockheed investigation all these government contracts isn'ta like who were who were brought up for you know embezzlement that sort of thing and trying to exact favors and setting up shop and getting orders abroad but there is the sort of knowing issue of whether Walmart might be disproportionately being targeted here now we don't know the magnitude of the problem we do know some of the numbers involved as I'm sure you're aware that this might involve upwards of sixty five million dollars in bribes might or might not that's a lot of money but well there's a lot of a lot of money I guess what I'm asking is then if you get similar numbers out of any large company would you be just as Ellis because that's what many are calling for now let's look at all american entities in mexico and what they have done to set up chomp in mexico would you be open to that as well absolutely anyone who is caught doing large-scale bribery or to be prosecuted now you talked about whether walmart was being targeted because people don't like it because it's non-union oh because it's too big or whatever there's no evidence of that right now all we know is that there that there are allegations with some substantiation of large-scale bribes and of a corporate cover-up conducted at the highest levels and that's got to be investigated when it's investigated when we see the evidence when we see the actions that are take and then people can decide that the Justice Department is acting appropriately or not

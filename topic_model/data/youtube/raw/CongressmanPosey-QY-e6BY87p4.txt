when from Florida mr. Posey thank you very much mr. chairman and and Thank You panel for your appearance today mr. Gerstenmaier on what date does our contract with the rushes to transport our astronauts back and forth the International Space Station what what is the date at the end of our contract with them the last launches are in the spring of 2019 with their crew returns in the fall of 2019 so by probably October November of 2019 we need to have some established way for a commercial the US crab providers to be delivering cruise ok how many missions do we have between now and then maybe Soyuz missions we have between now and then we have roughly we do two Soyuz missions in the spring and two Soyuz miche's in the fall so we fly essentially three crewmembers in the spring and three crew members in the fall okay how many do we have scheduled after that after the 2019 date with choice we have none no nothing's scheduled for the ISS we have we only have what I described before where we will fly one of our astronauts on the Soyuz vehicle for safety considerations and we will fly one Russian on our us crew providers but beyond that September 2019 date we have no further ability to use the Soyuz directly for our purposes but what it what is the need for missions to the space age how many more missions do you think we'll need to have to the space station we'll need again from from then through the end probably twelve missions or so again two per year the same kind of a year for the next till the end station goes through no earlier ends of station is no earlier than 2024 so that would be 2019 through 2024 so five years at two per year okay mr. Mulholland when do you think you're gonna be flight ready you know we have we have high confidence in our plan will fly our uncrewed flight in August of this year and crude flight in November of this so you think you be online by spring of 2019 yes sir okay mr. khones one how would you it's both saying we have an uncouth flight in August of this year and then we have a cool that the flight plan for December this year okay just out of curiosity mr. Gerstenmaier what are we paying the Russians for seat now it's on the order of 70 to 80 million dollars per seat okay are they gonna pay us when we carry their people up there no and we're not going to pay them for them carrying our astronauts to station but they will be carrying our astronauts after 2019 will they yes they will for the safety reasons I described earlier we will continue to have one u.s. crew member on every Soyuz flight that flies to station and we will continue to have one Russian on one of our US flights and that's to keep station viable with the Russian cosmonaut and a u.s. astronaut onboard station and that will be done under no exchange of funds basis all right so we'll carry ours and what lease one of theirs and look Harry there isn't at least one of ours that's correct okay Thank You mr. chairman yes sir thank you now

joining me now is democratic congressman tom malinowski of new jersey he sits on the transportation and infrastructure committee congressman thank you for being here so do you expect a deal to come out of this meeting between biden and senator capito today i i don't know about today but i i do hope that there's a chance here for a bipartisan deal it would be better if we did this as a unified congress as a unified country but the bottom line is one way or another we have to do it we have to deliver we we have a chance right now to rebuild america and not just to you know rebuild dwight eisenhower's interstate highway system for the 25th time but to do this in a way that makes the united states the world leader in transitioning from fossil fuels to clean energy that's a huge economic opportunity for us and i think in the house at least amongst democrats and republicans on the bipartisan problem solvers caucus we've come to some understanding of what that should include if we can get these republican senators and the president on the same page we can get a deal but one way or another we have to deliver look if the problem solvers caucus could be leading negotiations on multiple fronts i think that you we'd see a lot more bipartisan agreement that is for sure but for you personally how long is too long to wait for a bipartisan deal to take shape well i you know my deadline is not today i i i think we we've got a couple of weeks to to see here whether there is the basis for a compromise meanwhile in the house in the transportation and infrastructure committee we are moving forward marking up uh a surface transportation bill which would be a huge chunk of this jobs and infrastructure packages if this pushes into july then it then then that start then that starts being a problem for you i think that would be an indication that that the republicans are just not willing uh to go along with a compromised version of this and and you know to be clear joe biden has moved a lot already in these negotiations and we're willing to to move a little bit further but some of the key elements that he put forward have to be part of this we're you know we're not going to be uh digging up a road to repave it and then not fixing the water main underneath and and not laying broadband uh wires to connect people to high-speed internet that's just crazy and you know as china and europe invest way more than we are right now in moving to to clean energy in electric car infrastructure for example we're not going to be left behind that's just unacceptable so those fundamental elements have to be part of the package for this to be bipartisan if if funding these projects are so important and getting at this and projects that are you know a big deal in your district and quite frankly every district in america would you support and sign on to breaking this into smaller pieces if that got you closer to a deal look i just want to get it passed i want to deliver for for my constituents and for the american people i don't care as long as it's as long as it makes sense uh practically and so the scope has to be right doesn't have to be exactly what joe biden proposed but it's got to include those core elements and you know what we also want to be responsible in how we pay for these investments and and here's one big difference right now that the republicans many of them seem to want middle-class americans to pay for this with higher gas taxes i would like to see for example amazon pay taxes uh amazon i mean you got it back back and forth with amazon about that amazon shooting back that they did pay taxes in 2020 you're looking at their packs past tax base that is for sure and something you can continue to find what about using covet relief funds would you be okay with that if there if there are funds that we're not using for for other things then sure i mean we're all being practical about this i just don't think there's a lot of magic money lying around um and and these are big investments and and so we can find a little bit from passcode bill sure but magic money magic money that should be your next that should be your next agenda item is finding the magic money it's thank you congressman for coming in today is an important day we'll see what happens and i'll check in with you appreciate it come

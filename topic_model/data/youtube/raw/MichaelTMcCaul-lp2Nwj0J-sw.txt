Thank You governor for your strong leadership on this issue thank you for calling this important issue to the attention of this committee and I think it's an area that has been overlooked by the federal government as you have eloquently pointed out I wanted to make a sheet of course I know you've met with the or talked to the president I know you've met with Secretary Napolitano Attorney General Holder when asked earlier this month the Attorney General was asked why the Office of National Drug Control Policy has a southwest and northern border counter-narcotics strategy but does not have a Caribbean border strategy his response to that was when one looks at the Caribbean Puerto Rico in particular I think we need a strategy the so my question to you is what is the federal strategy for the Caribbean region at this very moment as far as as we see it our state law enforcement agencies are working very closely together with the local offices of those federal agencies but there is no strategy at this very moment actually that is exactly what we're asking that there be a strategy so that all the resource existing resources could be brought to bear to protect what we have called America's Caribbean border and it affects American citizens residing both in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands but it also affects every american's that is in every city across America and what we're asking is that there'll be a comprehensive interagency strategy for the US Caribbean border initiative and that this actually this will bring and bolster resources funding and staffing of federal law enforcement agencies throughout the region which are at this moment as I mentioned earlier under staff and also it will allow us to uninsured that Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands are included in any border security and drug trafficking initiatives that at this very moment we're not actually i'll be going further at this moment the nation has a strategy in the Caribbean with foreign con trees since both the USVI in Puerto Rico are part of the US were excluded from that tragedy and those meetings by same token there is a strategy for the southwest and the northern borders but none for the Caribbean bordered us at this very moment we fall between a you know fell between the cracks we're nowhere to be found so as I understand we have a strategy for the northern and southern borders but not for what i call the third border and that's the the caribbean there's no federal strategy fact if and I know you've come forward with a plan of your own in terms of creating one will be your top priorities in that type of strategy and that that plan well first of all we need to identify existing resources and and be able to create a comprehensive interagency strategy for the for the region that includes that encompasses both a US Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico what additional I mean we talk about resources these are obviously tough budgetary times but this is such a critical area we've seen a thirty percent increase in narcotics coming through this region as we seal the southern border and we're seeing an increase of this flow trafficking and as you stated there is no federal strategy what would you need and what needs to be done in terms of shifting a focus of resources to Puerto Rico into the rest of the Caribbean this will entail protecting our coasts in the case of just 40 Rico we have over 300 miles of coast that has to be protected as I mentioned earlier we're doing what we need to do in terms of all the cargo coming in we are handling at this moment ninety-two percent of the domestic cargo with a review and everything that is in those containers and we have just entered into an agreement with CBP to be able to also inspect international cargo we must make sure that CBP indeed has the resources working along sites with us to be able to handle that otherwise we will provide the resources we don't have a problem with that secondly we need the resources to protect our coastline that will i er for example fixed-wing airplanes that this woman operate out of Florida about have to cover the Caribbean which makes little sense and vessels as well the eastern side of Puerto Rico at this very moment which is the closest to the USVI doesn't have a vessel a coast guard vessel / barely operating in that area and we have seen an herb search in just drug traffic in the region but a drug-related violence as well actually I mentioned one of our joint strike forces with the federal government encompasses working on legal crimes and actually violent crimes with illegal arms we are expanding that initiative to do to eastern sectors or regions police regions because of the earth of search we have noticed in drug trafficking and violence in the inner part that's one of the island the clothes I just I say poor Rico's for the United States these are American citizens and I believe that the federal government needs to do a better job protecting them

thank you Mr chair so I'm glad to see that the last amendment was considered Germaine I think that the members will find that this is you will as well Mr chair uh this is kind of an amazing discussion that's going on here this afternoon a debate in the Judiciary Committee about a bill with with members on the other side of the aisle admittedly saying that this is very tightly focused and we're only aiming at controlling human trafficking in and around school zones when there is a absolute pipeline of Narcotics and teenagers and kids that are coming across the border on a daily basis and a lot of these a lot of these people are being trafficked not in school zones but in truck stops and in strip clubs and in drug houses around America being handed over directly to pimps that are part of the cartels on both sides of the Border so whether it's coming out of McAllen or the San Diego sector or whomever you talk to whether it is border patrol or Homeland Security it's an absolute pipeline of Narcotics and kids coming across and yet we're sitting here having a discussion about ignore that look the other way pretend that that's not happening at the border after this committee specifically has brought it up again and again and again in every hearing with a discussion a full discussion about border security where do you think these people are coming from homegrown this is all a homegrown issue this has nothing to do with what's coming across the border that's unbelievable that we're having this discussion today in this format and then Mr chair I mean for you to say this goes beyond that Mr Biggs Amendment goes beyond that it's too broad it goes too far are you kidding me that's the problem that's what we've been talking about for the last year and a half how do we get control of the border so that we can get control of the narcotics so that we can get control of the human traffickers and the cartel that's what this bill should do today this amendment that I had before the committee will increase the punishment for sex trafficking of children by entering the United States illegally as described in eight USC section 1325. that is what needs to be done so you can all Pat yourselves on the back and said this is an awesome bill I can run on this bill back home I can talk about listen I stopped human trafficking in the school zone back home in my district with complete disregard for all the individuals that are coming across the border on a daily basis turn on any news channel turn on any 24-hour News Channel and what you'll see our live shots from the border is it just adults is it just adults coming across no it's kids it's kids and a couple of members of The Other Side you got you got dangerously close to admitting that this doesn't address that it it's unbelievable to me that we're having this discussion without addressing the real issue which we have been pounding on and and bringing up on a regular basis specifically in this committee if if we don't if we don't address this here I'm not sure what it's going to take but like I said earlier there are all kinds of pockets where these kids are being exploited there's a pipeline it comes directly out of the western states it goes through Denver they jump on I-90 I-94 I-35 and they end up all over the United States these kids but guess where they come from we know where they're coming from they're coming from the border and this Judiciary Committee will not do anything about it and the idea that you would have the guts to bring up a bill and dance so close to the real issue and then pretend that it's that it doesn't exist is unbelievable to me I yield back

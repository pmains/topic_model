well i promised when i was running that i wouldn't raise taxes or add to the deficit the infrastructure bill we all need infrastructure it's popular issue it's an issue that i ran on i'm on the transportation infrastructure committee but there are 42 new taxes in that bill it'll add about 250 billion dollars to the deficit and i i was someone who put some appropriations requests into the legislation uh as in many other members of the house that those requests were stripped out in the senate this really was a senate transportation bill without any input largely from members of the house and i do believe we could have done more with less that we could have done it without some of the tax provisions in there that raise taxes on chemicals and mineral companies and then you know having that kind of deficit with inflation where it is and i would have loved to have seen it been to be bipartisan and bicameral in the same process this was a historic transportation bill and we didn't get any input

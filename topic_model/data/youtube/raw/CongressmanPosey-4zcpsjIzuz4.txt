thank you very much madam chair for holding this hearing today these are exciting times for space it's exciting to have Jim bridenstine as our NASA Administrator we're thrilled to have Bob Cabana back to head up the Kennedy Space Center yeah thank you for that it's exciting to have a president that loves space that's clear it's thrilling to have a vice president he loves space and and heads up the National Space Council and see that active again and moving forward and and it's especially great to see that space is still largely a bipartisan issue and probably the least daggers in this committee of all the committees in the house that's a really a good thing not many things were recommended for an increase like the NASA budget was and and we're all grateful to you for that and pleased to see that you want to continue to make significant investments in in our nation's space program most the increase will go towards the Artemis program which is wonderful and I think we're all excited about that but we do want to talk about some other objectives that are important and that is ground support systems we've always in a pass receive strong funding for ground support systems and we'll work to continue to do that you can have the best rockets and the best people on those rockets and the best people make them those Rockets make if you don't have the ground support systems in place nobody goes anywhere and we don't want to be on track for that and it's the possibility we might be on that track and we we need to make necessary adjustments to that to make sure our ground support systems are going to actually help us go back to the moon and ultimately to Mars instead a strong economy and the huge job demand space like most other industries it's a little bit in a bad spot for recruiting out skilled workforce people so we often hear about the importance of internships and and apprenticeships establish the administration's five-year plan also identified and just wondered if you'd speak to us about the steps the office is taking and the appropriate federal agencies are doing to support such activities including those working in skilled trades who don't require or acquire a four-year degree mm-hmm no thank you for that in your spot on one things that I talked about and I'd really increasingly am seeing in the country is what I call kind of a steep a seamless STEM enterprise and so you know sometimes research universities would look at a two-year college and say you know well kids that come to the University or not very well trained so we have to do a lot of remediation we need to all work together we need to all lift each other up and so for example I did a visit recently down to to Virginia to a company that builds all the nuclear reactors and fuel and everything for our marine or Navy submarines and ships the people that were working on doing incredible things with with welding us on none of them had a four-year degree they were all skilled trades people working with incredible computers so things like apprenticeships these programs working very of course the the National Council of the American worker the rescaling and upskilling of individuals who might be a traditional arc welder with an acetylene torch now we'll be running a computer and say well gee is it going to displace that person no it's going to put them to a new level of the economic earning because we still need their skills in operating that equipment because they're still welding at the end of the day the robots not doing it all on its own there has to be somebody there guiding it along and so I think this is tremendous opportunity with these industries of the future ai and advanced manufacturing 3d printing and things like that will really enable a lot of capability so the apprenticeships programs the the skilled technical workforce the National Council of the American worker the pledge to the American worker their Ivanka's champion 15 million you know upskilling and rescaling activities are really extraordinary and you know so stem is not just going to college and getting a stem degree it's the whole enterprise and somebody who's getting say in a skilled technical job maybe goes to a tier school maybe later on they get a four-year degree but if they don't they can come out starting to make 70 $80,000 a year that's a pretty good living and so I think the president's been very very clear and strong on this point of making sure that we we don't disenfranchise those folks but for example we you know continue to support that that type of activity because we need a whole spectrum of skills in this country well I'm very pleased to hear you say that and you know an economy where you have more job openings and you have people looking for work increases the economic value of every single person in the workforce and of course we want to continue that right now I see my time is expired and I yield back madam chair I just think one quick thing you mentioned the ground systems you look at things like big experiments like LIGO and telescopes and so people have to run those systems they have to manage maintain the HVAC systems on things like that a lot of those people don't have a green they don't need a degree but you need their tremendous skills and so those folks are just as important to science as a scientist actually doing the work sorry

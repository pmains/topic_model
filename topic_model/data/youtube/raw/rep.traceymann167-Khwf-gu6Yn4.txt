yeah well well thank you for letting me on thank you uh for being here to testify today uh really my question i know that senator tuberville touched on this as well but you know for me it's an honor to serve on the house veterans affairs committee i often tell people back home this really should be called the heroes committee and i'm glad to be here advocating for our men and women who wore the uniform our service members as they transition to civilian life often bring to the workforce workforce unique skill sets and backgrounds and perspective and i guess my question is how can congress improve the transition assistance program to better serve disabled service members in their transition to civil life i know i said senator tibberville also mentioned the transition but specifically on the transition assistance program what are the things that we could be doing to help our brave men and women when they return home enter the workforce and uh and have a good career thereafter thank you for such a great question because that transition is critical you know getting in front of them right away is the most important thing so they actually can have that soldier now veteran now has an idea of what they want to do uh but jim if you could elaborate a little bit more on some of the areas that we could get after that group that'd be great jim thank you commander we certainly agree that it's it's a significant process when you transition on the military and then finding employment after is so critical the dmv was able to still interview with the pandemic 21 000 departing service members last year and assist them with the initial claims process i think being able to continue to outreach to these individuals letting them know that there are benefits there are services available to you to help you with this transition is significant i also think making sure that service members are required to go through these out processing briefings we call them tap classes as as i was getting out of the military and it was very much beneficial to me teaching you how to write a resume where you can look for uh government jobs all these resources need to be available and it's got to be done in a consistent manner as well regardless of where you're being you're transitioning from yeah we hear that there are differences all over the place and and it can't be like it has to be consistent everywhere and we got to provide those services even after you're discharged you still want to have those services available to departing service members i think a big piece including spouses of service members is important as well it is a team effort obviously so we want to make sure that everybody's participating and taking advantage of those opportunities yeah how many you said it'd be good if all of them participated rough ballpark do the majority participate in something like that there's only a handful or any any do you have any data on that i don't offhand i know it is the majority i mean we we would be happy to research that a little bit and follow up with you and your staff okay we can reach out and i yield back thank you mr chairman

this constant stream of allegations and scandals springing from the excuse me from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue it's really quite shocking I have to admit that after watching president Trump fire the FBI director who was investigating him I thought things could not get any worse just days later President Trump blundered into sharing classified and intelligence with Russian officials as the nation and the world grappled with the aftermath of this revelation yet more shocking news was breaking the New York has alleged that before he was fired director Comey was pressured by President Trump to shut down an ongoing investigation into General Michael Flynn possible collusion with the Russians Mr Speaker I want to be very clear with the American people if the New York Times report is true president Trump's attempts to influence a federal probe can only be described in one way and that's obstruction of justice and yes obstruction of justice we all know is an impeachable offense right now one thing though is crystal clear the president's abuse of power has plunged this nation into a full-blown constitutional crisis this crisis goes far beyond party interests every american democrat or republican should be concerned by these allegations president Trump's actions have threatened national security the rule of law and the independence of our nation's justice system his actions dishonor the office of presidency and place our nation and its allies in danger the reports of last week underscored the need to establish a bipartisan independent commission to get to the bottom of Russian interference in our elections once and for all it's vitally important that director Muller and I'm very pleased that the Department of Justice appointed him this is one step in the right direction but is very important that he be given the resources and the autonomy to conduct an investigation unfortunately President Trump said that this investigation is a witch-hunt nothing could be further from the truth the American people deserve to know the facts about possible collusion between Russia and the Trump administration the Trump campaign our democracy must be defended at all costs and so thanks you congresswoman jayapal for giving us a chance to speak tonight about this very dangerous moment that we're in about presidential abuse and you know and really about the preservation of our democracy the Congressional Progressive Caucus continues to lead on so many issues that are important to this country and to the world

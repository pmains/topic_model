drizelda 45 minutes Thank You mr. chairman and thank you for the opportunity to present my bill HR 32-29 to provide for the non application of medicare competitive acquisition rates to complex rehabilitative wheelchairs and accessories an important piece of legislation which would have a significant impact on individuals with severe disabilities complex power manual rehabilitative wheelchairs and related accessories are mostly utilized by a small percentage of individuals who suffer from significant disabilities such as ALS cerebral palsy multiple sclerosis muscular dystrophy spinal cord injury traumatic brain injury and many more within the medicare program these individuals represent less than ten percent of all Medicare beneficiaries who use wheelchairs making them an extremely vulnerable group of people suffering from significant disabilities specialized equipment these individuals rely upon for daily life is provided through a clinical team model and requires evaluation configuration fitting adjustment or programming before it can be properly used this small population of individuals has the highest level of disabilities and requires these individually configured wheelchairs and critical related accessories to meet their medical needs and maximize their function independence in 2008 Congress passed the President signed into law the Medicare improvements for patients and providers Act mipa which established a fixed price schedule for complex rehab technology CRT and related accessories under HIPAA CRT devices would be excluded from CMS's competitive bidding program to ensure consistent and fair prices for consumers excluded devices include power wheelchairs and related accessories which are the fundamental parts of the products that make them useful and beneficial to people with progress disabilities such as recline tilt system specialty controls and seat back cushions in November 2014 however CMS issued a ruling contrary to meta which stated that beginning in january of 2016 accessories that are used on complex rehabilitative wheelchairs will no longer be a part of the fixed fee schedule but will now be subject to competitive bidding prices which will decrease access to the individually configured wheelchairs and accessories relied on by adults and children with disabilities while Congress acted to temporary delay this measure until 2017 further action is needed to permanently address this issue my legislation HR 32-29 seeks to codify the 2008 mipa regulations and excludes power and manual wheelchairs and their related accessories from the competitive bidding process in addition to the significant support from groups such as the ALS Association Muscular Dystrophy Association National Multiple Sclerosis Society Paralyzed Veterans of America that's first the United spinal Association and the Christopher Reeve Foundation just this past week the governor Accountability Office issued a report to Congress regarding the benefits of this legislation this GAO report focused on utilization expenditures for Medicare with wheelchairs and accessories and how the 2016 competitive bidding program adjusted payment rates for accessories and how those rates compared to the 2016 unadjusted fee schedule payment rates for the same items in addition to recognizing that CRT wheelchairs accessories are acquired by individuals with high levels of disabilities the report also details that these wheelchairs accessories are not standard wheelchairs and they are individually configured to each person utilizing this technology to meet their specific needs the report further states that the information CMS is relying upon to shift these wheelchairs and accessories from a fixed price schedule to the competitive Bing prices process is based on limited information from only 9 of 109 total bidding areas which is clearly insufficient in order to nationally shift policy in fact the report shows that this shift will bring about significant payment cuts ranging from ten to thirty four percent which will only result in increased costs which are passed along to the consumer my legislation is a common-sense approach to addressing one of the significant issues currently affecting the Medicare system is broadly bipartisan legislation is supported by well over 100 mm murs in the house is companion bill Senate bill 2196 also enjoys significant bipartisan support in the Senate this legislation ensures that those who are in need of the most assistance are not unfairly impacted by this new policy shift mr. chairman thank you again for the opportunity to testify on behalf of this essential piece of legislation and I yield back the balance of my time Thank

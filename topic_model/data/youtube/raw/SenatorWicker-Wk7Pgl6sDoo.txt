Armed Services Subcommittee on seapower convenes this afternoon to receive testimony from prominent naval analysts on achieving the 355 ship Navy we welcome our four witnesses dr. Eric Labs senior analyst for naval forces and weapons at the Congressional Budget Office mr. Rana lo Rourke specialists in naval affairs at the Congressional Research Service dr. Jerry Hendrick senior fellow and director of the defense strategies and assessments program at the Center for a new American security and mr. Brian Clark senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and budgetary assessments our subcommittee is grateful for these witnesses appearing before us they're thoughtful analysts analysis will be most helpful as we consider options for increasing the size and enhancing the capability of our Navy today's hearing represents another step in this subcommittee's effort to examine the Navy's 355 ship requirement we have received a classified briefing on the requirement heard from shipbuilders and suppliers held a shipbuilding hearing with Navy officials and received testimony from Reagan administration officials last week our actions this year will set a firm foundation for an intelligent and responsible expansion of the fleet in the future to that end I would note the bipartisan ships Act legislation which would codify the Navy's requirement for 355 ships as US policy the full committee has adopted the ship's act into the FY 18 NDAA and our House counterparts have done the same and gotten it passed by the entire House of Representatives the C power title also authorizes additional funding for five ships above the administration's budget request while maintaining effective cost control measures on existing programs each of our witnesses has made important contributions toward analyzing Navy for structure including the Navy's 355 shift dr. labs annual analysis of the Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan is eagerly anticipated and widely read his special report this April which projected costs and timeframes to achieve a 355 ship Navy is particularly relevant in this report he found that 2035 is the earliest date upon which a 355 ship fleet could be achieved that's eighteen years from now his report estimates that estimates that reaching 355 ships would require doubling the historical spending on shipbuilding to about 33 billion dollars per year for a number of years in comparison the Navy's budget request included about 20 billion dollars for shipbuilding in FY 18 he also found the Navy would need 19,000 more sailors to man these extra ships 15 billion dollars more for associated aircraft and also that annual fleet operating cost would increase by 67% or 38 billion dollars compared to today's fleet my understanding is that his analysis did not consider the effects of extending service lives for existing ships or reactivating decommission ships mr. o'roarke government service as a naval analyst began in 1984 during our last naval buildup his frequent reports on specific shipbuilding programs as well as broader naval issues are read closely by this subcommittee by government and industry leaders by our allies and partners and by competitors his latest navy force structure report published last month highlights the Navy's proposed mix of ships within the 350 pound ship requirement he determined that the Navy would need to add at least 57 ships over the 30-year shipbuilding plan to achieve and maintain a 355 ship fleet this effort would require a minimum increase of 4.6 billion dollars in the annual shipbuilding budget unless the service lives of existing ships are extended beyond currently planned figures and or retired ships or are reactivated as a retired Navy captain and highly regarded analyst dr. Hendrix is intimately familiar with Navy capability gaps and modernization needs he has written many compelling reports and articles including one which I've previously entered into the record entitled how Trump can build a 350 ship Navy co-authored with Robert CEO Brian for Politico in this article he asserts that a 350 ship fleet could be attained as early as 2024 by increasing the Navy's top-line budget roughly 20 billion dollars cumulative over the next eight years to achieve this timeline he proposes several out-of-the-box actions including service length extensions reactivating decommissioned ships and building foreign designs in u.s. shipyards finally as a retired Navy Commander and top former chief day of and top aide to a former Chief of Naval Operations and prominent analysts mr. Clark has been assessing and making recommendations on Navy for structures structure needs for over a decade as with all the witnesses his body of work is an excellent resource for this subcommittee today I would like to focus on his congressionally directed future fleet architecture study called restoring American sea power his study calls for a 382 ship Navy by 2030 a figure which would cost an additional four to five billion dollars for shipbuilding every year the study's in-depth analysis of capabilities platforms and operating concepts and posture were compelling and I hope to see of these recommendations implemented the subcommittee is interested in the views of these four witnesses on the options and considerations for achieving a 350-pound ship Navy specifically I hope our witnesses discuss what factors are driving the need for a bigger Navy the right mix of ships for a future fleet timelines and costs for achieving the Navy's requirement innovative options to grow the fleet including extending service lives and reactivating decommissioned ships the additional support necessary to generate and maintain the fleet build-up including personnel aircraft weapons other equipment and maintenance and finally actionable items that this subcommittee should consider to lay a firm foundation for a fleet buildup on

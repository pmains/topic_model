and let's bring in wesley hunt army veteran who is running for congress in texas wesley you heard aoc there say that texas turning blue is inevitable what do you think is it you know aoc's dream of turning texas blue is no more real to santa anna's dream of conquering texas it just ain't gonna happen and look she comes down here to texas and she loves our freedom but she doesn't want tech sins to have freedom she's completely out of touch with texas and when you look at the policies that she supports uh what's happening at our southern border enough fentanyl to to kill every american in this country five times as poured into this country our supply chain issues the assault on the oil and gas industry this is just not how we roll down here in texas yeah all great points but i think that some conservatives do worry about texas turning blue because people from california and new york and new jersey they're leaving their high tax areas and moving to texas and could be bringing their politics with them it is happening so how do you fight back against that you know it's happened to a certain extent but if you look at where joe biden is and the blind administration how poorly they are doing amongst independents and the issues that i just listed we aren't really concerned about that it's up to republicans to get our message out that look we are the party of freedom we are the party of liberty no mask mandates no vaccine mandates if you have a business and you want to come here and you want to grow your business texas is the best place place to do that but don't bring your politics with you there's a reason why we're like that here and in florida and we've got to make sure that we keep our state read you know wesley i want to tap into your military experience here there's this after action report that shows that military leaders were frustrated with the white house and the state department during the disastrous afghanistan withdrawal in the washington post sums up this report saying declassified u.s military analysis of the calamitous exit from afghanistan detail repeated instances of friction between american troops and diplomats before and during the evacuation concluding that indecisiveness among biden administration officials and um initial reluctance to shudder the embassy in kabul sowed chaos and put the overall mission at increased risk pentagon press secretary john kirby was asked about this yesterday listen to what he had to say yeah i think i think we need to keep these documents in perspective they didn't think that these documents were going to become public they weren't talking to reporters they were talking to investigators and they were talking about appropriately what they saw there at the airport what they experienced there in in kabul and in afghanistan in real time he says that we need to keep these documents in perspective what is your perspective on them so we watch this unfold in real time and when we take back the house here in 2022 we need to have a complete investigation as to what happened and i am shocked that ginsake didn't even know that an aar had been conducted but this is weakness being displayed on a world scale and you look at what's happening with russia and the ukraine and china and taiwan and iran having a path to a nuclear weapon yet again this would have never happened during the four years under the trump administration and right now joe biden is making jimmy carter look strong and furthermore if we can't defend our southern border and putin knows this how can we possibly defend the ukrainian border again we look weak this is the weakest we've looked for the last 40 years we've got to do something about this and this report only shows just how haphazardly that exit from afghanistan was and it cost us 13 american lives it is unacceptable yeah and i think that one of the biggest concerns now is the danger afghanistan poses without a military presence there and i hope that doesn't come back to bite us wesley thank you for joining us this morning

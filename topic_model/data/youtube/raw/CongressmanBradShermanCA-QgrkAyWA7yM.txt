I'll have a number of statements and questions for the record I know we have this five-minute time limit and I look forward to reading most of your answers as to I ran you knew I would do that as to I ran I want we need to get Europe on our side to impose sanctions whether or not they view those as sanctions because they don't like the Iran deal or because they don't like Iran's other non-nuclear policies I want to thank you for bringing to the attention of our European friends the assassinations that Iran has been responsible for in Europe I know you face some pushback on that but whether it's the death in Bulgaria in 2012 by the assassination of Hezbollah and Iranian surrogate or whether it's the death just last year and is Istanbul or whether it's the Netherlands assassination of an advocate for the Arab minority in Iran there are assassinations in Europe and you should know that sitting right there secretary Kerry told this committee that it is fully consistent with the jcpoa for the United States to impose sanctions on Iran for their non-nuclear wrongdoing including sanctions against the Central Bank of Iran I'd only wish that you had gone that the administration had gone to Europe urging sanctions for that reason rather than asking them to repudiate the jcpoa I want to associate myself with ranking member as to the issue of resources and particularly ask you to focus on appointing an East Asia and South Asia assistant secretary as to Pakistan it is a country of great importance to us and has various regions I hope the State Department would do public diplomacy in the Sindhi language and I hope that you would reach out to the pack to the leaders of Pakistan about the disappear Terrence's in Sindh and the forced disappearances as to North Korea I can understand that your bargaining position is complete immediate a dropping of their entire nuclear weapons program and a verifiable and irreversible manner that has been referred to as the Libya model I would hope that while you can go into negotiations with that if you can come out with verifiable limitations and end to the creation of new fissile material a halt permanently to their ICBM program that should not be regarded as a failure simply because you don't get complete verifiable irreversible denuclearization of the Iranian Peninsula as to Turkey I hope that the administration would oppose the sale and prevent the sale of the f-35s they can't they are not a weapon to be used against terrorists their weapon to be used against Greece and I hope the State Department would at least be neutral should Congress consider as we are considering the recognition the remembrance of the millions of Armenian Greek Assyrian Sheldon and Syriac victims of the Ottoman Empire at the beginning of the last century as to our trade deficit with China that grew from 309 to 337 in the first year of the administration and I hope that we don't see a shuffle where we continue to import oil then China buys our oil and natural gas and then we're told what we've done something about the trade deficit we should not count oil and gas exports to China as a reduction in the trade deficit I would hope that when you talk to president Sisi you urge him to protect the Christian minority and note that all that only 53 permits have been issued to renovate or build churches when over 5,500 applications have been made well one question for an oral response or a quick response and that is can we meet our challenges the world with a 30% cut in the foreign aid budget oh you have my word as I said we're gonna we're gonna get this piece right I assure you and I want to comment on one other I am close to making a number of significant announcements about new members of the team since the secretary for East Asian affairs in South Central Asia amongst them ambassador Shannon is retiring here shortly we'll need a replacement for him and we're very close to moving along we've got to get him through the Senate but I'm looking forward to getting the whole team bill back we go now too

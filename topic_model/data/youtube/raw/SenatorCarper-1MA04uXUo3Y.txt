hi everybody i'm tom carpenter i'm happy you are able to join us today i have a a question here from a fella from newark named mark and i just want to read the question and maybe share some thoughts in response to it here's why mark writes to say he says the department of energy has now restricted the loan guarantee program only to those projects that can be ready by this september 30th excluding dozens of worthy viable clean energy projects from securing funding he goes on to say what are you doing to make sure the department of energy provides appropriate funding to allow this successful program to continue good jobs and our energy future are hanging in the balance uh first and foremost let me just say first of all mark thanks for your question and secondly i just want to say i want to make as clear as i can that i am committed to having offshore wind energy in our state i've been working on this for years and i'm determined to get it done i know a lot of people feel that way i think i can speak for the entire congressional delegation all three of us senator cones congressman carney and myself and the governor jack markell when i say that we will do everything in our power to make this a reality we want to get this done on our watch uh we're going to work to in fact we are working to get more money for the loan program we're making modifications to the loan program uh introducing a bill to expand offshore uh when tax credits beyond 2012 uh working with the administration to move the process along now let me just start with the facts the department of energy is following congress's orders establishing the budget agreement this year to fund the government and before this agreement there was money in a 2005 loan guarantee program that was inaccessible to renewable projects like blue water wind congress fixed this problem by directing the department of energy to make some of those funds more accessible now despite this setback i'm committed to working with my colleagues in the congress governor other state officials the administration the obama administration and the private sector to help offshore win in this industry and especially uh the nrg bluewater wind project to uh continue to move forward i think we've made some great progress by the way and with respect to um getting uh permitting firming challenges overcome we've done that and now we'll focus refocusing on the the financing i've already had uh meetings delivered within the last month or so with u.s secretary of interior uh with u.s secretary of energy to discuss how we can help move nrg bluewater win forward i'll also be working with my congressional colleagues in the particularly in the senate to restore funding to the loan guarantee program and to remove some of the more cumbersome hurdles that pose challenges to alternative energy projects this change the loan guarantee program is certainly a disappointment to me and i know to others and a new challenge to overcome in our quest for for safe for reliable for sustainable domestic energy off the coast of delaware but as albert einstein once said he used to say in adversity lies opportunity he's right then it's true today as well and i'm confident that together we'll overcome this adversity and seize this remarkable opportunity before us carpe diem additionally i'll be introducing legislation uh very shortly to extend the critical tax credits for offshore win development beyond 2012 doing so with olympia snow republican from maine and others the tax credits available to investors in offshore wind projects for the first three thousand megawatts of offshore wind facilities placed into service and once awarded a tax credit companies have five years to install win facilities this tax credit is designed to spur the growth of the offshore wind in domestic energy industry and to ease our costly dependence on foreign oil sooner and that would be a very good thing thank you mark

thank you i want to thank all three of you i'm going to start with simply an overview we've been hearing an awful lot about artificial intelligence machine learning are they one and the same that's one thing you can maybe just very quickly i really want to know and mike and i both serve on armed services this is a subcommittee of armed services all three of us serve on where are we in the pecking order of what's going on in this unbelievable world that you're explaining to us are we behind are we in the hunt are we on the cutting edge what more can we do besides we know investing but we want to invest in the right places to get the best results so is the private sector are you moving us to a position to where i'll use the the whole spacex program what they've been able to do in the private sector for the defense of our country and the amount of money that we have saved because of the efficiency of the private sector can that be duplicated here in artificial intelligence and machine learning better invested in because we're contracting as a federal government for our defense programs with spacex putting different types of articles that we need in space as you know so with that we can start and we'll start dr moore if you can and keep them fairly concise if you can and your answers because everyone has an awful lot of interesting questions thank you chairman mentioned yes i'll be concise artificial intelligence without machine learning gave us things like deep blue where the american ibm computer deep blue beat the russian chess master uh kasparov gary kasparov back in the 1990s we were all so happy about that in the ai world but these systems did not adapt over time and so that's why machine learning in the early 2000s has come in and made ai much more powerful than it was in the days of deep blue so basically it's an integrated into one uh it's all one ai and machine learning is now integrated as one that's right in the old days you could have ai without machine learning these days you always want ai with machine learning and on the other real quickly on on the other where do we rank just given your ranking you don't have to name countries but are we behind and hunt are we on the cutting edge we are ahead we're losing ground i'm most worried about our structures bringing in massive scale superhuman automation means changing organizational structures and change management that's what i believe companies are really quite good at uh but you all can do it better than we can do in government is what you're saying and we can contract out in a very secure situation like we do at some of our defense okay perhaps yes dr long thank you senator manchin i'd like to concur with dr moore that ai is a like a broader umbrella that has machine learning within it as a component now i understand the confusion because those two those two terms have become almost anonymous because almost all of the ai that we talk about today is machine learning but in the past there were other techniques that were not machine learning so right now they're basically the same thing it may be that machine learning uh will not be the same as ai in the future but right now they're basically the same thing with ml machine learning a small subset of ai with respect to why are we ahead behind to evaluate what's going on i'm sure you all have interaction with your with your colleagues around the world in different countries whether they're adversaries or allies the scientific world seems to cross over pretty i wish we could do as well as as you all do in that arena yes how do you evaluate it i've tried to study this directly and u.s is ahead china's been gaining we still have an innovation lead i i i'm confident to say and we also have companies like those represented here that give us a huge leg up what i would like to point out from a dod perspective is that the dod has an opportunity to to step ahead of industry in the adversarial context a lot of the time my my co-panelists here are developing products that don't have a natural adversaries trying to mess with them but the dod does and so that's a place where we really need to focus a little bit further on what is somebody going to do to subvert our systems as we deploy them dr horvitz first let me say that um the people in the other fields of ai love machine learning but they they have all existed side by side since 1956 when the first proposal was written about using the phrase ai for the first time machine learning has gained but it's simply i shouldn't say simply because it's important a part of ai it's not separate it's one of the one of the important disciplines within ai that's the way ai researchers view machine learning now it's grown up to be a very big discipline because almost every other discipline leverages the advances in that field which are moving very quickly the us is leading in in science at the core principles and create creative applications from my point of view that said these days technical advances spread around the world like lightning so at the scientific frontiers i see scientists really keeping pace with one another around the world there are issues around who has the right resources to do the computation that's needed because these models are getting bigger and bigger and they're showing value with getting bigger they don't see any leveling off just yet you need tremendous amounts of compute for that kind of thing there are probably two places in the united states that can compute like that a couple in china right now um so thinking about the resource constraints especially on academic researchers to push on the research is very very important direction the private sector is kind of like spacex in some ways microsoft for example is building platforms and tools and it's working with customers in the federal government as well as in uh civil society and and in the um private sector to understand what it takes to field these applications and tools and and technologies the one place that i worry about federal applications in dod is integrating in these scientific achievements into real world workflows i think the devil's in the details there it gets into lots of engineering human ai human factors and human ai collaborative approaches we need to get our hands dirty and work hard and then share ideas insights across the sectors thank you all so much and then just one final one the um i would say respectfully all three of you are in working with the federal government and with department of defense and being able to harden basically making sure that we're not going to be hacked or the information we have has been protected i would assume you all have done that we'll talk about that more too but i just wanted to make sure i brought that up center rounds

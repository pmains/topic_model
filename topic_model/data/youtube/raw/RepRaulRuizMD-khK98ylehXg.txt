here this is the final amendment to the bill which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee if adopted the bill will immediately proceed to final passage as amended right now House leadership is focused is forcing a vote on a bill that they know will go nowhere instead of working to find pragmatic solutions to our most pressing problems they have chosen to put politics above the needs of the American people they have chosen to put politics above jobs the economy health care comprehensive immigration reform and again they are playing politics with millions of hard-working families who have lost their job through no fault of their own and are currently looking for jobs the gentlelady is correct the house is not in order it is now in order thank you currently over two million people have lost unemployment insurance because of these political games every week 72,000 people on average are losing their unemployment benefits nationwide while they are looking for jobs in my home state of California almost 350,000 people are living on the brink of financial disaster because of these games this is exactly the kind of political gain Manship that the American people are sick and tired of house leadership continues to refuse to restore this vital economic lifetime that helps people support their families and pay their bills while they look for a new job long-term unemployment remains an enormous challenge for millions of Americans and our overall economy which is exactly why we should put the American people first and renew this important program we need to focus on creating new jobs and help American families temporarily weather the storm I yield back the balance of my time

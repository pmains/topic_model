two things that are missing I think most in Washington these days are the two seas the willingness to communicate and always compromise and the third thing that's missing is a tea the word is trust and one of the ways to to I think improve the trust is actually spend more time together we Democrats have a caucus lunch in the Senate on Tuesdays and another one on Thursdays no Republicans Republicans have a caucus lunch on Tuesdays and on Thursdays no Democrats every two years we have retirement dinners for senators that are leaving the u.s. in it the Democrats have those Republicans have theirs it's crazy what we should do is from time to time eat together for going on a congressional delegation trip to Afghanistan or Pakistan or Iraq or someplace like that it should be bipartisan one of the reforms that I brought with me from for being a governor for up for eight years was the idea that every time every two years we have newly elected senators there we have new senators cold the Faculty's current senators and their spouses Democrats and Republicans we actually get to know each other we develop some bonds or friendship and begin to build on that trust we need to continue to do just that kind of thing

chairman since President Biden took office we have seen a tremendous surge in the terrorist watch list arrests at the southern border there were two terrorist watch list arrests in fiscal year 2017 six in 2018 0 in 2019 three in 2020 in 2021 President Biden's first year in office Terror watch list arrest surged to 15 in 2022 there were 98 terrorists arrested at the southern border and this fiscal year so far there have been 38 arrests according to border patrol that then approximately 1.2 million known gotaways since President Biden took office November alone 73 000 border crossers evaded overwhelmed border patrol agents but were detected by other forms of surveillance these crosses are known as gotaways often these border crossers are evading being caught by border patrol because they have a criminal record or Contraband to hide unlike most migrants who crossed with the explicit intention to meet border patrol but today I want to ask about other Sinister news in the immigration space I have a copy here of an email circulated last Thursday January 26th at Mount Pleasant High School in Rhode Island its assistant principal Stephanie Harvey someone with a Doctorate in Education is fundraising among its faculty and staff to pay a debt to a cartel that trafficked a student the email calling it an urgent matter reads we have a student who came to America with a coyote with coyote which is a group that helps people this group gives you a time frame to make a payment of five thousand dollars to those who bring them into the states our student needs our urgent support to raise another two thousand dollars to meet his goal of five thousand dollars by February 1st 2023. sheriff is this helpful is that I'm sorry sir is this helpful to have faculty raising money to pay a Mexican cartel to bring someone into the country Congressman no okay ranking member uh said that many of President uh Trump's policies have been continued um is the fence continuing to be built on the southern border no is the remain in Mexico policy being continued no is the agreement with the northern triangle countries to immediately Deport illegal immigrants who come into this country has that policy been continued no Sheriff let me ask you something um we now have in this country 2 million individuals who have gone through the entire process and have been adjudicated for removal in other words they came to this country they applied for Asylum they weren't entitled to Asylum they came here for economic reasons so they went through they had due process they have been adjudicated they have been ordered removed and the president of the United States has instructed ice not to seek those individuals and remove them from the country to million what's the impact of an order like that in terms of welcoming people who are coming to this country for all the wrong reasons well Congressman that's one of the things that has changed with the two administrations that I've seen is the former president had a very strong message when you say former president president Trump yes sir that if you come to Country you break our laws there's consequences under the current one that's not being the rule of law is not being fulfilled okay and and I guess just to uh further that a little bit the impact on individuals that are considering coming to this country when they know if they come to this country there's going to be a consequence a negative consequence for them or and I'm not even talking about a welcome mat we welcome immigrants to this country we welcome people who want to go through the process the right way we want legal immigration but when they know that they're coming to this country and there is no consequence to come to this country illegally and even when they lose in court and they are ordered removed the United States won't remove them under this Administration and there is this hope for an amnesty program to go through Congress or informally as President Obama did and this President will probably do the same thing uh issue an executive order with the stroke of a pen to give people amnesty what what is the impact on on people being attracted to this country for all the wrong reasons well Congressman there's a couple number one is they keep coming and we're seeing that on the border number two it's a fracture of our rural law the oath that I take that you all take and share it and last not least is it's an insult to all law enforcement State local and federal try and do our best to secure this border thank you are you back thank the gentleman for

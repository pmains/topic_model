I feel very confident that the up or down vote on the majority rule proposal that will come to the house will satisfy members concerns about the Senate bill every vote every legislative vote is a heavy lift around here you assume nothing assume nothing in terms of where you were before where people may be now and Pelosi said that even after the declaration of congressman bart stupak this morning congressman Stupak saying that he and 12 other Democrats are prepared to bring down the health care bill because the Senate version doesn't use the Stupak language on banning federal funding of abortion also today Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius met with top insurance executives to raise concerns about huge rate hikes President Obama actually dropped in on the meeting to show the executives a letter from a woman whose plight was typical of many Americans her insurance rates had gone up forty percent in one year meantime Republican congressman nathan Deal announced today that he will not resign until after the healthcare vote and over in the Senate one of the architects of reconciliation Robert Byrd clearly said he does not oppose reconciliation for the House Senate changes to the Senate bill which contradicts key Republican talking points White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said today that the House and Senate were on schedule to get something done on health care by March 18th the house passing the Senate version he explained would be the first part of that let's bring in congresswoman maxine waters of California's 35th district thanks very much for your time tonight congressman you're welcome delighted to be here with you we know what the process has to be the house in an unprecedented move has to pass the Senate bill without changing anything in it that bill then gets signed into law and then immediately you start working on a reconciliation bill to pass both the House and the Senate that will correct many of the deficiencies are other issues in the Senate bill that the house wants fected and now including some senators want corrected is the timetable of March 18th realistic for at least getting the house to pass the Senate bill I think this timetable is perhaps more realistic than any of the other time tables that have been set in the recent past I think that members of the Democratic caucus have gone through a grueling debate and you know many of us have fought very hard starting out from wanting single-payer to public option to national health exchanges but we realize I think most of us that we've got to move this bill I think the president is correct the American people deserve comprehensive universal health care reform and that if we don't get it done now perhaps it will be another maybe 15 20 years before it can even be attempted again so I think people are pretty much ready to move and get something done when this two-stage process for passing the bill was first floated a speaker Pelosi a few weeks ago at that time said I don't see the votes for it at this time what has changed since then in the House of Representatives I think what has changed is an understanding that there were central elements in this bill such as pre-existing conditions subsidized health care for the poor beyond Medicaid involving all of the businesses in providing health care for their employees are paying a fee so that the other taxpayers wouldn't have to pick up that cost I think that people have probably come to the conclusion that they're very very substantial basic elements to this bill that's worth passing now the public option continues to gain support in the Senate the 35th member of the Senate has now signed on to wanting to do the public option in a reconciliation bill after after the house passes the Senate the Senate bill but President Obama today is reported in the with progressives from the house to have said that in effect for him the public option is dead at this point it doesn't that mean that President Obama is in effect the biggest opponent to the public option well it means that the president even though he's often said that he was supportable public option option that he's not really been out there really fighting for it but I think if the Senate emerges with enough votes to put it in I don't think he'll resist it I think he probably does not believe that there's enough votes in the Senate to get it done but we're all hopeful those of us who fought so hard first for a robust public option and then accepted just plain old public option when we passed it out of the house we're thrilled at what we see happening in the Senate and we hold out hopes for the possibility that public option will end up in the bill but the House bill did pass the first time with only a free vote margin congressman Stupak says that in Carson stupak was included in that group he's saying that he and maybe ten others will Lee will leave that group if the abortion language isn't corrected according to his specifications if that happens it seems like you don't have a winning margin in the house well i think that the congressman is hopeful that he can have his way that he can threaten in ways that will cause his language to be acceptable but i think what you're hearing from crowley and from nancy pelosi and others that we think that this bill is going to make it representative maxine waters of california thank you for your time tonight welcome

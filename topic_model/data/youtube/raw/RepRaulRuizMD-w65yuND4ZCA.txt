this would be a disaster for my sake if strictly budget oriented my sense is going to be big trouble this destroys Medicaid as we know it this bill does nothing to reduce health care costs that last lawmaker you saw there is Congress enroll refuse me rosaries of California just one of the Democrats on the Energy and Commerce Committee unleashing their outrage and pulling an all-nighter marking up the Republicans health care bill this as a right now I want to look at this this is a live look at the committee i'm going to say they look pretty good is they're approaching 23 hours in those seats talking and lucky us congressman raul ruiz had stepped out of that meeting and he joins me now first how you holdin up well we're holding up you know I'm an emergency medicine doctor I'm trained to think be sharp on my feet for long hours so I'm fine I'm ready to go another 24 hours if needed to protect health care for the American people then actually let's start with that in order several that would like to shave yeah well the more than as a Democrat as an ER doc as an ER doctor what do you think this problem innisfil what would hurt the American people the most as a doctor you know as a doctor I want my patients to have health insurance I want them to be able to come into the emergency department and feel secure that was that they will get the care that they need and not have to worry about the cost of the bill or the cost of medicine and this bill will be disastrous for working families this is a violation about the American value of fairness this will create millions more of uninsured patient it will increase the cost for working families who are already struggling to live paycheck to paycheck while giving tax breaks to corporations and making the house more affordable for millionaires that's an outrage and and and this is contrary to the American value of fairness if this is so bad and why not just let it go through let the Republicans get it through and let's see what it does because if what you do is block it and the Republicans say listen we try to make things better we tried but the Democrats wouldn't play ball yeah you know that's what the Republicans did with the Affordable Care Act they sabotaged it in order to try to play the blame game later for political gain and I'm not yeah I don't take part of that because I'm a physician I you know I the American people are sick of that I want to fight to the very end to do what's right for the American people because I took the Hippocratic oath the first do no harm so I will be here another 24 hours if necessary to fight these these proposals that will essentially stripped health insurance for millions of people the Medicaid program is in jeopardy right now they want to do a per capita blog grant which means that over time due to any unexpected epidemic or new expensive the Block Grant payment to States will be underfunded for the actual cost of state health care which means that they will cut eligibility more people uninsured me they will cut the benefits meaning that less coverage for patients on Medicaid and they will reimburse hospitals and physicians last meaning that less providers will choose to see patients on Medicaid and that is unacceptable for working families and for the millions that have had the Medicaid expansion there's millions of people who now benefit with the Medicaid expansions that they will repeal and halt after the year 2020 according to this bill all right well you've got over a hundred amendments proposed doesn't seem like anything has gone through yet is there any hope is there any middle ground here yes you know it so far all the amendments have been voted by party lines but let me give you a couple of behind-the-scenes agreement that i have found with the Republican colleagues the first is the fact that at least at the very least disaster care should not be put into a per capita block grant that we should be able to fund all of the disaster humanitarian crisis care that we can for the American people there is a Republican who came over after my point and said I never saw it that way thank you for forgiving us your doctor perspective I'm going to go back and think about it a little more the second part was the fact that I agree with my Republican colleague who said that mental health is in a crisis and there are more mental health patients being seen in the emergency department and we need to do something about it now the reason why we have this crisis is because throughout the years we have or the Republicans have cut mental health programs aid they have recently had a bill that didn't fund it to its proper degree mental health services that is there is a physician and mental health specialist shortage crisis in our nation now we have millions more who have the essential benefit of mental health and that essential benefit is going to be cut with this bill and mental health states will not have the option not the guarantee patients will not have the guarantee because case would not have the option of choosing to provide mental health or not and that's not right congressman and thank you so much to help this morning probably one of a cup of coffee before you head back in their lot of work I will

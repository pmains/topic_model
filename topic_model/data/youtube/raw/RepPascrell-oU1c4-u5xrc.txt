this bud budget is fundamentally unserious we've heard this now for four years in a row my friends on the other side of the aisle come down to the floor with their draconian budget claiming they are reluctantly forced to make tough decisions because the specter of a debt crisis is right around the corner this despite the fact that our deficit is falling at the fastest rate this is the end of the Second World War we said this we would do it and we did it this supposedly looming debt crisis going to be so incredibly bad for this country that we need to reluctantly gut programs that help low and moderate is to prevent a and you stand there and stand up there and talk to us about tax and spend Democrats you can't balance your budget without the Affordable Care Act isn't that a honey you've done everything to dismantle it 50 / 50 votes to get rid of it now you're using it in the revenues to balance your budget hole hole hole how very convenient of you they're prescription to prevent this impending disaster is exactly what they're randiyan worldview prescribes in the first place tax cuts for the wealthy paid for on the backs of those not so wealthy unfortunately leads to only one conclusion the Republican Party does not care about our time at time the gentleman has expired gentleman about 15 seconds John was recognized for 15 seconds in the words of Vice President remember him Dick Cheney he proclaimed deficits don't matter so you've had a call to religion you come back your budget the deficit is simply an excuse to gut the social safety net so I say let's vote down this phony budget let's get on with the real things mr. speaker thank you very much for your enough all times

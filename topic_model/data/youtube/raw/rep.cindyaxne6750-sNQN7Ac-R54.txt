in March Wells Fargo announced it would lay off 400 central liable workers the bank blamed declining workloads for the cuts but representative Cindy axe nay says workers who contacted her office told her that those jobs were actually being moved to India as a result accident is introducing a bill that would require publicly traded companies to report where their employees are located and joining us now is representative axon a thanks for being with us today my pleasure let's back up a little bit first of all did we find out whether or not Wells Fargo lied about outsourcing those jobs where does that stand so as you remember during a hearing I questioned former CEO Tim Sloan on the 400 jobs that were people were laid off here in Iowa is that were those jobs outsourced he denied it we have multiple folks who have come to us who have said that's not the case and as a matter of fact they were also having to train other people in India on the jobs that they lost we are in the process of continuing to gather that information from Wells Fargo to find out exactly what the the cliff get the clarity around this entire issue so we have a timetable on that when that might be you think that investigation might be complete weeks months I'd say within the next couple of months okay and then if we find out that yes Wells Fargo did lie are there any repercussions for lying to Congress absolutely there would be repercussions for that in particular with with the people who could have received trade assistance when they were laid off if their job was out sourced and that's first and foremost what we need to get after and make sure that those folks are whole because they lost support as well as retraining for other jobs when they when they were laid off if it was an outsourcing situation they would have received that adjustment and I want to make sure that those folks get get made whole again so that's going to be issue number one secondly will absolutely need to look at the logistics around you know the hearing and the former CEO statements during its addressed to members of Congress so the bill would require publicly held companies to say where their workers are located thus disincentivizing them from having jobs overseas correct that's correct and so how would that all be trapped how would this all how would this all be laid out so right now companies do not have to lay out where they have employees either in the United States or in any other country so we have no idea how many employees for any company are located in any state or our outlying company as well and so this will as you mentioned disincentivize outsourcing folks because they will have to put out an annual report showing where those employees are located and certainly for investors and consumers who want to purchase from those businesses it gives them an opportunity to you know to see if they're really supporting the creation of American jobs and building the American economy so we will be working with those public companies so just so you know it's only public companies who are you know who have to register with SEC that will be a part of this this isn't private companies small businesses that type of thing and it and it isn't all public companies new public companies that are less than five years won't have to register to do it until five years unless they're a multi and unless they make over a billion dollars so for instance a Facebook could have to do that is there support for this on both sides of the aisle are you getting pushed back so there's support absolutely on both sides of the aisle there's always going to be pushback there are some folks that say well this is just extra information that a company doesn't need to deliver I would absolutely disagree with that i can tell you i've worked for fortune 1000 companies i've worked for small businesses and the government every single one of those companies tracked their employees they know exactly where they were you pay them on a regular basis this is not information that's difficult to gather so I think it's very easy to gather so using that as an excuse is is not something that I think will even it doesn't have any merit a full disclosure for investors

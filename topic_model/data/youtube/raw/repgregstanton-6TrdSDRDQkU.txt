the veterans are part of the most important aspects of our country and here they are they're not getting their medications on time the homeless the veterans are are in need of medications their need of their checks their need of their benefits they're in need of conversation with the va so terry would you give an overview of what's going on because and the importance of mail to the veterans and homeless veterans that you work with absolutely uh you know for the last several years the veterans administration has really transitioned most delivery of medications to mail service so as uh congressman sam said something between 80 and 90 of all medications going to veterans and we have a large veteran population in this country go through the mail and i have to tell you i have a lot of ties in the veteran community so i get a lot of emails and i've got a lot of discussion and so forth and this whole issue with underfunding or under utilizing our uh our postal services creating incredible anxiety amongst veterans especially those veterans that live in the rural areas right now i'm living up in the uh in the muggian grim country and there are a lot of veterans up here a lot of retirees they're all dependent on the mail service to get their their medications on time and it's not just medications um notifications for appointments uh the veterans benefits administration sends out uh communications by mail and those are critical to uh to the life and to the to the activities of veterans so uh the other thing that a lot of people sort of overlook is and i know several mail carriers myself and i have great respect for the work work that they do they're very service oriented and something like 18 percent maybe as much as 20 percent of our of our postal workers are veterans so if you're going to cut back on overtime they're going to take out some of the equipment potentially they could even lay off postal workers if they had to you know that's going to have a major effect on veterans so this is not the time during a pandemic and with all the other things going on in this country right now to be attacking our postal service you know this is the time when we should be shoring those people up i consider postal workers to be essential workers just like people working in health care you know their jobs are absolutely critical and to demoralize these people as some in the administration have done by saying hey we're going to take some of these uh benefits away from you or we're going to cut back your hours or maybe we don't think you're doing the job that you should be doing this is a that's that's a horrible thing right now but again i'm living up in a rural area there are a lot of retired uh retired veterans up here and you know republicans and democrats and they're all concerned you know their their their lives depend in many cases on getting those medications and getting them on time so and in terms of veterans who are experiencing homelessness for several years i ran a transitional living center for veterans and i'm telling you the at least 50 percent maybe more of the mail that we received at that shelter was medication so another critical component in helping veterans who have ended up out on the street is making sure that their health journeys are taken care of and we cannot we cannot break our uh our trust with our with our uh postal service and give them any kind of an indication that we don't think their jobs are essential there's just too many people that depend on it you really you this whole thing really makes me kind of angry and i've talked to a lot of other veterans that feel the same way about it you know the the the timing for this is just horrible so uh i'm glad to hear that there's been some change but this issue will come up again even if it's uh if it doesn't happen until some point in the future so we need to provide more resources to our postal service we need to uh allow all of the the equipment and postals you know abilities for people to get to the post office as much as possible and we need to allow people that to feel comfortable that if they're going to send in their vote by mail that it's going to be received on time and it's going to be counted so uh yeah veterans are very much in support of the postal service that's great thank you terry for all you do for our veterans also and it's a great answer too thank you

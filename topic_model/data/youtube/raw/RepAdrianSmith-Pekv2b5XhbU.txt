inquire thank you mr chairman certainly thank you to our witnesses today i may not agree with every point of analysis and policy recommendations from our witnesses but i do hear i do appreciate hearing various perspectives i think if we sat down for a conversation about economic opportunity we would find our goals are actually very similar for every american have a chance at a better life for themselves and their families no matter where they live or what their background might be that is after all i believe what our country is all about for the purposes of today's hearing i would like to focus on two real world issues where i worry democrat proposals should be particularly troubling to working families and where republicans have solutions to meet their real everyday needs first and foremost we want every american to have access to a good job right now there are more job openings across our economy than job seekers a recipe for rising wages i do fear that some intention some good intentions of trying to be generous to folks are actually creating barriers to getting people back into the workforce i think we should all be very concerned about this when i was chair of the human resources subcommittee we first introduced the jobs for success act back in the 1990s a while ago now welfare reform was effective in getting millions of americans into the workforce and actually reducing child poverty but that was more than two decades ago our country does not look or work the same and we must take steps to connect americans from all walks of life with adequate opportunity states passively telling people to work it's not enough the jobs for success act would require states to work one-on-one with tanf tanf beneficiaries to actively connect them with employers get them started in a good job and provide them greater support to address challenges like child care and transportation this will help keep employees working ensuring they can access opportunities to earn raises and promotions and once you are working the child tax credit that republicans doubled in tax reform provides more economic help for families we all want every parent to have access to high quality affordable child care that meets their diverse needs unfortunately the democrats child care proposal limits options for families around the country by only providing assistance to families using government government-approved facility-based care not located at a religious institution seventy percent of child care is currently provided by a relative in-home based care or through a religious based child care provider that means 70 percent of families utilizing care right now would be unable to use assistance at their current provider simply put the structure of the democrats program would only worsen some of the disparities that they i think are trying to address center-based care may be a great option for nine to five office workers but it's generally unavailable for parents working second or third shift further data shows that whites with graduate or professional degrees are the predominant users of center-based care while racial minorities are likelier to use expressly ex the facilities that racial minorities tend to use are expressly excluded from the democrats program instead of mandates we should focus on ways to truly improve access to care to work together on bipartisan solutions to expand access in places with the greatest need provide technical assistance to new providers of all types and ensure states can use existing dollars to help parents stay in the workforce mr ortiz thank you for being here today i appreciate all of our witnesses one of the most frequent concerns i hear from businesses in my district is the lack of workers and about government programs like expanded unemployment and child tax credit payments keeping people from going back to work is that something that your members are encountering yes congressman thank you so much uh it absolutely is i mean uh you know we have a couple of buses that we go across country with uh we have a recent campaign called bring small businesses back because obviously they've been under attack and having a difficult time and every single time we pull up somewhere they're like we hope you have workers in there you can bring to us because we can't find any and this isn't because they're not paying them enough in many cases it's it's you know you know twice what the minimum wage is and or even more so just that in many cases they're also competing against the federal government effectively because some of the overly generous programs really made it more lucrative for workers to stay at home than to actually go back to their work what i've heard things for example is sure i'll come back and work for you but i want it under the table so that i can keep getting the benefits and the cash from you and this was a very consistent story that we were hearing especially amongst you know all these small businesses especially in certain industries for example in the hospitality and restaurant industries which are extremely challenged right now but yes this is a very consistent uh to what i'm hearing thank you mr archies i yield back the balance thank the gentleman

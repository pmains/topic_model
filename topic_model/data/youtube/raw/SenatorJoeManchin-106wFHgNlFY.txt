secretary secretary thank you for being here appreciate it thank you for your service uh on supply chains we've spoken quite a bit about supply chains and uh we learned that uh during kova 19 pandemic uh how fragile it is and and trying to make sure that we're able to meet the needs of the people this administration by administration they instituted a whole of government effort to assess what can be done to strengthen competitiveness and supply chain resilience including that hundred day reviews and later this year i think you all will issue it's your first annual report uh to provide an update to the challenges developments and opportunities so anything i know that we're running into uh these time time frames and everything so i guess what progress has the department made in confronting the supply chain crisis uh that jeopardize the supply of medications that patients are going to rely on in need senator i look forward to working with you on that as you know the this administration has used the defense production act on several occasions to try to increase and expand our supply chain a quick example last year all the manufacturers of cova test kits were not domestic and we worked really hard not only to expand the number of test testing kits that would be available for americans to test themselves against covet but we worked really hard to make sure those were domestically manufactured and today we have several in america that are domestically manufactured which by the way they will begin to shut down those lines of production if we don't have the monies to guarantee that we will be able to fund test kits moving into the future you've been able to track manufacturing back people are willing to come back into the to our manufacturing base absolutely you show them the support they'll be there okay the other thing is on life the light and energy assistance program we're having a hard time uh and advocates both from back home west virginia and nationally uh challenging the states facing administering this program they're having trouble getting the people to administer the program and getting the money to be administered so i guess quickly have you all looked into this and can you look into it on liheap how you can maybe help or make sure that money is getting there or they have the administration that they're going to need the support that they're going to need to get this money out because it's just it's just been very very uh very difficult for a lot of poor people americans need heat in the winter and they need to be cool in the summer and we will do everything we've expanded light we will do everything we can senator working with you and others to make sure that the resources that you all provided get to people who need it i think basically just accept helping them with their application approval process that will help tremendously if you can look into that the other thing is is that that i had one thing that i wanted to mention to you i think we've talked about before i've been trying to support trying to pass the lifeboat act and the only thing it does lifeboat truly is saying that we're going to charge manufacturing of opiates one penny per milligram that one penny per milligram goes to treatment centers all over america every one of us and every other states have an addiction problem but we have so few facilities and the government can only do so much but i think that the manufacturing that's a manufacturing fee it won't be passed on as far as cost to the consumer but for if you're going to put this product on the market you ought to know the damage it does and right now we see lawsuits all over the country i would hope you all would look in that and see if if it's something you all could support it's not onerous at all it basically directs every penny to to treatment centers and the final thing i wanted to ask you about the 10 billion dollars that were that we're stuck on i cannot believe it what's it going to do what what's what risk are we are we really uh going to be faced if we don't get this funding well the 10 billion is certainly not enough to carry us through the end of the fiscal year but what it does do it lets us stay at the front of the line to make sure we're purchasing the medicines the treatments and the vaccines that we need moving forward without that again we could lose our place in life this is like the different different variants that first of all we thought the cover 19 was over then we've been told dr fauci told us that there are going to be different variations and it's exactly true what he said yeah and now we even have more but what's the time element where are you going to be crunch time if politics is being played democrats republicans got to come together for the health of all americans our scientists are telling us that in the fall winter we probably will see another surge how big who knows but in order to be ready for that fall winter we gotta start purchasing today not in the fall or winter i i just i know you all have a yeoman's task in front of you and i appreciate the job you're doing and i just want to make sure that we can help you and assist any way possible so communications between the offices have been great and i appreciate that we need a lot more and we're going to try to do all we can to make sure we can protect america thanks senator thank you thank you

any moment now President Trump will be meeting with his cabinet at the White House reporters are gonna be heading in and we will bring in the headlines as they come out but it is the first cabinet meeting of course since House Democrats launched the impeachment inquiry into the president and this week is another very busy week of testimony on Capitol Hill appearing tomorrow is the top US diplomat in Ukraine bill Taylor he's really found himself at the center of the investigation as he's the man on the text messages questioning whether a quick woh was happening in one message writing quote I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign the other ambassador I'm replying hours later and in another asking are we now saying that security assistance and White House meeting are conditioned on investigations so what are the questions that bill Taylor is now going to face joining me right now is democratic congressman brad sherman california sits on the House Foreign Affairs Foreign Affairs Committee congressman thanks for being here what do you want to ask Bill Taylor well frankly I won't be asking bill to lure anything we leave it to the the attorneys the investigatory attorneys to ask the question I think it's also important for your viewers not to think that all we're doing is focusing on impeachment our committee is having important hearings on Kashmir tomorrow and then the next day we've got Mark Zuckerberg before the Financial Services Committee to discuss Zuckerberg efforts to create a new currency and thus meet the needs of tax evaders sanctions evaders and drug dealers so congressman I don't think you want to do you want to leave the impression though that you're not involved at all or you don't have any questions that you want answered from Bill Taylor I mean other members of Congress have sat in on these meetings I have talked about they have asked questions but what do you want to know from him let me phrase it that way I let's put like this I have enough information I will sit in on the meetings because it's historic but the public testimony is everything you need you have the transcript you have the chief of staff statements it's obvious that the President of the United States was trying to force the Ukraine to help his political campaign that's a request for an illegal multi-million dollar worth contribution from a foreign power a clear violation of our law just another one of trumps many high crimes and misdemeanors I filed articles of impeachment in June of 2017 over obstruction of justice and the felonies committed there so I've got enough information on this this just adds more and more but your viewers should not think that all we're doing is focusing on impeachment we had 435 members of Congress and we're all doing a variety of things after the acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney acknowledged a quid pro quo on Thursday during a press conference he defended himself in a statement afterward but also in the wall he defended himself this way yesterday listen to this things you've again said just a few seconds ago that I said there was a quid pro quo never use that language because there there is not a quid pro quo Jonathan Karl is that you've described a quid pro quo and you said that happens all the time again reporters will use their language all the time so my language never said quid pro quo but let's get to the heart of the matter go back and look at that list of three things what was I talking about things that it was legitimate for the president to do did mix Mulvaney clear things up at all for you do you understand his positioning I know your position on impeachment already do you understand his position he said that he admitted that the president committed a crime in English and didn't use Latin and quid pro quo is Latin he made it easier he said it in English he said that we were holding back the money and one of the things we were demanding is that the administration of the Ukraine investigate Joe Biden and his son he it's even more clear when you say it in English than when you say it in Latin you as you've mentioned you've been calling for the president's impeachment for two years since 2017 I do wonder then what is your pitch then to Republicans that now is when you really mean it and now is when they should really join you well I think they're particularly concerned about our foreign policy toward the Ukraine and standing up to Russia that being said I think it's just a one handful of Republicans who are seriously considering voting for impeachment I think what will matter more than this or that testimony because my god we've got mountains and mountains of testimony is what the reaction when you see a Republican like Francis Rooney come out and he's voicing real concern about what he's seeing he calls it very troubling what's come out so far saying he's looking forward to among others bill Taylor's testimony tomorrow does that give you I don't know hope very little mr. Rooney's not running for re-election he was part of my handful as is Senator Romney and that still leaves two or three others to be named Nate later just to be a handful at this stage unless there's a shift in Republican opinion and there may be so I would say that if you want to predict what my Republican colleagues are going to do continue your efforts at polling particularly Republicans and you'll get the answer more quickly than I will talking to them on the floor congressman thanks for coming in thank you still ahead for us Elizabeth Warren

thank you mr chairman thank you thank you sir for your for your service and thank you for being here um general aqualino recently this committee had a very sobering briefing from the department in this briefing it was mentioned that the marine corps made the very hard decision to procure the nemesis anti-ship missile instead of the more traditional equipment but congress made the decision to zero uh that request out in exchange for two ch five k helicopters and part of that's built in my state so i mentioned this example because it's one of many i believe the majority of my colleagues agree with me in order to compete against china we've got to do the best thing we can do not was politically popular let's put it that way um what with that in mind what domains of warfare do you believe the u.s still maintains an asymmetrical advantage and against china and what weapon systems or equipment do you believe we should procure to widen that to widen that advantage uh thanks senator so i'll start by saying that we do have the world's greatest military in all domains foundational there are certainly capabilities that we want to go ahead and pursue and i commend the commandant on making some of those tough choices right so land-based anti-ship fires is a critical component uh of the strategy and the approach but it will take the entire joint force so that's one example there's some hypersonic capabilities that we certainly want to continue to pursue and then deliver we want to be able to continue to work unmanned capabilities to provide different alternatives as a part of the contribution so there's a number of those those are just three examples general uh like america you mentioned in your opening statement your work towards achieving the bilateral conditions based operational control transition plan between the united states and the republic of korea when fully implemented the republic of korea will assume direct operational control over their military in the event of war with north korea so my question would be can you explain to the committee if this transition plan is successfully executed how will the immediate nature of our presence on the korean peninsula change uh thank you senator uh as we go through this conditions based bilaterally agreed upon conditions-based upcom transition they'll be we're we're in the process of working through what are the bridging capabilities and what are the enduring capabilities so when the chalk line is finally snapped um it's hard for me to predict right now based on the capabilities that the korean military has and what the requirements are we're also in the process of rewriting our operational plan what would you consider how being the u.s forces korea commander how would you lead your force in the event of a war on the korean peninsula following the plan's execution how would i lead the forces it would be part of the combined forces commander so i would become the deputy commander of combined forces command and my deputy would become the combined forces commander i would work underneath him i'd still retain the title of u.s forces korea and unc commander and then it's still a bi-national decision-making process between both national command authorities admiral the marine corps has taken significant risk in recent years to reorient the service towards our pacing threat china among the many initiatives the marine corps is pursuing is orienting the marine corps towards the developing the doctrine for expeditionary advanced base operations what are you doing at the endo paycom commander to support the navy and marine corps is refined and further operational to this concept i i think the way i would say senator is i'm making them prove it to me right so it's a concept for a number of years now and we're working to rehearse it and practice it what challenges do you see with that we see certain challenges and capability delivery transportation placement and uh and posture in some cases and i ask you both one final question knowing what you know and and then the insight that you have on where we are in the ukrainian russian war the putin war that's not i'm not going to graciate that by calling it a russian war it's a putin war uh the escalation uh your concerns about escalating this war escalating into bringing us into conflict uh chances of them uh breaching over into the uh nato allies maybe general camaro the marines are first to go so tell me about if you're ready or not thank you for the compliment i'm sure the comment i would appreciate um when the marine corps now sir um i'm watching the impact uh that it will have on the korean peninsula and the regional regional stability um is my main concern um i don't have the insights of what's really going on and your thoughts uh senator you know it's part of commander's business to assess three things in everything we do no matter what theater or where we are uh number one is risk to force are we putting u.s service members families or or supporting people in harm's way so risk to force to make sure i can send everybody back with mom dad and the kids after the mission they're complete number two the risk to the mission itself am i going to achieve what i'm trying to do and generate the effect that i'm trying to generate and then number three risk to escalation we assess it in every single event every single operation and i know my counterparts in eucom are doing the same thing thank you sir thank you

five million Texans rely on small businesses for a paycheck Congress just poured more money back into federal programs to help those businesses stay afloat right now for things like the Paycheck protection program and forgivable SBA loans congresswoman kay Granger is the most senior Republican woman in the US House she represents Fort Worth and Weatherford and joins us from DC congresswoman thank you for the time we appreciate it let's get right to this bill will this be enough money in your opinion for all the small businesses that have applications pending no I don't think so and and that's unfortunate the good part is that's so popular the first round was so popular that a lot of people now understand how good it can be we put in more money for more people but we reached 1.6 million small business owners before so there's going to be a lot of help I'm hoping that we can keep going on this because small business is so very important and it's so important that they keep their employees so we're going to do this we've been a big outreach so people will really understand that they can keep their employees that they keep their employees that loan they got will be forgiven which is pretty amazing yeah you said keep going on this does that mean a third round potentially coming for of aid for small businesses you know this this situations a crisis and you know of course it is it's an economic crisis that's also a health public health crisis and and we'll have to see is the public health works its way through but the small businesses which is really where what we're aiming at to keep them going that's also a crisis I think that based on the popularity it was in the last round which is 340 billion this is 310 billion will still have small businesses that will need help congresswoman how likely might all this new money go how likely will it be this is spent within a few weeks I think it will go a long way in that and I check this before came and to look at this because we have people that applied the last time didn't got chosen because the money ran out so they're in line and should be taken first really and if we if we aim it at small business that have to have this loan to stay open and keep their employees and I owned a small business myself for 20 years and and I spent a lot of time on this bill explaining that it's not you want just any employees you want the employees that know your customers and so that's very important you know I know it'll go a long way 310 billion but we'll let's see because we have so many small businesses that need to help well the fine print in the first care Zach got a lot of small businesses upset because big businesses like Ruth's Chris Steakhouse and potbelly sandwiches these chains with access to the to the capital markets they got a cut of that paycheck protection program is that fair it was not intended that way now remember we were making decisions very fast the Congress making decisions very fast of how can we bring the help and we warned it small mom-and-pop businesses I work with one business and in Dallas Texas that that a man and a woman who owned their business for nearly 50 years and got hit by that terrible storm in Dallas and then this and it was meant for the people like that the money ran out before they got even though that they went through the process so they'll be in line to be helped but it was not intended for big companies some of those situations exist because it's a large overall company but they have different small businesses within it and it's alright for that but we should be very very careful the bank should be held accountable for using this money as the Congress intended and that's truly small businesses all right congressman kay Granger we appreciate your time thank you

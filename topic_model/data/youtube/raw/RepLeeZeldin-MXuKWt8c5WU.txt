Zeldin how are you I'm doing very well thanks for participating tonight not a problem I'm a proud fan of the work you do but what I was curious about was the $24,000 deduction that I would get from the IRS versus deducting my property taxes how badly will that affect Long Island well there there we go we're going right into a the tax conversation so we have just about half of our districts itemizing the the large itemized deduction for our areas of state local tax deduction the way the state local tax deduction works for those who itemize it would be income taxes plus property taxes the original proposal in the house was to fully eliminate the state and local tax deduction there there was a compromise worked out which certainly was progress but not enough progress where people would be allowed to deduct up to ten thousand of their property taxes only but if you're itemizing it's not just your property taxes it's that plus income tax the Senate bill as it currently exists is a full elimination of this state and local tax deduction so we've run all of the numbers for all the different tax brackets and we find that there are some people who would be paying less in taxes we find others who would be paying more in taxes and quite frankly there's too many people who would be paying more in taxes I'm a no to the bill in its current form I've been involved in countless meetings texts emails phone conversations there's the all day really all day every day conversations with colleagues in the House members of the administration on the house side it's literally just before I came here had a long conversation with the speaker on the House floor during the last vote series but chairman Kevin Brady used a chair of the House Ways and Means Committee Majority Leader's kevin mccarthy the Majority Whip is Steve Scalise a lot of meetings with my New York colleagues and then sometimes it's one-on-one sometimes there may be many of us from different states with the administration of with the vice-president one-on-one on this issue with Gary Cohen as well as a conference call that I set up with Gary Cohn secretary minutiae and all nine New York Republicans so a lot I mean I'll just the edges a sampling of many of the conversations that are going on I what I would love to be able to vote YES on a bill that gets as close to perfect as possible this bill is not there yet so I'm going to keep advocating strongly I understand that if I'm not fighting from my home district in my home state but I can expect these colleagues from other states to to do that for me fortunately there are other members who are in similar situations in places like New York New Jersey California what I would say is and we'll see tomorrow where the vote is it seems from leadership they are increasingly confident to have enough votes to pass this bill however the Senate is Senate has a different bill which means that if the Senate passes their bill there still needs to be a conference set up and the bill would have to come back to the house for another vote so this is a progress a process tomorrow is just one step of that process and I'm going to continue to work for additional improvements to the bill because I don't want to see so many people actually having to pay more there are good things in this bill but unfortunately too many constituents would be paying more in taxes than before so a Thank You Leslie for your for your question and we're bringing the next caller John on the line remember if anyone has any calls any question feel free to press star 3 or any insight John page Oh miss Sheldon as what if you could on give a little information about the bill that you had um coke I guess co-sponsored on to the severely disabled veterans oh yeah thank you for asking about that so the adult day health care bill passed the Senate last week and it passed the House this past May there are only three locations in the entire country that provide adult day health care one of those locations is that the State Veterans Home Valon State Veterans Home in Stony Brook and the there are well over 100 state veterans homes all across the country this legislation would provide at no cost to the veteran for severely disabled veterans 70% or more service-connected disabled they would be able to obtain a Delta health care at no cost this would also help veterans on long island even though this is a service that's currently being provided at Stony Brook there are veterans who can't afford the daily cost so I'm really excited about getting this bill passed the Senate last week working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle strong bipartisan support for this bill and looking forward to getting it to the to the President's desk so yeah thank you for asking about the adult day health care bill John and the next caller is Mary Ann good evening hello hi Mary Ann how are you doing well how are you good I have two questions one I listened that you are presently in no vote but I have serious concerns about any tax relief bill that primarily transfers wealth from the middle class eliminating deductions especially deductions that folks in high tax areas rely on to the wealthy and the elimination of the estate tax which really only affects approximately at this point four hundred and fifty families in in the whole country you have to have 11 million dollars or more to even be subject to it so realistically I think that if choice is to eliminate medical deductions and state and local taxes I'd rather see the estate tax stay in place and the revenue come from that exact you good and secondly I would very much like to urge you to do what you can with the House Judiciary Committee to see to it that the nominees for the federal bench are rated as qualified it is appalling that of the eight nominees that have been nominated by the president for have been rated as unqualified this is a simply an appalling situation these are lifetime appointments and they need to be qualified and I'd like to have your comments on both so uh on the first point the on the estate tax I've raised this in my conversations with colleagues I view I don't personally I don't believe that we should be taxing death you know however this proposal that completely eliminates the estate tax my my one of my big issues with that is for any middle-income person to have to pay more in taxes while at the same time you're fully eliminating the estate tax for a middle-income person who might live in a zip code having to pay a little bit more in taxes while at the same time someone who is a heck of a lot more wealthy nearby getting a full repeal that's something that I have an issue with I want to be able to ensure that those middle-income taxpayers are going to be seeing tax relief we have there's there is a situation that I'm very well aware of and highly sympathetic do with our farms where you have multi-generational the land rich cash poor families hi grant you need to expand the 20:32 a requirement so that people in New York and Connecticut New Jersey where the land use worked so much they're forced to sell the farm to pay the estate tax oh yeah we're on we're certainly on the same page as that so I have a huge sympathy on that one it's a big deal all across our country and even there are a lot of people who you know live in places like I'm I grew up in Brookhaven never realized to the extent of just how many farms that were right here in our own County and when I was a little late and with regard I so the Senate version has the medical expense deduction added back in I agree with that I'm going to strongly support I strongly support the bill coming out of conference to add back in the medical expense deduction I think that would be a good thing and I also believe that anyone who has a responsibility and I dealt with this when I was in the New York State Senate serving on the Judiciary Committee approving judges in New York we all get an opportunity to weigh in when we get to vote for judges in these elections that we just had a local election voting for judges I would say that whether it is 2017 its 2020 25 whatever year it is whoever's in charge whoever is nominating we should always be working hard to get the best qualified people on the bench so I absolutely agree with you Mary Ann and thank you for your questions and reminder anyone has any questions at all just dial star three and we'll be able to bring you on next caller is Anton aye mr. Zeldin how are you today I'm doing well how are you okay well I'm a little shook up I live in Smithtown nice sound what has happened in Smithtown is I thought our property taxes are extremely high I say extremely high I think you know you've been around spit sound I know I passed you one day going down and ha go we've got people paying here the average of 10 thousand dollars a year taxes our children in most cases are paying 18 to 20 thousand dollars in real estate taxes and what happens is they just cannot maintain that I built the house my own self my handwork I built it 50 years ago my house is an average house in Smithtown 50 year old house it's 57 years old my wife corrects me ok but what has happened is you just I can go to North Carolina I can go to Tennessee I can go to Kentucky and pay two and three thousand a year in taxes on a house I would be much better off to get out of New York I love Smithtown I have worked and Smith down all my life I want to die in Smithtown okay now that's not far away by the way I and I would have to leave here I really would I couldn't afford to continue paying that kind of a tax and paying a large income tax so it's something now to support the other states I can't afford it I can't afford to support my own state much less all the other states so I wish you would take a look at that and I know you're saying you're going to vote against it and I appreciate that very much the other thing I wanted you to do and I think you're thinking about it also is you know medical care for everyone in America is kind of a needed thing and we all agree to that almost all of us yet we never really sit down it may take five years it may take two years but we should both all sit down in Congress and the Senate and come up with a plan that we can afford that won't kill us as other countries have done and yet each of their citizens have health insurance and are covered can live and not be totally wiped out if they get sick one day and I'd appreciate that I think everybody would appreciate you're working on that so yeah I encourage you to work on both of those things so that we can all stay and live in America or rather than go somewheres else that's a so those are both really important points first off one of the things earlier we were talking about the state and local tax deduction one of the reasons why or the main reason why our same local tax deduction is as high as it is is because our state local taxes are as high as they are and that is why I've been saying that all levels of government need to be working on tax relief when it comes to property taxes that's not Congress it's not even as much Albany you know it's our tax bills when we look at them we see that there are multiple taxing jurisdictions somewhere around seventy percent of it our school taxes we vote on those budgets our property taxes so we back in 2011 there was a property tax cap that was enacted which slowed down the rate of growth of property taxes it didn't reduce property taxes and we've gotten to the point where we have some of the highest property taxes in the entire country we have we rank somewhere around the seventh highest as relates to income tax rates I believe its eighth highest in the country as it relates to sales tax rates so we're being taxed in many different ways and when it all adds up people reach their breaking points it doesn't include so many other aspects of a high cost of living and you know people need tax relief and that is why I would absolutely love to be able to vote for a great tax bill this bill is is just not there yet and it actually for too many constituents will result in them having to pay more than if the bill didn't pass and when you know when I went through the years when I've been saying that I want to fight for tax relief this just isn't what I had in mind this isn't what I said that you know that this isn't the proposal that that I would draft up I want to see people's taxes go down not up but it really does require all levels of government to be working on tax relief in order to what to get there as far as health care goes everyone needs to have I mean it's just one of the basic essentials in life when you get sick to have the ability to take care of yourself your families your family members and we need to not just improve coverage but we also have to reduce costs of health care as well and there are many contributing factors there we've had quite a robust debate this year on insurance coverage and that should continue and that should continue 5 years from now 10 years from now 20 years from now we'll see where where it goes I just don't know what the Senate has 51 votes to pass at all on health care in any directions that's that's pretty important and at the same exact time whether it's tort reform to reduce the cost of medical malpractice rates making it easier for employers to pool their their policies to have additional flexibility of state governors for Medicaid coverage there's many other other examples too beyond what's been debated over the course of this year know the one bill that that they were trying to pass through the Senate but I appreciate you for bringing up both points and to get to our first poll question of the night so over the course of tonight so this calls an hour long by the way just to give you a heads up but during the call we're asking if you survey questions so here's the first one which issue issues are most important to you so you have ten options which issues are most important to you press one for economy or jobs press two for Foreign Affairs or terrorism press three for taxes for for infrastructure five for immigration or border security six for healthcare seven for veterans eight for environment nine for spending or debt or zero for education if our phones had 30 options I could I know there's a lot of priorities out there but these are 10 of them and if you could pick one the question is which issues are most important to you press 1 for economy or jobs - for Foreign Affairs or terrorism 3 for taxes for for infrastructure 5 for immigration or border security 6 for healthcare 7 for veterans 8 for environment 9 for spending or debt zero for education and while you're doing it we'll bring on the next caller and it's Anna Maria well good evening good evening hi um I had written to you and couldn't you know conferred with your office concerning the Army Corps of Engineers that lady in Massachusetts who wants to jump tons and tons of mercury dioxin pesticides you name it a lot of people and we've been eating fish from this Long Island challenge since we were kids and I know that Governor Cuomo wrote to her and and mr. Englebright and ken the violin we're just concerned and I when I wrote I gave some suggestions I mean there's so many bad lines out west we could bury a deep deep or send it outer space or do something but not you know at the edge of our plates so I wanted to know what the status of that is and also if you have an opportunity I want to know what's going on with Social Security is our funds being taken from that coffer coffer and will there be a rage and will there be any left and whatever you have to say about to the status of old people in Social Security but we want to leave the environment clean for the future well thank you Anna Maria and with regards to the first part of that as a relates to the dredge spoils that are dumped into the Long Island Sound I support a phase-out of that that right now there's a 30-year phase-out process I believe that that should be sped up to more like a five to ten year phase out of the open water dumping of Connecticut's dredge spoils a lot of these spoils can be recycled reused when you're building up a sand dune Oh many different other projects the Army Corps is working on this these dredge spoils can be recycled and reused puts a better pair than just open water dumping they can be tested beforehand to make sure that that they're safe there was a modification that was done that was good on the eastern Long Island Sound where the sites were changed there's one site that's now closer to Connecticut it's all you know we look at the Long Island Sound whether it's right next to Connecticut or right next to Long Island it's you know we value the water just as important regardless of where it is but there is that one site that exists but you have primarily these two sites and Western Long Island Sound but I would support a a quicker change to the plan where instead of phasing it out over 30 years you're phasing out a 5 to 10 as far as social security goes we I believe very strongly that we absolutely must honor the promise the commitment to ensure that the social security that our seniors rely upon is there for them they paid into it you paid into it we need to be able to continue the program and sustain it not just for those who are currently seniors but those who are closer to retirement I wish I could tell you that there's all sorts of extra money laying around where you know next year you could be surprised by a you know a big raise it's been too long since the you know the last time you've really seen I mean should be annually that there's increases to Social Security but over the course of decades and really the way the whole system was set up originally created this issue where people are paying into it and there's not enough money now to you know pay everyone who is seniors and and have enough for everyone who's not yet seniors you're you're desperately relying on as the baby boomers are going to go through their retirement years it's going to be a real challenge funding it so we have to make sure that it's sustained that funds aren't rated that the money is there I would support I would support a raise we just have to make sure that long term that we're not you know raiding the fund for you know someone who's 50 today to give an extra raise unless you have a plan to make sure that the money is there for people who are 50 so at the very least we have to honor the promise and make sure everyone gets their social security payments I support finding a ways to be able to have cost-of-living increases along the way and that's you know and I'm I'm 37 years old if we were going to make changes that would impact you know people who are my daughter's age at 11 or my age at 37 we're you know let's say we have to wait a couple more years until we collect or some other modifications made to the way that we're paying in or taking money out we would have decades to prepare so I would I'm certainly very willing to have that conversation and make some tough decisions that would result in additional sacrifice by the younger generation to help take care of our seniors so we're going to get to the to the next survey question next caller but thanks again annamaria for for your call tonight and yet anyone has any questions dial star 3 we'll be able to bring you on but just to give you a heads up I see that there are a lot of people and queue with questions to ask and just know at the end of this call you'll have an opportunity to leave a message with your question will be able to get back to you the next question is on the next question is going to be on taxes don't press any buttons yet we load up the the question here the question is do you support the Republican tax reform plan as is do you support the Republican tax reform plan as is press one for yes press 2 for no press 3 if you're undecided you support the tech Republican tax reform plan as is press 1 for yes press 2 for no press 3 if you are undecided all right well we'll bring on our next caller here William Oh William congressman better than Brookhaven for 46 years I'm rich I'm retired and I'm 78 years of age like a 2 full question I resent being called a high earner which I never earned a lot of money but I also resent the government not honoring our state tax deduction and our real estate tax deduction double years ago with Obamacare is course be additional several thousand dollars extra each year and now you might as well say my retirement and loving and caring a poor for Long Island is being depleted very quickly your comments please vote against unless they include the taxes and our real estate tax deductions as well as the merkel deductions because the insurances don't pay enough anymore with the high deductibles alright anyone wants to participate in our last and our prior question do you support the Republican tax reform plan which is what we're talking about here do you report to support the Republican tax reform plan as is press one for yes press two for now and press three if you're undecided I so uh I mean this is scheduled for a vote tomorrow I'm a no to this bill I'm not aware of there being any changes coming between now and tomorrow that would change my vote so I'm planning on voting no tomorrow this is a process where the Senate is going to be passing a bill then after the House and the Senate pass a bill when is it different and then goes to conference that's the legislative process working it's will at conference they you come out of it with one bill that then gets voted on in the house and the Senate and then if passed by both chambers it'll go to the president for signature the Senate version has the medical expense deduction in it the House version doesn't I support in coming out of conference adopting the the Senate version as it relates to the medical expense deduction now there are some pieces in the Senate version the Senate bill that I don't like there's some there's some components of the House bill I don't like and components of both that I do but on the medical expense deduction I really do believe that that it should be adopted coming out of conference committee if the bill gets that far as relates to state local tax deduction this is something I don't like in the Senate version they propose to fully eliminate the state and local tax deduction something that is better in the House version is that the House version allows which originally the proposal was to fully eliminate salt there was a compromise worked out it was enough to get some members to vote YES I'm still a note it's not enough progress and that's to allow you to deduct up to ten thousand for property taxes only and it would be eliminating your ability to deduct income taxes I personally I support keeping the state local tax deduction it's in its entirety and I've let leadership and others know I'm more than willing to hear them out if they have any creative idea of something else to do but they know we're on that and I'm a no vote tomorrow and I'm going to fight for an improvement along the way knowing that this is a this is a process and maybe I'll vote YES for the final for the final bill if we can get this get this right if we get this bill fixed and we can have it better take care of district like ours Long Island our state so I appreciate you calling in with your question William and we're going to get to our third poll question of the night which is with regards to the state and local tax deduction which of the following options do you prefer with regards to the state and local tax deduction which of the following options do you prefer okay so you have four options press one to preserve the state and local tax deduction entirely press to to eliminate the state and local tax deduction entirely press 3 for the current proposal to eliminate the state and local tax deduction for income taxes which caps the property tax deduction at ten thousand so press 3 if you support the current proposal in the house press 4 if you would prefer a different option that's not mentioned so we're asking about the state local tax deduction and which options you prefer you can press one if you want to preserve the state local tax deduction entirely press 2 if you want to eliminate the state and local tax deduction entirely press 3 if you support the current proposal which is to eliminate salt for income taxes and cap at ten thousand for property taxes and press four if you would prefer a different option that wasn't mentioned and meanwhile will I'll be able to keep moving along through our callers here and uh Phil that's it that's me and oh I ate tonight mrs. Elvan very well all right you're gonna have to forgive me because I'm a little annoyed with the tax structure that we had here I've been annoyed for the past few years it seems like New York or Long Island basically seems to be supporting the rest of the state and a while back I wanted to have a movement for Long Island to secede from the state if that was possible but that fell through but it seems like we're being penalized right now by eliminating our state tax deduction our property tax deduction may mean while the rest of the country they're reaping the same benefit with that twenty four thousand dollar tax deductions they're getting basically the same thing and they don't have the property tax deduction the property taxes that we have most of the other states they have anywhere from $1,000 to $3,000 maximum we're in this area here in Long Island we have anywhere from 7,500 to maybe $30,000 that we have to pay in-state and I'm sorry in property taxes and that doesn't seem fair because the rest of the country is basically reaping on our blood where they're going to gain the same thing that we're gaining and yet we have to suffer to it so a couple of things are going to happen I know we can't secede from the state but maybe the state should try and secede from the union and if that doesn't happen which I know it isn't going to happen the mayor going to have what we're going to what you want to see is we're going to have a mass exodus from Long Island that means the people here especially people in my category that are retired of some are retired you take that away from them they're not going to be able to afford to stay over here on the island so they're going to go to places like Florida South Carolina Tennessee Kentucky and places like that and eventually you're going to find that by that happening people leaving Long Island it's going to drop the value of the property by dropping the value of the property that's going to stop the war that's going to lower the tax structure for the people that for the government to absorb taxes so they're only out there are there only facet is raise the taxes to make up the difference so it's going to wind up being a catch-22 so by that happening more people are going to be leaving Long Island and eventually Long Island is going to be a ghost town and you might be out of a job because you know I'll tell you that so this is a very issue not just for my little face oh I know yeah well I don't believe me I lived upstate so people up upstate New York up in the Adirondacks or in Plattsburgh they don't pay the taxes we do Westchester County and Rockland County maybe yes Connecticut maybe yes New Jersey maybe yes but not the rest of the state I mean I've had property upstate in Indi Adirondacks they pay they pay about 1/10 of what we pay down here on Long Island so that doesn't that you know that not true but like I said I think Long Island if things keep going the way they're going and it looks like it's a Xuan with this the passing of this this tax I think it's a Xuan I think you've got to find out that it eventually it's going to be a mass exodus you're going to find people leaving Long Island because they can't afford to live here I'm one of them and even though I voted for you well you're going to lose my vote on the next election because I probably won't be here and it's not only me it's feeling this way it's a lot of people are might you know I'm I mean what they call the lower middle class alright and those are the people that are going to get hurt the most might be upper middle class on the lower middle class I'm not below poverty that level so I don't have the government paying for my paying for this and paying for that I got to pay my own stuff alright so I'm wondering let me let me jump in if you don't mind um so you know my point when I said that our state is going to be impacted is that when you have when you have people leaving our state it's wherever you're leaving from that you're leaving from allowing you're leaving from Manhattan you're leaving from Westchester partly is an impact on your local community part of it is the money that you pay to Albany so if someone leaves from Westchester or Manhattan because they're mobile they go to Florida they go elsewhere that impacts the rest of the state because that's just less money that that Albany has in its coffers and it's another reason why I'm saying all levels of government need to be working on tax relief it's not just the revenue side of the ledger it's also the expensive expense side of the ledger as well and everything from where we have 123 school districts on the line we have over 700 school districts in the state every school district has a director of math science social studies superintendents deputy superintendents you know every school district has its own administration but then you have issues state level with crazy inefficiencies as it relates to Medicaid I won't even get started with with a tangent on on that one but there is literally billions of dollars of money that gets spent every year more on Medicaid more than bit more than necessary when you go after not just not just going after the doctor who charges for 11 cavities instead of one but for the individual who has figured out how to gain the Medicaid system where they can make literally tens of millions of dollars and that's actually happening right now they get away with and we pay for that all of us you know we have just about the same population as Florida in New York yet we spend well over a billion dollars a week on Medicaid so these are examples really every level of government revenue side expense side figuring out how to how to fix things so that you're able to to stay here and cost the living and the way we deliver energy and Lipa bills this there's so much that goes into it I'm working in Congress and improving this tax reform bill I don't like the way it is as of now because I would have to many constituents while I would have some constituents will be paying less I have others who would be paying more and that's not good up for me so it doesn't have my vote the I thank you for for your question and comments so our next poll question is do you approve of the job that I am doing in Congress do you approve of the job I'm doing in Congress press one for yes press two for now press three if you're undecided do you approve of the job I'm doing in Congress press one for yes two for no three if you're undecided and meanwhile we'll bring on our next caller Sean hello congressman my my my czar two questions one is in reference to the opium epidemic description drugs and the heroin epidemic in our schools number two do you prefer or have solutions in reference to or agree to having a universal educational standards the host country instead of statewide and a universal tax where the tax school taxes are based upon our income tax not property taxes okay what was Ramona what's the first part of the question Shawn the first question is in reference to the open epidemic in schools and on the prescription prescription opiates alright so just a general question on that so um you know I mean this is a massive issue we are Ground Zero as you look at New York State on the opioid the heroin and opioid abuse epidemic this is a national issue I'm talking to colleagues from so many other states all across the country where this is issue number one in their district in New York State Suffolk County has been targeted too much there's any crosses age socioeconomic status race religion it's in school districts all over my daughter's are only 11 years old I personally have been to way too many wakes for young men and women who have lost their lives due to heroin opioid abuse being to one wake is too many I have been to a lot of them and it's terribly tragic when I mean no parent should ever have to bury a son or daughter what is so inspiring is the amount of inspiration that the amount of motivation the way that a whether it's someone who is recovering someone who's lost a son or daughter or brother or sister the way that they try to turn something that was a negative experience into something very positive and helping others because education prevention is huge our border enforcement when we talk about issues related to our Boehner so often we talk about people a big issue is the illegal narcotics that come across our border I've met with DEA FBI US Attorney DOJ and you know they need some additional tools for the International aspect of the way these illegal narcotics are coming into our country with these other countries when we talk to them we'll say we'll ask them to stop sending their drugs to our country their response will be you need to get your people to stop buying them and we're both right we all need to do more so there's that international aspect more access to narcan but when you save someone we reverse a heroin opioid overdose with narcan if you don't get that person immediate help then they might just return to using immediately there are people who have narcan saves first responders multiple narcan saves on the same person in one day beds treatment insurance coverage so that people can get the help that they need which might require a longer stay sometimes the homes that people are going to are you think you'll be going to a house to get help but inside of that house where you want to be able to focus on recovery you're surrounded by some horrible elements that we lose men and women who really want to improve their situation but unfortunately end up in a home where they go back to using because of their setting is not as positive and productive as it should be so these are all helmets I co-sponsored the I stop legislation well as a state senator that became law to curb doctor shopping so that pharmacies are aware of where else people are getting prescriptions from so the doctors are not I mean I there was one picture I saw someone whose mother had a stroke he cleaned out her medicine cabinet there was so many different types of drugs inside of that medicine cabinet and you know so that that's something important too because sometimes what the medication that one doctor can prescribe you like inflict with another sometimes it's expired I've co-sponsored these shed the meds events in the past where you can get rid of your unwanted expired unused medication so that's important as well because sometimes it's you know a family member getting into a medicine cabinet so there's a lot of issues there as far as the education question I don't believe that there should be one national education system you know I believe that we should have we also need to improve the communication because right now you have standards that are set pretty much nationally tests created by the state curriculum set by local school districts everyone's not really talking to each other that well I have not been a fan at all of the implementation of common core I actually sponsored a bill when I was a state senator to stop the implementation of common core and I just don't believe that a one-size-fits-all federal model for education is is the way to go but I appreciate your appreciate your questions and so the next poll question of the night is do you believe our country is on the right track or wrong track you believe our country is on the right track or wrong track press 1 for right track press 2 for wrong track do you believe our country's on the right track or wrong track press 1 for right track press 2 for wrong track and we will we have one or two more questions after this and we'll let everybody know we'll go through the results of all the different questions but do you believe our country's on the right track or wrong track one for right track two for wrong track right well let's bring out our next caller on clatter hello Clara hello hi hello hi Mike my what it's not really question is more of a statement I live in your district here in mastic and there are numerous houses that are boarded up and we have an epidemic - with homeless veterans why can't there be a program where the veteran participates and refurbishes refurbishes a house and is able to live there I mean and then when I go to north port north port to have all of these buildings three stories high brick buildings that are just deteriorating where a lot of our homeless veterans can end up going there let them participate in doing some kind of some of the work like even if they if they're good at plastering plaster the walls paint the walls something because it's it's a shame we shouldn't have to worry about these people when we have all these facilities and speaking of facilities we got rid of the state got rid of all you know pilgrim stayed and closed up Kings Park now we have no place to put these people that are in drug rehab and the drug rehab is only like a three-week participation that's not enough time to get somebody off drugs there are a lot of issues that could be changed if greed wasn't the big factor well on the the homelessness issue we are in Suffolk County one of I think the numbers I think it's about 50 counties give or take a few I think they're about 50 counties in the country that have an affective homeless veteran rate of zero and the way that that's calculated is that the on a given night I think it was a January that they they do this all around the country I believe was a January night if I'm not mistaken Suffolk County is now one of somewhere around 50 counties in the country with an effective veteran homeless rate of zero that doesn't mean that someone today who's a veteran becomes homeless and they don't know where to go but in Suffolk County we have so many different places available that I mean if you know of any veterans who are homeless I would contact a sub-account II veteran service agency because there really are a lot of available housing options to get veterans into maybe they're not aware of it but there really is a lot that we're doing bright for veterans and Suffolk especially when I see what's going on in other counties other parts of the country someone who believes you veteran if you raise your hand you willing to lay down your life for our freedoms and liberties that you should have a roof over your head there should be shoes on your feet there should be food on your table but there should be a roof over your head there are programs that are refurbishing houses and then donating to veterans I know Habitat for Humanity is actively involved in this right now there have been others who have done it other organizations have done in the past so for but I know that their homes being built right now for for veterans I'm aware of one being built right now for Chris levy from Holbrooke who is a triple amputee I know Chris I'm excited to see that at home is being built for him which is a very great thing but we have other people other people who are veterans who aren't I'm sorry other people who are homeless who aren't veterans and we need to and that's us taking care of our neighbor it's sad whenever you see see people who have to live in the woods live on the ground it's it's terribly sad it's maddening you want people to have all the tools they need to rise up out of poverty some people are they're not even looking for for help you try to help them and it's you know that you give them a dollar and they're not going to put it to a good cause you have others who if you give them a dollar there they want to share it with 50 other homeless people it's there's definitely a lot of different kinds of people out there who are homeless but the ultimate goal of having a zero is certainly the one that we all should be agreeing upon and working towards but I appreciate your question and we get to our next survey question which is do you approve of the job that President Trump is doing do you approve do you approve of the job that President Trump is doing press 1 for yes press 2 for no press 3 for undecided do you approve of the job the president Trump is doing press 1 for yes two for now 3 for undecided after this question will go through all the questions and will let you know what the results are for each of them do you approve of the job the president Trump is doing press 1 for yes two for no three if you are undecided and we'll bring in Peter hello Peter hi congressman Zeldin thank you very much for taking my call first off according to your literature and your ads you're a veteran of 101st airborne division and we'd love to thank you for your service thank you actually 82nd airborne oh my god I do the oil American division I made a big mistake no screaming Eagles it's okay I'll tell you you know the the battles that go on and it's love between people might be Army Navy Marines Air Force Coast Guard different branches the 82nd and the hundred and first which as any second guy we would we would call them the 100 worst we all wanna be though I'll tell you when I was over in Iraq I was in to create a camp Spiker and the 82nd and the 101st were at the same exact place reading at the same tiny facility and even deployed in a combat setting what I always thought was fun love between a second one Oh first I remember a sergeant from the hundred and first checking IDs going the dining facility a private from our battalion did not show his ideas he walked by and the sergeant from the hundred and first pulls hit you know he puts his rifle up to his face yelling after this private and I remember it being this huge incident like what we're going to do is it was obviously one of us but this rivalry between us ended up in this massive altercation over there getting into the dining facility but you know a lot of respect though for for the hundred first band of brothers the net series that was out there Oh in data and I read the book by Stephen E Ambrose yeah great a great book when I read it as well great book and a great series but anyway I digress I'll cover it will slowly god bless the airborne yeah there you go and we might left that it wouldn't left out some of our friends from 173rd but that's okay so Kate will God bless them as well you know what and one of the reasons I wanted to close I appreciate the fact that you're against eliminating the deduction for state and local taxes you did mention the conference process are you member of the conference committee and if you are not what members in New York from the Senate and the house are members of the conference committee that is my first question about conference committee regarding the tax bill my second question and concern is that the unaccompanied minor program seems to be have become a geez I don't want to use the term dumping ground for you know ms-13 in in Suffolk County and it just seems to me ludicrous that we're having one of these homicides committed by these gang members and yet this program seems to continue so I and I again I don't know if it's it's under Congress's purview or the executives purview but it's madness that it continues so I suppose those are my two questions regarding the conference committee regarding the tax bill and what could be done to stop the flow of unaccompanied minors that has just inundated Suffolk County with gang members or potential gang members all of so both are great questions points the conferees have not been appointed yet for for a conference committee on the tax bill so I don't know yet who the members would be from New York or from anywhere else in the country both House and the Senate if the House passes a bill and then the Senate passes the bill then the next step will be appointing the conferees so we'll you know we'll see your timeline wise when if that happens and so as of right now yeah I can't name for you anyone who's on or not on extended appointed yet as far as the unaccompanied minors goes I remember this issue breaking big time summer of 2014 and you know we are a compassionate country we have a tremendous amount of sympathy for any child going through oppression gang violence poverty anywhere in the world it's just it's in our nature we don't have the bandwidth to allow every one of these kids to come into our country we have a lot of issues already inside of our country young what we were doing over the course of years was actually encouraging essential American parents to turn their kids over for this really dangerous mission they turn the kids over to these people called coyotes and this and I've heard these stories firsthand before getting to the southern border of our country they would be held at many of them would be held at gunpoint if they wanted to complete their mission and get into the United States they would have to smuggle things especially illegal narcotics into the United States if they wanted to finish the trip they get to the u.s. part of the process they get appearance tickets that were they're supposed to show up in court many of them don't show back up they get sent to very transient communities where the gang violence might be most prevalent where there's less assimilation than other places they're not with their parents so you're breaking up a family unit by encourage someone to send their kids on these missions so that that is a really important aspect just of life of growing up that doesn't exist and not just the gang violence but the the drugs these are lower income communities and a lot of the challenges that we face on Long Island's have resulted from certain policies that kind of compound each other's issues that's why you'll see a higher concentration of unaccompanied minors in a place like Brentwood or Central Islip but it's really all over our entire island were almost at the very very top of the list nationally here on Long Island as far as the amount of unaccompanied minors I I just I haven't been a supporter of this program it has not played out the way you know a utopia I eat opium pass would look and it's you know it's unfortunate so we shouldn't have been encouraging them in the past we really should stop encouraging people to turn their kids over for the dangerous missions and the whole program kind of sets them up for failure once they get here alright so let's go through the answers to with all of our questions by the way tonight we had thousands of people participating we had 3500 and 32 participants

Floyd's death was it wasn't was a tragedy and no one really disputes that and I think we can all agree on that and I saw the country come together and unify with the message that the person the people that are responsible for his death should be in prison but I was just heartened to see the rioting and the looting of public and private property and so first things first we have to restore order back in this country and restore the rule of law but once we do this the best way for us to get past this is to rebuild our economy like we had before the coronavirus and before all the incidences that we've seen here and there in the in the recent in the recent past and we have to make sure that we put people back to work to bring our jobs back to this country and if we did it once I can assure you we can do it again that's the spirit a lot of Americans want to hear right now captain Wesley Allen thank you we should point out we reached out to your opponent congresswoman Lizzie Fletcher and did not hear back from her she is welcome to come on this program all right Attorney

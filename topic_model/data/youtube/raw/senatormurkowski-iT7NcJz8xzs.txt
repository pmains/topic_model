so it's good to be working with my buddy joe manchin on bipartisan things um there's been a flurry flurry of bills that you have seen ideas floated out there in the past in the past week bills that have been introduced i think the difference with what you have here is this is bipartisan this means it actually has some legs and the fact that it is bicameral as well i think is one of the reasons why you've got so many folks that are gathered here today because this is actually something that can make a difference that can get putin's attention senator manchin has has used the words you know putin is not afraid to weaponize energy he's been doing that we've seen it all along into this lead up and and there's been an approach and a policy from this administration that says we don't want to do that we don't want to put that on the table well i'm sorry sir it's already on the table and it's been put on the table by putin and so what what can we do to respond well i will tell you today our message should be pretty clear and pretty simple no no more russian energy should come into the united states for the duration of this bloody horrifying and unprovoked war against ukraine so this measure this measure is in direct response to what russia is doing with the with the bombing of the schools and the hospitals and the apartment buildings forcing the ukrainians to flee their country killing the innocents that remain and and using some of the worst weapons in the world and indiscriminately uh to do it so these are not just acts of of war they're war crimes and there should not be a single additional american dollar allowed to finance these atrocities so the president has said i'm going to use every tool in the toolbox mr president this is a tool this is a tool the one tool the one tool that might just force vladimir putin to sue for peace here so we've got an opportunity here to address this we in this country can move today to ban russian energy imports so we know that we've been bringing crude oil russian crude into this country and and and oil products but we've been seeing those numbers drop um back in 2021 everyone's looking at those numbers it's about about 700 000 barrels that were coming in we started to see companies that are basically self-sanctioning in light of russia's activities according to eia's preliminary data u.s crude imports from russia were new were near zero at january so to senator manchin's point we can backfill all of this but i think people need to kind of put it into context in terms of how much we might need to to step up i'm confident that we can fill the supply gaps by american production along along with our allies in in canada for instance so i i would urge the president take take your take your counterproductive policies like taxes and royalty hikes take them off the table give the industry the confidence that it needs to be producing more he he might not want to hear this but i think the most important step that can be taken right now to lower domestic gas prices because that's what everybody wants how are we going to get the prices down it's almost psychological in nature he's got to change course he's got to embrace american energy he's got to tell the public that he's doing this that's going to do a lot more to calm than some some temporary spro sale we've we've seen that you don't get much mileage out of that in terms of reduction in the price you don't you don't see it calming the markets so to me this is clear as day we are not going to send russia any more us dollars to help them kill innocent people this bill will do it it's bipartisan it's bicameral and it needs to move and it needs to move today so let's go to the other side of

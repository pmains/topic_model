the house minority whip one of the top republicans in the congress steve scalise steve good morning good morning good morning i'll ring the bell sometime later on yeah we know you can you know uh what do you make of what is going on on our southern border because there's this video that we've got that shows a two-year-old who was abandoned apparently by the cartel or somebody that was bringing him to the united states it's just heartbreaking to see these images and it exemplifies that it is a disaster down there and it doesn't seem like the administration really is taking the same tact that donald trump took that stopped the flow of people across now and president trump had gotten control of our southern border and he'd actually engaged countries like mexico uh like honduras and el salvador and guatemala to help us get control of the southern border and what president biden did is reverse all of those things that were working and it's now out of control in fact the drug cartels have operational control of my major america it's a humanitarian crisis it's a national security crisis and it was all created by president biden's policies that aren't working it's why kamala harris didn't go to border control because she would have seen what we've seen i've been down there y'all have been had crews down there and it's everybody knows what's going on the border patrol agents all tell you the same thing just put back in place those policies that were working that they undid but it's not going to happen in fact they're the fact they're going to defund the border patrol they're proposing in this democratic committee about a billion dollars to cutting out of the border patrol so wait a second you don't have enough agents you just totally defanged ice and now you're cutting a billion dollars out of the budget congressman this isn't a tactic this is a plan what is going on here yeah it's really bizarre it's their priority they want open borders look you looked over the weekend you had the white house trying to blame other people for defunding the police which is a crazy idea that they embraced now they're trying to defund our border patrol when that goes south they're going to blame somebody else for that too they're the ones doing it and the people for what stuff they can blame everybody they want it proves that their policies are failing but in the end they're doing this deliberately they know the results of it you can go down the dyna detention facility and see these places overrun with with people here illegally they don't know what to do with them they're sending them to states all around the nation and they won't even be honest with with us or the american people about where they're going which states they're sending them to i mean local school systems are going to be getting kids by the hundreds that can't speak english and they don't care about those consequences because they just want to register everybody to vote they they have an agenda and they're using these kids unfortunately as pieces of their game and it's a dangerous political game for america congressman we interviewed bill weber and he is the sheriff of tarrant county in texas earlier in the show he's going to be with president trump and governor abbott today as they tour the border or they're going to actually go to an area close to mcallen which is where kamala harris was avoiding this is what that sheriff said incredible seizures of drugs the things that we have caught coming across the border and the things that we've caught in country up in the tarrant county and dallas county area we're having huge loads of drugs that are being seized so there hasn't been any progress there the border is open and uh you know we're talking about the kids coming across and we have got a crisis on the border we in that crisis is growing throughout america and we get drawn a lot in the sand someplace and take care of it congressman what do you think the reaction will be from border patrol and the people who are shaking hands with president trump and governor abbott well they spoke very highly of president trump when i was there because he took care of him he he gave them the tools they need if you meet with our border patrol agents they're wonderful people but they took this job because they want to get control of the border they want to push the drug cartels out of america they see the fentanyl coming across right now in record numbers uh and they see by the way that the trade the human trafficking that's going on this is a multi-million dollar a day business for the drug cartels to bring people across illegally because of biden's policies and and it's it's incredibly demoralizing for our border patrol agents and they know that president trump had their back and that biden doesn't as you pointed out he wants to cut them and take away their ability to do their job so all of this is playing up before everybody's eyes but to negative negative consequences for america's national security you've got people on the terrorists watching us that have been caught coming across the southern border recently and not just just from central and south america from middle eastern countries and other places around the world yeah uh well the former president is going to be at a sean hannity town hall tonight from the border and sean himself will be with us in about a half an hour so we'll be watching for that congressman yesterday you were busy because you're up early today you were up early yesterday you had a the republicans want answers apparently the democrats not as curious as the republicans how did this coronavirus pandemic start was it a lab leak or was it some sort of mutation jumping from you know animal to man here's some of the questions republicans asked at the hearing where dr fauci was a no-show what was the origin of covet 19 we've asked that question for more than a year and requested that the house majority hold hearings to investigate perplexingly speaker pelosi has refused to allow a single hearing calling it a diversion i believe it's time to completely dismiss the wet market as a source of the outbreak we have a con have confirmed case 10 days before the wet market cluster in fact i would say this is a diversion by the ccp and all roads point to the lab he said this is the chernobyl of virus research and it should underscore the need for increased scrutiny of gain of function research anywhere in the world we must allow for debate and dissenting views to be heard or we may never get to the root cause of this problem and hold the chinese communist party accountable congressman 600 000 americans have died from coronavirus you would think that this would be a bipartisan issue where did this thing start yeah and it really should be we've been calling for more than a year to have bipartisan hearings and speaker pelosi refuses to do that so we held our own hearing and what you saw some of my colleagues talking about what they've found and a lot of research has been done we had four medical experts from different areas of science that came who have been researching different aspects of the origins of the copen 19 virus single one of them testified that this started in the lab it was a a leak from the lab it was not transmitted to animal to human which was initially what china the chinese communist party the world health organization said it's clear when you look at the gene structure also they've tested over 80 animals in china not one of them has been determined to have covert 19 yet when you look at the gene structure of copen19 it looks like it's been around for more than 10 years when it's only been around for maybe a little over a year which tells you that it was genetic medically modified in that lab that was doing research on bat coronaviruses and so when you look at sars or mars very different structure for those newly occur maybe five or seven thousand people infected worldwide with cobit 19 over 200 million infected america over 600 000 deaths 4 million worldwide everybody testified that it was created in the lab and so it raises more questions that need to be answered what did america know about it did the nih have any financial investment directly or indirectly to that lab not pointing fingers but saying let's get these answers how could this have happened so we can prevent it from happening again speaker pelosi i don't want to join with us in doing it instead she's covering for the chinese communist party they won't have the hearings they won't even bring a bill to the floor a senate bill that yeah that would declassify everything related to the origin yeah all right congressman we're having a broadband issue right now thank you very much for joining us and to our viewers we apologize for that

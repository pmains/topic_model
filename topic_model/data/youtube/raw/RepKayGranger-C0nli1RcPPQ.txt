does Fort Worth ever cross her mind I trust it does she represents it in Congress represented it as mayor when I got here Kate Granger was the mayor of Fort Worth my the road we have both traveled okay welcome how you doing ma'am I'm doing great good to talk to you Marcus it's been a long time it has indeed it's so nice to have you listen I've got a bunch of stuff to talk about your past few years and where we are now but first let's talk about yesterday because the the the House Republicans went to the floor of the house with a resolution of disapproval against Nancy Pelosi's tactics the ripping of the speech or tell me what that was and you were the person who delivered it what was the content of that resolution it's called a privileged resolution which means it states that her actions were a breach of decorum and brought discredit to the house because it's a formal notice of disapproval because it's a privileged resolution that means the speaker will be required to bring it to the floor for a vote and that was what was important the you know Nancy Pelosi began with her introduction when she omitted the words high privilege and distinct honor which has always been a tradition but when she tore up her copy of the speech the official would we understands the official house record of remarks then that said to me that needs to be everyone needs to be aware of it and say say that she's not just the Speaker of the Democrats she's the Speaker of the House yeah I mean and and I remember John Boehner introducing Obama I remember Newt introducing Clinton I remember Tip O'Neill introducing Reagan I mean of speakers of the opposite party and they still afforded the sitting president the basic dignity befitting the event in today's Democrat Party is that just gone it is and that that was why it was so important to make sure people understood that and you're exactly right speaker Ryan Speaker Boehner they may have disagreed with the President on multiple issues but they treated him with respect so can you imagine the outrage if they had acted this way toward President Obama what Nancy Pelosi did was shameful it just degraded the Proceedings of the joint session the other thing mark that was so important you know the president brought those wonderful heroes those wonderful stories of people that were there in the audience and when she tore that up it was a slap in the face of those heroes and their families that the president had honored because those words were on those pages I let's expand this out how do you think impeachment plays out President Trump seems unfazed by it we'll learn more about that a couple of hours I I don't want to over state the degree to which it blew up on Democrats I said it would backfire and I believe it did but come November is an impeachment largely forgotten and people are sort of voting on whether they like or don't like President Trump or Republicans in general I think it's but there's a real misunderstanding of what people think of this president and he last night and it's in his speech he he went over all the things that have happened in the economy the unemployment incomes are rising poverty and welfare rolls are falling millions of jobs have been added Americans of all backgrounds are thriving workers are coming off the sidelines you know it's interesting why it's not all the women that were in white they were in white in solidarity the women's suffrage movement and but refused to applaud President Trump when he said clearly that women felled over 70% of all new jobs created last year so that people remember that and they're living through it and they have jobs that they didn't have they have more financial security and people will remember that when they go to vote yeah and and of much is made of Trump and women and Republican party etc etc and and the relationship that voters have with president let's spend a moment on the relationship you have with the president because it has been a pretty amazing thing to behold politically your affinity for him is pretty obvious his affinity for you is wrapped around every ad where I think it was at the rally at the AAC where he showed enormous respect and love for you what's the root of that what I think because I think I got a lot of it's about military spending which is so vital to you but just just riff on that for a minute I got a couple more the military spending when I came into Congress I was asked now you've been elected what path are you going to run on and I said I said clearly I want to make sure that every year that I'm in Congress I help keep our nation safe and support our military with the best training and the best equipment in the world President Trump is exactly there so when I wrote I chaired defense appropriations when I write a bill having to do with that I never have to check and see if the president's going to support it he is right there a hundred percent all the time the other thing is the border and I got involved in protecting our border in 2014 when John Boehner Speaker and I started watching these literally thousands of children that were coming across our southern border brought by what we call coyotes paid people and I went to Speaker Boehner and said Mr Speaker there's something very serious is happening and I think that you should put a staffer to follow it a committee to follow it instead he put me to follow it and I went to the border learned understood what was going on came back reported went back to all with those three countries and I saw in President Trump came in and said we need to secure our border I said I'm there and I've been there no one has been more active in supporting our border and building wall at me would it be true because you got a lot of company in this regard that back in the heat of 2015 and 16 President Trump might not have been your number one candidate but he showed you something through the military and border stuff he showed you enough devotion to things that are vital to you that that was the path that you took to an alliance that that is defined by those issues and now even more it's true and President Trump and I people say they don't want one like him so they ignore the fact that he says he's gonna do it and by gosh he gets things done I mean it he's he's doing things that really should have been done years ago and have have concerned me for a long time but he stepped every single time one of my favorite lines in his speech when he gave the was the only victories that matter in Washington or victories of the American people I love that I said that is so true and he never forgets that he gets it done he keeps his promises

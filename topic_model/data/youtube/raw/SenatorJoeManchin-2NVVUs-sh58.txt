first of all let me just say this to all of my colleagues i just can't tell you how proud we all are of us coming together and basically we're coming together all the support of ukraine what's happening in ukraine it's absolutely the carnage we see going on innocent peace loving people being attacked viciously by russia by putin's russia let's put it very clearly putin's russia and we have to do everything we can to support them i was very proud of the president when he said that basically there won't be one inch of uh of nato land that we will not defend that's a strong statement and i feel very strongly about that and i think showing the support that we have in united about this we will the one what we can make no no mistake this this is a this is a uh energy has become a weapon of war for putin and he's using that as a weapon of war he's using it against all of europe if you will but ukraine is basically the catalyst of what he's doing so what we're doing today is we introduced a bill it's been dropped we have i think there's 18 of us 9ds and 9rs that are on this piece of legislation that basically bans the russian energy imports act that's all it is we're banning russian imports act what we're banning is basically petroleum petroleum products crude oil lng coal mostly all fossils coming in the united states and whatever they should be it's an impressive group that we put together here but we're also united and basically if we can't show the united the uniting support that we have for ukraine and backing ukraine and making sure our allies nato allies know how supportive we are and that we're united behind them too and protecting them if we can't do that here that's going to be very hard to have them hold holding lines together that's been always my concern i've said this as a young person i'm i think i'm the oldest person here no let me just say i've never been more concerned since the cuban missile crisis as a young 15 year old i remember that vividly and man we were scared i mean really scared that what could happen because we knew the effects of a nuclear war i'm as concerned now about what this could escalate into if we don't do what we're doing now and stop and and hopefully he will he will understand the economics of this to his country and the detriment to his own country and putin so with that i think we can uh we can uh we can show solidarity here but also we can make a difference uh it also shows you the fragility of the energy uh in the markets around the world and what we're dealing with uh the united states has the ability to backfill and help all of our our allies around the world as they use this energy as a weapon but we have to make sure that we're doing ours we do it cleaner than anybody else we do it in a better fashion anybody else and we have the ability with the reserves to do much more during this crisis time of crisis so i hope we all take that in consideration so we're going to step up and we're asking the government to step up i've i've spoken to most of the largest ceos petroleum ceos in the united states they're basically all over the world they have markets over the world they have their tentacles everywhere in the world and spoke to all of them i asked him i said i want you to do everything you possibly can they said we have basically started aggressively pulling back all of our investments and pulling back all of our dependency on russian products that's that's that's great i applaud him for that and i said i need you to do something else i need you to make sure you make a commitment that basically the united states economy and the citizens of the united states will not be impacted because of corporate profits or shareholders profits whatever it would be during this period of time of crisis they all said this is a matter of national unity for us to and i was very proud to hear that so i'm going to say that everyone seems to be very much on board 100 and supporting this effort so with that i have no no concerns that we should have any shortages right here so the united states of america in 2019 was producing 12 million barrels a day 12.3 we're down 11.2 because of code market dropped off we have no problem at all ramping back up with what we already have ready to go so we can backfill that we have tremendous amount of lng we have a tremendous amount of gas that we can produce the lng for we're expanding on our exports as far as with our lng terminals uh germany is putting two terminals to receive lng so they don't have to depend on on russia and it's up to us to make sure that we connect all that together so without further ado i want to thank one of our co-sponsors one of our lead co-sponsors and everyone you see here this is a bicameral event you have house members and josh godhammer and brian fitzpatrick here and then basically the group that we put together so uh bring lisa murkowski up at this time and lisa if

mr. president I rise today as the Senate has been called upon to fulfill our constitutional duty to give advise and consent on president Trump's nominee to the Supreme Court red Cavanaugh now in the past presidents worked with a bipartisan Senate to appoint someone who understood the importance of precedent and transparency who respected the independence and integrity of the highest court in the land unfortunately that did that did not happen during this nomination process instead the process was flawed to fast-track a nominee without a full vetting for political gain Brett Kavanaugh was handpicked by the Federalist Society a right-wing lobbying organization dedicated to overturning Roe versus Wade why because as he has made clear on several occasions President Trump wants to stack the court with justices who will overturn Roe versus Wade now I am new to the Senate and as long as I've been here I've been told this is not regular order and so as we went through this confirmation hearing unfortunately I had found it along with my colleagues to be fast-tracked and I take very seriously my role to advise and consent when it comes to a nominee and I think we all as senators have equal votes and we should all have access to all of the information of full vetting of any nominee who wants to sit on the highest court for a lifetime appointment think about this the highest court there's only nine members lifetime appointment and this is something that we should all all look for the right person and everyone should have a full vetting but this hearing was fast-tracked not only was it fast-track we did not have access to all of the documents necessary to determine to determine whether Brett Kavanaugh not only had the correct judicial philosophy but the judicial temperament and impartiality that is necessary for somebody to sit on the highest court of the land not only were we limited in the number of documents but what little documents we did get unfortunately some of them were marked committee confidential in an effort to prevent members from using documents to question the witnesses the witness by unilaterally declaring them committee confidential many of my colleagues and the Senate Judiciary hearing were unable to adequately question judge Kavanaugh now I am told that that process of committee confidential is without precedent Republicans claim that chairman Leahy also accepted documents on a committee confidential basis during the Kagan nomination those documents were processed by the National Archives not private partisan lawyers and Republicans did not object by the time of her hearing 99% of Elena Kagan's White House records were publicly available and could be used freely by any member in contrast the committee has only 7% of Brett Cavanaugh's White House records and only 4% were made available to the public no Senate or committee rule grants the Chairman unilateral authority to designate documents committee confidential and prohibit their public release either the rules of the Senate nor the rules of committee authorized unilateral designation there was no committee action and ranking member Feinstein sent a letter stating she did not agree with a blanket designation and asked the Chairman to work with her to identify a subset of documents that should remain confidential and he refused but the Chairman then released thousands of mr. Cavanaugh's documents himself specifically he posted thousands of documents that had previously been marked committee confidential after consulting with mr. Bourke if these were confidential in committee confidential documents and the Chairman's actions also would violate Senate rules the Senate rule on executive sessions provides a penalty for disclosing the secret or confidential business or proceedings of the Senate but it requires a vote of the committee action to conduct confidential business or proceedings Democrats cannot be held to a different standard chairman Grassley has asserted that mr. Burke had sole authority to decide what documents may be used to question judge Kavanaugh and sole authority to decide which documents may be released to the public however he has failed to cite any rule or statute that gives Mercer Burke any Authority we should not have moved forward with hearings when we only had a fraction of the nominees record and the most significant documents that we had remained hidden from public view now the chairman claimed that he provided ample opportunity for Democrats to clear committee confidential documents for use at the hearing but he refused the request of several members to make documents on a number of topics public and I also want to make it clear that as I watch that hearing there are allegations that members of the Senate didn't even show up to take a look at these confidential documents so why were we complaining well I'll tell you what mr. president I showed up I was there for three days looking at all of these documents because I thought it was necessary even if we were gonna be limited and what we could see and what we can talk about I had a voice equal like everyone else and I should have access to those documents and figure out if I had the to talk to judge judge Cavanaugh or talk with my colleagues about it then I should have access to those documents but even when we had access the chairman demanded that Democrats send him their documents for preclearance by his staff President Bush's lawyers and the White House now my understanding is never before has minority members of the committee been required to identify and pre clear the topics and documents that they want to discuss with the Supreme Court nominee with the Chairman we're outside private lawyers or the White House never has a majority asserted unilateral authority to pre-clear what issues the minority party can even ask a nominee the idea that Democrats have to ask Republicans to pre-clear their questions and a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing is outrageous if the chairman bill Burke and the Trump White House were truly interested in a transparent process mr. Burke in the White House could make the White House Counsel records public now as President Obama and former President Clinton did for the Kagan nomination but we still don't have access to all of the documents we still have a process that is broken we still have a process that unfortunately did not provide all of the center's senators the opportunity to have a full vetting of Brett Kavanaugh now I took my time I reviewed judge Cavanaugh his record I looked at his cases his written statements I listened to his comments in the hearing I went and reviewed the documents the committee confidential I wanted an opportunity to meet with him unfortunately that never happened so I could question him myself and based on all of the information and based on taking my time like I did with our previous nominee because it is that important that we get the right person on the bench but in his statements and in his writings and opinions it was clear to me that Brett Cavanaugh has shown that he does not respect precedent he does not respect a woman's right to choose he does not respect workers rights if confirmed I believe that judge Kavanagh is extreme activist judicial philosophy will pose a threat to women our environment our constitutional separation of powers and our fundamental civil rights but it's not just Brett Kavanaugh judicial philosophy that troubles me last week judge Cavanaugh testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee to defend himself against sexual assault allegations he was asking for our vote for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court one of the deepest and most profound honors this nation can bestow upon a citizen this nominee was interviewing for a job in front of the American people and he was belligerent evasive and aggressive this nominee who currently sits as an appellate court judge on a DC Circuit Court disregarded all demeanor and respect for impartiality and independence by accusing the Democrats of engaging in and I quote a calculated and orchestrated political hit fueled with apparent pent up anger about president Trump in the 2016 election fear that has been unfairly stoked about his judicial Room record revenge on behalf of the Clintons and millions of dollars in money from outside left-wing opposition groups he then took it even further by stating and as we all know in the United States political system of the early 2000s what goes around comes around what goes around comes around are those the words of an impartial judge of course not during the question and answer period with the senators he was belligerent impatient and aggressive towards anyone who pressed him to get to the truth his demonstrated lack of temperament and impartiality is another reason why I cannot support him it is also why over 2400 law professors from respected law schools across this country penned a letter to the Senators to state that the Senate should not confirm judge Kavanaugh some of these very law professors who also appeared before the US Supreme Court some of these very law professors who also practice and teach at Yale and Harvard they wrote and I quote judicial temperament is one of the most important qualities of a judge a judge requires a personality that is even-handed unbiased impartial courteous yet firm and dedicated to a process not a result they further stated at the Senate hearings on September 27 Judge Brett Kavanaugh displayed a lack of judicial temperament that would be disqualifying for any court and certainly for elevation to the highest court of this land and former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens a Republican appointed by President Ford stated similar concerns when I watched Judge Cavanaugh's testimony I didn't see a fair and impartial justice I saw a man who is blinded by rage and ideology as a sitting judge Brett Kavanaugh knows better he knows better his accuser dr. Christine Blasi for testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee for four hours she was poised serious and credible in recounting what was clearly one of the most scarring traumatic experiences of her life and she did it on live television for all the world to hear she did it in the face of death threats she did it at the risk of damaging her credibility and career she had nothing to gain she has done a profound service to everyone whose life has been touched by sexual assault or abuse dr. Ford I believe you and I thank you for your courage and coming forward now I believe in a fair and independent process for people who have been accused of serious crimes like sexual assault and the process should include a neutral investigation that is thorough and nonpartisan because it will hold a perpetrator accountable or exonerate the falsely accused but that fair and independent process did not occur this time I am glad some of my colleagues stood up to make sure the FBI had a chance to reopen its background investigation but I'll tell you what after reading the recent FBI report it is clear that Republican leadership limited its scope and I say that as somebody who not only has been a prosecutor for ten years in eight years the Attorney General of the state of Nevada who's conducted criminal investigations and oversaw peace officers who did the same thing because what they did not do they did not interview dr. Ford nor obtained from her the important medical records that would corroborate her testimony in fact her attorneys wrote to the FBI offering up not only additional witnesses but making the statement that if they were to interview dr. Ford she would have also provided corroborating evidence including her medical records and access to the phone from which she messaged the Washington Post about Judge Cavanaugh's assault prior to prior to his nomination to the Supreme Court and I'm here to tell you corroborating evidence isn't just in the form of witness statements it's in the form of documentation that is key and that was never never recovered by the FBI and I'll tell you the potential witnesses that potentially the FBI could have talked to we know we know because they came forward out of a civic duty and they went public and the FBI still did not talk to them we know dr. Blasi Ford's husband Russell Ford basically he said he said that Christine shared the details of the sexual assault during a couples therapy session in 2012 she said that in high school she had been trapped in a room and physically restrained by one boy who was molesting her while another boy watched and dr. Ford's husband said I remember her saying that the attackers name was Brett Kavanaugh in 2012 2012 along with her husband adela Gill Domas on a friend of dr. Blasi force came forward and said in June of 2013 she said Christine for dr. Ford said that she had been almost raped by someone who is now a federal judge she told me she had been trapped in a room with two drunken guys and that she then escaped ran away and hid and a third witness and somebody who could have corroborated dr. Ford's statement Lynn Brooks Cavanaugh's Brett Kavanaugh as college friend who said there is no doubt in my mind that while at Yale he was a big partier often drank to excess and there had to be a number of nights where he does not remember so I know and unfortunately too often we have seen in this particular case an FBI supplemental report that was not thorough in addition after I reviewed the summary of the report and realized we were missing information the additional corroboration would have also gone to Debbie Ramirez allegations but they did not import they did not interview the FBI did not interview important witnesses to corroborate Debbie ramirez's allegations we now know because they've been again willing to come forward after seeing what has been happening through these hearings Kenneth's April Kavanagh a sweet mate for Brett Kavanaugh at Yale who is now professor at Princeton stated I can corroborate Debbie's account he said I believe her because it matches the same story I heard 35 years ago although the two of us have never talked and professor April was never interviewed likewise James Roche was also a roommate for Brett Kavanaugh and he said although Brett was normally reserved he was a notably heavy drinker even by the standards time and that he became aggressive and belligerent when he was very drunk and likewise chad Ludington a college classmate came forward I can unequivocally say that in denying the possibility that he ever blacked out from drinking and downplaying the degree in frequency of his drinking Brett has not told the truth but they were not interviewed by the FBI so now because we only have limited information all senators are left with a lack of a full understanding of the facts surrounding the allegations against Brett Kavanaugh the questions swirling around Brett Kavanaugh it at the very heart of our responsibility as members of the United States Senate we are not here to be a rubber stamp on the president's nominees we are a check-and-balance on his power we are here to work with him to make decisions that are right for the American people that means we listen to our constituents that includes women and men who have buried their experiences of trauma for far too long I have received letters from my constituents from all over Nevada sharing their stories of survival I heard from men and women in our military who were struggling not just with the effects of PTSD but with the experience of being sexually abused I recently met with women who led the campaign to codify a woman's right to choose in the Nevada State Constitution and they all asked me to oppose Brett Cavanaugh's nomination and I stand with them I stand with survivors I stand for the right of every American woman to make her own healthcare decisions I believe dr. Christine Blasi Ford I believe in the integrity and independence of our judicial I've condemned Brett Kavanaugh as confrontational and partisan behavior and I condemn the handling of this nomination by Senate Republican leaders we must work together in a bipartisan way and restore our constitutional role of advice and consent this is about something bigger than any one nominee it's about the integrity of our institutions it's about the core functions of our democracy we can't allow partisan politics to eat away at the checks and balances enshrined in our Constitution we have to return to common decency and regular order anything less is below the dignity of the American people and the great Constitution we swore an oath to faithfully support I encourage all of my colleagues to join me in voting against this temper mentally unfit nominee Thank You mr. president I noticed the absence of a poem the clerk will call the roll

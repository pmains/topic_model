i want to see unity in america and unity begins with truth and truth demands accountability here are five reasons we must impeach convict and bar donald trump from ever holding office again one protect democracy from future coup attempts trump's effort was designed to knock out the basic pillar of democracy the idea that voters not the sitting president not the members of congress but the voters decide who will lead this nation trump tried to strong-arm congress into overturning the will of the voters he cannot be president for another minute it's just too dangerous we're gonna walk down and i'll be there with you we're gonna walk down to the capitol because you'll never take back our country with weakness you have to show strength and you have to be strong you're allowed to go by very different rules two confront white supremacy head on there is a long history in this country of burying the truth instead of attacking the white supremacy in our system from lynching to jim crow to police brutality to the undemocratic attempt to overturn our election clearly the failure of accountability invites repetition to stop white supremacy and the violence it brings we need to look it squarely in the eye with courage and determination and use the laws on the books three protect the peaceful transfer of power some republican leaders are hiding behind this talking point we have an obligation i believe to protect the integrity of the election i've heard from people like i've never heard before they have major major concerns about the integrity the fairness of this election translation they're too afraid to tell the truth the truth that trump lost so they'll pass around a bunch of lies instead joe biden won the election he won by seven million votes nothing changes the facts four the whole world is watching leaders around the world commented as the crisis unfolded iran's president said the attack showed how fragile western democracy is a russian official declared the celebration of democracy is over a state-owned website in china called the events an iconic humiliation for our country we need to show the world what it looks like for democracy to win over tyranny five check unrestrained power trump doesn't feel bound by norms or laws for the past four years donald trump has tested the limits of our democracy breaking norms and laws and getting away with it we have separation of powers for a reason to check this kind of unrestrained power and congress needs to fulfill its constitutional duty to enforce it as our beloved colleague john lewis said shortly before his death democracy is not a state it is an act every member of congress must be counted are you on the side of trump's mob or are you on the side of democracy democracy demands accountability

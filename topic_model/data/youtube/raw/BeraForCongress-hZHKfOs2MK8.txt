welcome back to news tonight it's not a secret that when it comes to solving problems there is a clear division between the parties in Washington DC but there's an effort that's underway that's trying to change that it's called no labels the goal of this movement is to change the culture in Washington DC and encourage the parties to come together for the good of the country we've got two people here are driving forces behind this we know that you recognize this man congressman dr. Ami Bera nice to see army that's me back on there and mark mckinnon you're actually one of the cofounders of no labels with two other people yeah we've got a group of a few co-founders and started it's about five years ago and we're really excited because it's really taking off thanks to people like ami bera well we will get into no labels but first I do want to ask you both about what happened last week politically with eric cantor does that help the no labels movement in your mind on me or does that hurt well I think it shows that people want problem solvers and I think wieder Cantor you know it was viewed as one of the dysfunctions in Washington DC not working together across the aisle I think he also lost sight of who he works for the folks back home and again I think it does send a message that people want us to work together what do you think I think the big takeaway is that people blah Satan the leadership of the Congress and that they failed the problem-solving if Eric Cantor were a problem solver like like Ami Bera then he might still have that see well in doing the research i love the mission that is behind the labels move america from the old politics of point-scoring to new politics of problem solving is that an easy undertaking well you know what the the bar was so low at the beginning we said let's just bring people together and meet together Democrats and Republicans in the same room and even that was difficult originally we only had 20 people on me as one of the original 20 our goal is to get the 50 but the good news is that now we're at 94 we've exceeded by twice our goal for the year ninety four members of Congress half democrats have republicans meeting regularly working together writing and filing and passing legislation against stuff done and that's what that's what constituents want what what do you think is their future in this absolutely right we're in divided government people expect democrats and republicans for together to put the country first and that is exactly what we're doing but mark we see in light of Bergdahl's return in light of what's going on in Iraq in light of what's going on in Syria you can almost drop the responses from the two parties before anything is said you know how predictable it's going to be do you ever get this helpless feeling well there's huge frustration outside of Washington as people look at the paralysis because they just want things to move court they don't care if it's a Democrat solution or Republican solution they just want solutions and so we've got a group of people who are working together and they can go back to the district and say despite this divided government you see on television in Washington we're actually working together filing legislation getting stuff done so we're making a lot of progress and we've got 94 members we've not now working on something called a national strategic agenda which is goals for the country this is so simple we're doing the easy stuff get people together in a room what's amazing is how productive it's been for these people who are part of the coalition because their first of all they recognize that they like the people across the aisle the thing gets stuff done and work together so work it's been very exciting it's really exciting our expected we hear complaints from everybody Democrats Republicans they can't work together these people who are complaining who want the forces in Washington work together what can they do to get their message well so part of what we're doing today is we're meeting with local leaders local business leaders grassroots advocates now no labels has over 500,000 grassroots advocates across the country so if leadership is not going to do it we're going to do it as rank-and-file members coming together Democrats Republicans putting our ideas out there and creating that momentum and that pressure upward I think you've done a great example this is no budget no pay the idea that Ami Bera ran on it was one of our original ideas and you know Washington the sort of incumbents up there said oh that's a ridiculous idea but the grassroots rose up behind people like ami baire when he ran on that issue and said that's a great idea we want Washington respond and now it has this amies idea became the solution to the debt ceiling crisis back in the fall and forced out the first Senate budget we've had five years and 11 other when a year goals Q&A between the President and Congress wouldn't that be not hot you actually talking about you know what yeah I'm gonna give you a problem solver spin this is one of our label really yeah i will wear let's not fight I will wear proudly Marc McKenna was a pleasure to meet you and I survived i knows favor mami always nice to see you in we're going to try to get you and Doug OC for a debate i know the bees trying to work on that too but one way or another we're going to hear from both of you

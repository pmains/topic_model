  COMMITTEE, ONE MINUTE. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE   GENTLELADY FROM NEVADA IS  RECOGNIZED FOR ONE MINUTE. MS. TITUS: THANK YOU.  I'M PROUD, TOO, TO STAND WITH  MY COLLEAGUES ON THE T&I   COMMITTEE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF  THIS BILL WHICH IS THE RESULT  OF A LOT OF HARD WORK OVER MANY  YEARS AND INCLUDES A NUMBER OF   IMPORTANT WINS FOR MY  CONSTITUENTS IN NEVADA AND FOR   USERS OF OUR AVIATION SYSTEM   ALL AROUND THE WORLD.  AS CHAIR OF THE HOUSE TRAVEL   AND TOURISM CAUCUS, I'M HAPPY  TO SEE PROVISIONS TO IMPROVE   OUR AIRPORT INFRASTRUCTURE,  PROTECT AIR TRAVELERS AND  SUPPORT OUR PILOTS, FLIGHT   ATTENDANTS AND AVIATION  PROFESSIONALS. IN ADDITION, I'M GLAD THE BILL   INCLUDES AN IMPORTANT EXTENSION  OF THE WORK BEING DONE AT THE  NEVADA U.A.S. TEST SITE WHICH  WILL ALLOW CRITICAL RESEARCH   BEING CARRIED OUT WITH NASA AND  F.A.A. TO ADVANCE LOW ALTITUDE   AIR TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT, VITAL  TO THE SUCCESS OF THE  COMMERCIAL DRONE INDUSTRY. AS RANKING MEMBER OF THE   ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT   SUBCOMMITTEE, I'M ALSO PLEASED   TO REPORT THAT THE BILL  INCLUDES A BIPARTISAN DISASTER   RECOVERY AND REFORM ACT. THESE CRITICAL REFORMS WILL  HELP COMMUNITIES BECOME MORE   RESILIENT AND BETTER PREPARE TO  DEAL WITH THE IMPACTS OF GLOBAL  CLIMATE CHANGE.  WITH OUR NEIGHBORS IN THE  CAROLINAS REELING FROM THE   IMPACTS OF HURRICANE FLORENCE,   OUR FELLOW CITIZENS IN PUERTO  RICO AND VIRGIN ISLANDS STILL  REBUILDING FROM LAST YEAR'S  DEVASTATING HURRICANES, AND  NUMEROUS COMMUNITIES IN THE  WEST FACING BILED -- WILDFIRES,  THIS CAN'T COME SOON ENOUGH. THANK YOU AND I YIELD BACK.  THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE   GENTLEMAN FROM PENNSYLVANIA. MR. SHUSTER: THANK YOU, MR.  SPEAKER. IT'S NOW MY PLEASURE TO YIELD  ONE MINUTE TO THE GENTLEMAN  FROM LOUISIANA WHO TRULY IS AN   EXPERT WHEN IT COMES TO  EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AND   DISASTER RECOVERY, THE   GENTLEMAN FROM LOUISIANA, MR.  GRAVES.  THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE   GENTLEMAN FROM LOUISIANA IS  RECOGNIZED FOR ONE MINUTE. MR. GRAVES: THANK YOU, MR.   SPEAKER. MR. SPEAKER, I FIRST WANT TO   THANK THE CHAIRMAN, RANKING  MEMBER, AND THEIR STAFF FOR  THEIR PERSEVERANCE ON THIS   LEGISLATION. REALLY AN AMAZIN

mr. speaker we introduced HR eight eight years ago after our friend and former colleague Gabby Giffords was shot and nearly killed when she was by our side to introduce the bill she said speaking is still difficult for me but I don't think I can make myself more clear Congress must act to make our country safer from gun violence now is that time we've waited too long to close loopholes that let people easily avoid background checks through private sales I've cried with too many survivors and attended too many funerals I've marched with too many student activists and I have bowed my head through too many moments of silence we know strong gun laws work in the 25 years since the Brady law took effect background checks have stopped more than 3 million gun sales and have saved countless lives it's time to expand the brady law it's time to close the dangerous loopholes it's past time for Congress to take law take action to save lives from gun violence mr. speaker this is not a moment of silence this is not a sit-in this is action by the United States House of Representatives on behalf of everyone who has pleaded for that action after San Bernardino and after Sutherlands Springs and after Fort Hood and after Virginia Tech and after Columbine and Sandy Hook and Las Vegas and pulse and every day gun violence in our communities and yes after Parkland let's represent the 95% of the American people who want us to take this action to help save lives let's pass HR 8 they yield back the balance of my time

narrowly advanced in the house after lawmakers included the addition of a rule that prevents debate on US support of Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen joining us now a Republican member of the House Agriculture Committee congressman Roger Marshall of Kansas congressman good to have you on this morning explain a little more what was the controversy in that farm bill well that the controversy was on the rule if you may recall the final vote was overwhelming over 90% of us supported the final bill itself but in some procedural moments there's a we have to vote on a rule and that rule included some language on Yemen and just what I would emphasize is that certainly was a curveball but I think what this was all about was trying to halt to put a halt on Iranian mission in the Middle East so let me ask you about one of your tweets congressman we're talking about the meeting between the president Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer in the Oval Office Lee much talked about meeting the televised meeting that was in the in the Oval Office you wrote this I will always support Donald Trump putting national security first securing our borders is a no brainer Nancy Pelosi and Senator Schumer in their unending efforts to work against anything the president proposes are working against the security of our nation that's a pretty serious claim that they're working against the security of our nation what did you mean specifically by that congressman well you know this is the brilliance of Donald Trump is to put that meeting on national TV so everybody can see the dynamics of what's going on when the president tries to meet with mr. Schumer and miss Pelosi so so this border is all about national security every day over 10 10 terrorists and 40 criminals tried to cross that border where are you getting that silver sir that 10% across the border over 90 percent of the illicit opioids come into this country through that border as well from from DHS from the Department of Homeland Security that they captured ten terrorists at the border every day that they that ten terrorists might try to cross that border every day and how do they assess that how do they terrorists in other words well I think that we have to trust that that's what the DHS is communicating to Congress so we obviously have experienced guards down there experienced people that are patrolling that border and what kind of terrorists are they specifically because we know since 9/11 no radical Islamic terrorists in fact who have committed acts inside this country have come across the southern border right I think that that the Secretary of State has what he has orders what he would consider a terrorist and if they meet those criteria then that's what the Department of Homeland Security is going to work with but I certainly would not undermine or or underestimate that the threats on this country coming across our borders by terrorists yeah I mean have you made a call to DHS to where are these terrorists now presently being held I'm not saying that they've all made it even across the border but it but if they're in there it would be in our jails okay what about people coming across the border what would help what would happen to a lot of the farmers who are in your district if they had to go without the migrants who come across the border to assist in helping them you know cause their crops at the end of the season oh it would be really tough we have probably 40 50 thousand open jobs in Kansas right now we have 70,000 jobs that depend upon an agriculture guest worker visa and that's why I provoked by oriT eyes working so hard to make sure that we have more agriculture guest worker visas I'm sorry we have any of them might be terrorists well I sure would be absolutely and we've had some you know unfortunately some terrorist actions in Kansas but I think that they are most of the people that are here illegally have came here illegally and were properly vetted but absolutely I'm concerned about terrorism I think we all are this is Gene Robinson congressman one you said everybody could watch the meeting and make their own judgments one uh one other thing that everybody knows and can see is that Republicans have a majority in both the House and the Senate so why are you blaming Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer for what Republicans could just do if they want to do it right and I think that my concern is why do we always focus on the blame what I want to do is take responsibility I think I want to take responsibility and say that border security is so important that we're willing to shut the government down if we if we can't fund five billion dollars of border security now and as you know we need 60 votes in the Senate we're not going to get those 60 votes unless we have some Democrats cross the line we can do it in the house get it done in the house but we need some Democrats across this we'll cross the line on the Senate side why doesn't speak just call the vote in the house there's secret speaker to be Pelosi suggested why don't you just go ahead and do that that might show the Senate the house of serious might move things forward why didn't that happen I'm certainly willing to do that as a matter of fact I expect the Republican House to demand we get to have that vote before January first gets here so I expect that will happen again we're just not ready to put all our cards on the table we want to give the Senate some time to negotiate it and work out a plan as well it'd be much smoother if we have some confidence from the Senate side as well but we're very willing to do that and I have confidence in our conference that we can that we can get this vote across the border Congressman Roger Marshall thank you very much for being with us we should point out to our viewers the men who was charged in Kansas City with providing material support to Isis did not come across the border he was

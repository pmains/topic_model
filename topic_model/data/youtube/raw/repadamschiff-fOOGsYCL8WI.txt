joining us now is democratic congressman adam schiff of california he's chairman of the house intelligence committee a member of the january sixth select committee and he served as the lead impeachment manager for the first impeachment trial of donald trump trump craftsmanship thank you very much for joining us tonight i'm sure you've heard those calls to congressman kensinger's office i'm sure you have your own sample that you could release what do you say to staffers those young people uh who get those calls well it is very hard uh and you're right lawrence we've all had those calls uh certainly all of us on the committee uh and we you know we confer with each other about the threat environment out there what we're hearing from people i was in a parade over the weekend uh actually on july 4th and you know while most the crowd was supportive there was a healthy contingent of people calling me a traitor saying i betrayed the country uh and and uh like uh sentiment um so we're all getting these kind of threats uh on the phone uh we report them to the capitol police when we feel they're sufficiently specific um and and yes it's it's traumatizing i think for the young people working in our office uh i had young people with me during the parade uh hearing that kind of feedback from people um and uh and i'll tell you what was most traumatic for me was at a fireworks celebration uh you know talking to a what i think was a middle schooler about her active shooter drills and the fear she feels in school and we have a lot to cope with as a country right now and we have to i think reject these calls to violence and we have to do something far more substantial when it comes to gun violence in particular the committee announced today that you'll be having a hearing a week from today on tuesday there are reports tonight that the witness will be sarah matthews she's 27 years old she served as a deputy press secretary in the trump white house she resigned the night of january 6 2021 with a resignation letter saying that she was deeply disturbed by what i saw she said our nation that needs a peaceful transfer of power uh can can you confirm for us that she will be the public witness next tuesday uh i can't um confirm that one way or the other i'm gonna leave that to my uh chair and vice chair or to uh one of my colleagues who will be handling uh the next hearing or the next couple hearings um but we do expect to get into what uh you know what that crowd was made up of uh the participation of those white nationalist groups the summoning of that mob to the mall this is part of the progression that the chair and vice chair announced at the beginning of these hearings we pretty much tracked those all along uh with the straight state pressure campaign with the pressure campaign against the vice president hearing on the big lie uh and now focusing on that mob itself uh and then finally what the president was doing and and more important what he was not doing uh during that attack the terrible dereliction of duty by the president of the united states will we be here in the next hearing will we be hearing more testimony like we heard from cassidy hutchinson that is in effect testimony from inside the white house lawrence i really can't go into those kind of specifics yet uh we've uh and i know it's frustrating at times uh to you all but we've been very disciplined about what we're willing to share in advance and and particularly as this is not a hearing that i will be leading i really don't want to comment on the on the specifics so but what you just suggested is that it that it will be about uh actual attackers uh of the building uh could could you could you give us some basic frame of the hearing well we want to shed light on how that mob came to be there on january 6 how they were called how they were brought together uh what different groups were participating the relationship between groups how they were incited and and so that will certainly be uh the subject of some of our upcoming hearings now you already had your georgia hearing uh feels like a month ago but it was a matter of a couple of weeks ago uh georgia focused hearing with brad rappenberger who we know is a witness in the grand jury in georgia today we get a flood of subpoenas uh for that uh grand jury uh including for united states senator lindsey graham uh what is your what did what did you see in that did you see a pattern in those subpoenas that went out today uh yes you know the fulton county district attorney and you know hats off to her is pursuing this very aggressively uh the fake elector plot the attempt to interfere with the secretary of state's office with the secretary of state in particular the calls the urging the false claims of fraud the false presentation about that video that took place at the state farm arena suggesting a corruption that wasn't there and i have to think that it was very telling for the district attorney's office in fulton county to watch our hearing and see the attorney general bill barr deputy attorney general and others talk about how they investigated this how it was complete nonsense and they told the president this uh and so that demonstrates the the president and his campaign's knowledge that what they were pushing in georgia was just plain false and fraudulent and so i think that that provided some important uh evidence to the district attorney's office i do want to underscore something that andrew told you before the break because i completely concur with it it is very unusual for a local district attorney's office to be way out ahead of the u.s justice department in a case of federal and national significance it's very unusual for congress to be way out ahead of the justice department it really ought to be a broad justice department investigation uh and i i hope that the actions of our committee and uh and fulton county uh have given the just department a real sense of urgency about these matters congressman adam schiff thank you very much for joining us tonight always appreciate it thank you thank you

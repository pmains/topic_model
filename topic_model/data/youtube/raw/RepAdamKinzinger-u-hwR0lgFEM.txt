joining us now republican congressman adam kinzinger of illinois is a member of the foreign affairs committee the january 6th select committee and he's also a lieutenant colonel in the air national guard served in iraq and afghanistan a congressman thank you so much for joining us as you know russia has named a new commander for ukraine it's sending a convoy to reinforce this push for the dunbas region right now does the u.s need to revise its strategy of support for ukraine as the fight changes as it moves east right now yeah we certainly do and and i think you know to an extent some of that's being done i know there's been changes in information sharing and intel sharing that's good uh conversations with the ukrainians asking what they need uh and doing our best to get it there i think any bureau bureaucratic red tape that exists slow those backfill of weapons down to our allies who want to push for the more soviet-era weapons that has to be cut but yeah i think some of the changes that can happen i think we need to really look at the fact that you know there were no flights of nato aircraft into ukraine or you know direct convoys really into ukraine when you had russian presence in kiev but that presence is now gone and really with the the fighting focused on the eastern part of ukraine uh and i don't know all the tactical uh difficulties specifically on the ground there so i'm saying it with that caveat but i think this is a moment where maybe we can begin directly flying more things into ukraine directly driving more stuff into ukraine to make sure we're getting that equipment quicker to the guys on the ground that need it because they're in for a real heck of a fight and uh you know as you guys have well covered uh the fight in the east is going to be very different than what we saw in kiev and uh we cannot wolf we cannot allow the ukrainians to lose or the russians to win yeah it's going to be much more difficult to get the weapons to the eastern part of the country than it was to the western part of the country which is closer to poland and a key nato ally the pentagon says they're working to help get long-range air defense systems into ukraine but that the ukrainians quote still have a lot of their air defense capability available to them first of all do you agree with that assessment yeah i mean it seems like it i'm astonished as a as an air guy myself that the russians have been unable to get air supremacy over ukraine uh it goes to show both ukrainian tactics but the fact that we also have significantly overestimated the russian military's capability but that doesn't mean of course there's no danger there is a plenty of danger from the air we see it every day and so having their defense system in place is good the long range bringing the s 300 in is good and uh you know bottom line though we have to realize that every day there's a moment we could wake up and realize that air defense system has been significantly hampered or taken down so we can't rest on that and uh i think it is essential to continue to move you know moving things like the javelin like the stingers in uh and our allies versions of those but ensuring they get that long-range air defense system but ultimately this may be a tank on tank battle this may be you know very different than what we've seen and we have to be flexible and agile to supply the ukrainians with the equipment that they need while i have your congressman i quickly want to turn to your work on the january 6th select committee your colleague republican congresswoman liz cheney says it's absolutely clear that what former president trump was doing was unlawful do you agree with her uh yeah certainly i mean i i think yeah all you have to do is look at donald trump's own statements uh when he says he put out a statement not that long ago where he said i wanted vice president pence to overturn an election i mean that to me sounds like an admission to a coup attempt uh the question now though for the committee is we put the story out uh you know the doj is going to be able to read whatever we do there's no criminal component to what the house of representatives can do but certainly we can put that information out there and doj can take a look and do whatever they will with it and we hope that they enforce the uh the contempt charges that we've just brought forward or the contempt resolution uh to get these witnesses to testify in front of us so you think there'll be a criminal referral from the committee well so that's an interesting question because get we we may be able to do that we may not really we have no ability to to say anything to doj that they're not going to already see but that's certainly something look i i think if that is a reasonable thing to do and again even if we don't do any kind of an official criminal referral they have the report they'll be able to see it but i'm going to tell you too wolf this is a very united committee i've seen some weird reports out there about division on the committee and debate on this issue they're completely false they're utterly not true we are a united committee focused on getting to the truth and getting to answers and people will see that yeah that's what liz cheney said yesterday the vice chair she said something very similar on cnn's state of the union thank you very much congressman adam kinziger thanks for all your important work we appreciate it very much anytime well thanks

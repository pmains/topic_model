welcome back to the show congressman and House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul back with me now thanks for being on the show again yeah thanks for having appreciate you being in Belgian authorities let's begin with this talking national security following the Brussels attacks of course but Belgian authorities releasing new video today of one of the suspects in the attacks is still on the run what's the US involvement with it's just trying to track these people that are still at large well are you know federal law enforcement is engaged in this investigation working with the Europeans with the Belgians the intelligence community as well Interpol the international police in pretty much this manhunt for that third suspect there are I my understanding is about twenty two other suspects out there related to both the Paris and the Brussels attack these are interrelated it's the same network the cells or have one of an interrelationship to them in fact the individual a booth who came in as a mastermind of Paris claims that he came in with 90 other foreign fighters from Syria so that's the magnitude in Europe I think the threat level far greater in Europe than it is in the United States you've said that you've been worried about Brussels from for some time what were the signs there and could things have been prevented her flags that went up prior to the case and the turkey officials warn them about some of these individuals in advance and and so when I was there prior to the Paris attacks I was both in France and Belgium there was a lot of anxiety about this is right after the Charlie Hebdo attack and in Paris they were concerned about an active shooter plot like this one and a suicide bomber and in Belgium I think they were very concerned at the the communities themselves being so segregated the Muslim community alike in the United States is not well assimilated with the rest of the society and they have these hotspots of radicalization in those jeans I think that's what they're most concerned with when I was there what I mean if you can grasp this just the size and scope of the threads in terms of you know and some of these flights that have resumed and just kind of what we should be looking for what you guys are looking for in terms of here on US soil wealthy it's important to note that I think Europe is in a pre 911 state and they are trying to change some of their laws they don't share intelligence like we do they don't share the databases they don't check their own citizens passed a watchlist if they're flying from say turkey into Europe and these are all things that need to be corrected we do that in the United States so the threat level when I say it's not as high as it is in Europe the reason I say that is because there are thousands of what are called these foreign fighters that have traveled to Iraq and Syria trained in the art of warfare and many of those have come back in the united states / perspective we've had hundreds travel and some of those have come back into the United States and if we can charge them we do if we can't we usually monitor those individuals but we're always concerned about an active shooter plot in the United States Isis and whether latest videos calls for a Paris or Brussels attack style attack in the United States yesli Americans are always concerned when these things happen but just in terms of what people can know and see in more security that's being done here in the United States as a result of what's happened recently well i think is important also note that the last points of departure airports those airports of inbound flights into the united states we are heavily engaged in the security of those airports pushing out the border if you will and our scrutiny and screening has gone up significantly since Paris and Brussels but also in the United States you'll see a more visible presence of canines for instance you see what these Viper teams they call them these the TSA state local teams that will go around airports to provide a deterrent effect so we have ramped up the security at airports and and a perimeter but things you can see in a nun team yeah after this latest attack you have renewed your call for the encryption bill that you've introduced how much I guess dunno about the use of encryption in these terrorist plots well it was used in both of these plots and we're now finding out that in Brussels they use the same techniques with the Paris attackers used because the cells are really interrelated in Paris they used what's called telegram it happen we can't see their communications if you can't see it it's hard to stop it in the phones we found now in Brussels the same thing we're not seeing anything on these phones we couldn't see their communications in advance which is why people say did you see it happening early any signs of warning signs beforehand and the answer is no because we couldn't see what they were saying I'm really worried about that scenario in the United States because now they're sophisticated enough to use this kind of technology it's not like bin Laden primitive communications with Kay's encouraged it's a new generation of terrorists that know how to use and exploit the internet and this encryption we do have this sort of water and I introduced the bill to create this National Commission on digital security and even though in the apple case that's now been resolved we still have this threat of tariffs being able to communicated dark space and how do we handle that from the Congressional perspective yeah and I know we talked about this a bit last time but just in terms of still protecting people's privacy though when you're still wanting to make that an important part of the bill correct yeah and so what we do is we have the leaders the experts on technology privacy federal state local law and the intelligence community to come together and form a national consensus and recommendations to the congress as to how we can proceed when I'm worried about or some of these knee-jerk legislative reactive proposals that actually may go too far for instance the idea of putting a back door in your vice iphone that the government can access I don't think that's going to go over wealthy American people know what about some of the comments on the campaign trail just regarding national security terrorist plots specifically Ted Cruz is called for patrolling Muslim neighborhoods what's your response to that well I think since he made that come and he kind of scaled it back to say we need to be more engaged like Bloomberg was with Ray Kelly you know anything I think community engagement and the Muslim community is very important when I go to New York NYPD's is very has a great outreach program to the Muslim community to the routing of the leaders in those communities and that's very important because only by doing that can you have prevention and see signs of radicalization possibly stop it whatever we do we have to do this under the framework of the Constitution you can't just put people under surveillance around people up without predication or probable cause under the Constitution you on the show will get you back to talk more and who you appreciate having you on thanks a lot more capital tonight right after the break you

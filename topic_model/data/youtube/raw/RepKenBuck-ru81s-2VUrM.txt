Colorado congressman and house Judiciary Committee Member Ken good to see you so do you think that the White House is going to heed your ass to release the records of everyone who's gone to see Joe Biden in Wilmington Delaware I don't um and I think it's really important that they do but I I have little faith that they will try to resolve this matter and especially in a transparent way uh Sean I think what's what's interesting is there's a lot of people going in and out of private residences there's a lot of friends of Hunter bidens and we know some of the uh less than Savory characters that that Hunter Biden hangs around with and so if he is bringing anybody into these uh homes and they have access to these documents it's it's a scary situation I'm not sure exactly how classified these documents are or or really the sensitivity of the information that they held but uh it is uh it's it's something that would help give the public some uh sense that that there is a fair play going on right now peer plan transparency you know our own peter Ducey they'll press this issue at the White House earlier today watch when will the White House release a log of visitors to the Wilmington House again I am telling I'm telling Rita which which house logs uh did you ask the last Administration why they got rid of the White House law okay let's go Congressman she looks like a boxer she's dodging and she's weaving but they can't keep dodging this question forever right well the the question is really simple why don't they tell us who was in these homes uh the fact that they have logs now that's great I'm really happy that they have logs at the White House but that's not where these secure documents were left unattended in an unsecure location and it's important for us to know who had access to those but isn't that the point if we know who went to to Joe Biden's home or to the Penn Biden Center then we know who would have had access to these documents and they don't want us to see who could have potentially had access to these confidential records then it wants to see because every time that Hunter Biden does something it uncovers another layer of corruption they don't want us to know that he was on the board of barisma and getting eighty thousand dollars a month uh for his expertise in oil and gas which is non-existent they didn't want us to know that he accompanied his father um on Air Force 2 to China and and was dealing with the Chinese Communist party's uh bank there's a lot of things they don't want us to see and the reason they don't want us to know about who's in these homes is because Hunter Biden is undoubtedly involved in other activities that they want to cover up Congressman when I look back to the way Democrats talked about this investigation about Mar-A-Lago and Donald Trump having documents many of them said Donald Trump was a traitor right and being a Trader is punishable by death um I'm not suggesting death for Joe Biden but should should the Republican Congress use the Democrat standard and if Joe Biden then is a traitor should he be impeached well let's back up um let's treat everyone similarly and and I don't think this is an impeachable offense um on its face you've got to show all kinds of intent um in in levels of uh now obviously they were in two different places and that shows more intent than uh if it had just been an accident located in one place but the way Hillary Clinton wasn't uh treated the way uh president Trump was treated and now the way President Biden's being treated uh completely different um and and unfair in

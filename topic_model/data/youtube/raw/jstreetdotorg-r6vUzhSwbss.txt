hello J Street you all are the best I've been with you many times and I'm really sorry not to be able to with you this year for your conference the J Street conference is always an important opportunity for us to reaffirm the values we share to build support for Israel to strengthen the constituency for peace and all the young people in attendance I want to thank you for getting engaged we need you badly because the partnership between Israel and the United States must continue to grow and to nurture all the unites our two countries our shared values democratic ideals that set us apart which every generation must fight to renew the spirit of innovation on entrepreneurship the determination to overcome every obstacle and endure the two-state solution is the best if not the only way to secure a peaceful future for a Jewish Democratic State of Israel you know despite the violence today despite the enduring animosity and challenges peace is still the most important element to submit Israel's enduring security you know it's also the best way to meet the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people expand Economic Opportunity pursue justice protect their dignity as well Israeli and Palestinian children both deserve to grow up in safety with every chance to pursue their dreams that's what we have to keep working toward and we can't give up no matter how hard the work that heads going to be nor should we ever forget that Israelis wake up every morning facing an existential threat from their neighbors in the region and they live each day with tremendous courage but also anxiety that's why you always have to be adamant that Israel must be able to defend itself not just critical for Israel's security it's critical for America's security but as all of us know so well we can't be afraid to tell the truth to our closest friends any step that takes us further from a path toward peace has to be condemned and the Palestinian people need to step up to no support for terrorists stop violent attacks on Israel Israel needs to stop the settlement activity as well which takes us further from peace taking Israel further from its democratic values and undermining support for Israel with some in the United States especially among younger people we all need to work together to address the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza as well we can't let this will become a political football this can't become another issue that divides Republicans and Democrats that's why this conference is so important thank you again for your enduring commitment and thank you for all you do for the United States and for Israel you

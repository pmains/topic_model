republicans haven't supported buildback better or any of these things either and we're staring at a contrast in a split screen here where you have the supreme court and conservatives primed to strike down roe v wade and then you have the white house and democrats in congress trying to pass the women's health protection act or today's maternal health day of action if the anti-abortion movement really cared about babies and families don't you think they should be at this day of action and participating in reducing maternal mortality since they want the government to force women to have babies let me tell you this i serve on energy and commerce and last year or last congress when we tried to get my bill passed not one republican signed up for it and it's so crazy because they came from states that ranked number one or number two or number three when it came to maternal mortality but they did not sign up uh for this bill and as you've um you know the american rescue plan which my bill was in none of them voted for it and for bill back better i don't think any of them voted for it if they did in congress it was very few so it seems like they may care when you're in your mom's stomach but they don't care you know once you're born or they don't care about the person carrying you

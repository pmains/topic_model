in the meantime senator roger marshall the kansas center he's a physician by training what he makes of this back and forth um and i never know a senator on these type of occasions particularly when it comes to getting an update on virus or things i should address you as a senator or doctor i think i'm going to go with dr senator but um it's always good to have you i'm wondering what you make of what the president was saying about mass and what he was hinting at taking guidance from the cdc which is already hinted potentially new restrictions are in order what do you think well well neil i think the the president is not responding to the science there there's so much optimism that should be out there right now this delta variant is spreading a little bit across the country but here's the good news two-thirds of american adults over 90 percent of our senior citizens will have their second vaccination within a couple of weeks the group that's left 50 of them have have some type of natural immunity already and that protects us natural immunity or the vaccination protects us over 95 percent of the time this is not the time to put more restrictions on america the mask have very minimal help if any people need to talk to their doctor if they haven't got the vaccine that's the cure here is to talk to your doctor if you haven't got the vaccine we're winning the war um now as a doctor senator a couple of dumb questions on my part this this idea that people wear mass indoors whether you've been vaccinated or not apparently it's not just l.a county kicking this around this fall and a lot of school systems the atlanta greater area that will be the rule everyone wears masks whether you've been vaccinated or not is that a bit much or what do you make of it it's way over the top right we certainly know that especially making our kids wear masks their psychological harm to that and and keeping them home from school is a huge psychological threat to them and of course their academic progress as well um so remember that whether you've had the vaccine or whether you have natural infection it's going to protect you 95 of the time from hospitalization i guess i would ask the president is don't they have confidence in this vaccine what why does a person want to wear belt suppenders and maybe depends as well i i don't get it but i see no reason to force our kids or anybody to wear a mask at this point in time

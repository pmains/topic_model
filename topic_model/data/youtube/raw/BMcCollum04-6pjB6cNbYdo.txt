Thank You mr. speaker the Iran nuclear agreement is fundamental to the national security of the United States and I applaud the tremendous efforts of secretary Kerry and secretary mosi who worked in concert with the world's most powerful military economic nations to reach a verifiable agreement that will deny Iran the ability to develop a nuclear weapon in past errors when politics was civil in foreign policy was bipartisan this diplomatic agreement would have been championed by Republicans and Democrats as a non-proliferation triumph as it is today in Great Britain our greatest ally this agreement will prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon as an Israeli intelligent analysis said and I quote this is not about trust or goodwill between state sides it is strict inspection and verification regimes that will ensure the success of this agreement and if Iran violates the agreement sanctions will snap back and the international community together will take action I strongly support this agreement and I'm grateful for President Obama's unwavering leadership in the face of hostile and on president attacks from Republicans and Israel's Prime Minister the New York Times calls Republican efforts quote a vicious battle against mr. Obama in an unseemly spectacle of lawmakers siding with a foreign leader against their own commander-in-chief I want to be crystal clear I support our commander-in-chief the Republicans and Israeli opponents of this agreement are the same neo-cons who sold the war in Iraq to America based on lies distortions and misinformation and now what do the Republicans offers an alternative nothing they have no plan no plan other than to kill this agreement which means that Iran will either obtain a nuclear weapon or the u.s. goes to war to stop them well let me tell you I am NOT interested in another republican war in the Middle East now's the time to put the Nash security of the American people first let's reject this Republican game plane and support a tough diplomatic agreement that will stop Iran from gaining a nuclear weapon and I yield back the gym

good morning everybody thank you for joining us senator Warner and I are here with a couple of our allies to announce the introduction today of legislation that I think meets a couple of criteria when you think about the most important task that in my view washington DC congress and the president have to resolve its job creation growing the economy and when you think about the greatest complaint about what's going on in our nation's capital its lack of partisanship and working lack of bipartisanship and the failure to work together to accomplish the goals that we need to for our country and we very much believe that what we're presenting today addresses the issue of job creation in a very substance even significant way and that we're doing it in a way that should lend itself to said no real opportunities for Republicans and Democrats White House and Congress to be in opposition to the details of our legislation week marks as we hope we think we're there and certainly our goal was to do something that mattered as something that provided made a difference but did so without creating a kind of the political enmity that seems to arrive so often in the work that we try to accomplish in our nation's capital I certainly want to acknowledge senator Warner and his role we have developed a awfully good working relationship and I'm honored that someone of senator Warner's background experience in caliber has has joined us in this legislation especially also pleased to have Steve Case the co-founder of AOL with us one of the leaders on the President Obama's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness and also brink lindsey is here rink is with the Kauffman Foundation headquartered in Kansas City Missouri and the what initiated this legislation in in you know in my world was a report by the Kauffman Foundation demonstrating by absolut scientific based research the value of entrepreneurship and job creation in the history of our country and what has transpired in recent years and more importantly this this thoughtful foundation has provided a path suggestions of what policies could be could be brought forth that would create an entrepreneurial environment in our country today and so we're very grateful to the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation in Kansas City for providing the the substance the the real support that demonstrates the value of what we're attempting to accomplish with this legislation I particularly got interested in this and landed with the Kauffman Foundation report on my desk at a time in which I was discouraged about what Congress was unable to do I'm certainly one who believes that the deficits matter that we've got to get our financial house in order senator Warner has taken a lead in those efforts and the discouragement came from kind of everything that I'd seen happen in Congress really was it's not happening and so I started thinking how is it has a different way perhaps a better way a more politically possible way of addressing the issue of our our budget challenges the deficits and and deficits another way that we can help pay down the debt and get our country's financial house back in order is to have a growing economy put people to work people who are working are paying taxes the the tremendous benefit that comes from that plan is that people who are working and earning an income therefore providing for their families putting food on their families tables saving for their kids education saving for their own retirement and so that I decided to focus my efforts on trying to grow the economy not forgetting the efforts at trying to hold the line on spending and addressing the deficit issues but to do it in a way that certainly a much more positive message to Kansans and to Americans is there's a there's something we can do here that does awfully good things for Americans across the country and at the same time a growing economy helps us get out of the financial condition that we're in as a nation as a country so the startup act is the is the result of that it basically focuses on five areas of ways that we can help entrepreneurial those with entrepreneurial skills and talents to succeed in the United States and in the process succeeding putting people to work as you would expect it has a regulatory component the regulatory environment and particularly an uncertain regulatory environment is a significant handicap we do not expect to address in the startup act every piece of legislation that can be introduced or will be introduced in regard to regulation this is a very broad topic that our colleagues in Congress will and are addressing but we do know that the regulatory environment is one that handicaps entrepreneurs and job creation we know and this bill addresses the second component being attract and retain capital that's a very difficult challenge for many startup businesses and this legislation addresses that issue as well those are broad topics that many members of Congress are dealing with some of the things that are unique it to me about the startup act is we're working to encourage the commercialization of federal research millions of dollars are spent every day year-round throughout the country particularly at universities academic institutions research is occurring and we want to make certain that we focus at least a portion of that research on ideas that can be commercialized meaning that they can be used to create the opportunity to grow a business to bring those ideas to market and so we incentivize the commercialization of research occurring across our country we want to attract and retain entrepreneurial and highly skilled workforce and this legislation again something unique to the startup act is that we create additional visa opportunities for individuals in the United States either because they are entrepreneurs that are willing to put raise the capital put capital investment at stake and employ additional people or they are receiving an a masters or PhD in science engineering the stem issue and again this legislation then creates visa opportunities for those two categories of individuals to remain in the United States if they meet the criteria provided in the legislation and in the process of doing so they create a highly educated trained workforce and aalto also an entrepreneurial talent in the United States and finally we try to create some competition among the states not by mandating States to take certain actions in regard to an environment to grow business and to create entrepreneurs but by saying that every state we will collect the information the Department of Commerce will report what each state is doing in regard to an entrepreneurial environment and therefore create the opportunity for entrepreneurs those who are looking at starting up a business to make a choice about where to locate again creating competition among states for the for the to try to attract that entrepreneurial talent and the skills that the legislation promotes lots of examples in our state of Kansas I would consider Kansas a very entrepreneurial state as I know senator Warner does in regard to Virginia but you can look at companies that began in the back back room in the in the garage and the basement of homes across our state across the country that resulted in thousands of jobs being created and certainly the statistics bear out and I know that Steve Case can very adequately describe the opportunities for job growth in this country because of entrepreneurs and historically that's been the key to American success and we want to revitalize that opportunity recreate what has worked for our country and its economy in the past and we believe the startup act is one more component along a series of pieces of legislation that have been introduced in the last few months that move Congress in a bipartisan way in a you know legislation that can be supported broadly to a better day for America and its people and their ability to put food on their family's table to grow and to pursue success in the process of pursuing that success once again live the American dream let me turn the podium over to my colleague and friend from Virginia senator Warner well thank you jerry Thank You senator Moran let me thank you for this partnership I think this is one more example of evidence that there are actually people on the hill can work together to put the country's interests first I won't reiterate everything senator Moran said I just want to make it hit a couple of high points one we always talk up here about the fact that we want us to support small businesses small businesses create two thirds of the jobs in our country if you dig down into that and I think Steve will probably mention this that's mostly true but most of the small businesses that are actually creating the jobs are what we call in the industry the Gazelle firms those startup firms that grow very rapidly and echoing what senator Moran said we need to find ways that we can boost that effort and as somebody who spent actually I can still claim more time on the private sector side actually doing this as an early stage investor entrepreneur and venture capitalist 20 years in that business only still single digits in the elected office business which these days I guess is important to point out you know I think this piece of legislation is a giant step forward and it does and as Senator Moran mentioned it builds on some other legislation that then I think Steve will mentioned this as well that builds upon the good work the Kauffman Foundation is done in Steve Case who's on the president's jobs Council has done you no issues around how we can get startup companies going public on a faster way changes to sarbanes-oxley section 404 that increasing the number of investors that can go into startup companies key points startup act builds on that prior legislation legislation that cinema ran and I both support in a couple of ways one it says how do we make sure and we're going to hear not only from the Kauffman Foundation Steve Case but we're going to hear from folks who are trying to live the American dream around this issue of immigration Steve mentioned earlier in our Mac in my office that we have to win the World competition for the best and brightest talent and taking stealing your line before you know I get a little bit for you so I'm going to steal it you afraid you forgot to steal at first you know for a long time anybody in the tech business has said let's staple a green card to people who are in getting graduate degrees from our great American universities who are in the STEM fields well this legislation puts together a program that basically would make that happen create a whole new visa program to retain that form born talent that if they're graduating with graduate degrees in the STEM fields from American universities choose to stay in work in America a couple program with that is an effort that says if you all happen to be already here on an h-1b or one other visa and you want to leave your current employment and actually go out and start a business and hire Americans that's virtually impossible to do so we create an entrepreneurs visa path where we can again have talent that's already here in this country already here legally in this country if they can start up a business invest in that business hire Americans put people the work of cinema and said we're going to give a path to make that happen SN a Miranda mentioned as well we go down the path in terms of regulatory reform how do we make sure that we do a better job both within executive agencies and independent agencies of doing cost-benefit analysis this builds upon current policy that's already there but it fills it out a little bit more how do we make sure that as as somebody who's been involved as a venture capitalist make sure that there are tax investment policies that reward patient capital you know back in the heydays of the IPO market back in the late 90s you'd see people money flow into these companies but then it would flow out very quickly people would be flipping how do we create tax treatment that will actually in sent investors to invest in start-up companies and actually keep that capital therefore for up to five years and then some Moran mentioned this in addition to the competition among states how do we get how do we take the research that's done in a lab and get it into the commercial sector particular transactional translational research how do we take a small not spend new research money take a small sliver of of dollars of existing research dollars and redirect that into the commercialization sector and you know some of the things this areas need some more work I believe but we there's a lot of talk about commercialization I think this effort put some resources behind that in the neighborhood 100 million dollars a year and also starts some stirring up 10-3 some competition amongst higher educational institutions we will get some blow box in LAN and I have realized and what we are doing in terms of shaking up some of the tech transfer offers in our universities but that kind of debate is needed if we're going to really win the World Wide talent for the best jobs and making sure that the greatest ideas that are created our universities actually translate into jobs so with that let me turn it over to my good friend and fellow virginian Steve Case it's great pleasure to be here and thank you senator Warner and Senator Moran for taking the leadership on this issue as I think everybody knows America is really built by entrepreneurs the story of America is the story of entrepreneurs if we didn't become the leading economy in the world just by accident fortune 500 companies don't just automatically become fortune 500 companies they started startups and eventually they grow and create a lot of jobs and economic growth so as a nation if we're going to focus on the economy and focus on jobs we've got to focus on entrepreneurship and that's what the startup act is designed to do to really put this on the center stage and build bipartisan support for pro entrepreneurship legislation that will make it easier for entrepreneurs to get company started easier for them to get the capital and talent to scale those companies at the right stage make it easier for them to go public is we Kauffman research indicates that ninety percent of jobs are created after companies go public so it's really important legislation and something that we need to move quickly to to adopt the good news around entrepreneurship is I'm trimmers are optimistic they see all kinds of opportunities in the world they want to kind of take take on those opportunities the bad news is the last five years it's become more difficult for entrepreneurs actually startups are down twenty-three percent if they had stay at the same level they were five years ago we have two million more jobs in our economy right now so this really is a key job creator the Kauffman data also suggest the last three decades high-growth companies company growing twenty percent a year so essentially means they're doubling every four years account for 40 million jobs really all the debt job creation so it really is around high-growth entrepreneurial companies and this legislation helps move the ball for it I give the president credit for getting the thing started in early this year he created to start America partnership Becky I'm heading over from from here the White House we have a board meeting of the startup America partnership of the president will be part of that will give them an update on the initiative there as well as some of the legislative momentum with the jobs council led by Jeff Immelt that I'm proud to be part of and chair this high-growth entrepreneurial subcommittee of it met with the president but six weeks ago laid out a framework terms of what the private sector you do what the administration need to do and also what Congress needed to do and I'm very encouraged in the last six weeks now there's three different bills have been introduced in the Senate one the agree act by senator coons a senator Rubio then last week Senator Schumer and Senator to me introduce something focus specifically on IPOs and now the startup back from Senator Warner and Senator Moran really take it to another level particularly by including the central issue around winning the global battle for talent we were it's crazy our immigration policy right now we understand the complexity of immigration the sensitivity of immigration but in particular we need to focus on making sure we are attracting the best and brightest not just to come to our educational institutions but then to stay here and start companies here as opposed essentially forcing the lead to start companies in other countries to compete with us so it's very important time for our nation everybody's focused on should be focused on jobs there's now growing focused in the last few months in terms of the central role entrepreneurs play this legislation that Senator Moran and Senator Warner have been working on for some time is terrific and really does move the ball forward by dealing with talent dealing with kapil dealing with regulation some of the core underpinnings but now it's time to get something done and it's really time for entrepreneurs all around the nation to kind of march on Washington and say it's time for the Congress to act it's time to build bipartisan support it's time to put entrepreneurs the front of the agenda because they are the job creators they are the innovators they are the folks that are going to help us win the next generation of battles in terms of new industries around around the world so I'm very grateful that they've taken the leadership on this issue it's now time for others in the Senate and then others in the house to join together I've had a lot of meetings a lot of people in the Senate and House Republicans and Democrats for the last couple of months and this is an issue where people agree something should happen and something should get done and now's the time to act thank you it's a great pleasure to be here on behalf of the Kauffman Foundation I just want to say a few words about some of the findings of Kauffman Foundation research relevant to this important set of issues research conducted or supported by the Kauffman Foundation over the past decade has done a great deal to clarify the absolutely central importance of entrepreneurship and new firm formation to the health of the US economy not only in terms of creating jobs and promoting short-term prosperity but also in terms of spurring innovation and long-term growth when it comes to job creation the numbers are absolutely unambiguous new firms are the main engine of job creation in the united states between 1977 and 2005 there were only seven years in which existing firms created more jobs than they destroyed so the bottom line is simple without startups there is no net job creation in this country when it comes to innovation Kauffman supported research has found that the productivity of firms that exit the market is generally lower which is a good thing than firms that stay existing firms in the market which in turn is lower than surviving new firms so that over the churn the dynamic churna firms in the economy and particularly the entry of new firms is the lifeblood that brings new ideas and better ways of doing things into the economy raising productivity and ultimately living standards the bad news is as we've heard already that all is not well with entrepreneurship in the United States new firm starts are down and this started before the Great Recession Kauffman research shows that that new employer businesses started falling the number of new employer businesses started falling after 2006 it's falling twenty-seven percent between 2006 and 2009 looking even longer term Kauffman supported research shows a long-term decline in the level of job creation by startups back in the 1980s total gross job creation by startups amounted to three and a half percent of total employment on average by the 90s that had fallen to three percent in the past decade it's down to two point six percent so the timing of these numbers of declining startup activity show that our problems with our economy aren't just cyclic will today their structural and structural problems need structural solutions in particular it is vitally important to identify all those regulatory and other policy barriers that inhibit entrepreneurs from starting new businesses bringing new ideas into our lives and systematically dismantling them and nothing less than the long-term health and vitality the US economy depends on how successful we are in that effort thank you very much we also wanted to bring forward we often talk about this question of how we retain and win the the global challenge for the best talent and we've got a couple who would exemplify some of the opportunities I think that will come out of some of our immigration reforms Thank You senators uh hi I'm neelima ready and I mashaallah here we are here on behalf of immigration voice which is the national grassroots organization representing high-skilled workers like us who have come together to advocate for change in the current legal immigration process We are fortunate to have received the opportunities and the education provided to us by this great nation and a privilege to be part of the US workforce as well as a local communities I have a master's in quantitative finance and part of the financial services in this tree and believe I have much to contribute and have the skills and experience to be part of the solution in this challenging financial environment however the current legal immigration system does not allow us to give back and contribute to the economy to our full potential meaningless country limits job mobility restrictions and cumbersome procedures create long wait times in most cases decades an uncertainty for thousands of people with advanced degrees who are raring to contribute more to this to their fields and the American economy it puts an enormous strain on our careers as well as a personal lives hampers professional advancement and prevents us from making long-term financial commitment commitments such as buying a house this bill ensures that advanced degree holders in STEM fields like myself can fully participate in the economy by allowing job mobility and creating incentives for innovation I have been in the US for nine years and I'm still waiting for my permanent residency I have a bachelors in computer science and masters in digital media and I'm part of and thriving and exciting technology industry helping to create the next generation media and commerce applications over the course of my career I was part of three startups but was unable to continue working on them because of restrictions placed by my current visa situation on multiple occasions I've had to make the difficult choice of fulfilling my dreams are living in the country i love this bill would mean that I would not have to make the choice anymore but would be able to be an entrepreneur right here let's create the next Google the next Facebook the next a well right here in Kansas in Virginia in the US nilam and I would like to thank Senator Warren and Senator Moran on behalf of emigration voice in high-skilled immigrants all over the country for introducing the bell and that leadership and legal immigration this bill would not only enable us to contribute effectively to the economy and our communities but will also create new jobs and allow America to retain the best and brightest of the world and increase its competitiveness in an increasingly flat well thank you and we'll take a couple questions I have to scoot out with you there is one more budget to bipartisan bicameral sessions no question there is still hope I questions comment suggestions must start with that cuz you I only would say that I have an appointment when I leave here with Senator Reid one of the topics of conversation is trying to indicate him how valuable this is to all of us and that Senator Warner and I are committed to finding that path not many things around here seem to survive as a free-standing bill so history and predictability would suggest that it becomes a part of something but we certainly want as many components and we're certainly open to other ideas as this process goes we're working with our colleagues and I would just echo that this might be that rare sweet spot and the ideas are coming out from the Kauffman Foundation they're coming from the president's jobs Council everybody agrees that this is an area these high-growth startup firms ought to get support this might actually happen and we're going to work to make it at when the President's Council started last year some of your father's shop just your words based bill well I only would reiterate that there's too many shots taken at too many people around here too often and often circumstances trying to create a political environment that diminishes the chances of somebody success we very much want the Obama administration and the republican-controlled House the Democrat majority in the Senate one is to all to come together and have success not for a political party not for a Republican or Democrat victory but for an improved circumstance for the lives of American people and we're we started with the Kauffman Foundation obviously an academic think-tank not partisan in any way and learned that the things that we were proposing were supported by many of the things that we were proposing in this legislation are supported by the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness that's just an example of where if you don't start out looking for a fight you can find common ground and we're delighted to find that common ground and obviously any piece of legislation that passes Congress any of the proposals that are included in this that currently are in this legislation that including some other piece of legislation is going to take a president's signature I just add you know retaining the best talent in the world helping startup companies get through the regulatory process and get access to capital trying to keep create competition between states and universities in terms of getting good ideas from the lab into the marketplace you know I ask you is that are those Democratic Republican ideas I think there are American ideas I could if I just add the obviously any time there's a new thing like a council introduced there's going to be some skepticism Eve among the participants about what's really going to happen here and i think my from my perspective think my colleagues in the jobs council we weren't particularly interested in spending a lot of time writing nice white papers it sit on the show we think the nation is at a crossroads and getting the right policy in place to support business generally but particularly entrepreneurship in particular is critically port thing we have a plan B as a nation this as I said at the beginning this nation was built by entrepreneurs that drives innovation that drives job growth that drives our economy ensures our global competitiveness will really need to double down on on entrepreneurship so the jobs council made some recommendations or a lot other recommendation from Kauffman Foundation and other groups and I think senator Warner and center Moran took I think the best of those ideas to create the startup act I think it's very important that people focused on this and and and get it done we as I said the nation doesn't have a plan B thank you very much for those of you who write about business and entrepreneurship I commend to you the Kauffman Foundation and their research you ought to explore what they have done it's and mr. Kaufman is an example of the entrepreneurial spirit and success that we'd love to replicate started a drug company in his garage and ultimately came became in a Kansas City world he was the owner of the Royals which became his greatest fame to us but created many jobs in the process of starting a drug company and we very much appreciate their role in exploring educating us and providing us with with basic information that's necessary to determine good policy so thank you very much we're delighted that you were here thank you very much thank you thanks to you very much

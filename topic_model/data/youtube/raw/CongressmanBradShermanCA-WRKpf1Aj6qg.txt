line four Democrats has been very clear for for several months and that is no tax cuts for the rich for the democratic perspective congressman brad Sherman of California joins us now in a fox business exclusive hey congratulations to the Dodgers will win you back Liz stop rooting for the Indians I like the underdogs congressman all right speaking of underdogs you and the Democratic Party have said the underdogs are the middle and and less wealthy classes they should be the ones to get the tax cuts and that there should be no tax cuts for the rich that was the redline now that you see that Paul Ryan is stating it today President Trump has stated it that there may be that fourth tax bracket of hi-hi rich people and that they would be subject to more taxes here are you ready to at least consider going to the table on a tax reform plan no the opposition to this tax bill will be bipartisan whether any Democrat will support it I don't know because it's going to cut Trump's family taxes by over a billion dollars just by eliminating the estate tax and it slashes the tax rate on Exxon from 35% down to 20% almost a 50% reduction you slash Exxon's taxes you slash taxes for multi billionaire families it's hard to sell that it appears going to slash taxes except if they eliminated the estate tax but which which really does affect a very small percentage of families when they are hit with it but nonetheless there are some that would have to give up their people always use the farmer situation but trust me there are a lot more than farmers who get hit with the estate tax and they are smaller businesses but I don't I don't understand once they are faced with this fourth bracket that would tax the very high rich or put them in a higher tax bracket why you would then still say that you won't go to the table I will go to the table but a trillion and a half dollar increase in our budget deficit slashing taxes for giant corporations eliminating estate taxes for the Trump family and for other families the and most of that money comes in from families worth more than a hundred million dollars from one family that that's hardly a starter for Democrats well what could they add as a sweetener to it that would get you to change your very strong opinion here I'd like to see immediate American taxes of the money earned by American corporations abroad if we did that consistently then we wouldn't have all these factories moving overseas and finally we'd get the kind of labor shortage that we need in America to push up wages well the president Trump has really wanted and tried to lure companies back by lowering the tax rate so that they didn't flee to low tax countries he's going to a zero tax for what they make overseas so right now we have a 30 compromised I mean that that meant there may be some wiggle room there to at least make them pay something we would like to see that in on a continuing basis he has a an immediate small tax on the profits they've earned overseas but then he goes to zero for whatever they do in the future so if you're planning for the future yes you'll pay a little bit lower tax on a factory in the United States but you'll pay zero a massive reduction from thirty five percent down to zero for the factory you build overseas that is an attack on everyone who was fooled into voting for Donald Trump oh boy that's a no but wait listen we can only hope that we do see some relief for the middle class it's good to see a congressman thank you so much and I will be voting for the Dodgers can't be voting for the same team and you don't vote for a team Liz I know that you Ruth thanks congressman good to be with you closing bell ringing

now it's a pleasure for me to ask my friend from Fresno California representative Jim Costa to share some thoughts on the life of john mccain mr. Costa serves on the Agriculture and Natural Resources Committee were grateful for him being with us tonight well I thank the gentleman from Arkansas and congressman Hill for giving me this opportunity to pay my tribute to Senator John McCain clearly an American Hero his love and patriotism for our country knew no bounds I first met Senator McCain in 2006 when we were on a congressional trip to Antarctica we spent six days together exploring the science and the efforts that were going on with NASA and with our Defense Department and American universities that were doing valuable research and I got to witness firsthand his self-deprecating sense of humor he like he did with many members and and people who he came into contact with gave me counsel he said to me I remember during those days were supposed he said hey kid if you really want to learn how to do this right well first of all I like the fact that he called me kid but that you oughta listen carefully too many people around here don't spend enough time listening and for me as so many other members and people both professionally that Senator McCain came into contact with his role model his role model on how we should conduct ourselves not only as representatives but also as people that want to solve problems he clearly I think set the bar quite high on how we develop bipartisan compromises I gave a speech here last year about what has happened to the art of the political compromise has become a lost art well Senator John McCain had fine-tuned his skills his efforts to reach across the aisle to figure out ways in which you could bring people together to find that art of the political compromise and so his greatness really is one that reflects the true values of Americans for all of us I think he instilled upon the nature of as we know in our country historically there's the politics of hope and there's the politics of hate and many individuals have been successful at practicing both types of politics in their careers Senator McCain was success was the politics of hope the politics of love love of country love of his fellow Americans and it carried him through the trials and and and and difficulties that life brings ones away both as his service to this country in the United States Navy as a prisoner of war when he had the opportunity because of his status to leave the Hanoi Hilton early he made it very clear he would not until every American prisoner of war left and suffered great torture as a result of that and the lessons and life that Senator John McCain learned were lessons that he tried to teach to all of us in his conduct as a public servant in which he put public service among the highest levels of contribution that one can make to their country and so not only was he a role model for all of us for Americans but throughout the world when we traveled in the middle week in Europe my congressman colleague Mario diaz-balart and I who worked closely with our European colleagues John McCain was sought after for advice for understanding of what the body politics was happening in America and how we could better work together with our European allies in the values that we hold most dear the values of human rights the values of freedom of speech the values of ensuring that we protect our democratic institutions Senator John McCain really reflected the best that America has to offer which is why he was so well respected around the world and when you went to countries in which you had autocrats and dictators and you had issues of human rights he was always sought after by those that were oppressed because there was clearly a sense of empathy that they understood that he had to them so as I closed let me say that the tributes that we paid to him are small in comparison to what he gave to our country the book that President John F Kennedy wrote profiles encourage if there were to be a a second book in the 21st century clearly Senator John McCain would be one of those individuals that throughout his career exemplified what it means to have profiles and courage in his conduct in his daily life in the practice of the politics that he led by through example which are lessons for all of us to learn Senator John McCain a grateful nation can never ever say thank you enough for all that you did and all that you gave god bless you I yield back the balance of my time

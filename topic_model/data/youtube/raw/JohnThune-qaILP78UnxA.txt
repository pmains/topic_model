joining us now Republican South Dakota Senator and minority whip John thune welcome Senator what do you expect to hear from President Biden tonight or not here well I think he's going to try and create his own version of reality where his policies have led to this Renaissance in America but as you guys just pointed out that's not what the American people are experiencing and you look at the disaster at the southern border you look at rampant inflation you look at the fact that we've gone from energy dominance to energy Reliance you look at what's happening with respect to the the National Security around the world and the dangerous world that we live in and the way that we're viewed by the world when it comes to America's national security posture I think there's he's got a lot of problems a lot of explaining to do but I'm sure he'll try and gloss over all that and talk about how great things are because that's what presidents do at states of the union and in this case at least I think he's got his work it out for him because the American people are not feeling um as you point out from the polls that are that all of them out there and you hear it anecdotally too they aren't experiencing that you know Senator I got to sit in the in the chamber with you for a number of years and listen the State of the Union night is great it's a lot of fun no matter what president's there and we all watch you know whether you're in the chamber or you're watching on TV people stand up and and sit down and I'm interested if Joe Biden goes through this probably probably Litany of lies of his successes which the American people know are false do you think Democrats are going to stand up and applaud the lie that he's going to make from the from the Rostrum well as you point out Sean you've been you've been in that chamber many times from many speeches and um I I think he's going to create an alternative uh reality and I do think Democrats are going to stand up and applaud I mean this is sort of the ramp up they say to his announcement for his re-election bid and I think he's got to try and paint the rosiest possible picture he can and I think the echo chamber there will probably you know respond favorably to that but again it's going to be a complete odds with what the experience of the American people is who have had to deal with and live with these policies and in runaway inflation which is you know food is 18.6 percent higher today than it was when President Biden took office and that's where most people experience these things is in their pocketbook and the reason that they they have turned a thumbs down on his performance is because they they certainly aren't seeing um the any positive impact from his policies in fact the opposite is true Senator why did you vote though for that Omnibus spending bill because again they took the power out of the hands of house Speaker Kevin McCarthy to really negotiate a spending package moving into the new year and certainly Senator Richard Shelby walked back to Alabama with 660 million dollars in pork well I mean I think any of those spending bills end up that way that's why the process is broken and needs to be fixed again it's a it's a it's a process that literally lends itself to that and it's true when you do appropriation bills individually but it's even more so when you pile them up and try and do them at the end of the year I think we try to clear the clean the you know clear the Slate clear the deck so to speak for the House Republicans because they're going to be dealing with the next budget year and we also know as a matter of experience that when it comes to National Security continuing resolution is a really bad idea I mean for a lot of us that was a national security vote we did get defense funded at 10 percent increase over the previous year and what we're facing in the world today in terms of threats that was really important to a lot of Senate Republicans and his request the Biden's requests on the non-defense side was you know 14 he got five and a half granted more than he should have but any any deal was going to be struck in a divided government with Democrats and Republicans so I but I think it comes down really for a lot of Republicans who voted for it it was a national security vote you know senator tonight Sarah Huckabee Sanders is going to give the GOP a response um good for her what can we expect to hear from Sarah Huckabee Sanders well Sean I mean you know we all know her know her well from her her time here uh serving in the Trump Administration and I knew her way back when uh when I was campaigning in Arkansas with John Bozeman and she was running his campaigns she's somebody I think to in at least Republican circles is well known but she's known as a a tough articulate spokesperson who you know grounds her views in policy and principles and those principles I think reflect what not only Republicans around the country feel but a lot of a majority of Americans I mean I think she's going to talk about limited but Effective Government personal freedom coupled with individual responsibility I think she'll talk about economic freedom free markets uh and and that sort of thing and I think she'll you know touch on things that she's going to be doing in the state of Arkansas which I think will probably as time will tell will be a good model for other states around the country to follow Senator then say Sean was bragging about getting to go to the State of the Union and being in the Capitol rotunda if I ever got invited I wouldn't be able to go I assumed they would make you wear shoes do you think that's disqualifying thank you Senator all right sounds good yeah so I'm sure they let some people in there with no brain so um yeah Point well made yeah good to be with you guys enjoy watching it enjoy the night good to see you

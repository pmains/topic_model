you can chalk up yet another victory for progressive democrats here's why the bite administration extending its ban on evictions for many renters and they'll do it through an order of the cdc this is happening after the white house said its hands were tied by a recent supreme court ruling that came at the end of june they lost that ruling here we are in august and they're going back to it regardless republican senator john kennedy louisiana member of the judiciary committee sir good day to you got a few questions for you your colleague tom cotton tweeted biden even admits it's unconstitutional and he concludes with the word lawless what's going on in that town well i think it is unconstitutional that's never stopped the permanent washington types from doing something but i do think it's unconstitutional and i think it's unwise i don't i don't want anybody to to have to to lose their home but look it's time that we rejoin the world and uh we have spent uh we meaning the congress about 4.7 trillion dollars uh helping the american people recover from the coronavirus our economy is clearly recovering in my state we sent louisiana 550 million dollars to help people with rental assistance we've only spent 50 so that tells me there's not a big need there okay um among your colleagues then what what do they tell you about the nash natural forces of capitalism you know you you can look to some of these states right now in nebraska unemployment's two and a half percent that's awesome and utah it's 2.7 percent in new hampshire and south dakota it's 2.9 percent and idaho is 3 so your point about the economy recovering is very well taken but at what point do we take our foot off the gas well we're there we've had a v-shaped recovery uh we have uh we're now uh generating a a gdp that uh is is uh slightly greater than it was before the pandemic started we have what 10 million jobs uh openings that we can't fill uh we set a record last quarter we'll probably set a record this quarter uh our economy is is is uh is back and it's time that now we still we still have the virus with us which we can talk about but it's time to uh to rejoin our lives and we can't give free rent to everybody if you want free rent there's nothing free bill everything free somebody had to work for well that's this is like free rent to infinity i pulled those unemployment numbers for the wall street journal for you seize the headline eviction ban has to end sometime kind of the point you're making there tenants and landlords have to work it out and better now than later but back to the point the supreme court said he can't do this after july well it's august now should the supreme court have an emergency ruling and come back and say that's against the law yes and i suspect somebody will file suit and try to get in front of the supreme court now whether the supreme court will take the case or not i don't know but but let me say it again with with permanent washington types who run this place and under this administration make most of the decisions the constitution is just a nuisance you mentioned covet here is your state where it ranks you're in the bottom five of vaccinations louisiana checks in at 37.1 percent behind you alabama mississippi arkansas and wyoming what's happening back there that you think the country needs to understand as to why people are hesitant well this is america we're all entitled to our opinion here's mine number one the vaccine works the mrna message tech messenger technology works it's the single greatest achievement of the trump administration i have i believe in it i've taken two shots and if i if they came to me and said in order to get a booster you got to take a shot in the eyeball i'd do it why because i don't want to die and this stuff is like playing russian athletic can kill you number two if you want to wear a mask in my opinion you should if you don't you shouldn't uh it's the mask issue is not nearly as important as trying to get people seriously think about taking the vaccine number three uh we're in a fourth wave the single biggest thing that has undermined our efforts to make of the american people understand we're in the fourth wave is president obama's decision to hold a birthday bash with 400 people now i've never seen something so irresponsible he knows better he needs to cancel it and have a a beer and a personal pan pizza at home with his wife

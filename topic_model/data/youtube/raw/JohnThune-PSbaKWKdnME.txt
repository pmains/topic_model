Mr President yesterday afternoon Richard Shelby delivered his Farewell Address here in the United States Senate it's difficult to think of the Senate without some of our retiring memories or I should say retiring members it's nearly impossible to think of it without Richard Shelby like Jim inhofe he's a senate Institution he's proudly served the state of Alabama for six terms in the Senate that's 36 years of tireless work to make life better for the people of Alabama and for the American people as a whole he's currently the longest serving Senator in Alabama's history as well as the longest serving member in history of the senate committee on banking Housing and Urban affairs Mr President throughout his Senate career Richard has always kept his eye on getting things done for the people of Alabama whether that's supporting Alabama military installations or the work NASA does in his state he's a long time NASA Advocate and as chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee on defense at the Senate Appropriations Committee he has worked to ensure robust funding for our national security priorities he's also been a champion of funding to support Ukraine in his fight for freedom he's been a supporter of scientific research at various government agencies as well as in partnership with research universities Mr President Richard is also notable for being one of the tallest United States senators and that's significant to me because as a tall guy myself I don't often run into people I can look up to if I look up to Richard both literally and figuratively Richard's record of service and his dedication to people of state are an inspiration to me and to many others as we carry out our work here in the United States Senate and I will miss his presence and his example as well as his sense of humor which has lightened the mood around here on many challenging days but if anyone has earned his retirement it is Richard Shelby and I wish him and Annette his wife of 62 years some very well-deserved relaxation and the very best of everything in the years ahead Mr President later today senator Pat Toomey my longtime colleague on the Senate finance committee will deliver his Farewell remarks Pat is known for among other things his steadfast commitment to Pearl Market policies to fiscal responsibility pro-growth tax policy free trade limited but efficient regulation and above all for his command of these issues he has a tremendous grasp of Finance banking and the economy and an equally tremendous understanding of what the ins and outs of the tax code mean for business saving and investment and Entrepreneurship and is able to break down these oftentimes Byzantine subjects and explain them in plain language that round around here Mr President is a gift these attributes made Happy indispensable man during tax reform five years ago his expertise and commitment were key to passage of the tax cuts and jobs act the wide-ranging reform of our tax code that put more money in American families pockets and made American businesses more competitive Beyond tax policy Pat has consistently fought protectionism in its many forms he's pushed back on financial Market regulations that restrict Fair competition and is fiercely advocated for Market opening initiatives that benefit Pennsylvania families workers and businesses he's going to be missed in the Senate in on the Senate finance committee in particular for his knowledge and his experience or and for his practical approach to getting things done for the American people Mr President I admire Pat for his economic expertise but I especially admire him for his thoughtfulness his decency and the fact that he is very principled he stayed committed to the causes he believes in from improving Economic Opportunity for American families to reducing government waste to protecting taxpayer dollars and while I don't know what he will do next I am confident that whatever he does will continue his commitment to building an economy that works for the American people Mr President I want to wish Pat and his wife Chris the very best on his retirement I hope they're able to enjoy some well-deserved rest in the coming months and I look forward to seeing all that Pat will do in the future Mr President I yield the floor I suggest the absence of quorum

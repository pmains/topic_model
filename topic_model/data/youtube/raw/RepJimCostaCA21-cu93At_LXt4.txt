mr. speaker I'd also like to discuss the importance of wildfire awareness no state knows more about how important the subject is than in California there is no longer a fire season in California it suffers from fires sadly year around resulting in many factors including climate change just last year California solved the deadliest wildfire in its history the town of Paradise was decimated with more than 14,000 homes which were destroyed in 85 people lost their lives god bless them and their families there have been other fires in Santa Barbara Mendocino Yosemite rim fire right in my own district's backyard we need to do more for the first time in 110 year history of the Forest Service they say they will now dedicate more than half their budget to wildfire suppression efforts which we have directed as a result of the farm bill last year to begin with this requires better managing and caring for our forests this week we will vote on an emergency supplemental to help communities affected by wildfires I ask my colleagues to vote with me and pass this important legislation let's do the right thing and help our fellow Americans rebuild their lives and their communities at the same time let's be more responsible stewards to our forests we know how to do it let's get started with our state's local governments and the private sector future generations deserve better management of forests throughout our country I think we can do it if we work together thank you and I yield back the balance of my time gentleman yields back his time

ADVISER STEVE BANNON. HE'S BEING TRIED FOR DEFYING HIS OWN SUBPOENA FROM THE  INVESTIGATION. JOINING US NOW IS DEMOCRATIC  CONGRESSMAN ADAM SCHIFF, HE'S A  MEMBER OF THE JANUARY 6th  COMMITTEE. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US  TONIGHT. >> GOOD TO BE WITH YOU.  >> LET ME START BY ASKING YOU  FIRST ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THIS SUBPOENA TO THE SECRET  SERVICE. A LOT OF THIS DRAMA UNFOLDED  LATE LAST WEEK, INCLUDING THE  INSPECTOR GENERAL AND THE  BELIEVING OF WHAT MAY HAVE  HAPPENED WITH THE SECRET SERVICE WHEN THEY FACED A REQUEST FOR  INFORMATION FROM THEIR  DEPARTMENT RELATED TO JANUARY  5th AND 6th. WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THE  STATUS OF THIS CONFLICT WITH THE SECRET SERVICE AND WHAT YOU'RE  EXPECTING TO GET IN RESPONSE TO  THAT SUBPOENA.  >> MY UNDERSTANDING AT PRESENT,  AND THIS IS STILL VERY MUCH AN  ONGOING INVESTIGATION, IS THAT  SOME OF THESE TEXT MESSAGES WERE EITHER LOST OR DESTROYED. WHETHER THEY WERE LOST OR  DESTROYED BECAUSE OF NEGLIGENCE  OR WILLFULLY, WE HAVE YET TO  DETERMINE. BUT THERE'S A VERY STRONG  CONFLICT BETWEEN WHAT WE'RE  HEARING FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF  HOMELAND SECURITY AND WHAT THE  SECRET SERVICE IS TELLING THE  PUBLIC. I HAVE TO SAY THAT STATEMENT WE  SAW FROM THE SECRET SERVICE THAT BASICALLY THERE WERE MESSAGES  LOST BUT NONE OF THEM PERTAIN TO WHAT WE'RE INVESTIGATING, I  DON'T KNOW HOW THEY'RE LOST. SOMETHING DOESN'T SEEM QUITE  RIGHT, AND WE HOPE TO FIND OUT  AS SOON AS TOMORROW WHAT HAS  BEEN PRESERVED, WHAT WAS LOST,  AND BEGIN TO FIND OUT SOME OF  THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THOSE MESSAGES MAY HAVE BEEN  DISCARDED.  >> WE'RE GETTING A LITTLE MORE  INFORMATION TONIGHT ABOUT WHAT  TO EXPECT ON THURSDAY. OBVIOUSLY IT'S A DECISION OF  SOME CONSEQUENCE IN IT'S OWN  RIGHT THAT THE HEARING ON  THURSDAY WILL BE IN PRIME TIME. YOU CAN EXPECT A LARGER AUDIENCE FOR THAT. AND I THINK LARGER EXPECTATIONS  TO GO ALONG WITH THAT. WE ALSO HAVE BEEN TOLD TO EXPECT A COUPLE OF -- AT LEAST IT'S  BEEN REPORTED, A COUPLE OF LIVE  WITNESSES WHO WERE BOTH INSIDE  THE TRUMP WHITE HOUSE AT FAIRLY  HIGH-LEVEL POSITIONS LEADING UP  TO AND THROUGH DAYS AROUND  JANUARY 6th. WHAT SHOULD WE UNDERSTAND IN  TERMS OF HOW CLOSE TO THE END  YOU ARE? WE KEEP HEARING FROM YOU AND  OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE  THAT THERE'S STILL MORE TO FIND  OUT, THERE'S STILL MORE TO GET  TO THE BOTTOM OF, THAT THE  INVESTIGATION HAS TURNED UP A  LOT OF STUFF, ACTUALLY, IN  RECENT DAYS SINCE THE HEARINGS  HAVE BEEN IN PUBLIC. AT THE SAME TIME, IT DOES SEEM  LIKE THIS IS GOING TO BE THE  LAST PUBLIC HEARING FOR QUITE  SOME TIME.  >> YOU KNOW, I THINK AT THE  BEGINNING OF THIS PROCESS WHEN  WE WERE SCHEDULING AND SKETCHING OUT THE HEARINGS, WE DID  CONCEIVE OF THIS AS PROBABLY THE END OF THIS FIRST SET OF  HEARINGS, EVEN WHILE WE WERE  CONSIDERING ANOTHER SET OF  HEARINGS IN THE FALL THAT WAS  FOCUSED ON RECOMMENDATIONS FOR  PROTECTING DEMOCRACY GOING  FORWARD. BUT AS WE'VE ADDED HEARINGS LIKE WE DID WITH CASSIDY HUTCHINSON,  WE REALIZED WITNESSES CONTINUE  TO COME FORWARD, AND WE MAY VERY WELL BE ADDING OTHER HEARINGS TO ACCOMMODATE NEW EVIDENCE AND  TESTIMONY. YOU KNOW, WE HAVEN'T MADE FIRM  CONCLUSIONS ABOUT THAT. WE WANT TO GIVE OURSELVES THE  FREEDOM AND FLEXIBILITY TO  PRESENT TO THE PUBLIC WHATEVER  WE FEEL THE PUBLIC REALLY NEEDS  TO KNOW. I THINK IN THE NEXT HEARING YOU  WILL HEAR ACCOMMODATION OF LIVE  TESTIMONY. YOU'LL HEAR PART OF VIDEO  TESTIMONY THAT YOU HAVEN'T SEEN  BEFORE. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, WE WILL  TRY TO WEAVE IT TOGETHER SO  PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED  IN THAT PERIOD OF TIME WHEN  DONALD TRUMP SAT IN THE WHITE  HOUSE AND WATCHED THE CAPITOL  BEING ATTACKED. >> IN TERMS OF THAT TIME LINE,  ONE OF THE REASONS THAT I'M  THINKING ANEW ABOUT THE OVERALL  TIME LINE OF YOUR INVESTIGATION  IS THIS MEMO WE JUST OBTAINED  FROM ATTORNEY GENERAL MERRICK  GARLAND. IT'S AN ALL-EMPLOYEES MEMO FROM  THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO EVERYONE AT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT  REMINDING THEM ABOUT ELECTION  YEAR SENSITIVITIES, REITERATING  THE KIND OF ADVICE WE'VE SEEN  FROM PREVIOUS ATTORNEYS GENERAL  ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT NOT TAKING  ANY STEPS IN ELECTION SEASON  THAT MIGHT LOOK LIKE THEY WERE  DESIGNED TO EFFECTUATE SOME  DISADVANTAGE SOME CANDIDATE OR  POLITICAL PARTY. HE GOES A STEP FURTHER AND SAYS  THAT ATTORNEY GENERAL BILL  BARR'S ADVICE FROM FEBRUARY 2020 IS STILL IN EFFECT AND IS STILL  JUSTICE DEPARTMENT POLICY. IN THAT NEW GUIDANCE FROM BILL  BARR AS OF FEBRUARY 2020 SAID  ANY INVESTIGATION INVOLVING A  DECLARED CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT HAD TO BE PERSONALLY CLEARED  THROUGH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IN  WRITING. A DECLARED CANDIDATE FOR  PRESIDENT OR ANYBODY WORKING AT  A SENIOR LEVEL FOR SOMEBODY IN  THAT POSITION. WITH DONALD TRUMP NOW OPENLY  SORT OF MULLING THE PROSPECT OF  DECLARING HIMSELF ONCE AGAIN TO  BE A CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT, I  WONDER IF YOU AND YOUR  COLLEAGUES ON THE COMMITTEE FEEL PRESSURE AT ALL IN TERMS OF THE  TIME TICKING, THE JUSTICE  DEPARTMENT BY POLICY IS A LITTLE MORE RETICENT AND PUTS MORE  HURDLES IN THE WAY OF PUTTING  ANY FEDERAL PROSECUTION OR  OPENING FEDERAL INVESTIGATIONS  OF PEOPLE WHO ARE DECLARED  CANDIDATES. WE'RE GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER  TO THAT EACH DAY WITH TRUMP. DOES THAT AFFECT YOUR THINKING  OF THE TIMING HERE? >> WE ARE MOVING ON AS  EXPEDITIOUSLY AS WE CAN, SO I  DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH IT WILL  AFFECT YOUR OWN TIMING, BUT IT  DOES, I THINK, RAISE THE  QUESTION OF WHY THE JUSTICE  DEPARTMENT WAS SO SLOW TO PURSUE THESE OTHER LINES OF EFFORT TO  OVERTURN THE ELECTION. THEY DID SEEM TO PROCEED WITH  ALACRITY WITH THOSE BREAKING  INTO THE CAPITOL, BUT WITH  RESPECT TO ALL THESE PRESSURES  WITH THE FAKE ELECTOR PLOT, ANY  NUMBER OF OTHER EFFORTS WHICH  MANY, LIKE JUDGE CARTER IN  CALIFORNIA BELIEVED VIOLATED THE LAW, WHY IT APPEARS ONLY NOW  THAT IS GIVEN A SENSE OF  URGENCY, I WILL SAY THIS TO ADD  ONTO WHAT ANDREW WEISSMAN WAS  SAYING. IT IS A BIT RICH TO BE CITING  BILL BARR FOR ANYTHING THAT HAS  TO DO WITH THE INDEPENDENCE OF  THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT  CONSIDERING HOW BADLY HE  DISRUPTED THE INDEPENDENCE OF  THAT OFFICE. YES, WE'RE GLAD BILL BARR  FINALLY FOUND A LINE HE WOULDN'T CROSS, BUT HE CROSSED A LOT OF  LINES BEFORE HE GOT THERE. AND I AGREE, THAT'S NOT THE  PRECEDENT I WOULD CITE. FINALLY, RACHEL, I AGREE WITH  THE ASSESSMENT, WHETHER IT'S  BASED ON THIS MEMO OR OTHERWISE, THAT DONALD TRUMP BELIEVES,  AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IS LUCRATIVE, BUT  IT ALSO MAY HELP HIM STAY ONE  STEP AHEAD OF JAIL. >> YEAH. AND WHATEVER THE OBSCURE  DERIVATIONS OF THE JUSTICE  DEPARTMENT DECISION TO NOT BRING PROSECUTIONS AGAINST PEOPLE WHO  ARE SERVING AS PRESIDENT OF THE  UNITED STATES, WHATEVER THE  DERIVATIONS ARE OF THAT POLICY,  FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP FEELS  VERY, VERY, VERY AWARE OF IT AND SEEMS TO BE FACTORING IT INTO  HIS FUTURE POLITICAL PLANS IN  THE MIDST OFOUR INVESTIGATION.

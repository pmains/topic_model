the focus of today's hearing i'll remind us all again is the role that immigrants play in the healthcare workforce crisis in the united states of america today and so we're going to begin with our questions um and uh i'll begin with this the one thing we hear often from immigrant health care professionals is that they are restricted in where they can practice medicine due to their uh status and because these professionals are often tied to a specific employer it is difficult for them to either move within the united states for better opportunities or to serve areas that might be in more need of their expertise or their services to move to other healthcare facilities in emergencies like the covet 19 pandemic dr allure in your testimony you mentioned that your non-immigrant status as an h1b visa holder prevented you from being able to go to places like new york during the height of the pandemic where there was an extreme shortage of doctors can you explain the limitations that come along with your status and how updating our immigration laws would improve the nation's public health chairman padilla it's a very important question when the pandemic took over the country it did it in waves new york was literally burning with the pandemic and southern illinois was relatively better protected we could have stepped up and attended to the call the governor of new york was asking retired physicians to come back into the workforce the students to graduate early we could not do it because it is a violation of our work permit to work anywhere else other than what is specified going to the endemic problem of physician shortage we have services that are not available in an area and you bring a doctor to one employer if he's not restricted he could go to multiple hospitals and help those hospitals during with the shortage for example in our neighborhood when the pandemic hit us our neighboring hospitals were losing physicians to quarantine there was a lot of attrition because a lot of senior physicians did not continue to work and how would it help um united states uh public health primary care is a huge area of shortage all across the country and again if a physician who has been in that country for in that community for years is still restricted to one employer he's limited um he could probably go uh 50 miles across his town and do a satellite clinic maybe one day a week that would help the community there um a lot of physicians in my community who were immigrants who did their waiver commitments stayed there and after they got their green cards they've opened practices all across and uh improving the primary care that way will address the public health thank you thank you doctor uh miss peterson i know that you're well aware that the us has designated 8069 health professional shortage areas across the country for primary care there's a map behind me that illustrates this this has resulted in 97 million people who live in the united states in an area that has a shortage of primary care providers in my home state of california alone there are 643 health professional shortage areas for primary care affecting over 7 million californians i'm sure many of my colleagues here are also represent states with significant health care workforce shortages if you look at the map consider that every shade of green on this map represents a shortage area miss peterson in your testimony you recognize that these workforce shortages are due in large part to our increasing and aging population our seniors our aging healthcare workforce and the stress imposed on healthcare workers around the country by the kobit 19 pandemic so drawing on your experiences can you explain how immigrant physicians have stepped up to fill these gaps in these underserved areas and how they are part of the solution to end our health care workforce shortage emergency thank you chair padilla annually over a thousand international doctors go to underserved areas and fill this need but just on the members of the committee today over two-thirds of your state used all of the conrad j-1 waiver numbers last year and if we gave states the ability to grant these j-1 waivers based on their needs california you know all of the other states texas that would permit doctors like dr allure to go to underserved areas and be rewarded and recognized for their work and to ensure that that americans were receiving the health care that they need by opening it up and giving states the ability to really um give these waivers and the conrad reauthorization act does just that thank you senator cornyn

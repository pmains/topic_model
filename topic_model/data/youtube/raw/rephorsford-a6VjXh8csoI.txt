welcome back to politics nation the midterm elections are now just 80 days away and in nevada's fourth congressional district one that is historically blue and only flipping red one time in its 12-year history pollsters are now calling it a toss-up election that is in part due to republican nominee sam peter's support from former president trump and his allies incumbent democrat stephen hartsford is vying for a third term come this november he joins me now first of all congressman thanks for being with us thank you reverend always good to be on your show now congressman horsford uh your opponent sam peters has received a nod from trump as well as official endorsement from some of his biggest supporters including arizona congressman candy biggs and paul gosar in kind with trump peters has denied the 2020 presidential election results in nevada despite the nevada supreme court finding zero evidence of trump's claims him peters has now called on the nevada secretary of state to remove electronic voting machines for the upcoming midterm national republicans uh from the upcoming uh uh of midterm elections national republicans are uh hoping for a pickup here despite a historic democratic advantage i mean what's your response to the trump party embracing your opponent and how do you think that affects voter sentiment come this november well reverend now in 79 days we will win re-election to nevada's fourth district uh because my constituents want someone who is going to continue to fight to reduce cost of living create good paying jobs and make our communities safer and that's what i've focused on my time doing instead my opponent who is an extreme uh republican supported by the former president he's an election denier uh it would not support the fact that donald trump did not win the 2020 election um and did not win it in nevada he also supports efforts to defund social security um and he wants to deny women the freedom to make their own health care decisions those are policies that are out of the mainstream uh from the majority of the people in nevada's fourth district and i'm proud uh to have represented this district um and to who have grown up in this district fighting for the needs of everyday nevadans who are relying on someone who's going to represent them in washington dc now this tuesday president biden signed a 750 billion climate health care and tax bill into law the bill has been called the most ambitious legislation passed on climate in the nation's history as it could cut u.s emissions by 40 by the end of the decade you have said that due to climate change excessive heat and drought are impacting nevada like never before which is leading to hiding uh to heighten the risk of deadly wildfires across your state how will the inflation reduction act help combat the environmental issue your state is facing and support nevada's growing clean energy sector well i was proud to vote for the inflation reduction act because as you said it makes a historic investment on addressing the climate crisis in my state of nevada that's the wildfires it's also uh a historic drought that we are facing in that inflation reduction act is four billion dollars of funding that we help to secure to address this the drought in the west as well as to reduce cost for nevadans everything from lowering prescription drug costs including my provision to cap out of pocket costs for seniors annually at two thousand dollars and the cap insulin for medicare beneficiaries at thirty five dollars it also makes sure that we are protecting people under the affordable care act so that they have lower cost premiums and it actually pays down the deficit with an uh 264 billion dollar of funding to help reduce the deficit so while my opponent and republicans in congress are trying to deny women their freedoms to make their own health care decisions i'm working to pass not only legislation to reduce costs but to pass the infrastructure investment and jobs act pass the bipartisan safer communities act including my bill to fund community violence intervention at historic amounts so that we can reduce crime save lives and break the cycle of violence congressman you are the first vice chair vice chair of the congressional black caucus and the fourth district of nevada which you currently serve has a diverse electorate across seven different counties with more than half of the district's voters being people of color and the largest portion uh proportion of that being black residents but more than any other nevada congressional district there will no other people of color on the primary ballots this year what is the significance of your campaign as a black american hoping to continue serving the diverse communities that make up nevada's fourth district thank you for recognizing the diversity of nevada's electorate we are one of the most diverse uh congressional districts in the country um and are continuing to change uh demographically i represent one of the most diverse districts uh both demographically and geographically i have a part of las vegas and north las vegas but i also have five uh counties throughout all of central nevada covering more than 50 000 square feet and so it's important to me that i reflect the needs of all nevadans from every corner of my district that's why i have worked to secure funding for community uh funded projects in rural communities uh helping to establish new hospitals uh funding for broadband making sure that we are actually addressing the internet divide that exists in both urban and rural areas i recognize that as the first african-american elected to congress for nevada i have a great responsibility to meet the needs of my constituents and that means serving every corner of our district um and that is what the people of nevada's fourth have chosen in previous elections and they don't want an extreme uh representative like the one i'm running against or those who are controlling uh efforts in congress to deny women that the freedom to make their own health care decisions or other uh protections including the right to vote all right and we'll have to leave it there thank you congressman stephen hosford uh thank you for being with us

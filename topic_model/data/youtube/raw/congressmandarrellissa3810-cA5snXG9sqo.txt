as we continue to see positive results in defeating the covet 19 we also see America demanding back its freedom this week was marked by many concessions including governor Newsom realizing that his lock down orders and his is over pushing against the counties would no longer be tolerated so as her own County Supervisors in San Diego and Riverside and other counties demanded more local control we began to see it not withstanding that we continue to see that it's a struggle to reopen and there's so far been no recognition that employers need to know that they'll be free of any special liability as people go back to work with safety measures that are as of yet untested so as we go through the next week these are going to be the subjects along with others as we come out into this Memorial Day weekend but as we go into the Memorial Day weekend I think we should all focus on the fact that well we've been dealing at home with these problems the men and women of the US military have defended us around the world and this is after all a weekend in which we celebrate those who served some of whom didn't come home and all of whom did something for America to keep us safe and free and so a salute to all of those who served in the US military have a great Memorial Day weekend

mr. president I rise today to talk about a subject that has been much on our minds recently in recent weeks and months and in fact years and that is healthcare one of the most complex confusing but important topics that we have to consider before I get into the bulk of what I want to address I think I want to make the point once again that as we're debating healthcare and debating who pays how much they pay whether it's the ACA or Medicare or Medicaid or private insurance or private pay we also have to begin a serious discussion about the underlying cost of health care regardless of who is paying it's going to break us if health care continues to grow in cost as it has over the last 20 years it's going to eat the federal budget family budgets individual budgets and it's going to be something that we absolutely have to address usually around here we don't address something until it's a crisis I would argue that when as we're approaching 20% of GDP one out of every five dollars in the country being committed to health care costs more than twice as much as most other countries in the world far more than any other country in the world we have to address this issue and arguing about who pays is not going to solve the problem that's important because in the interim that's what's going to protect our citizens coverage is what's going to protect our citizens from a health care disaster a health care crisis but I want to preface my remarks and I think this is something we all need to be thinking about is how do we move beyond the discussion that we're having now not that it's not important but we also need to move beyond to start talking about the underlying cost and why is it that Americans are paying virtually twice as much as anyone in the world for health care per capita or as a percent of GDP or however you want to calculate it without noticeably better results and in fact most worldwide studies indicate that our results of our health care system are not as good as many other country's it would be one thing if we were paying a lot of money in getting absolutely superior care across the board in our country but that's not the case in in measurements like infant mortality longevity kind of standard basic health care in indicators we're not doing very well and yet we're paying twice as much there's something wrong with that and we have to address it now right now I want to talk about the Affordable Care Act and I want to start with the point that it is the law of the land it is the law of the land and what I'm rising today in sadness but also in some anger because there's a lot of talk about the Affordable Care Act collapsing imploding mr. president it is not collapsing it's being mugged it's being stabbed in the back it's being sabotage deliberately and consciously by the actions of the administration and I want to emphasize this isn't about ideology it's not about politics it's not about who wins and who loses or which party is up or who voted or who didn't this is about people and it's about people in man it's about people who many of whom got care for the first time under the Affordable Care Act lobstermen small farmers small businesspeople individuals finally had a shot at reasonably priced health care it's not perfect by any means I would never argue that and in fact I've been working on proposals here since the day I got here on how to improve it how to fix some of the problems how to make it better how to have the effects be less intense on some parts of our economy but it is the law of the land and the impacts of what we do here or don't do here fall unreal people real people in my case in my home state of Maine the Affordable Care Act is not being is not collapsing it's being sabotage here's a partial list in January during the period when the LED when the last open enrollment period one of the first acts of the new administration was to cut the advertising on television advising people that they had this health care option cut the ads that's number one that was back in January then they announced they were going to minimize the enforcement of the personal mandate well if you tell somebody you're not going to enforce something that's an invitation to not abide by it to not paying attention to it people can argue about whether that is desirable but that's the law and to announce that administratively you're not going to enforce it again what does that do it reduces the number of people that are going to get health care and that in turn undermines the individual market and that in turn makes it less financially viable that is a deliberate act that will undermine the viability of this law in April began a series of what turned into seven different threats from various people in the administration to not make the legally mandated csr payments cost-sharing reduction payments which are not bailouts to insurance companies but we're designed as part of the law to hold the rates down and to hold the deductibles down for those people buying a coverage under the Affordable Care Act by continuously threatening the reduction or the elimination of these payments it has created an uncertainty in the marketplace that is now coming home to roost just last week anthem announced they are leaving the main marketplace they cited a number of reasons but one of the chief reasons was uncertainty the uncertainty created by whether or not these payments are going to be made recently the the h ELP committee had a series of hearings this subject they had bipartisan group of Governors they had a bipartisan group of Insurance Commissioners health experts from the coast across the country I was at all but one of those hearings and I believe I'm right in saying it was unanimous that we must ensure the continuation of the CSR payments in order to stabilize the market and in reduce premiums projected to increase this coming year the number nationally is estimated to be about 20 percent 20 percent increase attributable to the failure to ensure that the CSR payments will be made because an insurance company if they're setting rates have to factor into their rates the risk of these payments not being made and the testimony is it depends on somewhat on the state but roughly 20 percent increase attributable to just this fact if we could pass legislation here and unfortunately we've missed the deadline but we may be able to work that because the deadline was just last week but if we could simply ensure that those payments are made that in itself would lower rates by 20% next year on a silver plan and by the way if those CSRs aren't made and the rates go up ironically that means the the mandatory payments of subsidies to individuals under the under the Affordable Care Act will also go up so it'll cost the Treasury money additional money not accounted for roughly two hundred billion dollars over the next ten years what else has gone on in May another from the head of the Office of Management and Budget the administration hasn't decided whether to pay the CSRs that's a big red signal to the insurance companies you can't count on this so you better raise rates in May the budget Rose released and in the budget there were drastic cuts in the call centers for the Affordable Care Act in the in purse assistance and in marketing and just for good measure they announced ever cutting the enrollment period in half from three months to six weeks what possible reason can there be to do that except that you want fewer people to sign up that's called sabotage reducing from three months to six weeks then all along the Health and Human Services Department has been monkeying around with the website taking down explanatory material about the Affordable Care Act taking down material indicating why this would be as a good deal for people and instead putting up critical material August 31st the administration announces reductions in outreach of ninety percent and cuts in assistance to people trying to navigate this system by 40 percent this is complicated stuff any of us who have signed up for insurance I've gone on that we all have Affordable Care Act most nobody knows that but we had to go on the website and choose a policy for ourselves it's hard it's complicated and to take away the people who are out in the communities helping people to work through these various decisions and weigh the different policies and the deductibles and how to compare them to take that away is the same as taking away the coverage it's an act of sabotage and then the most recent I just learned about this this morning this is amazing the Affordable Care Act is based on a website healthcare.gov and we all know it had terrible problems when it started there's no excuse for that I was critical of it at the time but those were problems that weren't intentional now intentional problems are being created but this is the one that really gets me I just learned this morning that every Sunday during the bob-tailed enrollment period the six weeks enrollment period every Sunday that website is going to be closed for 12 hours for maintenance isn't that amazing twelve hours on the one day of the week where many working people are going to have an opportunity to try to understand the system and enroll they're going to be down from midnight Saturday night till noon on Sunday middle of the day on Sunday now I want to go back to the beginning this isn't about ideology this is about seeing that the laws are faithfully executed that's why they call it the administration the administration is supposed to administer the laws not unadmitted sir them and we're talking about people why do why does anyone want to have fewer people with insurance I just I'm just at a loss to understand the motivation I can understand if you don't like the ACA if you don't like the ACA let's work together find ways to improve it change it but figure out how to keep people with health insurance the uninsured rate in America has fallen fifty percent since the Affordable Care Act that's an enormous achievement it's one that should be celebrated not sabotage and that's what is so puzzling to me about this fewer people with coverage and higher cost to the Treasury mr. president we can do better than this and these are all things that the administration in good faith can say okay we don't like the ACA but we're gonna we're gonna move beyond the politics of this and try to help people get the coverage that they desperately need this is about real people's lives this is about lifting the the threat the cloud of a healthcare disaster both physically and financially from families across America millions of families not tens of thousand millions of families and why we are are deliberately trying to undermine and sabotage something that is so meaningful to so many people I just don't get I think as you can tell it makes me angry but mostly it makes me sad because I know people in Maine who benefited who've gotten coverage who didn't have it before who won't have it if this is taken away people who need those navigators to help them people who need to be able to use the website on a Sunday morning people who need to have rates that are lower because the CSRs have been funded and we aren't continuously raising the uncertainty of that piece of this law Madam President we can do better this is about the health of our people I can't think of anything more important and we can have different ways of getting there but right now we have a law that's in place and until we change it and we should change it we should fix it but we should administer it straight up straightforwardly that it was written and as it was intended Madam President this is too important for politics it's too important for ideology this is all about people and their health

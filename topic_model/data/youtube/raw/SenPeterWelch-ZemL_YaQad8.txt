did the taxpayer spend $30,000 for a security detail to accompany you on the trip to Disneyland I'm unsure about that I mean we took that's knowable yeah if the records show that all right so you you could determine this it's not like secret stuff the detail the the law enforcement make those determinations on what type of security should be provided whatever I've been listening to a lot of the answers and the answers are somebody else knows it and it really starts starting to seem like there's a there's a there's something on your desk with a motto that says the buck stops nowhere and you're the guy who's in charge yet yet congressmen have made decisions to switch and make sure that it make changes from first class back to coach yes i rescinded the plate the pay raises to those individuals no I get it but in fact that's happened let me ask you just about this phone booth because it's a metaphor are you aware that at the EPA headquarters there are two secure facilities where private phone calls could be secured and again I didn't request ask if I requested a secure communication that was not accessible to my office I understand that but you're the boss so you tell your folks that you want a secure way of communicating reasonable request they're going to accommodate it the boss is the one who has to make certain that it's a reasonable imposition on taxpayers and then they're you disagree with that and in this instance it's that the process failed and I indicated in my opening statement those processes we changed the way you asks the question here's the question that I think a lot of people would ask Republican or Democrat how can I make a secure phone call and the answer would be well mr. Pruit there happens to be two places in this building right close to your office where you can do that by clicking office pardon me they're not right close to my office well is how often do you have to use your secret phone booth it's for confidential communications and it's rare okay so on those rare occasions is it too much to ask you to walk whatever distance it takes for you to get to that's yes it belongs on the nature of the call and how urgent the call is but the point is that you have two locations that you can go to when you have to make those rare secure phone calls this is taxpayer money it's taxpayer money let me ask you this do you did you have installed or were there installed biometric locks on your office there were there were problems with locks on to the three Doors and changes were made to those locks and no instruction was given for biometric locks but that was a decision made by those those individuals so these things just happened there was no process of the agency in that regard and there was an evaluation well what's a biometric lock I'm not I'm not entirely sure so do you know in syndication I just open your door no seriously what is a biometric lock I don't know I just put a code in and then a biometric lock is it responds as I understand it to like fingerprints or some other eye your your Island your eyes some physical characteristic that's not that's my understanding as well all right so you have them right those are on those have been attitude to the office yes why gentleman's x x pride sure recognized gentleman from iowa for five minutes mr. loebsack I think

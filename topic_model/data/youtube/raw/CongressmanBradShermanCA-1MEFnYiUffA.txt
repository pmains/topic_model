to get Mark Zuckerberg here this is the biggest thing or it tries to be the biggest thing this committee will deal with this decade and while we have one of his employees here this is sucker mergs program now we're told by some that innovation is always good the most innovative thing that happened this century is when bill AMA bin Laden came up with the innovative idea of flying two airplanes into towers that's the most consequential innovation although this may do more to endanger America than even that people call this the Libre it's not the Libre nobody went if foe if it finally happens nobody's gonna call Italy brother gonna call it a suck buck this is Zuckerberg baby now mr. Marcus gave me two promises in our conversation yesterday both of which he knows they won't comply with first he promises that all the know your customer and anti money laundering is going to be adhere to but that applies only to the Calibra wallet and he hopes to have hundreds of other wallets created by others keep in mind as to bitcoin 46 percent of the transactions according to one academic study are for drug dealers and other nefarious operations you Hamas advertises they want Bitcoin contributions Bitcoin however has a problem there's no off-ramp there's no way to just go buy something with a Bitcoin you can eventually with a suck buck and finally the white paper put out by Facebook says the libre protocol does not link accounts to real-world identity a user is free to create multiple accounts by generating multiple key pairs so this is a godsend to drug dealers in sanctions evaders and tax evaders Zuckerberg has billions but he doesn't have the authority to print more until he gets this we saw we went from the US dollar we went from the US dollar being linked to gold and we only printed a number of dollars equal to the gold we had on had to the dollar becoming valuable in and of itself and now we can print how many dollars we print has nothing to do with how much gold we have in store mr. Marcus promised me that they would never do that but then he testifies here that the Libra Association will make all the decisions and Facebook won't be in control so so much for those promises America's power comes from the power of the dollar more I think than the power of our military it lowers the interest rates in the United States by at least $1,000 a family the senior edge has allowed the Fed to transfer a hundred billion dollars in some years often less to the Treasury our sanctions in Iran which I've worked on for over 20 years are effective only because of the power of the dollar and we were able to go after a human tractor for Gers drug dealers and tax evaders because of the power of the dollar we're told that they're going to solve two problems with this they're not gonna solve those problems cross-border transmission let's do that in dollars or let's send quit CIL's to Guatemala you've got a multi-billion dollar company trillion dollar company help people make those transmissions at low fees but what use dollars or use the local currency and then we're told they're gonna deal with the unbanked if they wanted to help the unbanked they wouldn't be using a cryptocurrency because crypto currencies are illegal in India the place where they have more unbanked than anywhere else they don't want to solve those problems they don't solve two other problems problem number one Zuckerberg can't print money yet and problem number two Zuckerberg is under attack because he invades the privacy of ordinary Americans and sells it to the highest bidder he needs to be an advocate for privacy and so he is creating a device which will provide privacy to drug dealers human traffickers terrorists tax evaders and sanctions evaders we need Zuckerberg here because we need to tell him that he probably has the power to push this through he'll throw around tens and hundreds of millions of dollars in Washington his supporters will get huge suck bucks in u.s. dollars a hundred lawyers will tell him that what he's doing is legal and therefore he's safe but some women with an understanding of the politics of this country needs to explain the mr. Zuckerberg that if cryptocurrency is used to finance the next horrific terrorist attack against Americans a hundred lawyers standing in a row charging two thousand dollars an hour are not going to protect his rear end from the from the wrath of the American people this is an attempt to transfer enormous power from America to Facebook and a number of its allies I'm surprised we need Zuckerberg here the gentleman from Kent

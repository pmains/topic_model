senator john hoeven is joining us he is on the appropriations committee and the energy committee senator good to have you on the program thanks maria good to be with you what is the viability of this new replacement to obamacare do you think i think it's a good plan it's about empowering people rather than expanding government and if the supreme court strikes down the subsidy that states are getting under the federal exchange we're going to have to have another plan and i hope there's some support both in the congress and on the part of the administration to go to this kind of approach what kind of an impact have you seen so far from anticipation of obamacare or actual implementation of obamacare um the front your question what kind of an impact have you seen already in terms of businesses in terms of the economy people's lives yeah i mean higher costs uh not only for businesses but for individuals in terms of their health care insurance and that's why the kind of plan that we're talking about now can create more competition and help bring health care costs down and give people more choice what would you like to see in terms of other priorities for for the budget the president uh released his budget what is your response in terms of what he's likely to do in terms of raising taxes and and creating more revenue for things like education and infrastructure projects well his budget's a real problem and and i don't believe it's going to go anywhere in congress if you look at it it's 2.1 trillion in higher taxes it's 2.4 trillion in more spending it's eight and a half trillion over 10 years in more debt for this country and that makes it harder for entrepreneurs and small businesses to create jobs and grow the economy and so that's not what americans want that's why congress is not going to go that direction what we're going to try to do is do things like reduce the regulatory burden engage in tax reform that stimulates our economy and encourages job creation for our businesses across this great country and how does this obamacare plan or replacement plan do that well the the uh it helps by giving more choice more competition reducing the regulatory burden again not only helping our businesses in terms of reducing costs giving them more options but for individuals as well that's the kind of thing that makes our economy go when you make it easier to do business then entrepreneurs small businesses create more jobs when you make it more expensive you have a higher tax burden more regulation that's what hurts job creation senator let me move on to the keystone pipeline which i know you have been pushing passage for but i want to start with north dakota because north dakota of course is a very big oil producing state producing more than a million barrels of oil a day second largest oil producing state what has been the impact on the state of this sharp sell-off in the price of oil that we've seen in the last year maria we're starting to see some slow down obviously the price of oil now just a little over 50 a barrel you know actually we're locked in a global competition to see who's going to supply energy globally so opec russia now the united states you know we're battling for market share so we have to continue to help build our industry in this country so far we've seen some slow down in our state not too much how much more we'll see depends on what happens with the price right i mean is it fair to say that the the rise in supply whether it's the shale revolution in america or opec and non-opec countries that's the reason oil prices have come down so much maria without question one of the things i often say is opec didn't decide to give us a christmas present this year the reason gas prices are lower dropping over last year from something like 3.27 a gallon down to about 217 a gallon is because we're producing so much more energy and that's how it works if we continue to grow our energy base in this country we not only become energy secure but we reduce the price at the pump for our consumers the benefit they've received so far would be if it were a tax cut would be equal to more than 100 billion dollars in the consumer's pocket yeah i mean you have been talking about the importance of the keystone xl pipeline and yet the president continues to say he is going to veto this so these threats continue what are you going to do if the president vetoes this in the next couple of weeks you know maria that's the great irony we're producing more energy it's strengthening our country it's helping our allies it's benefiting consumers and businesses you know throughout our economy and now the president on the one hand takes credit for it and then on the other hand he's trying to block it we need the infrastructure and we have to build the business climate so we can produce more energy not less here in north america and then we don't have to depend on opec for oil and we're stronger as a country and we have a stronger economy yeah i think it's also worth mentioning the fact that the oil is going to get here uh by hook or crook it's only going to come on rail cars as opposed to coming through a pipeline and we're already seeing a real capacity uh congestion on the tracks right because oil is being transported on rail car you make a great point that oil is going to move either by rail or by pipeline if it moves by rail that's 1400 rail cars a day which not only creates more congestion more risk of accident that kind of thing but it also blocks our movement of other goods the safest way to do it the most cost effective way to do it with the best environmental stewardship is with the proper in infrastructure the right mix of pipelines rail and roads senator good to have you on the program we'll be watching the developments thanks so much thanks brian senator john hoeven joining us

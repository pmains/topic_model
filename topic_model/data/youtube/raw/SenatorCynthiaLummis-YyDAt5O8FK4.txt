I'm a nice my questions are for Ms Raskin I'd like to ask you about Federal Reserve master account access an issue of great interest to Wyoming and my constituents I asked chairman Powell about it I asked Governor Brainerd about it at their nomination hearings I've been stonewalled at the fed and so I wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal Master accounts are the way Banks access the payment system many non-banks including trust companies have applied and failed to receive a Fed master account to my knowledge there's one and only one State Charter trust company that has a Fed master account it's a startup based in Colorado formed in 2016 called Reserve Trust Reserve trust has repeatedly touted the value of the company's fed master account their home page says in 2021 one of the company's investors underscored that Reserve trust is armed with a master account at the Federal Reserve and direct access to the payment rails the only company in the country that has that the only start uh fintech company now a Fed master account gives Reserve trust an enormous advantage over everybody else since it appears they're the only one who has it and you're very familiar with Reserve trust because you joined their board in May 2017 just four months after leaving treasury right right well thank you for your question um I joined the board of Reserve trust in 2017. and you're done in uh came after four years as a Federal Reserve Governor right um four years I think I well after I left as a Federal Reserve Governor I went to treasury as deputy secretary you're you you went from the Federal Reserve Governor to Treasury and then to uh Reserve trusts board and and then Reserve trust had its master account application denied in June 2017. but one year later the FED granted it a master account in 2018. it's a mystery to me how dozens of fintech companies have tried unsuccessfully and how Wyoming's spdi Charter has been under review for well over a year two and a half years at the FED Consulting with them about how to make this qualify how did Reserve trust get there so quickly after Reserve trust had their application denied did you communicate with the Federal Reserve about Reserve trusts application so Senator I was on the board of Reserve Trust on the board of directors from 2017 till 2019 and they got their master account in 2018. so did you call or communicate with the Federal Reserve about Reserve trust's application well uh certainly if you are suggesting anything improper I want to make very clear that I have um first of all had the honor to serve in various public capacities and each time I left I have been very mindful of the rules regarding departure well it's my understanding you did call the Kansas City fed in August of 2017. regarding Reserve trust's master account application so I have significant questions about your involvement in reserve trust efforts to obtain a master account so Reserve trust is denied you go on their board then they get a master account did you communicate with the Board of Governors about Reserve trusts application so I can assure you that I have been very focused well who did you who did you communicate with first of all I want to be very clear here the Federal Reserve has has approved plenty of Master accounts but not but not in fintech you resigned from Reserve trust in August of 2019 correct um August 2019 I left the board of Reserve trust correct now do you know amias Garrity yes I do know in myascarity okay so while you were number two a treasury Mr Garrity was the acting assistant secretary for financial institutions and he reported to you right he did not report directly to me but yes he was at treasury when I was there and he's also a partner at QED investor which is now the controlling owner of Reserve trust so in 2020 QED investor purchased the 195 000 Reserve trust shares you received when you joined the board in 2017. and they purchased your shares for almost one and a half million dollars even in this town that's a lot of money for being on a company's Board of Directors for two years so let me recap you leave treasury you serve on the board of Reserve trust for two years their first application for a master account is denied but after the denial you call the Federal Reserve and Reserve trust receives a Fed master account the only state chartered Trust Company in the country to get one and you walk away with a million and a half dollars something doesn't smell right with the way this played out my State's companies my constituents have been stonewalled have been slow walked and have not been able to get approval even though they've been working with the FED for two and a half years on our very specific guidelines forgetting Master accounts now Mr chairman I don't know the details here because the FED hasn't provided us with any documents we've asked about Reserve trust Master accounts but I think this requires additional scrutiny by the committee and I look forward to receiving it thank you Mr chairman I yield back

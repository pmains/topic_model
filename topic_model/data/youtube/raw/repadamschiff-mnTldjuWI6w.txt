, THESE PEOPLE WOULD NEVER HAVE TO TESTIFY OR BE DEPOSED. JOINING US NOW IS DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN ADAM SCHIFF, MEMBER OF THE JANUARY 6TH COMMITTEE AND CHAIR OF THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US AGAIN TONIGHT. WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT JEFFREY CLARK'S TESTIMONY TODAY? THERE WERE SPECULATION THAT BECAUSE IT WAS ONLY AN HOUR AND 40 MINUTES, HE MUST HAVE USED THE FIFTH AMENDMENT FOR AN AWFUL LOT OF ANSWERS. >> I ATTENDED EACH OF THE DEPOSITIONS TODAY. AND WHILE I CANNOT COMMENT ON THEIR CONTENTS, THERE IS A CERTAIN AMOUNT ALREADY IN THE PUBLIC RECORD ON JEFFREY CLARK, MOSTLY THROUGH PUBLIC PROCEEDINGS IN THE SENATE. AND IN THE SENATE PROCEEDINGS IT BECAME CLEAR THAT AT THE VARIOUS VERY HIGHEST LEVELS OF THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, THERE WAS AN EFFORT SPEARHEADED BY MR. CLARK TO MISS USE THAT DEPARTMENT TO PROMULGATED FALSE CLAIMS ABOUT FRAUD, TO TRY TO DISCOURAGE GEORGIA FROM SENDING A SLATE OF ELECTORS OR TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO SEND AN ALTERNATE SLATE. AND TO REPLACE THE LEADERSHIP THAT RESISTED HIS EFFORTS. AND -- HIMSELF. THESE ARE SHOCKING THINGS. AND LAWRENCE, WHEN WE HAD A CONTEMPT PROCEEDING EARLIER, DESPITE HIM INVOKING THE FIFTH, AND THAT IS SPECTER FOR SOMEONE AT THE TOP OF THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, AS INDICATED PREVIOUSLY BY HIS ATTORNEY, WHO MAY NOT BE ABLE TO TESTIFY HIM AS HE COULD BE INCRIMINATED. THAT IS PRETTY BREATHTAKING WHEN YOU HAVE A FORMER JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL IN THAT POSITION. >> AS YOU BACKGROUND AS A FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR, GIVEN YOUR BACKGROUND, YOU SEE A SCENARIO WHERE THIS COMMITTEE MAYBE AT THE END OF ITS PROCESSES, COULD BE MAKING A SERIES OF REFERRAL TO THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, DRAWING FROM PEOPLE LIKE JEFFREY CLARK, WHO MAY USE THE FIFTH AMENDMENT AS MUCH AS THEY CAN? THE FIFTH AMENDMENT IS ACTUALLY USED WHEN THERE IS A LEGITIMATE BELIEF THAT THE WITNESS COULD BE INDICTED BY DELIVERING ANSWERS. SO, MIGHT THAT BE ONE OF THE OUTCOMES OF THIS INVESTIGATION? >> YOU KNOW, IT IS CERTAINLY POSSIBLE WITH RESPECT TO ANY OF THE EVIDENCE THAT WE HAVE GATHERED. WE MAY MAKE REFERRALS AND OF COURSE WE HAVE MADE REFERRALS ALREADY TO PEOPLE WHO WERE IN CONTEMPT OF CONGRESS, FOR REFUSING TO APPEAR. BUT IF WE GATHER SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE OF OTHER CRIMES, WE CERTAINLY CAN REFER THAT TO THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. BUT IT IS IMPORTANT FOR US TO POINT OUT THAT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS NOT WAITING ON US. AND THEY SHOULD NOT WAIT ON US AND HISTORICALLY THEY DO NOT WAIT ON US. SO, THEY OUGHT TO BE INVESTIGATING THESE ISSUES THEMSELVES. THERE IS SOME CONCERN, AS I'VE EXPRESSED TO YOU BEFORE LAWRENCE, THAT THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT I DO NOT SEE MUCH ACTION FROM THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ON. THIS INCLUDES THE MATTER RELATED TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE OF GEORGIA, TO FIND THE 11,000 VOTES. [INAUDIBLE] THAT SHOULD NOT WAIT ON US, IT IS THE KIND OF THING THAT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SHOULD BE LOOKING INTO ON ITS OWN. >> DONALD TRUMP HAS TRIED PUBLICLY TO INFLUENCE POTENTIAL WITNESSES AGAINST HIM. PAUL MANAFORT, WHEN HE WAS FACING CRIMINAL PROSECUTION, DONALD TRUMP WOULD SAY KIND THINGS ABOUT HIM, CLEARLY IN AN ATTEMPT TO KEEP PAUL MANAFORT FROM SAYING UNKIND THINGS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP TO PROSECUTORS. WE HAVE SEEN THIS THING NOW OF DONALD TRUMP RAISING PARDONS FOR THE JANUARY 6TH ATTACKERS THAT IS, AMONG OTHER THINGS, AN ATTEMPT TO INFLUENCE WHAT THEY MAY SAY ABOUT DONALD TRUMP AND THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. ALSO, WE HAVE THIS UNPRECEDENTED LAWSUIT FILED TODAY BY LIEUTENANT COLONEL VINDMAN, WHICH IS IN EFFECT A LAWSUIT ABOUT WITNESS INTIMIDATION, AGAINST RUDY GIULIANI, DONALD TRUMP JUNIOR AND OTHERS, WHO WERE TRYING TO INTIMIDATE THIS WITNESS IN YOUR FIRST IMPEACHMENT INVESTIGATION. >> THAT IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. THE PRESIDENT HAS A LONG HISTORY OF ATTEMPTS TO INTIMIDATE WITNESSES AND TO REWARD THOSE WHO AGREE TO EITHER BE SILENT OR TO A BIDEN COVER UPS FOR HIM. FOR EXAMPLE, HE PARDONED ROGER STONE FOR LYING TO CONGRESS. HE AND HIS ATTORNEY GENERAL, BILL BARR, MADE A CASE ABOUT MICHAEL FLYNN GO AWAY COMPLETELY AFTER FLYNN PLED GUILTY REPEATEDLY TO LYING. AND AS YOU SAY, HE DANGLED PARDONS IN FRONT OF MANAFORT. HE ALSO WENT AFTER PEOPLE WHO COOPERATED WITH THE GOVERNMENT, PEOPLE LIKE MICHAEL COHEN AND HE CALLED THEM A RAT AND WENT AFTER HIM. HIS RECENT STATEMENTS AS WELL AS RECENT REPORTS ABOUT PARDONING THE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THE JANUARY 6TH ATTACK, THEY GO TO A COUPLE OF THINGS. THEY GO TO THIS IDEA THAT IF THIS WAS NOT SOMETHING HE CONDONED, WHY WOULD HE CONSIDER PARDONING THEM? SO IT IS IMPORTANT AS THE HIS INTENT. BUT IT IS ALSO PART OF THAT BROADER PATTERN, LAWRENCE, TO INFLUENCE POTENTIALLY WHAT WITNESSES HAVE TO SAY OR WHETHER THEY WILL SAY IT. >> WE HAVE LEARNED A LOT SINCE THAT FIRST IMPEACHMENT INVESTIGATION THAT YOU CONDUCTED ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S ATTEMPT TO USE THE UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT IN HIS OWN REELECTION CAMPAIGN, AND TO TRY TO CONVINCE HIM TO SOMEHOW DAMAGE JOE BIDEN, IF HE COULD IN THE CAMPAIGN. LIEUTENANT COLONEL VINDMAN LISTEN TO THAT PHONE CALL AS THE PRESIDENT WAS MAKING IT. HE STEPPED FORWARD TO TESTIFY ABOUT IT. HE NOW SAYS IN SWORN LEGAL DOCUMENTS, IN THIS LAWSUIT, THAT THERE WAS A CONCERTED CONSPIRACY TO INTIMIDATE HIM AS A WITNESS. DID YOU SENSE THAT AT THE TIME WHEN YOU WERE TAKING HIS TESTIMONY IN THAT ROOM? >> WELL, WITHOUT A DOUBT, WE SENSED THE EFFORT BY THE FORMER PRESIDENT AND HIS ALLIES, HIS SON AND OTHERS TO SMEAR LIEUTENANT COLONEL VINDMAN AND ATTACK HIM PERSONALLY, TO QUESTION HIS PATRIOTISM. SADLY, I THINK SOME OF THE REPUBLICANS DURING HIS DEPOSITION, SIMILARLY TRY TO IMPUGN HIS PATRIOTISM. HE IS A DEDICATED SOLDIER WHO SERVED AND, I BELIEVE, EARNED A PURPLE HEART FOR HIS SERVICE. SO I THINK THAT ON THE BASIS OF WHAT WE HAVE OBSERVED PUBLICLY, HE HAS A PRETTY STRONG CASE TO MAKE. AND I WISH HIM EVERY SUCCESS. BECAUSE NO ONE SHOULD HAVE GONE THROUGH WHAT HE DID, FOR DOING HIS DUTY AND -- A SUBPOENA. >> BEFORE YOU GO, I WANT TO ASK YOU BASED ON YOUR POSITION IN THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE. YOU CERTAINLY KNOW MORE ABOUT THE SITUATION AT THE UKRAINE BORDER RIGHT NOW, GIVEN YOUR POSITION ON THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE. DO YOU HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT WE CAN EXPECT OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS, SURROUNDING WHAT APPEARS TO BE SOME KIND OF STALEMATE? >> WELL, LAWRENCE, IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN UNFORTUNATELY MY SUSPICION THAT THE [INAUDIBLE] PRETEXT TO INVADE.  [INAUDIBLE] THAT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT HE ROLLS TANKS INTO KYIV AND THAT HE IS DISAPPOINTED THAT HIS PREVIOUS INVASION OF UKRAINE DID NOT CHANGE UKRAINE. IT CONTINUES TO MOVE TOWARDS THE WEST PHILOSOPHICALLY AND POLITICALLY. IT WANTS TO BE PART OF EUROPE AND NOT THE EURASIAN UNION AND UNDER THE THUMB OF PUTIN. SADLY, I THINK THAT THIS IS LIKELY. THE ADMINISTRATION IS DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE, I THINK, TO DETER PUTIN BY SENDING UKRAINIANS, BY MOVING U.S. TROOPS TO NATO COUNTRIES, BY DISPOSING INTELLIGENCE ABOUT RUSSIAN PLANS FOR A FALSE PROVOCATION, AND RUSSIAN PLANS FOR A PUPPET REGIME, AS THE BRITISH HAVE DISCLOSED. AND MAKE IT VERY CLEAR TO PUTIN THAT WE WILL MOVE NATO ASSETS CLOSER TO RUSSIA, NOT FURTHER AWAY, IF THEY GO THROUGH WITH THIS. ALL OF THAT, I THINK, IS EXACTLY WHAT THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION SHOULD BE DOING. AND IT MAY NOT BE ENOUGH IF PUTIN HAS DECIDED HE WILL DO IT REGARDLESS. BUT THEY ARE, WE HAVE TO RAISE THE COST TO RUSSIA BY PROVIDING UKRAINIANS WITH THE WEAPONS TO DEFEND THEMSELVES. >> HOUS

critical race theory is a direct affront to liberalism and it seems conservatives of the one who defends traditional liberalism and i'm sure a lot of my colleagues would identify as liberals let me read to you if you just google the first thing that comes up about critical race theory the definition it's a body of legal scholarship etc here's where it gets interesting seeks to critically examine the intersection of race and u.s law and to challenge mainstream american liberal approaches to racial justice it's challenging liberal principles like the neutral application of law it's challenging these things because it's in fact a racist ideology that believes you should treat people differently based on their skin color they're not teaching a class called critical race theory in middle school or high school i get that but those theories infuse directly their teachings and whether that teaching is is called diversity and inclusion or is given some nice name it is infused with the toxic teachings of critical race theory so i'm glad that everybody here says that they're against it but then why not just vote for these amendments so that we can actually say we're against it together so that we can actually lock arms and stand together against racist policies you say it has no place in this in this amendment in this in this policy discussion well you know what then that maybe from the beginning work with republicans along the whole 3.5 trillion dollar bill i mean that's what i would say to that take these parents seriously there's hundreds there's thousands of them throughout the country and if you're paying attention you're seeing these videos get get more and more attraction and you know what some of the most amazing ones are they're from black parents because black parents don't want their black child being taught that they're disadvantaged automatically because of their skin color or that they should see white people as an enemy this stuff is important it's important to our culture it's important to thousands of parents across the country and and the dismissal the sneering condescending dismissal of those parents concerns is really abysmal because those parents are bringing actual examples of curriculum they're bringing actual examples of curriculum to those school board meetings and you need to watch those videos and actually list them thank you mr chairman are you okay

Mr Speaker I rise today to address the imminent danger facing our nation in the wake of the terrorist attacks in California earlier this week the president addressed the country to talk about the impact of the Islamic state in the attacks in California from what I saw he gave his usual very brief and very naive analysis of the threat of global terrorism yet once again he still failed to provide any actual plan or strategy he made very clear that he believes his plan is working he talked a lot about how we would continue to do the same things we have been doing for months meanwhile Isis continues to grow expanding their influence and hitting targets far from their home in Syria it is unfortunate that very few people I have spoken to Phil surprised by the lack of focus and direction coming from the White House this is the same president that has been dismantling our military piece by piece he has continued to push for unsustainably low funding for our military in favor of social programs while making dangerous deals that jeopardize the safety and security of our nation and our allies oversees all the while he claims to be putting the safety and security of the American people first it seems abundantly clear to me in the rest of the country that mutt the most important thing to this president is his personal legacy of institute and social change and other liberal wish list items during the same address that he claimed all of his plans were working and we should continue along the same course he also argued that part of the solution to Muslim extremism was more gun control here in America obviously the president's memory is pretty weak the Boston bombers did unthinkable harm with household items the San Bernardino terrorists yes terrace had a dozen pipe bombs in their residence these people are dedicated to destroying the West and instituting a caliphate you really think that telling them that they can't buy an ar-15 is going to stop them from hurting people let me be clear this is not a gun issue this is a terrorism issue to combine the two is a blatant attempt to capitalize on a tragedy it should be looked at with disdain but you never know it wasn't too long oh that Rahm Emanuel former chief of staff to the president obama who always reminded his party to never let a good crisis go to waste this isn't the first time though last week while everyone was talking about the terrorist attack in California and despite pleas from the Marine Corps to make exemptions to certain military occupational specialties the secretary of defense made the historic but unbelievably dangerous decision to open all combat jobs to women but if there's one thing the president loves to do it is to ignore his senior military leadership many people believe that the emergence of Isis is directly related to his premature withdrawal from Iraq and I agree these are just a few examples of the AWOL nature of this president but in this case a wall stands for absent without leadership what happened in Paris and here in California was a brutal reminder of just how dedicated our enemy is and fighting this war against us yet the president only acknowledges it as a setback similar to how he refused to acknowledge Isis at all over a year ago and when he finally did he brushed it off calling them the JV team the night before the Paris attack he stated that Isis had been contained this president is either delusional or unbelievably misinformed either way it does not inspire confidence for the next year of his presidency now here we are he was wrong then and he is wrong now mr. speaker while the president held his annual holiday ball on Monday night I held at Ella Town Hall of my constituents when asked if they felt more safer left safe under this administration's handling of our national security and foreign affairs ninety-two percent of my constituents said they felt less safe and seventy-three percent said that we should do anything in our power to destroy Isis I got to say this is a clear message that i think would resonate nationwide time and again the president our commander-in-chief has proven to be oblivious to the real threat the ISIS opposes to our national security he said what we are doing is working when it is clearly not folks we are under attack and we could not be afraid to call it what it is this enemy is radical Muslim extremism the American people don't feel safe under this president's failed policies the time has come to change our the course in the new war against Isis secure our borders halt the Syrian refugee program and start listening to the American people Mr Speaker I yield back gentlemen

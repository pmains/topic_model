congresswoman barbara Lee of California who is a staunch advocate of the Affordable Care Act and opposes any efforts to repeal and replace it congresswoman thank you for being with us somebody said earlier it's like the the dog that caught the car they've got it now and they are struggling with the very things that my colleague Tom Costello says they're struggling with and that is parts of Obamacare that are remarkably popular what are you going to do if you're a Republican I would say the majority of the Affordable Care Act is very very popular when you look at what people have said throughout the country at town meetings it's don't take away my health care don't make America sick again so I don't know how the Republicans are going to get out of this they can't repeal this 30 million people will lose health care coverage and we're not going to go there and so I thank the people of the country from organized and mobilized and raising their voices and making sure that the Affordable Care Act is not repealed let me give you a hint that I'm getting from this let me play a sound bite from house speaker Ryan conference or he made some comments this morning about why he thinks they're going to get away with with with repeal and reform listen the Democrats have made it very clear with us that they don't have any interest in repealing Obamacare the Democrats want to go down with this internship Obamacare is a clashing law a collapsing law a sinking ship yesterday Donald Trump said the best thing that Republicans can do is just let this go it'll collapse under its own weight surely as a Democrat you can see that there are some problems around the edges or maybe even closer to the middle with Obamacare that some form of reform could be useful first with regard to tinkering around the edges fixing what the problems are correcting some of the problems fine but we're talking about not allowing a full repeal of the Affordable Care Act millions of people around the country our plan once again to the Republicans don't take away my health care and I just have to say it's really unfortunate resident didn't really realize how difficult this is that's pretty ignorant if you ask me my grandchildren knew how difficult it was to put together a health care plan that would cover it Americans regardless of their income level background or where they live even in West Virginia black lung disease is covered now people suffering from Bad have coverage people aren't going to let this administration take away the yellow here and we're going to sponsor to the end the president the administration often talk about Arizona they often talk about premiums having spiked twenty percent in some areas of the how do you address those things insurers who are leaving certain areas look I like to correct people that the increase in insurance rates is slower over the last five years that it was in the previous five years but but insurers have left in some areas so the Democrats come up with their own replacement the first thing we have to do is make sure that the 30 million people who are covered do not lose their health care once we do that if they're fixes that we have to engage in then okay but right now we're not going to allow this administration to take away health care from people who desperately need it this is a matter of life and death preventive health care all of the coverages that people receive nails their premiums would go up if in fact the Republican ideas are put into place and we're not going to let that happen and so we're going to continue to work with our constituents and to help organize around the country so people God the Republicans are Syrian speaker Ryan and the president so they understand that people do not want to lose their health care coverage congressman you said your grandchildren would understand that it was complicated i suspect you have unnaturally smart grandchildren representative barbara Lee a democratic congresswoman of California thanks for spending some time with me thank you very very much

one of the things that all of those people that are experiencing issues with knowing what's coming up with storms is flood insurance and I know it's been a really hot topic can you give us a bit of an update about where we are with that yeah uh look flood insurance is is really frustrating I I don't think that FEMA has gone through this the right way as soon as we caught wind of what they were doing in February of last year we started pushing back and doing conference calls and asking the questions began filing amendments we have a bipartisan bill right now that would prevent these new flood insurance rates from going into effect and of course there's all those things called risk rating 2.0 we have people whose insurance rates have gone from about 650 a year to eight thousand dollars a year I mean just completely unaffordable it devalues homes people you know you have X dollars available for your mortgage and insurance and taxes and if you're if your flood insurance rates are going to go that high it it you just can't afford to live in some of these areas and that's unacceptable that's why we've been trying to focus on the the investments in every a structure like hurricane protection because that means people are safe it means that they're not in vulnerable areas and they don't need to be charged these absurd rates while we're concurrently working to stop FEMA from implementing these crazy prices and just trying to offset some of that and actually the other thing is to get some answers for how it came up what did you what what formula did you use to go from anybody's flood insurance rate going from 650 to 8 000 I mean that's that's lunacy right and on top of it they are refusing to release the data they they are refusing that's one of the things that our bill requires our bill requires them to be transparent about this I've had conference calls with everybody and their mother nobody can answer questions nobody understands and they've refused to release the data showing how they came up with these rates and and like I said it's just it's unaffordable at this point yeah it's really interesting as we kind of close out this segment we'll probably have to spend a little more time talking about it in the next one but it's interesting that the people that this really impacts those flood insurance issues I've got a friend of mine who owns Shrimp Factory and they have people coming in with boats and they wouldn't be able able to afford their Shrimp Factory flood insurance there down in one of the Southern parts of Terrebonne Parish without having this flood insurance regulated but those are some of the people that get hit hardest and the Fisheries as well so so you have people that got hit by Hurricane Ida and just completely pounded trying to rub pennies together to rebuild and you're going to come in on top of it and and cause them cause them to pay multiple times for flood insurance I mean it's just a triple whammy that we can't allow to happen

one good evening and thank you to everyone for joining us tonight my top priority is making sure that you and your families have the information you need to stay healthy and safe during these uncertain times my office is open and ready to assist in any way we can even though we're teleworking to help social distance and mitigate the spread of the virus we're answering our phones and our emails and we're ready to help so please don't hesitate to contact us before we get to the meat of the program i would like to start off by acknowledging that we are living through unprecedented times the current global health crisis is giving way to what will certainly become an economic crisis how we protect americans health right now will directly impact just how severe that may become the moment we are in requires a level of solidarity and collective action not seen perhaps since world war ii it will require us to make changes in our daily lives to alter our production so we can take care of our health care workers so that we can meet the surge in patients and adapt to situations we would not otherwise seek out on our own everything we do as leaders and as citizens should give assurance to workers that their jobs will be secure and that we won't let our small businesses fail and if there is disruption for however long we will be there for our neighbors in need tonight i'm pleased to be joined on this call by jody white president and ceo of lowell general hospital and circle health and chair of the massachusetts health and hospital association dr dan berlowicz chair and professor of the department of public health zuckerberg college of health sciences at umass lowell and dr ashish jha director of the harvard global health institute and k.t lee professor of global health at harvard university just yesterday dr jarr co-authored an enlightening article published in the atlantic titled this is how we beat the coronavirus i highly recommend it and consider us fortunate for us having him here tonight these health care leaders in our community will be able to help answer questions ranging from massachusetts response to the pandemic to best practices that can help keep our families safe and healthy but first i want to just start by sharing a few updates on our federal response to the coronavirus as you all now know on march 6th president trump signed congress's emergency supplemental funding package to the tune of 8.3 billion dollars that package consisting entirely of new funds included support to stake state and local health agencies vaccine and treatment development and loans for our affected small businesses to lessen the economic blow of this public health emergency some of the other top-line funding provisions included three billion dollars for the development of treatments and a coronavirus vaccine 300 million to ensure americans have access to vaccines regardless of their ability to pay 950 million to reimburse states and localities for their virus response efforts as much as seven billion dollars will be available for low interest loans to affected small businesses one billion dollars for medical supplies health care preparedness and medical surge capacity including 100 million dollars specifically for our community health centers it includes access to telemedicine services for coronavirus treatment for our seniors it ensures that vaccines and treatments for coronavirus are affordable and that state and local governments are reimbursed for costs incurred while assisting the federal response last week congress took divisive action once more when we passed into law the family's first coronavirus response act which provides emergency paid leave it establishes free coronavirus testing supports expanded unemployment benefits ensures food assistance for vulnerable children and families while they're home from school protects our frontline health workers and provides additional funding to states for the ongoing economic consequences the president signed this package into law earlier this week congress is now working hard to ensure that state and local governments have the resources necessary to combat this deadly virus and to keep our families safe that includes directly supporting our heroic nurses doctors medical personnel and first responders serving on our front lines it's why i joined senator markey and his call for president trump to invoke the defense production act which converts non-essential manufacturing over to producing the essentials we need like tests swabs masks and respirators shortages of supplies are an unacceptable reality in our country and on wednesday the president invoked this power we must rapidly produce these essentials i'd like to take a brief moment to mention an yet disturbing part of this epidemic and that's the rise in xenophobic attacks against asian americans we must continue to educate the public that people of asian descent are not more prone to carry coronavirus than another racial demographic no one community or ethnicity is more likely to carry coronavirus nor infect someone with the virus than another and the asian american community does not deserve to be targeted with these racist attacks the words of our elected leaders matter look all of our words matter and it's important that we deal with facts and we treat each other with respect during this difficult time we all have a duty as members of a community to keep ourselves and our families safe and healthy especially the elderly and the immune compromised together we can do it we've all had to adjust our lifestyles in an effort to flatten the curve my 72 year old mom used to help me with my young daughters but she's at home with my dad who has ms and ceasing all interaction outside of the occasional face time with our family i know that this is challenging but it's necessary to protect the health of our loved ones i'd like to thank you all once again for joining us tonight and turn it over to our experts who can give us a little more insight into the virus we'll start with brief introductions so up first mr jody white president and ceo of lowell general hospital and circle health congresswoman thank you for um asking me to join your panel of experts tonight and thank you for your leadership as we are in uh really uncharted waters as we take this on together so i'm jody white i'm the president and ceo of circle health i joined the law market in 2003 and in 2012 we had the good fortune to bring our two hospitals together to form circle health and we are the second or third largest community hospital in the commonwealth we're on a progressive move towards improving health and reducing costs of care and look forward to continue to work hard during these times of strife and i'm also the 76th chair of the massachusetts health and hospital association with regular calls with the ceos from across the commonwealth to figure out ways to be sure that we are standing up as your health system uh to take on the challenges are ahead of us and i look forward to a conversation this afternoon thank you lori thank you jody we're fortunate to have your leadership in our community uh dr dan berlowitz chair and professor of department of public health at the zuckerberg college of health sciences at umass lowell thank you congresswoman as mentioned i am the chair of the department of public health at umass lowell i have been there for all of two months however i have been actively involved in the healthcare veterans in the merrimack valley for over 30 years working at the bedford va most recently as a chief medical officer i'm also a professor at boston university school of medicine and have done extensive work on improving health care particularly for older people and certainly one of my biggest concerns right now is the impact of covet 19 on older people particularly those in residential settings such as nursing homes thank you dr and last but certainly not least uh dr ashish director harvard global health institute and kt lee professor of global health at harvard university the congresswoman thank you for inviting me to be a member of this panel and thank you for your leadership in bringing members of our community together to have this conversation you know this is a an extraordinarily difficult time for everybody not just in the medical field but really all americans and to hear from our leaders and to hear from experts i think is um critically important and i'm honored to be a part of this process so thank you for having me um you know i was my practicing physician i've been taking care of veterans for about 15 years at the west roxbury va and uh have been running the harvard global health institute for about six years and when i first came on in that role it was in the middle of the ebola outbreak in west africa and so we turned the focus of the institute one of the major focus areas has been around disease outbreaks and pandemics and how do we prepare for the next one and that has been our mantra for the last five years how do we prepare for the next one and it is ironic that here we are and the next one is here and it's a big one and we're all while we're learning our way through it there are a lot of lessons from previous outbreaks that i think can guide us and i look forward to sharing what we know about the corona virus outbreak in the us i've been deeply involved in uh in that in the in the u.s response and just learning and thinking about where we are and um what we can learn from other countries and what we can learn from past experiences i hope i get a chance to share some of those but thank you again for having me well thank you so much for being with us um well without further delay let's get to some of the questions a brief note we have received hundreds of questions through our submission portal it's a credit to your interest and your engagement and we did our best to select questions that were representative and uh were frequent so to cover all of our bases the best we could we will do our best to answer all the questions we can following this call if a category of questions have not been addressed but let's start with our first one it's for dr ja and it's one we've been hearing over and over again when will widespread testing be available ask joseph c from ashburnham so congresswoman and joseph that's a really important question and you know our country has been unfortunately really slow on the testing issue most other major countries have figured out testing uh quite a ways back and we have been very very slow and we've been moving slowly but i have some good news on this which is that in the last two three days testing has really started ramping up so today as of 4 pm so my my information is about an hour old as of 4 pm today in the us we did about 35 000 tests today um that brings us up to about 140 000 tests total so you may be asking well how many should we be doing and the modeling that we have done and the estimations we've done suggest that america should be doing about 100-150 000 tests a day if we want to be at the same level that south korea was and south korea is the model for how you do testing to bring this disease under control you know testing is really critical to identifying who's sick separating them from people who are not and preventing the spread of the disease and we're still pretty far behind where we are but a week ago we were testing a thousand or two a day so 35 000 today is real progress and i am hopeful and i say this with some caution because i don't know but i'm hopeful that within the next seven to ten days we will get up to the numbers that we need to be at to be testing all the people who need to be tested well thank you those are numbers that we haven't heard yet so i'm appreciative of not just the latest as a four o'clock but also for the ramp up that we should be expecting in the in the next week uh dr berlowitz robin k from kingsborough asks what is the status of a treatment medication and or vaccine so thank you robin i think that question is the one that everyone really wants to know right now and i think everyone realizes that as of today there is no proven medication treatment or vaccine that said on a positive note there is a lot of work that has begun one of the things that we did learn from china is that rapidly initiated high quality clinical trials can be successfully done within the setting of an epidemic and right now there are over a hundred different clinical trials that are underway or just getting started that are evaluating a variety of therapies now the number of different medications being evaluated is quite large but i will mention a few that are most commonly mentioned just because people are likely to see this in the press one of the medications is something called from disappear and this is a medication that stops the virus from replicating and it was a risk originally developed for use in ebola and there are at least four studies that are currently underway to see whether it works with coded 19. one study with 400 patients in china will probably have results available in very early april so that's promising that we'll hear something another medication that's commonly mentioned is something called chloroquine and the related hydroxychloroquine this is a medication that all physicians are very familiar with we've been using it for decades to treat certain types of arthritis it's also been used for malaria it's not entirely clear how it may work with covid19 that said it seems to help prevent this spread of infection and there are studies underway but looking at it both in treatment of severe people people with severe infection as well as whether it's helpful in preventing people from getting infection once they've been exposed and those studies are mostly under getting underway a third medication i'll mention is something called losartan many people will be familiar with it it's used extremely commonly in the treatment of high blood pressure it is felt that it may inhibit the binding of the virus to lung cells and that might prevent infection from getting started the studies with losartan again are just getting underway one cautionary note and just reflecting how little we know some people have actually suggested that rather than helping this medication could actually make it worse and that's why we do need well done studies another thing we have also learned from china is that a common combination drug that's used in hiv infection something called lopinovir and ratanovir does not work in severely ill patients they did a well-done study and at least at the doses investigated in people with advanced voted 19 pneumonia it did not work so there's also been concern expressed about ibuprofen which many of us are familiar with some people were concerned that by suppressing inflammation it could make things worse there is absolutely no evidence for this finally in terms of that vaccine things are really just getting started the phase ones testing studies just enrolled their first couple people and a phase one study really just determines well is the vaccine safe and what type of dose do we need to generate an immune response and i suspect that it still will be some time before we get a good answer on the vaccine so the short answer is things look promising but nothing is is ready yet well thank you dr berlowitz and there's no shortage of companies here in massachusetts who are working on on that development uh jody in this part of the state we rely on community hospitals like global general janice w writes how are you prepared for this how are community hospitals like lowell general prepared for this and what is their capacity um as we face this uh this health crisis congresswoman thank you and janice thank you for the great question let me break that up and just into a couple of points first an over overarching comment um folks should have confidence that the massachusetts healthcare system is prepared and it's moving forward we have the finest health care system i think in the world and through the mass hospital association leading out with our academic medical centers in our community hospitals we are completely coordinated around focused and focused on being sure that we are putting our all of our efforts at combating this crisis so let me put it in just into a couple of categories that might make some sense for your listeners around what are the hospitals doing and specifically what are the community hospitals doing um that are closest to home i put into a couple of categories the first is that we are opening capacity it's very important during times of epidemic to take a stock of what we have available to us and to free it up and to open it up secondarily we want to take care of making sure that the patients that we're taking care of are protected so they don't exacerbate the problem and third that we're protecting our staff at circle healthy at 4 000 employees 1250 nurses that we need to protect to make sure that they are ready willing and able to take care of folks as as we move forward so things that we're doing to open our capacity across the commonwealth uh and i think inside circle and well force we kind of led the charge on this you you've all heard that we are reducing all of our elective work elective capacity that means routine surgeries routine endoscopies routine doctors visits are being postponed and pushed off and the reason for that is really twofold the first is to be sure that patients aren't coming to the hospital if they do not need to and that's contributing to this idea of social distancing of spatial distancing so people don't need to come to places where patients are are congregated the second is that we're going to protect our staff so that if folks indeed do have contamination that are coming in that we can do that in a much more of a controlled environment and then the third i'll talk about in a second is that we are preserving our personal protective equipment we call that our ppe so that we have plenty of equipment available to us as people get sick and we need to take we need to take care of them we are also taking some major steps forward with our amazing employees and our amazing physicians at creating these pools of talent so rather than furloughing people moving them into inactive status we're actually engaging folks and helping them to help us to take care of patients going forward nurses doctors and others may be reassigned to other areas of work to help us to prepare and to combat as we as we push forward we're also looking at preserving our personal protective equipment that includes increases in staff training uh and within limits the reuse of certain uh types of ppe that we can do safely this is a huge effort inside the organization of any hospital across the commonwealth helping to make sure that our staff are at elbow protected at elbow trained so that as they take care of our patients we are standing with them and then lastly i'll just mention a a a change and an enhancement of a clinical plan during times of pandemic and during times of challenge we have to take our normal workflows and shift them we've got to make sure for example that we have access to testing and i was glad that dr josh said that testing and access is improving i'm hoping that is true coming into monday it's been a little bit limited to date but being able to show our nurses and our doctors that if they have had contact that they do not have the virus we can keep them in the workforce that's terribly important to us taking a look at our icu capacity and how much can we flex to take care of folks that are going to need ventilator support which appears to be evident as part of containing this particular virus do we have access to enough ventilators and enough equipment to be sure that we are taking care of patients and i'll i'll just say that working within the massachusetts hospital association working with the governor working with mary lou sutter who's been tasked to lead this challenge they're making some major steps forward and having access to ppe access to additional ventilators access to the federal stockpile that is going to help certainly massachusetts and i think the um of course across the country uh to compete and then not to compete but to be sure we're taking great care of patients and lastly remember hospitals are still in business we're taking care of patients we still have heart attacks we still have folks with cancer we still have folks that are coming in that need our care and being sure that we are stood up and ready to keep um our lights on and keep uh taking care of great patients is a big deal for us so um we are working hard as a coordinated effort across the commonwealth my hat's off to the governor for leading hats off to mary lou sutter as our secretary for taking up the leadership in in the uh covet response and the hospitals are stepping up with changing workflow thank you uh jody and uh and hats off to you i mean i've talked to uh so many of the hospital administrators our community health center leadership in terms of immediately standing up and putting in command centers to deal with what we know will be a surge in care i'm going to take this next question it's from nicole b from lowell she wants to know how are we planning to support low-income families and families that are one paycheck away from a disaster during this crisis nicole the spread of the coronavirus presents severe challenges for working families across the commonwealth across this district they are more susceptible to an economic downturn as a result of this pandemic and that's why congress has stepped in to prepare us for the weeks to months ahead on wednesday the president finally signed the second stimulus package that congress passed which supports low-income families like the one i grew up in families that live paycheck to paycheck it includes more than a billion dollars to provide food to low-income pregnant women and mothers with young children it helps our local food banks and it feeds low-income seniors it ensures that students who depend on schools and child care for free and price-reduced meals continue to have access to nutritious foods during these closures in fact today i handed out lunches to students who are home from school at the butler and lincoln schools in lowell as well as weekend packs from the merrimack valley food bank and we will keep funding these programs so that families have access to nutritious meals for the duration i mean these are these are unprecedented times we have to make sure our families our seniors and our health care workers are supported and that they're healthy this is about helping and protecting people first and foremost in phase three which has been coming together very quickly the next stimulus package it's imperative that we provide direct immediate support such as enhanced social safety net programs and benefits but also direct payments to low uh and middle income families suspension of bill and loan repayments enhanced tax credits housing assistance and enhanced health care benefits and much much more so will as that comes together in the in the coming days i imagine uh we'll be taking an important vote on uh on the biggest package that we've voted for uh during this um during this time dr berlowitz we're back to you uh christina from berlin writes reports had previously shown that infants and young children lack their receptors to get covid19 this week the american academy of pediatrics offered a warning that the disease can spread to infants and kids perhaps with less symptoms can you bring us up to speed on all the information about children including infants and the coronavirus sure thank you congresswoman and christina so there are many misperceptions surrounding copit19 infection and one of the misperceptions is that it is a benign disease in children and young people the experience from china shows unequivocally that infants and children can get covet 19 infection now it may be true that the symptoms are less severe in some people but not in everyone in one sample of people from china children from china fewer than 50 developed a fever and cough was the most common complaint but severe infections and unfortunately even death were seen in children in china now the children who seem to be at greatest risk for severe infection children who are under five years of age and particularly children under one year of age in the very few unfortunate children who did die they mostly did seem to have pre-existing conditions so we don't really know yet the full extent of risk in younger people but the idea that it is negligible or non-existent is simply false and of course we also know that children can be a source of spreading infection to other people and we always must be aware of that risk thank you thank you uh dr giles t from sudbury wants to hear from the medical professionals not the politicians what they need right now that they do not have and what they anticipating anticipate needing over the coming weeks that they either do not have or that is in short supply he would also like to know what else we should be doing or what else we should stop doing ideally our actions would be well informed by data but unfortunately we don't currently have good information so thank you joey guiles actually for that question and uh thank you congresswoman for um asking so um guys here's where things are right now we are preparing hospitals across massachusetts and i think you heard from jody earlier about some of those preparations but hospitals across massachusetts are preparing for what will be a an increasing number of patients coming in with covered 19. some of them will be sick and require just regular hospital care and some of them will be very very sick and will require icu care and ventilator support that's where you have lung failure basically and you need to be put on a ventilator to get you through that infection there are two sets of needs that i think are really worth thinking about one is do we have enough hospital beds do we have enough icu beds do we have enough ventilators and that's a set of challenges and hospitals are working on that and while hospitals can free up hospital beds and icu beds ventilators they can't just order a few extra there are limited number of ventilators in the country and a lot of us are working on trying to figure out how do we increase the production of ventilators so we can take care of all the critically ill patients who need it the second part of this is around personal protective equipment and here i'm actually worried about where we are as a country and i can't speak about any specific hospital because i don't know the specific data for individual hospitals but we are as a country in short supply of personal protective equipment and let me explain why this is so important what we saw in china was about 3 500 doctors and nurses got infected and and some of them end up dying in italy 2600 health care workers have become infected in the course of taking care of patients many of them have died many of them have become so sick that they couldn't work anymore and obviously anybody who's infected can can't be in the hospital at the risk of spreading the infection this poses a real substantial problem we need to protect our health care workers and right now as a country i don't believe we have enough masks and gloves and all the things and gowns and all the things that we need to protect our healthcare workers and if our healthcare workers start getting sick in the course of taking care of patients it's going to make all of our challenges that much worse so i think that while hospitals are trying to do a good job of pulling together what we have and and use the the ppe the personal protective equipment wisely this is where we need federal leadership we need the federal government to be pushing much much harder on increasing production and making sure that our doctors and nurses and all health care providers have the protection they need to take care of patients when they come to the hospital thank you dr zha this is a great segue into um our next question which follows on uh to this one and it comes in a couple different forms i mean i think douglas r from groton wants to know what is being done to increase the availability of n95 masks shields and respirators for medical professionals and this question is for jody i mean it was reported recently that president trump told states to find their own respirators and ventilators and their supplies for medical workers has massachusetts figured out where to obtain these items how to obtain these items and how long will it take for delivery of them to hospitals and clinics congresswoman thank you for a great question and i want to start off my answer by just once again instilling a level of confidence that i certainly have to the folks that are listening in today um the the state government is working hard it's working effectively and with the governor's leadership and and the secretary sutter's leadership um we are we're making big progress somebody just talked about a couple of things the question was um and thank you for the question uh the availability of personal protective equipment and ventilators and things like that um if you if you take a look at the models that are out there if if this virus spreads to you know inordinate uh uh um overwhelming capacity um the ability to have all these things will be overrun at some point that being said um the commonwealth through mha's leadership and against the leadership of secretary sutter's is looking at how do we take the ppe that we have the personal protective equipment and use it most effectively so back to the hospitals for a second what are the community hospitals doing number one that what every hospital across the commonwealth is doing is adjusting its workflow uh this is not a typical tuberculosis patient this is not a typical just a flu patient we are very cognizant of the fact that we are going to have to ramp up our work train our staff effectively and be sure that we are preserving how we use our personal protective equipment what might be a routine case um 10 months ago where you come into the room once and put on equipment and then come out and take it all off again we're reworking all of those workflows so that once people are in personal protective equipment they can do multiple tasks they can take care of multiple things and therefore not have to come in and come out and come in and come out it just makes a lot of sense but that takes training it takes expertise it's why in the commonwealth and certainly at circle health we have amazing physicians and amazing nurses that are learning to preserve our p our ppe for the benefit of our patients and for the benefit of our staff for sure the n95 masks are a workhorse here for us there is um very specific guidance out from the cdc about uh during times like this about safely reusing our masks and we've taken every bit of resource every bit of intelligence and with our outstanding trainers and our doctors we are taking advantage of on a very limited basis being able to use this equipment and use it sparingly and then i'll just again hass off to the massachusetts hospital association against secretary sutter i was on a call again this morning talking about access to state and federal resources for bringing in ppe and the word is positive things are coming in there's a big load of ppe delivered to california the secretary brought out yesterday or so uh something coming to the east coast soon perhaps as much as today or into the weekend so the the federal government gets that they're pushing hard at it uh and i'm uh well we are certainly not out of the woods and not there yet i'm hoping that as we flatten this curve a bit give healthcare time to catch up a little bit and have enough protective equipment that we are exercising every lever that we have to use our equipment effectively to use our equipment efficiently and use our equipment best for our patients and and for um for our caregivers and let me just leave this question with one um a bit of optimism an array of sunshine and what other is a cloudy day you can't imagine across the commonwealth the generosity and the step up that other industries are having to help health care whether it's in boston many many construction sites that have been closed down by the mayor are now taking their personal protective equipment that we can actually adapt for medical use nicely and donating it in the lower market university of massachusetts lowell under the leadership of chancellor jackie maloney has gone through all of their labs all of their labs which are shut down and have donated every drop of personal protective equipment they have gloves masks goggles uh which is a huge thing for janice industries uh in in kingsborough has donated 500 um and uh 95 masks into lowell general mec a big electrical contractor all the idea where they needed was donated today so i just put that out as a ray of optimism and as a red community spirit across the commonwealth people are standing up for health care and ppe is going to be tight and this is going to be a this is not a sprint this is a marathon but we are working hard at it as your hospital system and we've got a lot of help from the partners that support us thank you jody well that is good news i recently heard a story out in the western part of the district in uh in gardner where an automotive repair shop had donated uh not a lot because they didn't have but they you know there was some n95 masks that they gave to hayward hospital and so just further uh confirms to us how a community pulls together but we will not be taking our foot off the gas we know we need to product uh produce at scale um behave the next question was submitted by joann d from my hometown of lowell she asks there is a lot of talk about bailing out large businesses what is the plan for keeping small businesses afloat with real cash until we get back to normal uh joanne help for our small business community is absolutely uh the top concern we're not going to let our small businesses fail i've been on the phone uh with small businesses from all across this district this week and their interests are just as deserving of assistance as large business interests particularly when they are far more likely to have paid a larger relative share of their income in federal taxes our local economies depend on our small businesses to thrive the first emergency supplemental took strong first steps by including a billion dollars in loan subsidies to help small businesses and non-profits harmed by financial losses but as we develop the next legislative package congress must include additional immediate and direct financial assistance to america's millions of small businesses independent contractors sole proprietors and gig economy workers i will plug that massachusetts has submitted a disaster declaration request to the sba the small business administration which has been approved and it makes assistance available across the commonwealth allowing small businesses to access low interest interest uh federal disaster loans and you can find the application and more information at disasterloan.fda.gov additionally we announced the creation of a 10 million dollar small business recovery loan fund for businesses of a certain size and that also includes nonprofits this fund will provide emergency capital up to 75 000 uh loans will be available to eligible businesses immediately and no payments will be due for the first six months you know there's on this issue there's so much more to be done as we're seeing small businesses grapple with no revenue with no patrons and mounting bills and it's why we're laser focused on prescriptions that will keep those small businesses afloat in our in our next package all right uh we're three quarters through the hour so i think we've got a you know we can squeeze in a bunch more questions jody i'm gonna i'm gonna go uh to you david b from fitchburg uh asks if there are plans to establish alternate hospital beds in unused office hospital or warehouse facilities to quarantine those infected from the general hospital population and from your staff congresswoman is a great question and um thanks for thanks for it uh let me give you a couple things first on the acute care hospital side um we are definitely across the commonwealth cohorting patients that means as patients come into the hospital we're putting them in places where they can be safe and cared for and keep the rest of our population safe and cared for with with the appropriate experts so we are we're we're certainly working inside the hospital with this with the respect to your question outside of the hospital what are the needs beyond post-acute care so when folks come through the hospital are now ready to go home but aren't ready to go home either quite yet or need to be quarantined or watch carefully beyond hospital exposure so a couple things are coming up first of all again with the leadership of the massachusetts health and hospital association in direct coordination with mary lou sutters and the executive office of health and human services there is a a commonwealth-wide evaluation going on right now in fact members of mha are joining with with secretary sutter's this weekend to talk about what are the opportunities with with either um federal buildings state buildings um uh dr tony monaco who's the uh president of tufts university had an op-ed i believe in the globe uh jackie maloney's engaged we're looking at what can the universities do perhaps as this pandemic moves across the commonwealth could we use spaces that are otherwise used for other things to help folks post hospital care those are all up in the air and being considered and um but most importantly i think uh on the other side of this will be this um part of this is just common sense and dealing with um recovering either at home or with loved ones there's an awful lot of evidence out there now that's saying that folks that have uh have received an infection with a carbon virus will have i'm going to say minimal symptoms and or symptoms that could be handled at home so this is a call back to if you feel ill talk to your pcp um he will or she will direct you to the hospital to the urgent care center to whatever site you might need and we are working um diligently across the commonwealth uh to find alternative spaces that if we do have to uh cohort folks in larger numbers there's an awful lot of options for us and i was very pleased by the call this morning with secretary sutter's that there's a very comprehensive effort to do just that so i want to again reassure um uh congresswoman your constituents that this is a plan that's in effect it's the best health care system i believe in the u.s and it's standing up tall during this emergency great great thank you jody um dr berlowitz derek b wright said it has been publicized the virus incubation period is 1 to 14 days if you contract the virus how long does it take until you're considered recovered and how do you make that determination to re-enter society yeah another really great question and derek is correct that nearly everyone who becomes sick will show symptoms within 14 days the average is about 5 days and by 12 days over 95 show some signs of symptoms the question then really is gee i had the infection i'm now feeling better how long do i need to remain in isolation so i don't spread the infection to someone else and there are recommendations on that i should give a question or note that recommendations likely will change pretty dramatically as we learn more for current for right now if testing is available to you the recommendation is that isolation may be discontinued if your fever has resolved if your respiratory symptoms such as cough and shortness of breath are improving and if you have two viral swabs assays that are negative on two different days so each analysis involves two swabs so it's really four tests for the virus showing that there isn't any available so if the testing is available you're feeling better your fever has resolved and the virus test is negative now we still are in the situation which hopefully is resolving that sometimes the testing is not available in that case the recommendation is that you go into isolation for at least seven days after onset of symptoms and you can then end isolation if you've been at least three days ace without any symptoms so again it takes a while and finally if you have the virus but have absolutely no symptoms the recommendation is that you want to be in isolation for at least seven days one other just note that this is mostly for people who are baseline healthy if people are you know suppressed that they can't fight off the infection as well it may take a longer time before they clear the infection and are not at risk to other people and we just don't have a clear answer on that so it takes time but people should recover and it should be able that they don't you know infect other people thank you just understood thank you dr berlowitz uh dr ja diane m from drakit wants to understand how long will we be dealing with this virus she observes that it's taken china five months for the illnesses to slow down and it may take as long to fully subside so if we have a resurgence like the second wave of illnesses uh illness as with the 1918 spanish flu it could possibly be longer do you have any type of projection along similar lines for this coronavirus yeah this is the big question is how long are we going to be dealing with it and how are we going to be dealing with it are we going to be in the kind of physical distancing staying at home for 18 months or 12 months obviously that's not tolerable our economy couldn't handle that so the the short answer is we don't know but let me say a few things about what we do know as long as we don't have a vaccine um the infection will be with us and i suspect that the vaccine is sort of 12 to 18 months away so what i have been saying is that we should be prepared for a bumpy ride over the next 12 to 18 months what does that mean does that mean we're going to be locked in our homes for 12-18 months no does that mean we'll be able to go back to work and go back to some semblance of normality i believe we will is everything going to return to where we were six months ago or a year ago it's going to be hard over the next 12 18 months and we have to be very careful and thoughtful about how we planned this out so look first and foremost we got to get testing extensively happening in our community so we know how much disease burden there is we do we're doing the physical distancing schools closed work closed for now i'm hoping that that substantially slows the virus spread out down and what will happen i suspect in a couple of weeks is that we'll start relaxing some of these lockdowns and we'll start letting people get back to work we'll start letting people maybe kids go back to school and look it all depends on what the data says i don't want to make any promises and communities will vary but i suspect we'll have some return in a few weeks are we going to have major events where 50 000 people gather in a stadium that's harder for me to see happening anytime soon so what i'm telling friends and family is that i don't see the next six to 12 months being easy but they won't be like this i think we will have extended periods of time when we can get back to work at back to school get back to many of the things that we enjoy in our daily life but until we have a vaccine or until we've built up herd immunity which basically means somewhere between 30 and 60 percent of the whole population has gotten infected which i'm hoping won't happen until that until we get a vaccine we're not going to be done with this virus unfortunately got it well in keeping with the trend i rely on my expert panel to take all the health related questions i'll take this next one from kathleen a who asks what federal and state assistance will there be for employees who will not be paid due to the mandatory three-week shutdown of businesses so the stimulus package that we just passed this week gives states the resources and flexibility to provide unemployment benefits to laid off and furloughed workers as well as those workers who exhaust their allotted paid leave this measure also provides additional funding to help the hardest hit states immediately and in the future if conditions worsen you know i'm proud that the house moved quickly on two critical release packages that support families and small businesses hit hard by the virus and protect our health care workers but i know that our workforce needs greater comprehensive support and as we consider the third stimulus package we have to think about our reach especially to workers who no longer have a source of income due to the standstill of our economy there have been many discussions around including stimulus checks in the third package which would help cash-strapped low to middle-income americans pay their bills or their groceries uh and i i believe that this this global health crisis requires drastic action uh we know the trickle-down release won't work uh we need a grassroots level response to help our workers our families uh and our small businesses avoid uh devastation uh you know i think um i think we have time for one or maybe two if we're uh if we're efficient uh questions and this one's from jonathan g and lawrence uh i think i'll take this one as well it has to do with education he asks what are we doing at the federal level to ensure our students safety while ensuring they continue their education so jonathan during this time of crisis young children students educators and institutions they all need our support i'm i serve on the house committee on education labor i'm the only representative from massachusetts to sit on that committee so i'm fighting to make sure that assistance for education is included in the next stimulus package we're pushing to provide emergency funding for early childhood programs k-12 schools and our higher ed institutions you know i've heard from parents and students in our district who are feeling the impact of schools closing and this next phase of emergency funding must enact measures that expeditiously provide broadband connections and funding for technology in homes that will bridge the digital divide we call it the home the homework gap in online learning that means taking care of kids in lowell and fitchburg and lawrence and haverhill who don't have access to internet at home or own laptops to keep up with their classes furthermore uh you know we should be shielding student borrowers from involuntary collections and the blunt of this crisis even before the pandemic our country was in the midst of a student debt crisis with outstanding debt surpassing 1.6 trillion dollars and as my other colleagues have called for congress must implement an immediate moratorium on all negative credit reporting and to ensure uh a period of debt forgiveness or loan forbearance with no additional interest accrued through the crisis on all loans the third legislative package must include measures to ensure that our student borrowers benefit from all other stimulus legislation that that helps our workers and families uh so we are we are monitoring this and i'm hopeful that we will have um an update as we go into uh next week's negotiation on this third package and so now i'm going to ask dr ja to bring us home michael c asks what would a total shutdown or home bound quarantine actually look like what restrictions for local travel would be placed on citizens is that even constitutional so i'm not a lawyer and i'm certainly not a constitutional lawyer but i'm not i think we should be very um clear about what what people are calling for um we're not calling for a police state and we're not no one's calling for in china they literally shut people into homes and enforce it with the military none of that is necessary here what we're talking about what when public health officials say we really need to shut things down and slow things down what we're talking about is essential services need to remain open grocery stores need to remain open pharmacies need to remain open obviously that means people need to get to work in those places you're going to have a certain level of mass transit that needs to remain open so workers can get their doctors and nurses and others can get to hospitals um what we're really calling for is the non-essential stuff anything that where people don't have to absolutely travel people should be trying to do at home none of us forgets how costly this is especially to hourly wage workers but to other low-income individuals and really to everybody but this is what we need to be doing in the short run to get our arms around the disease to figure out how much disease is spreading in our community and to slow that spread so our hospitals and our doctors and our nurses can take care of everybody who's sick i'm already hearing from my friends and colleagues in hospitals across massachusetts about the surge of cases they're starting to see what of patients with kovid and we need to keep this going for a little bit longer until we get our arms around this then i think we can relax things i know it's an incredibly hard time for everybody but if we stick together we can get through it and i think we can get through it strong but it is going to be hard work ahead oh thank you dr you know one thing i learned during the government shutdown was a thank you to a tsa agent goes a long way at lifting and maintaining morale and so just thanking our health care workers our grocery workers our pharmacy workers will really will really just kind of keep us as a community uplifted now unfortunately that's all the time we have for tonight i want to thank everyone on the call again for joining us and i encourage you to follow um our team on facebook twitter and instagram at rep lori trahan for constant updates about the federal and state response uh to this pandemic and also for news about future events just like this one and if there is any advice i can impart on you it's that we all have a role to play it's worth repeating that staying home and keeping your distance from others go a long way to preventing the spread you know coughing and sneezing into your sleeves frequently washing your hands and sanitizing surface surfaces it just can't be overstated i want to thank jody white dr berlowitz and dr ja again for their participation in tonight's town hall but most importantly for your leadership in our community thank you for tuning in tonight may you stay healthy and safe goodnight

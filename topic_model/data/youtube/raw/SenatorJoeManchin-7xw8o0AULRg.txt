Virginians before we hear from them I'd like to turn it over to my staff thank you Senator hello I'm Kim Berry Senator manchin's associate director of constituent Services Senator manchin's main priority is to represent West Virginia and that is why he values hearing from West Virginians each day he keeps in touch with West Virginians by meeting with constituents visiting various places throughout our state listening to voicemails reading emails and letters and sending his staff to be there when he is in Washington our staff motto is how may we help you because the senator expects us to give excellent customer service to all West Virginians who contact him the senator prioritizes his committee work on the Senate Veterans Affairs committee I think it's important to begin with the work the senator is doing in the policy arena for veterans on August 9th The Pact act the promise to address comprehensive toxics Act of 2022 was signed into law the packed act has expanded VA health care and benefit eligibility to Veterans who have been exposed to toxins in addition Senator manchin also announced that veterans across the country have a new crisis line veterans in need of help can call or text 988 and be connected to trained crisis counselors in July the senator killed the asset and infrastructure review Commission or air commission the air commission initially recommended that three of our four VA medical centers here in West Virginia had reduction in services to veterans in addition to preserving our VA facilities Senator manchin's Bill the VA provider accountability Act is expected to pass the senate in the near future this bill will ensure that VA medical centers are delivering the best possible service to our veterans as you all know the murders in Clarksburg were horrific and a preventable tragedy this bill improves the oversight and accountability of the VA and makes patient safety a priority the last thing I will highlight is especially close to Senator manchin's heart in July we lost our dear Woody Williams Senator Mansion has been working with Woody for years to ensure the last World War II Medal of Honor recipient would Lions honor at the Capitol we were able to honor Woody and his entire generation properly in a beautiful ceremony at the Capitol and the World War II monument these are just a few highlights of what Senator manchin has been working on in DC for our veterans Senator manchin has heard from many veterans all across West Virginia he understands the importance and of connecting them with a veteran service officer veterans service officers commonly known as vsos are accredited and insured to file claims on behalf of veterans and their families by making this connection veterans have help filing for benefits and are assisted throughout the processing of their claims I'd now like to share a testimonial from Denise Tucker Denise contacted senator manchin for help with her father's claim for VA benefits the assistance she was given is an example of how the senator and his case team work with the vsos in West Virginia I was trying to get benefits from my father who is 94 years old with dementia and I have been trying for two years without any success I contacted Senator manchin's office and spoke to Kimberly Berry and she got me going in the right direction she made sure that I had all the t's cross the eyes dotted and she followed up on everything that I submitted and between her and Andrea Ramsey with the Veterans Administration they both made sure that we stayed on top of things the paperwork was submitted and we actually got it done in in my opinion in record time I got a call from Cinder mansion's office and I was in Cleveland Clinic at the hospital with my husband and she called and told me that the benefits have been approved and I I can't even tell you it wasn't as long as it hadn't been two years I can assure you of that but it was such an overwhelming experience that she said the benefits have been approved moved yeah I got very emotional it means that my dad is still allowed to stay in his home with proper care and he has 24-hour care and without the benefits from the VA and the help from Center mansion's office it would never be it wouldn't have happened I wouldn't have been able to do this I would have had to put him in a nursing home if you have an issue for your veteran call Senator manchin's office they will help I mean I can't express that enough if you need help contact senator manchin's office our veterans deserve our help and they deserve our respect and

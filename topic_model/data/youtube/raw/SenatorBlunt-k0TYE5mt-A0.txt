mr president we've seen things in the pandemic crisis that nobody in living memory has dealt with in so many ways we're writing the book and trying to read the book at the same time trying to figure out how we get to where we need to be clearly there's been an incredible strain on the american economy and an incredible strain on the american health care system uh and everybody involved with that public health expert experts have told us we have to flatten the curve and the economic cost of flattening the curve was pretty great on the other side of that of that equation the impact on hospitals was significant in that many of them have been ready and waiting for whatever they needed to do and because we flattened the curve the worst case scenarios didn't occur uh and uh in most cases they were prevented and we had plenty of hospital beds and before it was over with we had ventilators and all those things we will have later but the crisis because of flattening the curve has certainly lasted longer and will last longer than it would have otherwise i'm not saying that's a bad thing i'm just saying measures like closing businesses and sending people home from work practicing social distancing putting people on the unemployment rolls have really created serious problems for people that have caused to have challenges to to really their mental well-being i think the impact is that nearly half of the adults in the united states say that the coronavirus has impacted their mental health now this is on on top of a statistic where we traditionally believe at the national institute of health and other places that one out of four or one out of five adult americans has a diagnosable and i'd hesitate i wouldn't hesitate to add a almost always treatable behavioral health problem a mental health problem but coming through the coronavirus again one half of all adults say that their mental health has been impacted uh by that whether that was social distancing or everybody trying to do everything that you'd normally do at other places at home maybe it was economic uncertainty that along with the isolation can certainly create depression and anxiety it's in almost all cases likely to be worse for people that had a prior mental health problem or prior mental health diagnosis but those aren't the only people that have been affected addiction addiction issues have become a bigger problem again than they were six months ago people that don't have access to their support system people that were moving with great focus on the part of the federal government and many state governments away from opioid addiction are in a situation where they're isolated they're depressed they're concerned about job or family or health and beginning to think what was that one thing that really made me feel good and well maybe i could just do that one more time and have that great feeling and i wouldn't get addicted again it turns out addiction doesn't work that way so you know we see people with unprecedented challenges as this almost perfect storm impacting mental health hits us last month the substance abuse and mental health services administration reported nearly a 900 percent a 900 increase in the number of calls to its disaster distressed hotline over this time last year nine times as many people calling that distress help line that disaster distress health hotline than recalling a year ago practitioners in behavioral health issues see the impact every day they're certainly warning that this could produce its own second wave of impact that lasts well beyond the time we have a treatment for coronavirus because people even if they've had the vaccine even if they've stopped worrying about the coronavirus have found themselves in a place with their mental health issues that they don't want to be but might not be able to figure out how to get out of if we don't respond quickly and we don't respond forcefully we could certainly lose more lives to this pandemic the new study from the well-being trust estimates that 75 000 more people will die from things like suicide and substance abuse because of the pandemic we're already seeing evidence that that may be a place where we're moving my hometown newspaper the springfield news leader reported this week that greene county my home county the first place i was elected as a county official has already received a 25 percent uptick in suicide and overdose deaths in the last couple of months mr president may is mental health awareness month i think it's appropriate for us to talk about the ways that uh coronavirus has widened the gap in the metal in the medical system between access to physical health issues and access to mental health issues this is the month and the time we need to realize that you can't separate those issues we need to realize that those issues are of equal concern and need to be treated equally as i mentioned before the estimate generally is somewhere in the neighborhood and one in four americans have a diagnosable mental health issue but the other estimate is that less than half of them seek any help for the care they need and as that number has grown now to one and two saying that they have concerns about their mental health or their mental health is not where it was before this all started we see a coming together of factors here that we've got to figure out how to deal with we need to take steps on how we address it we need to realize that more needs to be done we need to continue to work toward the normalization of treating all health the same in the cares act the congress did provide 425 million dollars for substance abuse and mental health services that includes more than half of that 250 million to certified community behavioral health clinics 50 million for suicide prevention and 100 million for emergency response grants to address substance and mental health disorders federal resources are critical but mr president most of the response and most of the important work will be done at the local level and so the congress also unanimously agreed in the cares act to extend the excellence and mental health and addictive treatment demonstration program through november the 30th they we added two states i talked to cms this morning about moving forward and adding those next two states of the 19 states that originally applied we've expanded this program was first authorized in 2014 and some legislation that senator stabenow from michigan and i had sponsored at the time it created the whole concept of certified community behavioral health clinics that care for patients regardless of where they live or their ability to pay hour seven day a week access it was necessary if you're going to be part of that program you can get preventative screenings you have care coordination with your other health care providers and and by the way mr president if you've got a behavioral health issue it clearly has impact on what other health issues you might have and if you're dealing with that behavioral health issue in the right way you're going to save a lot of money and a lot of caregiver time uh in most cases as you deal with your other issues if you're doing what you should be doing if you're feeling better about yourself if you're taking your medicine eating better sleeping better showing up for appointments your other health costs are going to go down so not only is this the right thing to do but it also in my view will turn out to be a money-saving thing to do to invest money where it needs to be invested in the eight states that have the the certified centers under the excellence act those patients have reported a 62 reduction in both hospitalization and emergency room visits probably though that one statistic on its own may have offset whatever investment we made in this mental health program people not going to emergency rooms obviously means you're less likely to come in contact with people that have coven 19 or some other virus we need to be sure using telehealth to connect you with your health care provider whether that's a mental health provider or another provider critically important people who are struggling with mental health or addiction are particularly challenged right now we need to let them know that they are not forgotten and no matter how alone they feel they are not alone and the congress is paying attention to this but we need to pay attention to the people on the front lines who are assuring that the right things are done in the right way at the right time

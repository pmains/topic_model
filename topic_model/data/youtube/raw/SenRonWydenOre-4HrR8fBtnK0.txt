for holding this hearing if you follow the news on trade you know that secretary Ross is a key Trump official negotiating with China determining who gets tariff exemptions and potentially reshaping the American automobile industry for decades to come in the last few days news reports about secretary Ross uncovered a short sale of stock in a Kremlin tied shipping firm new developments show that while secretary Ross was negotiating on trade with China he may have maintained financial ties with firms connected to the Chinese government a fun controlled by the Ross family reportedly owns a major international manufacturer of auto parts this unfortunately is not a one-off story virtually every day in the news you get whacked over the head with another report about Trump officials violating ethics rules or coming in to questionable winds laws you don't need a thick government rulebook to recognize flagrant conflicts of interest when they're brought into public view and when it comes to trade Americans have a right to know it's their best interest Trump administration officials are looking out for at the negotiating table the stories that we have seen in the last few days call that into question now here's why these issues are so important I'm on board with several of the administration's top trade priorities first tougher enforcement of our trade laws long overdue colleagues second cracking down on China ripping off American technology in jobs also long overdue updating you know NAFTA was written decades ago clearly it needs an update those are challenges that demand action but taking action gets harder when you're surrounded by the specter of conflict of interest that undermines the credibility of our negotiators it certainly makes it harder to work in a bipartisan way in the Congress and it makes it less likely the American people will accept the end results it is also frustrating to watch as the administration's trade moves seem more like knee-jerk impulses than any kind of carefully thought out strategy its most obvious accomplishment on trade so far is sowing a lot of chaos that has United allies in China against us that is unless you rank that behind the rescue of ZTE an action that in my view is compromise just sold out American security and gotten nothing in return chaos has consequences and you don't have to take it from me tariffs on steel and aluminum imports are in place but the process of determining what imports will be excluded is in a state of disarray businesses from sea to shining sea who are filing for these exclusions are waiting for the Commerce Department to do its job so I've heard from potato farmers in my home state of Oregon who export nearly a third of what they grow and now will face tariffs in key markets like Mexico I've heard from Pacific Northwest cherry growers who've got nearly 1.5 million boxes of cherries ready to ship to China they're worried those cherries are gonna end up stuck on the dock or rotting in a warehouse due to China's retaliation small Brewers find their cost skyrocketing when they need new can lines and holding tanks which of course are largely made of steel and now a strong well-planned strategy on trade would bring the full economic might of the United States and our allies to bear on China's trade cheating that would give confidence to American farmers manufacturers and service firms rather than creating yet more bedlam and chaos and I believe there'd be bipartisan interest here in the Senate in fresh policies that would strengthen trade enforcement and protect American workers so today has to be a beginning of the end of the chaos I hope that we'll see more from the administration in the days ahead I think it is priority business to get a clear sense of what is gonna be done to resolve these questions we hear about from our constituents every single day and those will be the questions I'll pose to secretary Ross and I appreciate him being here and look forward to questions

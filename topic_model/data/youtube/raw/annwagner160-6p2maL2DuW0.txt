and welcome to all of you one of the questions that I always like to ask when considering action or inaction as a member of Congress is how does this hearing this bill or this regulation create jobs and grow the economy in my district of st. Louis Missouri and across the nation my constituents want good-paying jobs and opportunities for themselves and their their children their families mr. Solomon the only one mr. moon you're blocking my way mr. Solomon can you discuss how your institution supports access to capital for consumers to buy a home start a business or send their their kids to college sure we we generally have not been a consumer bank but we've just started a very very small consumer business at this point in time we take deposits and we make small unsecured loans for consumers that amount from thirty five hundred to forty thousand dollars but it's a very very small business we're not currently in the business where we make mortgages for consumers but we might at some point in the future mr. Moynahan could you answer that question how are you helping my constituents get capital for them to buy homes and sort of business and send their kids college sure we provide obviously a mortgage loans to about three or four percent of the American population we do it directly last years fifty billion dollars of mortgage loans but recently we recognized that there were the time to save her downpayment has become longer under the current rules and regulations so we built a five billion dollar program to speed up the time to help people who may not be advantaged by having parents or someone who could give them the money it's down payment assistance three percent down and that goes on our balance sheet good credit quality and we do programs like that and last year we did four point seven billion dollars in low and moderate affordable housing not only homes dome but homes to rent and a good place to live how much in low and moderate-income 4.7 billion dollars last year since the crisis probably 35 40 billion dollars right you all are not just banks that provide credit and loans you're you're also providing hundreds of thousands of good-paying American jobs could we quickly go down the line and I'd ask each one of you if you're able to quickly answer how many people do your institutions employ here in the United States of America we'll start at the engineer mr. Foreman with you 67,000 over 150,000 leave 45,000 in the US 190 everyone in its 80,000 16,000 in the United States 26,000 a little less than 20,000 in the United States great thank you large financial institutions play an important role in the broader banking echo system mr. Boorman or anyone actually who can who can answer best can you talk about your relationship with banks of other sizes like community banks and regional banks while I am sure you compete with other banks for some services do you not also provide critical services to many of the smaller banks and institutions yes we do we engage in a number of activities for them whether it's raising capital helping them manage their liquidity providing various forms of financial advice and being there as a participant in the markets with other financial institutions a lot of the smaller financial institutions don't have the technology some of the capability that the large institutions of West to have simply because of their scale else mr. Corbitt yes we provide financial services for banks of all shapes and sizes community banks regional banks national banks and every bank sitting at this table with me is a client of our bank very good point I also serve as the ranking member on diversity and inclusion mr. Moynahan who drives diversity and inclusion at Bank of America I do and the other management team members drive it you know interesting most people talk about diversity and inclusion as a kind of HR issue why is it important to you as a CEO and to the business we want to have a place a company to be a best place to work we want every teammate to come to us and simply be able to say no matter who I am when I come in a door I can be all I want to be one here do you have pathways to more senior positions that are filled with qualified people successfully added diversity gear we're 50 percent women 40-plus percent women managers just in the last three years the top three layers the company wants from about 35 percent women to 45 percent women in terms of people color or 45 percent overall people color and 37 percent people color managers and we continue to watch that in every unit in every business review are you making progress the goal of having our company reflect society at large but importantly we want to make sure that people can go from that entry job to our jobs and that's what you're striving for wait thank you very very much I my time is expired I yield back

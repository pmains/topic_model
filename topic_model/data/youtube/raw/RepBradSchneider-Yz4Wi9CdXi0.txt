hello and welcome everyone thank you for joining us I'm congressman Brad Snyder and it's my privilege this evening to host this conversation with some leaders in our community working with Latino organizations to talk about the disparities that we're seeing in in our community on the effects of the corona virus and koban 19 before I begin I do want to do some housekeeping things this evening is being simultaneously broadcast in Spanish if you want to in Spanish you can there should be a button to press on the screen to choose either English or Spanish I will tell you that we've been having some technical difficulties with the two lines if we do run into trouble particular dark and I think we do have that I can hear the Spanish I think it's working but if we do run into troubles over the course of evening we are recording this and we will post this in on our website and on YouTube and the Spanish will be there as well so we're doing our best to make sure that everyone can participate and be be comfortable but again when I thank everyone for joining us this evening I'm grateful you are with us I'm grateful to have a wonderful group of panelists joining us this evening louia Kim youngness is the health policy director at the Illinois Coalition of immigrant and refugee rights Dulce Ortiz is the executive director of mano-a-mano Family Resource Center and Angie sentian is the clinical practice manager Roslyn Franklin University health clinics well thank you again for being with us this evening what what I want to do before I turn it over to the panelists is just take a few moments to go over a couple of things we're seeing within our community as you all know the Kobe virus or the Kobe 919 pandemic has affected all of our communities across the nation literally across the world but it is clear that it is affecting the Latino community in particular in particularly hard just a couple of statistics within Illinois Latinos have the highest proportion of cases of any ethnic group within the state in Lake County when accounting for differences in age between populations for everyone non-white Hispanic person being infected and getting sick with Koba 19 eight Hispanic residents are contracting the disease an eight to one ratio which is extremely dramatic state data shows that 54% Latinos tested are confirmed to have the virus which is the highest percentage of any group with within Illinois just some proportion in general for whites it's 14.4% 31% for african-americans 30% among Asians and again 54% positive rates among Latinos part of that may reflect the fact that the Latino community is being under tested with respect to other other communities but also its reflection I think of the high positivity the high impact this virus is having it's not just in in Illinois it's across the country for example in New York Latinos and African Americans are dying at twice the rate as non-latino whites in New York City and we're seeing that in other places around the country our goal today is to explore with our panel the reasons for these disparities we also want to acknowledge at the panic the pandemic is exposing and making worse inequalities that already exist what we're seeing in these disparities it's not just because of the moment because of things that have existed in many cases for a very very long time and things that we need to understand and work to address going forward in Congress just to share some of the things that I'm working on we've already passed legislation and signed into law to make sure the testing is free for everybody irrespective of their immigration status irrespective of their economic status we want to make sure that everyone in the United States wherever they are whenever they need it can get a test we need to do a much better job of making tests available but the cost should be free for everyone we wanted to make sure that not just that it was testing but if you are positive if you aren't affected by the corona virus and you come down with Coppa 19 we'd like to see and then the house is working to make sure that treatment is well available to everybody we need to make sure that passes in the Senate working to do that and that's part of the negotiations going on the other piece and we'll talk about this is part of the reason we're seeing the disparities is because it's the essential workers people working essential industries whether it's health care making sure that our food supplies are safe and secure this stores grocery store shelves are stocked people transiting material and medical products food across the country many of those essential workers are coming from our Latino community and many of these people putting their lives on the line literally just to go to work it's something that we need to address compounding that problem is the fact that we have had shortages of the protective equipment PPE personal protective equipment the gloves and mask shields the Gaus people need to be safe as they're working and we're trying to get more of that and invested in that so we need to do a better job of keeping people safe preventing people from getting sick identifying those who do gets thick and when they do get sick making sure they have the treatment they need and we need data to understand that so we are also working on legislation for example the equitable data in a collection and disclosure code with 19 act nice short name but this is legislation that would give us that information and I continue to work on that so just that was my general reduction what I really want to do is have a broad conversation with our guests I'm glad today to be joined by these three panelists who on a daily basis are out in our communities making a difference lifting us up again thank you for each each and everything that you do lluvia quinones a health policy director I served I'm going to start with you and if you could take a few minutes and talk about what you're seeing what your organization is doing and what we should be aware of Thank You congressman I'm good evening when a star base on thank you again for the invitation and I think you mentioned a few things congressman that unfortunately are impacting our Latino and overall immigrant community I would say that not only is that unfortunately because many individuals in our community are essential workers but I would also add that there is a lot fear and anxiety over over the years especially this last year since the public charge rule was enacted in February and I will say lastly even before this crisis the number of uninsured Latinos is very significant so not only did I have access prior to this crisis but they also where I'm the high high number of individuals overall around health disparities on Weatherby chronic illnesses are overall just the lack of having a medical home I think what we're seeing in this last two months and a half I believe that we've been going through this crisis is individuals either losing their jobs because of the shelter in place but also seen a decrease in their hours and unfortunately as you reference many of them are not eligible for any of their federal funds so really seeing a lot of organizations like mono mono and others really stepping up and trying to provide needed services but obviously that's still not enough great thank you and next we'll hear from dos Ortiz the executive director I thought I saw those thank you so much congressman Schneider for the invitation as you know madam I know our mission is to empower immigrant families to become full participants in their communities and I think that more than ever now it's really important for us to be able to support our Latino community as you know lluvia and as you mentioned our community has been one of the hardest hit and unfortunately the one that lacks the resources and the one that lacks sort of like a plan B of where to fall back when we started noticing know that our community members we're losing their jobs as we know from some of these members were dead in the service industry which was one of the first ones to shut down restaurants so on and so forth they were highly impacted especially in the areas of Highwood and Highland Park for the Waukegan area you know most of these community members or get factories we started noticing a pattern where a lot of these community members were getting infected at their place of employment and not really unfortunately being heard by these employers so one of the things that mano mano has done in working for their behalf in the advocacy efforts is work with the Lee County Health Department to be sure that our community members have been protected that they are provided with the necessary protective equipment that they are also their places of employment are you know sanitizing making sure that the facilities are safe for them to work in but that's one of the trends that we're seeing that unfortunately many of these families have been infected at their place of employment bringing the virus into their homes one of the things that most importantly one of these that we came up with was our ganda our Emergency Assistance Fund which helps undocumented individuals with basic necessities access to food prescription medication but also because of the impending daca decision by the Supreme Court we know that some of the daca recipients have lost their employment and unfortunately they don't have the 495 dollars available to renew their fee and if they do most likely it's going to be to help out their family members so we're also assisting with daca renewals we wanted to make sure that those that are eligible for public benefits are able to exit unfortunately because of the environment that this administration has created many of our community members are afraid due to the public charge and so that's also something that that we're seeing many families that could really benefit from this assistance are turning our turning away that assistance because they're afraid that maybe later in the future it might affect their opportunities to become you know legal citizens here in the United States and so there are a lot of barriers there are a lot of things that you know we are doing to work our community members with our partner organizations but we're also very grateful I want to give a shout out to the mano mano staff that have been working from home almost non-stop to be able to provide these services but also to our donors and our funders because of them we've been able to assist more than 500 families and we've been able to raise approximately three hundred thousand dollars for for this fun so we're very grateful for that but we still need more donations absolutely incredible the generosity of our community across the board has been really remarkable it's unfortunate that too many organizations and too many people are left relying on this and we need to make sure that the government support is getting out where it needs but last but not least let me turn over to Angie Cynthia clinical practice manager hi um well first of all I want to thank you congressman Schneider for for this opportunity to be able to bring and address the concerns of our community or Latino communities who are struggling with the testing or getting access or according to the healthcare facilities people who don't have transportation so to bring this information and to hopefully bring the resources to them versus them coming to us being a health care facility and now a Cova site testing we are trying to look at ways to bring that service to the communities around the county wrongly ground like beach eniac sign in the south side of Waukegan Mundelein and trying to partner up with other organizations so obviously one of the things that we struggle the most is the funding for the testing especially for the latino community that do not have insurance access to to state funds or government funds and john island who's our president has been working tirelessly to try and find partners or ways to find funds to be able to provide these services to our communities - we have a drive-through test inside here we have certain days for that we are we are talking about expanding its you to actually bring it to them through our community care coach which is a mobile coach who drives to the communities either churches or schools or nursing homes to try and test as many as many people as we can regardless of your immigration status regardless of your income status regardless of insurance status but we have the staff we have the ability to do that we just really need to find the funding for the testing so that that's our biggest goal right now bringing that the testing to the community well thank you again as I said in the beginning the law that Congress passed President signed says testing is free to everyone regardless of immigration comparative employment regardless of insurance so I absolutely focused on that well thank you and thank you for the introductions let me ask a couple questions I do want to apologize I was just notified that our translation service is not working this is a new service for zoom and I guess the wrinkles haven't been fully ironed out as I mentioned we are recording this and we will make sure that the translation is put up with recording so everyone will be able to access but I do apologize we touched on a number of the reasons in our introductions on why the Latino and other communities of color are being impacted for most in this crisis but I might spend a little more time digging down and what are you seeing as some of the key whether it is things that existed in the community prior to the pandemic elements we touched on people going for the work haven't go to work during the pandemic what do you see is this that the key things and I'll go across as it shows my screen they'll see why they start with you yes I mentioned earlier you know one of the things when our community members were calling in for the Tunde assistance emergency fund they were mentioning you know how they were getting infected at their place of employment and they didn't feel the adequate personal protection equipment was being you know made available to them also withholding information of co-workers I had tested positive and that they you know through word-of-mouth and not necessarily from the employer and I think that you know what that's one of the biggest issues that we're seeing here not just through you know like let the the public know how the inequity is that we're seeing right now especially in Lake County when we look at the Lake County statistics right now as of today we had six thousand eight hundred and thirty-one people they have tested positive hope in nineteen and 216 deaths out of those six thousand eight hundred and thirty-one Waukegan has the most it is the community that has the most individuals that have been affected with 1964 compared to Lake Forest a house ninety-five compared to our neighbors you know Ernie 189 compared to Libertyville which is 69 so right there and then you can see the inequity because these individuals are not don't have the luxury like us to work from home they have to do they have to work and also just the fear of losing their jobs and the fear of plant closing down and maybe there are family members also losing those jobs I think that not having that basic support and resources from the state or federal government are pushing our families that are already in survival mode to make decisions that no family should be put through so those are the major that we're seeing you know in addition to Olivia stated you know most of our community members don't have health insurance don't have access to adequate health care and then also encountering barriers just like the testing facility here in Waukegan and Thank You congressman to you and your office for working with us when it was first brought to our attention that they were asking you know individuals that wanted to be tested if they were citizens and so that's something that's very intimidating that's something that you know we don't know how the information is going to look it travels the word of mouth and so that was a deterrent for our community members to say they were exposed to a family member say if someone at work positive you know they're not going to want to put themselves or their families at risk right and just to emphasize that is number one they shouldn't be asking the question but more importantly no one has to answer that question that testing site will accept you under any circumstance everyone so open all comers if they are they shouldn't ask the question if you are asked the question just leave a blank you do not have to answer it and it can still be tested so that's an important to note I also you talked about what Keegan with almost 2,000 cases Round Lake Beach has about 350 cases around Lake honor in 20 cases of underlying 250 cases so it's not just isolated to our Keegan you're seeing it where we have a large concentration of people who are working in essential industries part of it is the federal government has to do a better job of getting to the states the PPE so the people who are being asked to work have the protection they have but it's also we need to make sure the employers are providing the PPE assuring the social distancing and that people can be safer in their work let me go to you next and you know you're taking and your organization works with immigrants as well specifically the time--as grants not just within the Latino community but your thoughts on some of the things that are driving differences I think I'm similar to what has happening in Waukegan and we have noticed throughout the state of Illinois that certain cities they have large concentrations of immigrants as well as low-income individuals are facing higher number of kovat whether it be dust or testing i'm similar to unfortunately in the african-american community that also continue to see an increase and i think a lot of the inequities are largely due to that I think in our community not only some of the things that have already been mentioned but also the lack of language accessibility as well as cultural competency we all know as a child of immigrants myself that when it comes to certain things either if the parent doesn't speak the language they rely on the child and vice versa and also within our in the immigrant community we have a large number of mixed status families so a lot of the times even if the person may be a US citizen but if they have a relative that's undocumented then they're not gonna want to access certain things and that leads unfortunately to further not only the inequities but also not always wanting to see care or attention that they may need so I think unfortunately on some of the things that we're seeing in the Latino community are not only there I think because other immigrant communities whether it be in the Aero community as well as Asian one the numbers are a little bit lower in size but also the way that their ethnicity race gets tracked I'm unfortunately is under white and a lot of the keys especially for the Arab community so but we also we know that that it is happening and unfortunately the numbers are high and again for similarly right thank you and Angie from respect your perspective and sitting at Rosslyn Franklin what are you saying well sitting arose in Franklin and having conversations with our patients they it's the lack of pay sick leave and these individuals continue to work even when they are sick or wanting to go back even though they're still testing positive still having symptoms why because of paying bills lack of insurance making sure that their family has food security you know these individuals can go out and they have to go out more often than others to the grocery store therefore exposing themselves and then exposing their families so I think one of the biggest things that I've had conversations with our patients has been again the lack of the benefits at their employment that these individuals continue to work and expose other workers but then also exposing their families their kids the elderly who have these underlying conditions so that's that's we've had a lot of conversations a lot of different conversations in the grocery stores I have my scrubs on people stop me and and you know they they they ask me these questions like where can I go again I've mentioned it before is is the lack of not having a vehicle you know there's a family in a household of four or five I they share the same vehicle and they work long hours so having accessibility and transportation to come to our site it's it's difficult for them yeah and along with Medusa was mentioning as well as oh yeah I mean there's this has been going on not just in the pandemic I mean obviously it's worse now but but it's been going on for a really long time all right absolutely and we'll come back and talk about health insurance well you know I want to first go to the testing and we've touched on some of the pieces the barriers to testing the immigration question obviously the example but are there other barriers to testing that we need to be aware of again Congress made it very clear testing should be free to everybody period stuff but we know that especially within the Latino community there still appears to be a under a lower take up in the testing and you know we want to get everyone tested it needs to be tested yes I would say that the other two things that we've been hearing is um you know that at some of the sites um they do ask for IDs and I would like to clarify here that the main reason that they're asking for that is mainly just to make sure that the person lives in Illinois I know technically it's a resident of Illinois I don't always use it that way because in our community when you say resident of Illinois a lot of the times they think they have to be a legal permanent resident um so I want to make sure everyone knows that yes you may be asked for an ID but that could be anything that has your picture whether it be your passport even if it's a foreign passport for those of you that are from Mexico as well as a few other countries if you have a method Akula anything that just proves your identity and even if you have a utility bill we are working with the state as well as the Illinois Department of Public Health to make sure that no testing site turns anyone away for not having a state issue ID I'm sorry just like to assure people one that that's the reason why they're asking for that I will at the end and provide some resources for people could call in case they are having issues around that I mean I would say the second thing that's holding back on individuals is also not knowing that even if they're uninsured that they could access the testing for free I think for the longest because of the capacity individuals didn't know that if you have the symptoms or in the last few weeks if you are an essential worker that you could also access any of these testings and I think lastly connected to some of the earlier comments sometimes people think that whenever they're receiving something for free from the government it can be connected to public charge so I also want to assure people that by getting tested yes the test the test is free it does not effect you anything regarding on public charge even if you're undocumented thank you for bringing that again that's something we put in the law that provided for the testing we need to I'll say it over and over we have to have everybody tested it doesn't matter I want my next door I want everyone in my neighborhood to be healthy in my community to be healthy if someone gets sick we want to know know that they're sick get them the treatment they need and try to isolate them from getting their family sicker or everybody else sick so the testing becomes really important and we to push that out don't say yeah yeah mano-a-mano you're working a lot of people in the community are there stories are hearing that my chemist demonstrate why people are reluctant to be tested or getting the treatment for the virus Dulce you're on mute one of the things that we certainly are hearing is in the beginning unfortunately testing was not as available and so they were having a very difficult time trying to get tested for those that did get tested unfortunately now they have big medical bills that they have to pay and so with the education community education I think that we have to do better in letting our community members know in their language you know a set language accessibility that testing is free again you know when we talk about the barriers about the citizenship question you know that that poses a risk to our families one of the stories that really stands out for me is with our applications our emergency community fund I go through those applications and I did see one a you know a mom I think I believe was a family of five she had been hospitalized for seven days and she got a hospital bill for $21,000 so when she called the hospital she was told that it was her responsibility and that she would have to figure out a way today and so when you hear these stories and we know Latinos talk we like to talk we like to talk to our friends our family when you hear stories like that you know and you're sick you're gonna do you know whatever you can in your own home thinking that you know you're gonna save yourself some money but and we know that you know you're just gonna you know things are gonna progress and you may get worse and you'll need to be hospitalized but just the fear of not having health insurance the fear of not knowing how to pay for it the fear of not having a job that you're trying to even provide you know just food on the table and making sure that you eventually have enough money to pay your to three months friends that you're behind in I think all of that it just you know it creates like a domino effect that individuals you know are just afraid of not only the expenses but also afraid to find out that they do have it you know and what does that mean for them I do have actually a family member that didn't want to go get tested he was very sick did I want to go get tested just for the fear of finding out that he actually did have it and so um I think that you know our families have been through a lot of trauma even before this crisis happened so trying to figure out you know what is the best way to to proceed you know try to have family members tell them you know you need to go get tested you need to go to the hospital it takes a lot it takes a lot because again of all the barriers and everything that you're thinking about you know while trying to make this decision well do I have the money to go into a hospital or emergency care you know it's something that you know as you mentioned um the care sack is supposed to pay for treatment of kovat 19 but we don't know if undocumented individuals can get treatment I know lluvia has been trying to get you know an answer for this we still haven't found anything that's you know confirmed that they're able to get you know assistance in the treatment for Kobe 19 but we also heard that if there's other you know issues that are played because of this virus it may not be covered and so you know it's just a lot that our community members are going through and you know having the virus it just means more medical expenses for them that they can't afford at the moment sure and I can share the conversations we've been having at least within the Democratic caucus in the house providing care someone does get sick making sure that they have the care and that they're going to be covered as you touch something takes the pressure there's a peace of mind that comes with it the alternative approach that's been offered is what we'll just pay the hospitals for treating people who don't have insurance but that doesn't mean that the people who don't have insurance know that they're going to be covered it creates more uncertainty so the what we're trying to do is make sure that people understand we achieved it with the no matter where you are where you come from you can be tested we need to make sure if you get sick with Kovac you can be cared for without that uncertainty and that's what we're trying to do it's unfortunate not and cares and it's included in the bill that passed the house Friday but that's now being negotiated with the Senate so we need to fight more on that and you may have some experience with that as well but I want to go to Angie next because you know Angie clinics like clinics like rosalind Franklin in the best of times are working to get out into the communities let people know here we are here's the services we provide in a crisis like this that information is even even more important so you know if you expand to expand a little bit on on what Rosen Franklin is doing to get that message out so we an are and have reached out through email text messages and phone messages through our electronic medical system to all of our patients notifying them of our services of our covert testing drive through hours of operations we've actually said certain days of the week for for example Tuesdays and Thursdays sick patients Mondays wellness visits make sure that we keep our patients our staff and our providers safe we don't want to mix the sick ones and the babies that still need their vaccines so we're trying we're really trying to communicate the best that we can and I know there was a posting a couple weeks ago in the local newspaper about about our testing drive through when you see the lot of calls our website and through Michael Smith who is the director of the community health engagement the mobile community care coach reaching out to our existing relations with mano-a-mano SafePlace Lake County Health Department so we're doing everything that we can to reach as many people as we can in our next step in our next goal is actually to to mobilize in the care coach as I mentioned before earlier we have the capacity we have a lab actually the RFU immunology lab runs our test testing turnaround time currently is at 24 hours for 248 so they have the capacity to run a couple hundred tests a day we we just need you know now now that you you touched on the bill passing that everyone can get tested for free you know that's good information that I can bring to the table and now I mean how much more we're just really trying to get out there to bring the service to them so they don't have to worry about coming to us when they don't have the means great thank you and thank you for doing that lugia I want to go back to you you mentioned earlier the concerns about being labeled of a charge as a cause for fear and fear just in general about either being tested being receiving a positive test so being infected or being sick and needing care effecting immigration status if you're affecting other things can you touch on on that again I don't want anyone ever to be concerned about getting health care that they need getting you know getting well that's what everybody but I know it's reported a lot and you could touch them that I'd be grateful if I made congressman I just wanted to reference something in regards to the hospital bills even though we still do not have assurance from the governor's office that treatment for kovat is free um I do want to tell people that even putting that aside there is state law that says any non for profit hospital needs to provide financial assistance to anyone that lives in Illinois is uninsured and it's low income at the end I am going to provide a hotline which is icers in case there are any issues and people are being denied or are not being offered that which would be illegal and we're happy to get and we're happy to involved the attorney general's office so just to mention that um in regards to public charge um I think at this point many people know that I'm the new public charge we'll did go into effect back on February 24th of this year despite some lawsuits I'm even though we still have a few pending and so hopefully there'll be some changes but the public charge rule again when it comes to cold at-st nobody should be afraid but the main reason just to highlight a little bit the reason why people are afraid despite a lot of ArtReach that everyone has been doing from community organizations to us as icer is that over seventy percent of undocumented individuals in illinois live in mixed status families so even if we tell individuals that it's not going to affect them just the day to day lives they're just afraid of something changing in the future in case somebody does not know what public charge is it's I always say think of it as a test it's a mainly affects on two groups of individuals those that are seeking a visa I'm trying to enter the u.s. or those that are trying to adjust your status or change their status from one visa to another and they're in the US or for example if you're trying to go from a visa or on document and then trying to apply for a green card and those individuals through their immigration interview will be asked a series of questions based on their skills education level income and many other factors I'm defending what they are there is a long list of negative factors and again depending on the situation skills etc if the immigration official things that this person in the future anytime in the future meaning even ten years from now the person may seek assistance from the government then they could be considered a public charge okay great thank you for sharing that and let me open this to the whole panel yeah and I've heard from a number of people who are going to work their companies considered a essential employer or whatever they're showing up at work every day people feeling that they're not getting the necessary protective equipment to be safe while they're working what are you all hearing in that context and Angie are you hearing anything specific people you're talking with uh yes to specifically to the to the workers the the grocery workers having to use the same loves for how many hours and having to to use the same mask for you know reusable reusing the mask I know and non-facility luckily right now what we're all pay is it is hard to get PPE even for our health care workers but and you see that a lot in hospitals but right now we we are facility we were okay with that but yeah we we see it and in the factories you know they they tell them to wear a bandana they tell them to wear a cloth instead of the facility providing the employers the PPE don't say you're in similar stories yeah this is the beginning of yeah that you know the place of employment is one of the main reasons why our community members and you know Latino community are becoming infected and bringing that home again not being able to get access to personal protective equipment the employers not being proactive in not only protecting the employees but also in regards to keeping their facility sanitized clean and also sharing of information right as I mentioned earlier we heard stories of community members that they knew co-workers not going to work because they tested positive for koba 19 but they didn't hear a peep from their their employer and so I think that we need to do better in regards to making employers accountable because again if they're trying to keep their you know their their their line going they have to be you know cognizant that if we don't practice social distancing if you don't you're not providing the necessary protective equipment then of course people are going to get infected I think it shouldn't be left up to the community members to figure out a way how to protect themselves because again they're already going through a difficult enough crisis that you know for some of them even having just a job they look at it as you know well at least I have a job you know if they can't provide me with this well at least I have a job the other issue is you know with this temporary employment agencies also sending workers and also not providing the equipment themselves or if any worker voices any type of concern then they get laid off and you know there's ten people lined up to get that job and so that makes things a lot more difficult I think and that we as organizations you know as community leaders we have to do better and being better advocates for our community members at least right now that's where you know at least in mano-a-mano we're seeing where the virus is you know just taking a hold of you know the employees and then bringing them home but also in working with you know the late honey health department they did see that there was a big disparity when they come up with these statistics and so they did convene a working group we actually met this morning it's the Latino community partnership group and so we are meeting to find out solutions or ways to be sure that our community you know is protected but also to stop the spread of the virus and what can we do in order to achieve that so we are working the community health I mean the Lee County Health Department with other organizations other Latino community members here in Lee County and you know we do hope and we do count on your congressmen to make these employers responsible for what they're doing you know not only are the taxpayers left you know to fill the builds of you know the medical treatment the testing but also they have to do something on their part under and to be responsible and making sure that they're protecting their employees especially those that are vulnerable communities right now a hundred percent and in the bill that passed last week there's a reinforcement that OSHA the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has to be involved in giving guidance to the employers of how to keep their employees safe but at the same time we have to hold those employers accountable for following the guidelines and be punished at the end of the day this is about keeping our neighbors keeping our friends healthy and safe and you know there are some industries that we're gonna have to keep open we shouldn't be asking anyone to put their lives on the line unnecessarily giving them the PBE making sure they have this spies make sure that the government provides that guidance and that the companies follow that guidance has to be a part of any solution Looby I want to come to you on this as well anything you're hearing anything we should know about with respect to what employees are saying specifically PPE yes oh we've been hearing similar concerns that on both Angie and those I mentioned I think many individuals they're trying their best whether it be by buying their own gloves or making their own masks etc but the reality is that many facilities are not providing PPE for different reasons I think sometimes on the one hand there is a limited number available - I think it also to be very honest direct I think in a lot of locations sometimes they just don't always care or don't always prioritize our community I'm despite all the work that they do um so I know that some of our member organizations are working on this and are advocating not only for the workers rights whether it be if they do want to not go to work because somebody did get tests positive but also it is one of our ask when it comes to icers i'm legislative platform i'm to make sure that the governor is providing that on as much as you can as well as holding employers accountable if they are expecting for them to go to work great thank you I want to take some questions we've got and I should have said this in the beginning I've got questions on the Q&A panel I'll get questions on the chat so I'm gonna try to pick up a couple from each but before we do that I just want to comment we've had more than 80 people join this call today so again I want to thank our panelists for joining us but all the people who did join and you know we're talking a little bit about multiple levels of government here as well I want to emphasize the work happening there the bill is the cares Act the heroes Act is that the federal level legate you talked about legislation state level and executive orders from the governor and our County and our municipal governments are all we have to work together and we have to work all as the community to protect everyone community so that's something I'm committed to I'm gonna take some questions here as I look through the list on the questions line if you're the well one real quick one was Angie how can people connect contact with Roslyn Franklin you can mention that and I'll pull the next one up yeah so you can give us a call number is a four seven five seven nine three two three nine that is our main line and that is aligned to the AMAs nurse's station that's one way that you can do and that's actually the best way to do it okay and on the question Manny Hernandez wrote one of the barriers to access health care a big part of the social determinants of health is the trust or lack of trust and lack of providers to them they can identify with the cultural background the view of volunteers wearing army it performs police cars with flashing lights and the facility that's considered governmental and not a health institution while Keegan's testing site is a big deterrent for a lot of our community members I guess it was a question but I see some heads nodding over there wants to touch on that one more briefly so to touch a little bit on that and yes I've also had patients or members of the community talk about concerns about false negatives not having a health care professional and having the test be as self administered how accurate are they got it and you know some of these questions questions will have major corporation looking like County contributed necessary funds they know a lot of the corporation tripping funds and donations also PPE - the hot PPE to the hospitals and so there is and looking for a lot of comments thank you for the comments looking for questions hype apologize for this so will we soon be able to get more gloves and masks for places like public libraries maybe by early June from Victor Dixon Victor a great question I'll touching this we've seen shortages of supplies really making it a problematic throughout the first few months of the crisis I was on a call today with FEMA for the Midwest region and we talked about it raised the question how do we get more the legislation that passed last week the heroes Act a piece of it was legislation I didn't introduce I've been pushing for getting supply chain management making sure we have that PPE as well as the medical devices the ventilators everything else where we need it so it's it's the hospitals it's the nursing homes it's the grocery stores it's everywhere we really need the president using the legislation passed 50 years ago they are so many years ago I guess the defense production act working with our companies to get that supply available and then working with the states and the federal emergency management administration to to ensure that we can have it how necessary who needed hospitals and health care centers centers like nursing homes and clinics like rosalind Franklin will be into the essential industries and eventually as we start to open up libraries and hopefully schools that it's there as well so this is something that we need to be putting pressure on government it's at all levels possible this is from Carol Carolina once is there a surance that employees can't lose their jobs if they exercise the right to stop going to work when they know firsthand co-workers tested positive gospel expand it what have you told people and then I'll touch on to close what have you told people who say I'm afraid to go to work I just am worried about getting sick I've got health conditions or someone in my family has underlying health conditions I just can't take any risk in bringing this virus into my into my home or infecting my family people are asking you those questions Booya um we have gotten some of those questions because we're not a direct service organization and we or we don't see patients like Angie and Dulce on to a lesser extent for our undocumented on community the answer unfortunately it's a little difficult because on the one hand individuals do have the right to not go to work but when it comes to unemployment insurance on they're not able to claim it other individuals would be able to claim unemployment insurance if they choose not to go to work and because of their safety or because they need to take care of a loved one that was tested positive does they about people coming to mano-a-mano what are you hearing and what have you been telling them yeah well you know same as lugia stated unfortunately they don't have something to fall back on and so they are afraid to go to work they are afraid of you know bringing this virus into their homes unfortunately you know and even if they have a loved one that has tested positive they don't have the luxury to unfortunately not go to work right because they're not eligible for unemployment benefits the other thing too is that unfortunately with these employers that have over you know 500 employees then we know that some of the policies that were passed through Congress where has to be tested positive if you would get you know I believe it was 80 hours paid leave unfortunately they don't qualify and so that's not something that they can offer to the employees or something the employees can take advantage of and again not having any you know personal time off or any personal benefits vacation time sick time they don't have you know that luxury and again most of these employees are contracted by temporary agencies employment agencies and so they're not eligible for any benefits because they're not permanent employees of the company so again it's you know putting themselves at risk but some of them you know they have been vocal they have called us they said you know I don't feel safe here at work what can I do who can I contact but they want to remain anonymous the other issue that you know one of the things that not only the Lake County Health Department but also us is that individuals that do test positive and they say you know I work at a factory most often than not they're not going to disclose the name of their employer for fear of retaliation or fear that the employer is going to find out and they're going to get terminated or for fear that the factory is going to be closed down or shut down by either the Health Department or the state and they have family members and friends that work there so it's a fear factor overall unfortunately and again it's because you know not being able to access you know the benefits that the majority of us aren't able to access that you know puts these families in very difficult situations and they have to make very difficult decisions well thank you and I do believe to that point now I get to my last question for all of you is if someone does have a concern about employer there's a number for the Lake County Health Department at least in Lake County to reach out to I'm sure the same is in Cook County but my last question for everyone and start with you guys how you put it up on the message board for everybody where can people go for help as we wrap up which we make sure everyone knows about as far as if I have a concern if I have a need who can I call so yes just for you mention congressman I did put in the chat box on two different phone numbers so locally mano-a-mano just assist anyone that needs assistance with public benefits if somebody is on here that does not live in the area and we do have a statewide program that could assist anyone to apply for Health and Human Services programs and that's to the immigrant family resource program and that phone number is eight five five four three seven seven six six nine if you have issues when it comes to health access or as I mentioned before hospital bills etc which should not be the case we also do have a hotline on that you could ask for a couple of different services from detention to immigration matters but also around health care I'm that hotline is eight five five four three five seven six nine three I also put in the chat box and lastly for those that care about at the local that I should say at the state level we do have a town how this Thursday which is May 21st at 4:00 p.m. through icers Facebook live it will be public and we are going to be I'm taking advantage that this week on the governor and the legislators are in session so we do want to make sure that our priorities are being heard and the immigrant community is being heard great thank you Dulcy how about for mano-a-mano who can people contact um I will put our phone number on the chat box but again you know one of the things that we're focusing on right now is the bombuh you know this emergency community fund for undocumented individuals and families we're providing you know basic necessities again you know groceries prescription medication any personal toiletries so on and so forth diapers formula for babies unfortunately some of the organizations here in Lake County are not able to provide this type of assistance because you have to have you know because of you have to meet their eligibility requirements and so that's what we're doing right now also a great source I would recommend is to one one phone number where we have all the resources in Lake County available and they do speak Spanish so for those that need were for example rental assistance I know that Isis and what Keegan is helping with a rental assistance and so you know for mano-a-mano we continue providing the same services that we did in the past whether it's legal immigration whether it's our online classes adult education for GED ESL our citizenship classes also our successful children's program is going to provide our kindergarten readiness online again most importantly you know mono mono is a welcoming center designated by the state of Illinois so our purpose is to you know help individuals access public benefits access health care and whatever we can do if we don't provide that assistance we're more than happy to assist our community members and finding someone that will great thank you and Angie I actually posted our main line as well as my direct number for those organizations that have more questions on the testing and to be informa and we can keep communication

stocking our groceries such shells people driving products across the country making sure that our streets are clean our streets are safe I mean you just run down the list so many people are working so hard and literally putting their lives on the line for us we all downgrade great gratitude that we've only begun starting to discuss and conversations like this how we start to pay that we have a

we turn now to the violent extremism that took place on january 6 2021 which will be a topic again this week for the committee looking into that attack congressman adam kinzinger sits on the committee and he joins us this morning from shanahan illinois good morning congressman good morning the committee is called the january 6th committee but it seems from the first hearing that in fact january 6th is encased in a larger argument that you're making that president trump made a series of efforts to overthrow the election and the january sixth attack was just one of them yeah i mean that's exactly right so you know it is kind of unfortunate we're focused on the day of january 6. we understand why it was really the visible kind of symptom of everything that led up to it but what's important and what we're going to delve into this week and on wednesday i'm actually leading a hearing specifically talking about the justice department moves but you saw a president that spreads misinformation tries to install his own people into justice to do his bidding justice which is supposed to be you know representative of all of us pressures the vice president and then eventually when he can't get his way he tries to pressure congress through just put not just public pressure but in a public attack and so what's very important to notice in that is it is a whole set leading up to january 6 but i think the thing that's most concerning to me is nothing has changed the only thing that has changed since january 6 is now if they want to run that play again they're going to put more loyal people into the administration earlier on so it's important for the american people to see this to take ownership of this and make a decision for ourselves what kind of a country we want to live in who's they congressman say that again you said they want to who is they well look i mean i think if donald trump gets elected again there is no doubt in my mind zero doubt that he will instead of screening candidates like he probably did when he got elected in 2016 for you know qualifications he's going to screen people based on their loyalty to him now i don't know if that would go beyond anybody else but him but i think it's important for us as a country to recognize that to recognize the importance that the oath to the united states plays i mean john we could pass any law in this country but if we have people in power whether it's in politics or law enforcement or the military if we have any people that are unwilling to put their oath above any loyalty to a person no law matters so what matters in the bottom line is that we as a country recognize even when we're on the receiving end of politics even when we don't get our way if we follow through our oath that basic compact of self governance will work otherwise it won't let me ask you about one of the findings on thursday evening one of the things we were shown for the first time is several people close to the president telling him there was no widespread fraud he was going to lose that's what the numbers showed how many people do you think in his close to him were sending him that message well i look we're going to get more into that but let me just say this i don't really know many people around him that truly believed the election was stolen and told him so do you get a lot of people he had a lot of people that told him it wasn't were there people who knew it was a lie and yet carried on in his inner circle oh for sure i mean look all you have to do is look at he was surrounded by yes people that want to come and tell him everything that pleases him uh you know and we'll get more into that i don't want to really kind of spoil the deep dive into some of this stuff but look i think if anybody truly believed after you know the after what you see after what the attorney general says for instance after what every piece of information comes in if you truly believe the election was stolen then if the president truly believes it for instance he's not mentally capable to be president i think he didn't believe it i think the people around him didn't believe it this was all about keeping power against the will of the american people but just to put a fine point on exactly what you're accusing the president of during the covid uh president trump at the time said it's uh it's like the flu but later we heard bob woodward had audio of the president saying no it's nothing like the flu so he was saying something out loud he had was on record in private saying the absolute opposite of do you have evidence of that about this well no i won't go in again i don't want to go into the evidence that we haven't put out yet let me tell you my belief that i can say right now the president absolutely tried to overthrow the will of the people and he tried to do it initially through misinformation through the department of justice through pressuring the vice president and then on january six and uh he was told repeatedly by people that he trusted that he respected people like you know folks around him uh that the election wasn't stolen that there is no uh corroborating proof of any kind of a a stealing or any kind of a corruption that would that would change the outcome and so yeah i think it's pretty obvious he knew but he didn't want to lose and let me ask you about pardons this was another one of the disclosures from the hearing how many pardons are we talking about uh and why were they asking for pardons well look more that's going to be released this week in fact we're going to talk a little about that in my hearing but um why would you ask for a pardon let's just say in general uh if somebody asked for a pardon it would be because they have real concerns that maybe they've done something illegal so um i'll leave it at that but i'll say that more information will be coming your colleague uh congressman perry denied that he asked for a pardon he's one of those ones who was named the notion that i ever sought a presidential pardon to the congressman for myself or other members of congress is an absolute shameless and soulless lie is the testimony you have hearsay or do you have the goods well look at like i said i don't want to tip my hand on this we'll we'll put out what we need to put out but we're not going to make accusations or say things uh without proof or evidence backing it one of the other disclosures in the in the hearings on thursday night was the role of the proud boys um quite a lot that that was painstakingly put forward some people have said well one of the things you proved is the proud boys were on the march before president trump gave his speech on january 6th so if they were already off to to march how could president trump have incited them what's your uh what's your response to that comment well again i think what we want to do thursday is show the top lines of what happened with some kind of overall things to be aware of more information will come out on that but let's keep in mind the the whole thing on january 6 and the violence wasn't just about the president standing on stage saying what he was saying it was also about tweets about th this will be wild january 6 will be wild come out to january 6 knowing darn well that he was spewing out lies before the american people um so we'll take a look we'll see but here's the other thing we are inundated with people saying this was the fbi i mean that you now see members of congress again talking about the ray epps conspiracy that somehow he was a informant for the fbi that said a word into somebody's ear and that led to all these people doing an insurrection it's garbage but that's the kind of misinformation that's coming back again and by the way john i gotta tell you people like ted cruz people like massey people like sheriff troy nels have been repeating this conspiracy twenty seconds left another thing i want to get to is uh the president has claimed uh that he he in fact did reach out to the national guard your testimony showed mike pence had to jump in when the president wouldn't what is your response to the president's claim i think it's very obvious the president didn't do anything but gleefully watch television while this was going down he can say anything he wants the real leader the only person in charge that made those calls was mike pence we'll prove that all right congressman kensinger thank you so much for being with us face the nation we'll be back in a minute stay with us

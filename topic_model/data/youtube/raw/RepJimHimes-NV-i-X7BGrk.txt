change the conversation in Washington congressman jim Himes is the ranking member of the house permanent Select Committee on Intelligence is NSA and Cyber Security subcommittee so thank you so much for joining us congressman I guess you know my first question is when the Snowden revelations came out the pendulum swung so far in the other directions and people were so upset about the government potentially monitoring us and monitoring our data do you see the pendulum swinging back after this well unquestionably it will and you know sadly after the Snowden revelations frankly the pendulum swung too far back I can't tell you how many people I had to disabuse of the notion that the NSA was regularly listening in on their phone calls but look I think at the end of the day the legislative process worked we passed something called the USA Freedom Act which dialed back some of the authorities in the Patriot Act got rid of the metadata collection program which of course was what everybody was primarily concerned about but no unquestionably you know when people are fearful as they are now there are the pendulum does swing we just you know as in everything else you know our response to these terrorists we we need to sort of calm that fear and make sure we continue to kind of deal with this most technical of topics in a fairly calm and and and intelligent way so can you lay out some concrete ways you think that policy should change in the cyber security realm you know i would say that we've got a lot of we can do at the government level as we all saw from the OPM hack and the loss of that data you know within the US government but also within companies like Sony the list of which is long there's an awful lot we can do to make our networks more secure you know we're really only five or six years into an effort of really concentrating on this and there's obviously a lot we can do there and then individually there's an awful lot we can do I mean I can't tell you the number of people I know who still regularly open up attachments from email addresses they don't recognize and so there's an awful lot that we can achieve while we have that debate between security and civil liberties so you propose something called an amoeba convention can you explain what that is and what sort of progress you've seen there yeah the idea there is that you know in the actual kinetic realm as the military says you know we do have rules of war there are the Geneva Conventions and you know people understand what an active war is if you're in a war what their obligations are two prisoners what is acceptable and what is not acceptable even in the context of a war in the cyber war realm we don't have any of those norms nobody knows if you know the stealing of data is an act of war is the shutting down of a network which doesn't hurt anybody inactive or what about the shutting down of a network that does hurt somebody and my point has been and I've been sort of working this theme for a long time around here we need to get together with the folks with whom we have a lot in common on the vulnerabilities of our networks and say hey let's at least set basic norms for what is an act of war what kind of retaliation is okay now mind you that doesn't help us with the people who don't observe those laws meaning you know non-state actors and terrorists but we ought to at least amongst the states in the world come up with a set of norms and agreement around what is what in the cyber realm so I just wonder though how do we find the the right line this balance between privacy and security and surveillance I mean you know it seems it the way we've been operating is very reactionary when really we need to be somehow ahead of these things it's a hard thing to do I mean as you pointed out the pendulum does swing right after Snowden you know everybody really thought wrongly that there was this massive surveillance apparatus that was targeting every American and listening to phone calls and reading mail and now we're probably swinging back in the other direction look this is a debate that we're not going to answer as new technologies come online I mean you know 20 years ago who imagined texting Facebook you know all these things we're not going to win or end this debate we just need to have it in good faith and it's a difficult debate to have of course because many of the capabilities for surveillance are by nature secret if people know about them it's not particularly valuable surveillance anymore so we say very difficult debate to have but it's an important one and you know it's a line that I think if you look at both the original passing of the Patriot Act and then the dialing back of those authorities in the USA Freedom Act you know that again we won't get it right in any given piece of legislation but it's it's a it's important that we focus on maintaining two values neither of which we want to sacrifice security and of course the civil liberties we have and on that last point how do you address the fact that the vast majority of these communications are completely 1,000% innocent well yeah and by the way how do you address the fact that even if we wanted to go back to a world where you know the FBI could read all texts and all emails and we would all agree i think that it would be good for them always to get judge's approval to get warrants and that sort of thing but hey we're in a world now where you don't have to be all that intelligent a software developer to come up with an app that will allow for strong encryption that our intelligence agencies so you know we're in a new technological world here that's going to require us to think differently about how we respond to new technologies okay congressman jim Himes from Washington thank

so I met Dan at a good friend's home my childhood friend she introduced us and we were friends first for quite a while and my parents were stationed out in California at the time and they had a fabulous backyard and so we would have barbecues and Dan all of our friends would come over and Dan be there and he would hang out with my dad and he actually became good friends with my dad first and my dad really liked him so after that barbecue that Dan hung out with my dad he ended up asking me out later that week he asked me on our first date and he was quite the gentleman which I loved about him and he picked me up and took us to a nice dinner and half liked their dinner I think is what I do that he was the guy for me so that's how it started he was very smart got a good with my dad first Dan is very thoughtful he every birthday I've ever had has been wonderful he thinks about it he plans surprised even whether it's a big birthday party or one year he he had a friend of a friend of a friend who knew someone that was on Dancing with the Stars and I loved the show I voted every week and Dan came to me about a week before my birthday and said I have plans make sure you were a cocktail dress and be ready to go out to like a nice dinner I thought okay we get in the car to go to dinner two hours later we're in LA and he said surprise and we were there for the shelf it was incredible and that's every year my birthday has always been very special whether he's stateside or deployed he always puts so much effort into it to making it a special day for me and he really he takes the time to do something that he knows to be very special to me he works hard at getting either he had one year he had friends flying in from the east coast for a surprise party he's just done wonderful things like that for as long as I've known him and always very secretive about it so I never know what's coming which is great okay so in 2012 Dan was on deployment in Afghanistan and it was a long deployment it was nine months so at the end at the very end of month six going the beginning of month seven I received a phone call at six ten in the morning and it was the phone call saying that Dan had been involved in an incident and that she was currently in surgery and that was you know life life changed then um they didn't have a lot information and that they knew that the right side of his head had been damaged I was told that they a friend of ours who was not currently deployed had volunteered to being my Keiko officer and that she was on his way to the house and was going to the earth me through whatever I was going dan was in a medically induced coma at the time and on a breathing tube and he wasn't stable enough to be flown in Afghanistan so we we needed waited for several days and then there was a miracle and danced stabilized enough to be flown to Germany and once he was in Germany was when they took him out of the medically induced coma and they removed the tubes so he could breed on his own originally I was supposed to fly to Germany in median but he improved his health improved to the point that I was going to be flown to Walter Reed Bethesda Maryland and meet him there and so that's what we did and I waited for him to fly in there a fellow wife held my hand and we were surrounded by other amendment or not on deployment they were there waiting with me and it was pretty incredible because in our community no matter what's going on you're always surrounded so it's kind of beautiful to think about that Dan's brothers were protecting me a stateside with me holding my hand and they were also with him on the other side of the world and he was never alone there with us every step of the way it was incredible and on that deployment your best friends did not come home Dave Orson was with Dan when Dan was hit by the bomb and later on Pat peeks stayed in constant communication with Sawyer in hospital and both of them would be killed in two months later in August and I think that Dean and I live our life knowing that he could come home and others those that we love did not many over the years i'ma come home and so it's very important to us to continue serving to continue the mission and serving the American people in any way we can and we owe it to them no no that's all continued again ok so something that I greatly admire about the N is his strength no matter what it's happening when we were in the hospital shortly after he'd been flown in from Germany the doctors informed us that they didn't believed in would see again for me this it was very difficult news to hear and and was completely blind and he reached out and set my name and took my hand and he told me that everything was gonna be ok and he'd just been told that he would probably never see you again but it was incredibly strong for me and told me not to worry Dan will always be that person as long as I've known him I've watched Dan have strong faith even during the hardest moments of her life I've watched Dan give strength to others when times are very difficult and that is something I've always been incredibly proud of him for doing when everything is crazy around you and you feel like the world's falling apart because the person you love was just thought it by a bomb he's the person to tell you it's gonna be okay not to worry even when he's the one that's been blown up which i think is incredible we live in a hospital for a few months and after after about a month and a half Dan was able to get out of the bed and walk on his own and we would walk to his appointments in the hospital and there was a day that I got totally turned around trying to get to the optometrist the eye specialist and Dan still completely blind told me Tara it's this way and marched off he had memorized the map of the hospital in his head and was able to get me to the area that we needed to be in now people did have to jump out of the way as he was walking because he didn't see them but I still thought that was amazing that in the short time we'd been there the majority of the time him bedridden he was able to navigate the hospital and get us where we needed to go dan is incredibly intelligent and although give him a hard time Oh Dan it is incredibly driven when he was told he would have to be medically retired from the military this was of course our day we thought Dan would be in the military for 20 years and it ended up being 10 years and the next day he woke up and he told me that he was gonna figure out a way to keep serving and he was going to apply to the top policy schools and he did and he got into everyone that he applied to and I was very proud of him for that and he kept moving forward he went to school he received his master's he worked very hard yet excellent grades and then he wanted to come home wanted to come home to Texas and so when I met Dan we were not in Texas he was stationed in California and I talked her when this when you need a boy who's from Texas outside of Texas they tell you from the first day you meet them they're going home to Texas so I always knew that we were gonna come home to Texas one day and Texas boys Dan in particular he's special Hughes always respectful and he's kind and he will always listen to another point of view the other side of the argument he won't necessarily agree with you but he will tell you why he disagrees with you in a nice way and in a respectful way and I I like that about him I think that it's a great quality to have data is incredibly passionate when it comes to service it's what he has always known he's always done and he's always loved to do he stand as a policy nerd and I find that incredibly attractive he is someone that will research everything talk to everyone he can about if they're an expert in the field he won't come out with the policy without getting the research done looking into it seeing what the best option will be he's very thoughtful he really wants to make the best decision for us now and in the future and I think that will be very important in Congress that he won't just vote this way or that way he really will sit down and think about it and talk to people that it will affect and choose the best thing for the people and he will always do that one of the reasons I fell in love with him is because he's the type of person where never have to worry that he's saying one thing to your face and one thing when you're not in the room everything he would say he says it to the person and he stands by what he says

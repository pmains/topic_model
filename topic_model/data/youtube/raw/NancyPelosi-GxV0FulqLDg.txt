to the rule the gentleman from West Virginia is recognized for five minutes in support of his motion thank you madam Speaker in June the American public learned at a major US airline greeted a group of army soldiers who were returning home from the front lines in Afghanistan with a bill for almost three thousand dollars or two hundred dollars apiece for each soldier to check for bags on a scheduled domestic flight Americans will route rightly outraged by the incident which was explained in a YouTube video posted by one of our troops in the video one soldier notes at his fourth bag for which he was charged two hundred dollars contained an m4 carbine rifle a grenade launcher and a nine-millimeter pistol quote the tools I used to protect myself and Afghan citizens while I was deployed in quote a spokesman for the Veterans of Foreign Wars told Associated Press the fees were quote the worst welcome home any soldier could receive the shock of even being charged is enough to make most servicemen and women simply shake their heads and wonder who or what it is they are protecting end quote members of the Armed Forces who are serving our country on the front front lines should not endure personal financial hardship when they are traveling to or returning from war zones yet the media is reporting of the incident last month showed that major US carriers were applying the same or similar policies across the board airlines were charging soldiers to check for reasonably sized bags and were profiting at the expense of the brave men and women of the Armed Forces who are going to or coming home from war this amendment this motion to recommit prohibits US air carriers from charging soldiers for up to four bags of checked baggage it's the bags that weigh 80 pounds or less and it's consistent with many airlines published policies I urge my colleagues in a bipartisan fashion as they should to support this amendment if the amendment is adopted it will not kill the bill the house will vote on the bill immediately after this amendment is adopted this motion recognizes it amend this debt of our gratitude owed by the United States to the men and women of our armed forces members of the Armed Forces who are going to the front lines are coming home from a war zone should not be given a bill with their boarding passes I urge my colleagues to join me in ensuring that our nation's Airlines treat our warriors with the respect they deserve for defending our country this is a bipartisan should be a bipartisan overwhelmingly yes and I close by saying vote for our veterans and I reserve the balance of my time gentleman may not reserve the balance I your Mac bounce my time in manager

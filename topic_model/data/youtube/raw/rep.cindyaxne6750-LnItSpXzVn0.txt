((THIS IS PROBABLY THE MOST MEANINGFUL PICTURE THAT WE HAVE....)) THE IMAGE BEVERLY KITTOE STILL TREASURES MOST. ((BRANDON'S IN THE CENTER.)) FIVE YEARS AFTER THE LAKE DELTON MOTHER LOST HER SON, BRANDON KETCHUM, TO SUICIDE...SHE VIVIDLY RECALLS THE WORDS HER MARINE SAID...THAT LET HER KNOW HE WAS STRUGGLING AFTER TOURS IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN. ((OVER AND OVER- YOU KNOW, HE WAS PICKING UP DEAD KIDS' BODIES AND HE WAS LOOKING FOR THE IDS AND WHEN HE WAS PICKING UP THESE BODIES, HE WOULD SEE HIS COUSINS' FACES IN THOSE BODIES.)) 27 NEWS DETAILED THE INITIAL REPORTS AFTER KETCHUM SOUGHT A FOURTH INPATIENT STAY FOR MENTAL CRISIS. IN JULY OF 2016...THE IOWA CITY V-A TOLD KETCHUM THE UNIT IN WHICH HE WANTED TO BE PLACED WAS FULL. KETCHUM STORMED OFF. WITHIN HOURS...HE HAD SHOT AND KILLED HIMSELF. ((IF YOU WERE ADMITTING THAT YOU NEED THE HELP, THAT TAKES A LOT FOR A MARINE, AND THEN TO BE TOLD- WHAT DOES THAT DO TO YOUR STATE OF MIND?)) THE FOLLOWING SUMMER...THE V-A'S INSPECTOR GENERAL PUT OUT ITS FINAL REPORT ON KETCHUM'S DEATH. IT "IDENTIFIED SOME DEFICIENCIES IN PATIENT CARE BY THE SYSTEM" ... SUCH AS HOW IT DOCUMENTED MISSED APPOINTMENTS. FOUR YEARS LATER... ((WE ARE FAILING OUR VETERANS)) IOWA CONGRESSWOMAN CINDY AXNE DRAFTS A BILL THIS SPRING...AIMED AT EXPANDING MENTAL HEALTH CARE FOR RURAL VETERANS. THE BILL WAS PART OF A PACKAGE THAT CONGRESS OVERWHELMINGLY PASSED AND PRESIDENT BIDEN SIGNED INTO LAW. ((THE BILL PROVIDES MONEY THAT'S ENOUGH TO EXPAND RURAL MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS AT THREE V-A CENTERS...THOSE SITES HAVE YET TO BE SELECTED.)) ((THE VA STAFF WILL HAVE VEHICLES AND THEY SEE THE VETERANS IN THE COMMUNITY OR AT HOME 58, OFTEN MULTIPLE TIMES EACH WEEK.)) DOCTOR CLIFFORD SMITH IS THE DIRECTOR OF FIELD SUPPORT FOR THE V-A'S SUICIDE PREVENTION OFFICE. ((IT WAS A TRAGIC SITUATION. VA NEEDS TO LEARN FROM ALL OF THOSE SITUATIONS AND HOW WE CAN DO IT BETTER TO PROVIDE SAFETY, ACCESS, AND TREATMENT TO VETERANS WHEN THEY'RE IN NEED.)) AS KITTOE WAITS TO SEE THE LAW ACTUALLY TAKE EFFECT...SHE TAKES PRIDE IN REMEMBERING THE CALL SHE GOT ON JUNE 30TH. ((IT SAID IT WAS WASHINGTON D.C. AND SO I THOUGHT 'WELL I HAVE TO ANSWER' AND IT WAS A SECRETARY CALLING FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN AND WANTED TO KNOW IF I WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO HIM AND I SAID 'WELL OF COURSE.')) PRESIDENT BIDEN HAD JUST SIGNED BRANDON'S BILL INTO LAW. ((I MEAN IT WAS ONLY ABOUT TWO MINUTES BUT FOR HIM TO CALL ME, REACH OUT TO ME, THAT MEANT A LOT TO ME DESPITE POLITICS AND EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON.)) IT WAS THEN... ((RIGHT AFTER WE HUNG UP.)) KITTOE SAYS SHE COULD REFLECT ON HER JOURNEY...BRANDON 'S JOURNEY. ((I WORK AT A HAIR SALON AND I WENT OUT AND THERE WERE OTHER STYLISTS THERE AND I SAID 'I NEED YOUR ATTENTION. I JUST GOT A CALL FROM THE PRESIDENT.)) IT'S BITTERSWEET FOR KITTOE...SINCE IT'S A CALL THAT COMES AFTER SHE FEELS HER SON'S CALL FOR HELP WENT UNANSWERED. NOW, HOWEVER, HIS LEGACY IS SHINING LIGHT ON A SYSTEM THAT NEEDED TO DO BETTER. IN LAKE DELTON, A.J. BAYATPOUR, 27 NEWS.

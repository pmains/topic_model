Mr. Speaker, Senate Republicans negotiated their Trumpcare bill in the dark, and that's just where it should have
stayed. And just wait until the CBO score comes out next week. Knowing that this
bill will cause a measurable harm to millions of American families, who will
lose their coverage and protections while facing higher costs. I do not
understand how anyone could support this. We constantly hear from our Republican
colleagues that Trumpcare keeps their promise to repeal the Affordable Care
Act. So, you keep a misguided promise, but at what cost? We are talking about
the lives of real people. Millions of real people. Aren't they worth more than
just a tax cut for the rich? Mr. Speaker, I urge my Republican colleagues to scrap
this disastrous bill. Let's work together to improve the Affordable Care Act and
not destroy it. And I yield back the balance of my time.

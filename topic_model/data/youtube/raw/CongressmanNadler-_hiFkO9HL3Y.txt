madam chairman I thank the gentleman for yielding and I opposed this closed rule on an obnoxious bill this bill is just another attempt in a long line of Republican attempts to interfere with women's health choices this bill is part of a disturbing national trend some legislators at the federal state and local level are attempting to insert religious exemptions into anti-discrimination and pro women's health law's with which they do not agree and rather than trying a frontal assault on the laws themselves which they know they would lose they seek instead to use the premise of religion to allow further discrimination against women we must not let them succeed let's be clear what this is really all about the Republicans are not happy with the Supreme Court's pro-choice decisions they are not happy with the Affordable Care Act that provides contraceptive coverage to millions of women with no out-of-pocket costs but try as they may they cannot overturn roe v wade and they cannot repeal obamacare the American people won't let them do that so now they are trying to bring religion into the discussion and there is to oppose what they call basic First Amendment principles about the freedom of religion well guess what that's not going to work either we see your bias we see your intent and we will not let you enshrine discrimination into federal law we won't let you punish women just because you are not pro-choice that is not going to happen and let's be honest this is not about religion it's about abortion and contraception let's stop the charade in this case the bills sole purpose is to deny access to and create more barriers for women seeking medical procedures that are legal and constitutionally protected the bill would enable employers and healthcare companies to override women's personal reproductive health decisions we've said this before and we'll say it again women's reproductive healthcare decisions simply should not be their bosses business religious convictions must be protected but cannot be permitted to infringe on the rights of others employers other than religious institutions have no right to impose their religious opinions on their employees and employees opinions about the propriety of birth control or abortion employer's opinion rather about the propriety of birth control or abortion must have no bearing on whether an employee can get access to abortion of birth control services and certainly no women should be denied information about her medical condition or about birth control or abortion because of the religious opinions of her employer that is not protecting the religious opinion of the employer that is projecting the religious opinion of the employer onto the employee in derogation of her rights religious protections must not be used as a sword against the rights of third-parties they must be used as a shield to protect your own religious liberty but not to hurt other people I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose this bill and I yield back the balance of my time

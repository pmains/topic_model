from Missouri the home of the Stanley Cup champions it pains me to say that MS Wagner I thank the chairman you know and you know I did not bring up this back to my st. Louis Blues are in fact the NHL couple of winners but over a certain Bruins team of Massachusetts the very kind of you to acknowledge it mr. chairman very kind and I thank you for organizing this hearing and I thank you to our witnesses Russia's capabilities in the information space cannot be underestimated Russian disinformation activities run counter to our US values and our interests and we must prioritize efforts to counter Russian information and warfare in coordination with our transatlantic partners mr. kolinsky you mentioned Russia's attempts to you said launder information in order to obscure its source what can what can the intelligence communities in the United States and Europe do to improve attribution so to speak I think for that it's actually very useful if you have the first part of the four four solutions I offered and that's actually documenting the threat because then you can always highlight that it was the Russian information space where the disinformation appeared I come from a country where we have quite a pro-kremlin president and when the attack in Salisbury happened the Russians tried to spread multiple versions often contradicting about the story you could see after the murder of Boris Nemtsov after shooting the mh17 and it was the same after Salisbury you try to spread contradicting versions of events because the aim is not to persuade you about one version but precisely so as dr. Kagan said so that you end up like say I don't know where the truth is and one of the versions was that it was not only Russia who was the producer of Navi choke the poison that was used there but it was also Czech Republic the Czech president was one of the first people to repeat that piece of disinformation suddenly you would see the Russian disinformation machine not saying it was a cementing the lie in the first place but it was even the Czech president admitted the Czechs produced no joke the information was laundered you have to monitor the information space very accurately so that you can say that actually no it was the Russians who came with July in the first place we know it and whoever parrot said is just multiplying Russian lie and is playing a useful idiot for the Russian disinformation machine I think that's why we also need to be a bit more resolute in in punishing the information aggressors we have to call them out we have to call out when someone acts as a useful idiot of Russian disinformation campaign and parrots its lies absolutely dr. Kagan I agree that the United States needs to develop new structures and strategies to identify expose and disrupt these hybrid operations this must include coordination with our NATO allies how should the u.s. approach the development of a coherent NATO based response to hybrid threats thank you it is important for us to do as much of this work as possible at the unclassified level and probably not in the intelligence community again the sunlight the transparency needs to be seen by all exactly and if you as soon as you do it in the IC then it's classified right and so forth in addition to that I think if you if you're not aware of them if you look into the restrictions on the icees ability even to monitor publicly available information a lot of people would be surprised at how hard it is for the IC to do that so I think that this is something where governments need to facilitate interaction of civil society organizations the computer algorithms to catch deep fakes are not going to be written by the government they are being written by private industry by individuals the ability to track stories from one place to another that's out there it's a matter of encouraging the mobilisation of civil society and then what the government needs to do is to be and the government's need to do to coordinate on our responses to these things so how what are we going to try to accomplish we know that we've got the Russians cold on this for example just pick any example you like what are we going to do with that information to maximize the damage to the entire Russian disinformation campaign and to demonstrate to our own people that there is truth out there that we can know what it is and to defeat the who knows principle thank you very the icy part of this I think is very very important Bizzaro in my very limited time what lessons would would should Western governments draw from Finland's programs to improve media literacy and public awareness regarding disinformation and influencer operations ma'am well first and foremost of course everyone needs to make university education free for everyone as we have in Finland but when that is not possible then what what was mentioned already before the program of the Finnish government of training government officials to recognize and counter these information operations already at the very early stage in 2014 has been a good example also journalistic community has started to train school kids on their free time they just visit schools until what's fact and what's fiction and how you separate the two what I find the truth yes absolutely well thank you and thank you for your courage thank you all for being here today I have gone past my time I yield back to the chair thing

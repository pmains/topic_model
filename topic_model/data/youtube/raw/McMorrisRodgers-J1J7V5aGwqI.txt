this morning i'd like to start where we agree mr hudson and ms herrera butler's h.r 5141 the mobile act will ensure that community health centers could use their grant funding for mobile units this will help people in rural communities all across this country access care they need in addition mr upton worked tirelessly on h.r 3655 to reform the vaccine injury compensation program we're taking a small step to improve the program and i look forward to working with chairman pallone for an offset before this moves to the floor i appreciate the changes made to mr o'halloran's legislation that reauthorizes a trauma center grant program but i still have outstanding concerns about the changes to the state matching requirement and i appreciate the commitment to continuing to work on this build before the full community a full committee markup we're also moving on h.r 3173 which is a top priority for dr bushon and i'm grateful for his hard work and leadership we've had a hearing in the oversight subcommittee and many members raise concerns about denials and prior authorization delaying the care seniors need this bill reauthorizes standard requires standardization and timely responses and will give seniors more information about how those claims are often denied however just last night the congressional budget office released an estimate that cost to medicare would go up by billions over the next 10 years my hope is to get this score settled and ultimately offset as we move this important legislation that improves care for seniors while also making sure medicare is solvent for seniors in the future the bill i have the most concerns with is the flint registry reauthorization act we've not had a hearing this congress to reassess the health harms created by government fiasco and a dangerous tragedy that occurred in flint it was a failure of at all levels of government the local state and federal level and we we right here have a responsibility to properly review this and ensure solutions to improve people's lives actually prevent a crisis like this from happening again people in every part of this country should be able to trust that the water coming out of their taps is safe that it's safe for them and their children to drink we're seeing other examples of locality localities mismanaging their water supply like the terrifying situation in jackson mississippi i understand the railroad labor dis dispute is threatening clean water around the country too these are challenges that deserve this committee's attention unfortunately that is not our focus with h.r 67 37 this bill will add an authorization of another 50 million for quote a city exposed to lead contamination in the local drinking water system based on the title and the text that applies only to flint michigan when there's other localities that need our attention too it doesn't include any oversight or review of current state and federal efforts in flint but it does spend tens of millions of dollars to quote establish a registry that's already been established the program or has already received more funding than authorized and it isn't clear where the money has been spent the flint registry touts for example spending money on unrelated costs like shipping 60 000 masks during cover 19. my colleagues and i have a have a mems file so that we can properly debate and bring oversight to this program for accountability we should have had a discussion at the hearing first and work towards a solution that we could all support i hope that we can come together to help other communities in america benefit from a registry communities like jackson mississippi that are dealing with its own government failures that have led to unsafe drinking water as well as other areas in the country where this has been an issue overall i know we will have a robust discussion as we head into the fall markup my colleagues and i are eager to ensure the energy and commerce committee is leading for proper oversight that helps us move the best legislation forward

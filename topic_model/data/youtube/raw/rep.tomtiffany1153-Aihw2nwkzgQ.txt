for moral welcoming member of the house judiciary and natural resources committees wisconsin congressman tom tiffany back with us congressman once title 42 goes away on may 23rd what happens at our southern border uh we have open borders uh they're basically a borderless country down on the southern border and i think the important thing for the american people to understand at this point is that this is deliberate this is what some people want to have happen because if president biden and vice president harris were really serious about this i mean don't you think they would be going to the border they understand the political peril that they're in as a result of doing that including prominent democrat senators that are coming out now saying hey don't get rid of title 42 it is delivered on their part we've seen it with the international organization of migration which is facilitating this and people like klaus schwab who talk about from the world economic forum that talk about the great reset america should understand that great reset includes getting rid of american sovereignty congressman you want to know what people are sick of when it comes to congress it's the hypocrisy and we see it all the time in washington and here's just another example so right now fine today april 5th 2022 things are going okay in this country when it comes to covet uh that wasn't the case 90 days ago we were all dealing with shutdowns uh the omicron virus was literally everywhere people were dying getting sick so why undo title 42 right now and at the same time congress is asking for more covert relief money when money from that first covert relief bill hasn't been spent in its entirety what do you make of that complete disconnect and the american people understand that at this point i mean it is a complete disconnect what's going on in congress at this point i mean think about it just flew into dc yesterday we still have to wear masks on airplanes so how do you get rid of title 42 if you still claim that there is this concern president biden could get rid of the mass mandate we still have it and many kids still are under significant restrictions in their schools and now you want to get rid of title 42 a complete disconnect out here amongst the democrat leadership in washington dc and the american people yeah congressman we keep hearing about these secret flights um there's been reports especially by the new york post of these so-called secret flights where migrants are being flown into various locations in the middle of the night places such as west chester new york are these secret flights real in your opinion oh absolutely i just had a i just did a listening session a couple weeks ago in my district a flight attendant from north central wisconsin stood up and told about how she used to have to count the seats when she was on a flight out of mcallen texas for how many openings they are and then they would bring that many uh illegal migrants onto the plane to fill up that plane and i saw it firsthand last year uh coming out of mcallen texas oh it's very real and make no mistake about it every state is a border state yeah it just seems like the cdc is is totally politically compromised at this point they are operating in lockstep with the biden administration uh congressman tom tiffany come back and see us great having you on we appreciate it

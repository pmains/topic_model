mine's Himes from Connecticut he sits in the house intelligence committee congressman thanks so much for coming in this morning good morning Kate good morning so what do you make of the comments coming from general Dempsey yesterday opening the door to a recommendation coming from him at some point the boots on the ground in Iraq could be needed what do you think sure well an awful lot of my colleagues set up today and said wait a second and that look it wasn't a surprise right I mean one of the reasons that today is so challenging is because well because you know once you have made a commitment both to putting people on the ground in Iraq which we have an increasing number of people on the ground and of course funding a proxy group of Syrian rebels who are acting in our name you can't predict the outcome the Middle East if it's one thing it is unpredictable so as people think about casting this vote today I think they're they're understanding that really we there may be a presidential pledge there may be an ability or there may not be an ability to vet Syrian rebels but once the pieces are in motion unpredictable things can happen sounds to me like you're not trusting what you're hearing from the president over and over again that there will be no combat troops on the ground is that fair well you know first of all as the senator pointed out there already our troops on the ground and you know anybody who's cognizant of history who looks at the history of Vietnam or any number of other conflicts you know things are unpredictable look if a couple of airmen are downed over Iraq and find themselves in the hands of Isis guess what they're going to be an awful lot more American combat troops there to find them and to rescue them so again this is a very very unpredictable thing and that's why this vote is so hard today well I'm going to get to the vote but on boots on the ground in order to defeat Isis many military experts many former military guys are saying that combat boots from someone are going to be needed and often that means the United States is going to lead are you at a place where you can say even though it is hypothetical at this point if the president requested and said he needed combat troops in order to take out Isis that you could support him I personally would not support that look the American people are well well tired of having our troops exposed in places like Afghanistan and Iraq and having military missions which don't end well I of course refer not only to Afghanistan and Iraq but to Libya where we made a substantial military commitment i'm not sure anybody looks at Libya and says gosh we're an awful lot better off today than we were we committed significant air power and look this concept of defeating Isis what can we do with airstrikes with airstrikes we can disperse Isis we can you know they'll blend into the villages and and and and and stop sort of concentrating with boots on the ground you might you might not defeat them but at least be much more aggressive about finding them in the villages look you don't defeat terrorism at the end of the day in Afghanistan and Iraq have shown this until you get at the underlying conditions the money that is flowing there from the Persian Gulf the kinds of economic and political conditions that turn a 17 year old and do an Isis monster until we begin to address those things terrorism will not be quote unquote defeated on general Dempsey even acknowledged that yesterday in that hearing he said no matter how you slice it there is no military solution to taking out Isis it yet involves diplomacy it involves political it involves all the things that you mentioned there I want to ask you though about the House vote the House vote today on arming and training Syrian rebels it's been tacked on to a bill in the central bill is I know it well know from govern Capitol Hill for years to keep the government funded where are you on this vote today well at this point I still have an awful lot of unanswered questions about exactly what arming the Syrian rebels does or means you know I we're being asked to fund a essentially a proxy army here that would be doing two things at once fighting Assad which of course is what these moderate rebels we call them the opposition that's opposition to Assad you know I but also fighting Isis which by the way is also fighting Assad that's a very very complicated operational thing there's questions about how well we can vet these guys you know what kind of weapons they'll be provided might we see those weapons again from the other end you know there are just a whole lot of questions here that I think an awful lot of members of Congress have I can't predict for you where this vote is going to go this is something that the Congress was not thinking much about two weeks ago and so a lot of people are being socialized to some very scary concepts and to some still unanswered questions this is an approach though congressman that was advocated by President Obama President Biden by the White House they wanted this vote to be tacked on to this funding bill because they thought it would be more palatable if it was masked in a must-pass vote but you still sound like you're an oh well look at you get to the process by which this is all happening and here you've got a little bit of a mess too yes this is being done as a separate amendment to a must-pass bow we got to keep the government open by passing a continuing resolution but look the more fundamental issue on the part of the Congress is an awful lot of members of Congress believe that that the president needs a separate authorization for this set of hostilities the President does not believe that and so now we're being asked to sort of go halfway and approve the money for a new you can use the word war if you want certainly as you know a set of hostilities that involve arming the Syrian moderates without actually having authorized the fight itself another way then congressman are you a no vote on the Syrian and on the amendment to arm Syrian rebels at this point in time remember the votes later on today a lot of information in question being answered but at this point in time I'm an oboe so then do you believe that there should be then a separate up or down vote on any for an authorization for further military force use of military force I do look this is an offensive action in the sense that we're not the leaders on this I'm sorry to cut you off but I think this is important because I feel like every member of Congress we have had on Democrat a Republican if rank-and-file they have said the same thing that they believe an up-or-down vote should happen but it's not happening are you talking to your leaders about the need for an up or down vote yeah look there's been an awful lot of advocacy the president has said he does not think he needs that up or down vote he thinks he has the authority an awful lot of us disagree and look this as you know as a fight that has been going on for 60 years between the White House and the Congress about exactly where war making authority lives well and this is also a fight when you look overseas even General Martin Dempsey said could be is a generation problem is going to go far beyond the three years that have been forecast in the fight against Isis going forward Congressman Jim Heintz thanks so much for coming on this morning it's great to see you Thank You Kate of course

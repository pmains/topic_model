WORLD HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL CENTER   RUSALEM WHERE HE WILL BE  LAYING A WREATH.  ISRAEL IS THE FIRST STOP IN A  TRIP THAT WILL ALSO TAKE HIM TO  SAUDI ARABIA.  WITH US IS SENATOR BOB MENENDEZ, CHAIR OF THE SENATE FOR  RELATIONS COMMITTEE.  ONE OF THE PRESIDT'T'S GOALS  FOR HIS DDLE EAST TRIP, IS TO  PROVIDE A COUNTERBALANCE TO  IRAN, WHICH, AMONG OTR  THINGS, IS REPORTEDLY PLANNING  TO OVIDE RUSSIA WITH ARMED  DRONES, THAT COULD BE USED IN  UKRAINE.  WHAT DO YOU SEE IRAN TRYING TO  ACCOMPLISH WITH THIS?  >> WELL IRAN IS A NEFARIOUS  ACTOR, NOT ONLY IS IT'SMARCH  TWO ACQUIRE A NUCLEAR WEAPON,  BUT ALSO, WORKING WITH OTHER  ROGUE ACRS KE PUTIN D RUSSIA.  AND SO, THE PRESIDENT'S TRIP IS  IMPORTANTTO CREATE A COALITION  WITH THE REGION, THAT CAN WORK TO COUNTER IRAN'S FORCES IN THE  REGION TO CREATE A COLLECTIVE  SECURITY AGREEMENT, TO  STRENGTHEN THE GULF COUNTRIES  RELATIONSHIPWITH OUR ALLIES  IN THE STATE OF ISRAEL.  AND AT THE SAME TIME, TO PROMOTE GLOBAL ENERGY SECURITY AND  STABILITY.  SO, IT'S AN IMPORTANT TRIP BUT  IRAN IS A NEFARIOUS ACTOR THAT  I'VE BEEN CALLING OUT FOR YEARS. >> OSER TO HOME, NEXT MONTH,  VENEZUELA IS SCHEDULED TO HOST  ARMED FORCES MEETINGS, FROM 10  NATIONS INCLUDING IRAN, RUSSIA,  AND CHINA, FOR WARGAMES.  I MEAN THESE ARE COUNTRIES THAT  ARE POSTER CHILDREN FOR HUMAN  RIGHTS VIOLATORS.  ANOTHER SIGN THAT SOME LATIN  AMERICAN NATIONS APPEAR TO BE  MOVING CLOSER TO OUR MAJOR  ADVERSARIES.  HOW DO YOU SEE THAT, IRAN,  RUSSIA, CHINA, GOING INTO LATIN  AMERICA ANTHE CARIBBEAN'S?  >> ULTIMATELY, THIS JUST SHOWS,  ONCE AGAIN, WHAT THE MADURO  RESUME IS ALL ABOUT.  INDDITION TO THOPPRESSION  OF ITS OWN PEOPLE THAT HAS  CAUSED 6 MILLION VENEZUELANS TO  FLEE THE COUNY,THEY'V TURNED IT INTO A NARCO ATE,  IT'S WILLING TO BE A FOOTHOLD  FOR IRAN, FOR CHINA, AND FOR  RUSSIA IN THE WESTERN  HEMISPHERE.  AND THAT'S WHY I HAVE BEEN  PRESNG SO HARD ON PURSUING AN  INTERNATIONAL COALITION ON  SANCTIONS ON THE MADURO REGIME,  BECAUSE, THEY WORK AGAINST OUR  NATIONAL INTEREST D OUR  NATIONAL SECURITY.  >> SENATOR, YOU JUST RECENTLY  SPOKE OUT ABOUT THE BIN  ADMINISTRATION'S DECISION TO  EXTEND, BUT NOT TO DESIGNATE  PPS, WE ARE IN A PERIOD WHERE  IT'S SO IMPORTANT FOR  SALVADORANS, HAITIA, SO MANY  OTHERS, HOW DO YOU THINK CPS IS  BEING HANDLED RIGHT NOW?  >> LOOK THE PRESIDENT HAS DONE  SOME GOOD THINGS IN THE  DESIGNATION OF TEMPARY  PRECTIVE STATUS, TPS, FOR  COUNTRIES THAT ARE ACTUALLY  MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS  WHY  CITINS HAVE FLED, BECAUSE WHAT TPS IS, IT'S A TEMPORARY  PROTECTIVE STATUS.  HOWEVER, I'M SAPPOINTED THAT  WHILE THE PRESIDENT, WE KNEW  THE PROTECTIVE STATUS FOR  VENEZUELANS THAT IS ALREADY  HERE, HE DID NOT ENLARGE IT BY  RE-DESIGNATING IT, AND THAT  LEAVES VENEZUELANS RE, WHO  MAY COME TO OUR BORDERS,  ULTIMATELY, IN LIMBO, AND  ULTIMATELY, NCE THEY CANNOT   DEPORTED BACK TO VENEZUELA  UNDER THE CONDITIONS THAT THE  ADMINISTRATION ITLF HAS  DESIGNATED, IT LEAVES THEM IN A  STATUS THAT IS NOT PRODUCTIVE  FOR ANYBODY, IT'S NOT  PRODUCTIVE FOR US IN TERMS OF  ASCEAINI THE UNIVERSE  THAT'S THER AND IT'S NOT

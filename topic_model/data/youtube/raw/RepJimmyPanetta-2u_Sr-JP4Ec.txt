Thank You mr. Chairman I appreciate it and thanks to all the witnesses who are here I appreciate your testimony your preparation I know it took a quite a bit of time I'm sure to put together your statements today so thank you very much I appreciate that my question kind of stems around education as my members are starting to know and as many people do know I come from the salad bowl of the world there on the Central Coast of California but we're looking to change that name actually we're going to call it the salad the salad bar of the world and no I'm serious and the reason they're doing that is because a lot of the growers and the shippers what they realized is that the people who work for them weren't eating the same foods that they're picking and they realized how to get to them is by getting to their kids and so what a lot of our ad companies have done it donated salad bars over a hundred to the local schools to start getting arc children including my two daughters to start eating more healthy foods having that salad bar option and they're doing that and what it what they're seeing is that when their children start to eat more at schools those trends they go home and their parents start to develop those same trends and it's actually working to a certain extent and so my question is to you know how do we continue besides AG companies donating salad bars how to our schools how do we continue to educate our children when it comes to you know getting them to eat healthier in our schools how do we do that a couple of things that the food retailers are working on one is a very high percentage of our companies do in store tours I mentioned earlier that about ninety-five percent of them have on staff nutritionists and dietitians and what they're doing is actually bringing school groups into the stores and the nutritionist and the dietitians take the children through the store and help them understand about nutrition help them understand the kinds of of nutrients and vitamins they get from various products and the balance that they need to be trying to achieve in their lives so that's one thing that I think has worked well and continued will continue to work well another thing that we've done at MMI through our FM I foundation is we are now we've just had our second annual national family meals month in September and the notion of national family meals month is sort of multifold one is that some of the societal challenges we have our improved by having more frequent family meals and I'm talking now about school truancy underage drinking drug abuse etc but the research shows that more family meals tends to bring down the incidences with with young children and teenagers but in addition to that what we find is that children who engage with their families at mealtime both by cooking by purchasing the food by being involved in preparation and serving they tend to have a better understanding of nutrition and diet and health than those that don't so we're promoting national family meals within our organization but also at store level and we've had as I mentioned our second annual in September of 16 so this is something that we're doing on an annual basis so that our retailers can actually be engaged with their customers and helping children engage more with the preparation of food in their in their home I appreciate do with the the fini programs from the snap ed program what are those entail yeah I was just going to say we work in a hundreds of schools and in Pennsylvania and we doing snap at nutrition education work so teaching kids to try new foods a lot of it is also peer-to-peer marketing so getting kids to be leaders in changing their school environment youth-led wellness councils and you really find that when when when the students are kind of marketing to their peers around healthy reading that has a big impact we also do to the congressman's point we work with our get hype Philly program is about healthy eating and exercise so the combination of both those is really important great great in regards to the you know a doctor dr. Rancic sink excuse me you talked about middle of the road consumers you know you mentioned sign service structure is there anything else we can do the target them I mean what else what else can we do well what can be done to the retail level is to make sure that the foods you want to guide them for them so they healthier foods and it being the ones that are most convenient to purchase their most attractive purchase and I just like price but attractive looking attractively names attractively positioned then that are also more normal because right now it's just not normal to buy a lot of healthy thing as you go she surges you feel like you're kind of a strange person simply a lot of placement changes can make a big difference thank you very much for your question thank you thank you mr.

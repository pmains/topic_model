or whether it's one that you want to present to the entire San Fernando Valley you dial Star three now uh if you just want to talk to my staff maybe deal with some issue involving a federal agency you can do that but most people who dial Star 3 will want to be put in the queue and be one of the many people who will ask a question tonight that will be heard by thousands of San Fernando Valley residents now we're going to have a two special guests at the state level we'll have a state Senator Bob hertzberg and at the city level city councilwoman uh nithi uh Rahman and we'll hear from them uh in either 20 or 40 minutes as the case may be um now if you want to know about our future Town Halls you go to bradsherman.house.gov you'll be able to see when our next town hall will be it will be

but you can find out about it by going to bradsherman.house.gov and uh you'll also be able to submit a question we will have a number of pre-submitted written questions that I'll deal with tonight although mostly I'll be dealing with questions live from the floor um now we're going to be going right up until 8 10 p.m if I go beyond that our vendor will charge us a lot more money so we will wrap it up by by 8 10 and uh God knows it's hot in the San Fernando Valley um I want to get the word out about the cooling centers because we're at temperatures where uh People's Health could really be adversely affected we have the Canoga Park Senior Citizen Center there on Jordan Avenue in Canoga Park it's open from 10 a.m to 9 p.m leashed pets are welcome and then of course every LA City Public Library is open in business hours not only for those who are interested in the books but those who are interested in the the air conditioning please try to get the word out because we want everybody to be safe even those with without access to a good home air conditioning system now I want to put in a pitch for our constituent service team uh we've got Lisa Montano on the line she's our senior case worker with well over a decade of experience so imagine a federal agency makes a mistake it could happen it could affect you uh could be someone trying to visit you from abroad that can't get a visa from one of our embassies could be Social Security could be the IRS you call our team at 818-501-9200 and talk to Lisa Montano she'll work very hard she'll solve your problem we hope and then I'm Brad Sherman will take the credit it's an excellent system our office is on Van Nuys Boulevard located in America's best name City Sherman Oaks there are five thousand Van Nuys Boulevard once again that number is 818-501-9200 and I do want to point out that one issue that the state department is just way behind in renewing passports or granting passports if you don't have a passport apply for one now you never know when you might need it if you have a passport that's going to expire in the next year get it renewed now don't wait until you win the lottery and that free trip to the Netherlands um because uh it will take many many weeks to renew your passport um even if you pay the extra fee now if God forbid you have a an unexpected situation all of a sudden your passport uh needs to be revised you know renewed very quickly you can give us a call but uh Lisa and our team are working pretty hard now and it's much better if people in the valley get their passports renewed way before they expire uh now uh I I realize that some people have joined us in the last uh three or four minutes so once again this is Congressman Brad Sherman this is our San Fernando Valley town hall meeting we'll be on until 8 10 p.m and this is a chance to discuss all the issues facing uh Congress today now uh if you live in the 30th the congressional district you should feel free to dial Star 3 and get the queue and ask a question if you don't live in the district relax and enjoy but the questioning should be done by people who live in our district now uh I do want to summarize the most important thing that Congress has done since our last town hall and that was passed the inflation reduction act which has been signed into law and I would refer to it as the inflation and carbon reduction act because not only will this bill help us fight inflation but it is the biggest thing done by anyone on Earth to stop climate change and it will result in a reduction of total output of carbon and other greenhouse gases that exceeds what any country has done today now I want to summarize uh this bill uh perhaps most important from an economic perspective is over the next decade it will reduce the U.S TR deficit by 300 billion dollars now all of the official projections only deal with the next 10 years but the nonpartisan committee for responsible federal budget has estimated that over the 20-year period we're talking of a 2 trillion dollar reduction in the federal deficit um the bill will provide 260 billion dollars in clean energy credits and incentives uh for solar and wind and hydropower uh electricity to be created for people to be incentivized to get electric automobiles uh for factories to completely retool in a way that reduces their greenhouse gases um the um bill will also uh extend for another three years the credits that are helping people uh afford the uh Affordable Care Act uh this will prevent three million people from becoming uninsured uh there is a cap on the annual prescription spending for seniors who are covered by Medicare at two thousand dollars so no matter what the situation that's the most a senior uh on in Medicare can pay for out-of-pocket pharmaceutical costs and that will be a boon to not only to every senior who takes advantage of it because they happen to get this or that condition where they need expensive drugs but also to all 64 million uh Medicare uh enrollees who know that uh um even if it doesn't happen to them if it did uh they would not be losing their home losing their life savings because of the cost of pharmaceuticals the bill provides for the in 15 minimum tax for corporations and this is so important because and I'm I'm a CPA uh what big companies want to do is tell the shareholders they're making a fortune and then tell the tax man they didn't make any money at all the overriding desire of corporate Executives is to tell the shareholders they're making a lot that drives the stock price up that drives executive bonuses up and uh so what this does is it harnesses the desire of Corporations to report good results to shareholders and say if whatever you're reporting to shareholders you got to pay a 15 tax on it and that will generate hundreds of billions of dollars over the next 10 years the bill also in this uh this has been criticized by some but I agree with it uh will provide a lot of additional funding to the IRS the average wage earner taxes uh there's there's almost no need for an audit you get the paycheck maybe you get some interest from your bank maybe you have a home mortgage the IRS gets all that money all that information electronically um and matches it up and that's not where problems occur and we're Under reporting occurs where it occurs is at the very top where things are complicated and where uh transactions don't get reported uh where there are fancy and an unreportable uh um uh income producing events and what this bill does is it takes the total number of people working from the IRS per American uh we um back to where it was under Ronald Reagan Ronald Reagan believed that we should have uh about one IRS employee for every 3 000 Americans and that's where this uh this bill will take us so while it's criticized it's somehow ah the IRS is going to be going crazy we're going back to the Ronald Reagan standard um the uh Bill provides for negotiation of drug prices for 50 drugs covered by Medicare Part D these negotiations will I think not only establish what Medicare pays for the drugs but for those under age 65 it'll establish the standard and will assure that we get closer to paying a price for drugs in the United States that's similar to what is paid in the other developed countries in the world it also uh imposes penalties on drug manufacturers it increased prices faster than the rate of inflation once you come up with a drug there's no reason to raise the price you've done all of the research to produce that drug and to establish its efficacy and at that point you should just be increasing the price for inflation no more all right um and it limits the cost of the out-of-pocket cost for insulin the 35 dollars a month when it comes to the energy and climate Provisions it's a program that will cut America's carbon and other greenhouse gas uh emissions by 40 by the year 2030. um through investments in hydrogen production Advanced manufacturing electrical Vehicles Advanced industrial program uh Etc and the bill also does provide for faster environmental reviews of proposed projects and uh you know some projects are good and necessary and some are not but decisions ought to be made within two years the um uh effect on info on the budget deficit I think just about everybody agrees that if you reduce the federal budget deficit you reduce inflation over the long term uh this reduces our deficit by 305 billion little comment though the bill only uh provides subsidies for those on Obamacare the subsidy extension Provisions only until 2025. if in some future bill um we made that permanent then the savings of the package that bill in this bill together would be only 155 billion rather than the 305 that is established under the bill as we adopted it so uh with that um I think I've described the most important action uh taken since uh our last uh our last telephone town hall and it's time to take a question from the floor Don who do we have in line uh we have um Robin from Chatsworth who has a question about January 6 hearings uh Robin you should be on now yes um one of the um hearings um broadcasts the public going to resume we were told it was September any idea when Congress reconvenes next week I haven't looked at the committee schedule but I assume uh that uh uh that next week or very soon thereafter we'll be seeing these these hearings on television um I think there's going to be an effort to to issue a report in October and um there's uh there's a a lot for us to to learn and reflect on um I was here on January 6th and uh it was a scary time not just for those of us here but for the entire country let's move on to the next question sorry Congressman um uh we have um uh Kyle from Sherman Oaks Kyle you are on now hello Kyle hello uh I I Congressman Sherman thank you for uh taking my question um my question is is is what what are you doing to protect uh our Second Amendment rights all I hear from uh the uh your colleagues and and people in Washington and people and and uh a lot of people on the California state government as well that they're trying to attack our Second Amendment rights what are you doing to protect our second amendment rights well um the Second Amendment is is not absolute the Supreme Court defines um exactly what those rights are and uh the rights as defined by the Supreme Court are absolutely safe and enforced to buy a supreme court that has struck down uh gun control most recently in in New York that they fail to override those rights at the same time I'd like to see uh some uh the constraints on on guns I I get a very low rating I get an F rating from the NRA um and uh part of that is I'd like to see the background checks uh be Universal right now um if you go to a gun store they do a background check you go to a gun show you can buy a gun without a background check and the effect of that is well if you're not going to pass a background check you go to a gun show um I think that uh we we do face a real problem with uh gun violence in our country um and uh we recently took some action in Congress that I thought was uh far too little uh but at least we have uh cleaned up uh The Gun Show loophole with regard to those between the ages of 18 and 21. um and that was in reaction to a mass shooting carried out by somebody under the age of 21 but the fact is everyone who buys a gun should go through the background check process in addition um again you talk about the Second Amendment rights uh the Second Amendment uh I I do not think requires you to have a a magazine uh with more than 10 bullets if if you can't take down a deer with 10 shots get out of the forest um and in mass shootings I remember when my friend Gabby Giffords was shot in Arizona uh the gunman was stopped when he had to reload and when you start putting 40 and 60 bullets in a magazine I think I think that goes too far so again I think the Second Amendment rights are uh uh what the Supreme Court determines them to be if Congress were to take any action beyond that or stay where to take any action above beyond that the Supreme Court is there but we've got a long way to go before our our gun laws in this country are sensible well let's take one more question and then we'll introduce our first special guest okay Congressman we have uh Stephanie with a question about climate change Stephanie you are on now hi there good evening thank you for holding the town hall I would uh and I also appreciate your support to pass the inflation reduction act I am an early childhood educator um from San Fernando Valley commuting to Culver City and as a person who's seen a lot of these wildfires and um especially that we've had this past week and on the five freeway I was hoping to find out more about what are your what are the next steps you would like to see Congress for dealing with climate change well I'm the co-sponsor the green New Deal which uh um goes further than the bills we've been able to pass and and sets a much more ambitious goals you talk about commuting to Culver City from the valley um the one thing while we're thinking globally we need to act locally we need rail through the Sepulveda pass I'm sure especially if you drive during rush hour you're sitting there at four miles an hour behind you know with every tailpipe churning out uh Smog and carbon and um I think that if we can uh provide rail through the Sepulveda pass and and uh as we've shown on our our website there are different proposals some call for a Subway some call for a monorail on the 405 I think it's it's important that we get something built and built within the next decade um and uh even if for some reason uh you can't write it uh whoever would be in front of you on the 405 on your way to Culver City um hopefully it will be on the rail uh it'll connect up to the uh what are called the purple and then turquoise lines uh although they're taking away the colors and they're going to letters whatever um so that people who do go through the Sepulveda pass will then be able to connect and go to Century City or Beverly Hills or uh or or or or or take uh take the train to uh to Santa Monica so I think it'll be a a very useful addition Los Angeles is the most important city and the biggest city in the world that doesn't really have a rail system and we've been building it all too slowly of with that uh uh we're gonna go on to a uh uh one more question and then we're gonna do a survey question okay Congressman we have yes sir uh you want to take one more question from we want to take one more question yes we're waiting for the Senate okay um we have uh uh Wesley from Encino Wesley you are on right now all right hello uh thanks for having me and thanks for doing this I really appreciate the uh the the direct democracy we're having here uh my question is when will we see obviously on a state level but also County city and down to the bottom enforcement about uh water regulations here because we drive up and down the valley I see some people sacrificed their lawns are gone and they didn't need them anyway but um you look at County property City properties the south of the boulevard up in Granada Calabasas um obviously these folks can afford to keep watering their lawn and pay the fine but when will their actual be enforcement to could directly affect our drought that's going on here and then secondly can we see on a state level or will we ever an incentivization to uh to get private homeowners and everyone to convert their lawns to uh to more drought tolerant to native plants La again best city in the world why are we falling behind Vegas Phoenix all over the Southwest again uh you may see people uh with who are watering their lawns maybe they're doing it in Conformity with the regulations maybe they're violating you'd have to look at whether they're odd or even and uh what day of the week it is um not everybody with a green lawn is is violating the rules I uh I do think that we need to and we pass the bipartisan infrastructure built we've got money in there that can particularly recycle so much of our water that uh is is going to waste now that could be could be used a second time the thing to to focus on about water is that in all the cities and all the suburbs we use well under 15 of the state's water uh well over 40 percent is going to Agriculture and uh roughly 40 percent a little uh is being allowed to uh to go to the ocean um that is good for those fish particularly salmon that that come up the river but the the while we live in a city and that's what we see and you think oh we've got to Drought the big problem is that guy's lawn that is the tiniest part of this we need agriculture that is more efficient and farmers are paying way way less for water uh than people who live in cities and so there's much less incentive for them uh to uh to conserve so I think that if we had some sort of pricing system uh where Farmers would lose use less and be incentivized to use less that we might be there now in fact uh the the water regulations in Phoenix and and and then Vegas are traditionally more severe than Los Angeles those cities are very much built in the desert we're built kind of on the fringes of a desert um but uh there's a lot that can be done to conserve water to reuse water and uh as to enforcement of the rules we do have rules they should be enforced and I think uh uh you know it may take a little while but uh uh uh I think that the uh DMV will be uh will be enforcing those rules um say we've only had them for a short amount of time and of course there is some basic enforcement in that the more water you you and this is not new the more water you use the more you pay so uh there's already a strong incentive um to and then and then of course from we've had programs where we actually uh pay people to uh to rip out their lawns and uh and put in something that doesn't uh doesn't need to be irrigated so uh I think that uh uh you know we live in a dry part of the country that is uh is getting drier we're dealing with climate change and uh we've got to look at at all three elements uh City usage and possibly reusage Agriculture and uh how much water we allow to to flow to the ocean um with that we do have our first uh guest speaker and uh I've had yes speakers join us simply because uh so many people who call in are concerned with issues involving State local government we couldn't have anybody better to talk about state government than Senate Majority Leader Emeritus Robert hertzberg uh thanks and uh oh I was going to tell us to tell people great things about you Bob before I introduce you uh he was unanimously elected uh speaker of the State Assembly by both Democrats and Republicans back in the day the Los Angeles Daily News has said he's uh as Relentless dedication and indefatigable energy and a reputation for integrity and perseverance so now here he is to tell us what's happening in Sacramento Senator Robert hertzberg thank you Congressman I really appreciate it and thanks for including me and thanks for the important partnership that we have in serving the folks of the San Fernando Valley together for so many years and I got to tell you it's it's so many of the successes that we're having at the state which have been many as the result of the policies that Congress and Chairman's been fighting for and I'm not just saying that to say that it's just the truth the reality is so much money we've had over the last few years during the pandemic for PPP for so many of the subsidies to be able to help businesses and the community folks and to pay for a vaccines in The Light Came From the federal government so much of the money 5.4 billion dollars from the federal government authorized and led by Sherman for all these eviction defenses and making sure people's rents covered so as we become the deliverers of these things I always have great respect for an appreciation for the people uh or part of this and I never think it's ethical or right to sit and take credit when they in fact did it so I just want to make that clear and I really appreciate that congressman and the same thing now with the inflation with the act that it was just passed some weeks ago in Congress again providing an extraordinary benefit to us in California in terms of allocation of resources reducing uh drug prices for prescriptions insulin all sorts of things increasing the subsidies for covered in California on the health care piece but I want to talk about a couple of the things that I think were successful in this year that tie into what this particularly the congressman was just talking about in water and some of the other issues I always like to start with budget because when you've got more money it's easier to solve more problems and when you have less money it creates very significant issues and there's furloughs and layoffs and all sorts of problems and cuts services and the like that we want to do in government we've had the last two years just an extraordinary amount of money for two reasons one there's been a lot of these uh initial public offerings that have produced unbelievable amount of capital gains that has helped and plus literally hundreds of billions of dollars in the federal government we didn't do it in our own as a federal government that brought so much of this money that allowed us to then redistribute it in ways that were consistent with their mandate I'm concerned quite frankly uh you know with with the next coming years Congressman Sherman's a CPA he cares and he was the former member of Board of Equalization he knows a lot about tax and I hate that subject itself but if you don't think about tax and taxes and how the money where the money goes and how to get it get the money all the other things we want to do doesn't work and so we're going to I suspect in the next couple years in California we're going to be facing some significant challenges and the money that's coming into the federal government through all the various programs that have been developed are going to be significantly helpful to us avoiding some of the uh consequences of those downturns on water if the congressman you're just talking about I want to add a couple of thoughts to it there's three million gallons a day not a not a week not a month a year three million gallons a day that we clean up to Federal standards and we have a pipe that goes three miles out into the ocean and we put the water in the ocean but you know as as they say in Yiddish a walking cup you gotta have a hole in your head it's nuts here we are having drought and problems and we're throwing water in the ocean one year just for the fun of it I introduced a bill that said I made it illegal to put water in the ocean uh because I wanted to make the point and so with the money the federal government's now giving us the Recycled water the idea is to take that water instead of putting the ocean to recharge the groundwater but basically there's spreading Fields where you can put it in the ground it sinks back in it percolates through the Earth and cleans it up even more and then you basically hypothetically stick a straw on the ground and pump it back out and so as we have a water system that takes water from the Colorado River or from Northern California we can be much more sustainable in that regard that's number one and I think you're going to see a lot of that activity and particularly the money the federal government gave us two a couple of years ago Jerry Brown uh uh wanted to introduce and Laura Friedman assembly woman representing Burbank Glendale area and I authored a series of bills dealing with you know conservation as a way of life trying to figure out how we can conserve in a more elegant way the congressman said is correct of all the water that falls on the earth in California 50 of it goes to the environment the other 50 percent goes to agriculture industry and residential use eighty percent of that 50 goes to Agriculture and he talked about the idea of what's happening there and the challenges we face which we have to focus on but we still need to conserve and so we passed a law that that not based upon individual homes but based upon water districts that set as standard and part of that law that we did two years ago said let's have the state water board take a look well Bob if I could if I could interrupt if you could wrap it up in the next two minutes that would be good I will I will I'm happy to and so we just I just passed another another conservation effort there secondly that's really important is housing we've been a really significant breakthrough for affordable housing in Sacramento so I think you're going to see a lot of those log jams that we had that were slow in building affordable housing are now going to offer an opportunity to build housing and lastly I wanted to share on climate change and extreme heat and the like we've put in billions and billions of dollars to begin that shift consistent with the money that's coming from the federal government to deal with the climate change issues so I think there's some pretty good things I was able to bring back tens of millions of dollars to the San Fernando Valley for all sorts of projects from The Jewish Home I mean the the Jewish Family Services to the hope of the valley for homeless people alike and together with Henry Stern Ben Allen and myself we probably brought back well over 100 million dollars for the San Bernal Valley to help support so many Community efforts so it's all been a good partnership and I'm optimistic is that leave government in the state level and deeply appreciative partnership with Congressman Sherman and thank you for telling me so much time thanks Robert hertzberg Bob thank you uh at this point we're going to do a a survey question and and Bob also not only thank you for coming on thank you for what you've been doing fighting for the valley for the last uh umpteen years um we're gonna do a survey question not everybody gets to ask a question from the floor but everybody gets to express their opinion our first question question a is when we've asked in a lot of our town halls we get different answers so we want to find out uh this time do you approve of President Biden's performance as president so far press one if you approve of Biden's performance press 2 if you disapprove press three on your phone if you're unsure somewhere there in the middle in addition I told people that they could RSVP for these uh this event and submit a question in advance we can't do all the questions that have been submitted advance but we can do the one from Charles Dorothy at Dorsey of Burbank who asks uh give us an update on the progress of the tax uh filing simplification Act of 2022. um I ought to explain what the ACT does this is a a project of Senator Warren from Massachusetts and myself and it would really revolutionize what income tax filing is for the vast majority of Americans what would happen is the IRS would send you a first draft of your tax return they already know what you make they know how much was withheld they know how much you uh interest you paid on your mortgage and they already know what interest you got on your bank account so you get that and if that's all the information that's needed and it's accurate you push submit you've done your taxes for the year if for some reason you say hey wait a minute uh that number is off you just erase it put in the right number um or if you see that uh yes the IRS knew everything but they didn't know how much I donated to Hope of the valley well you add that to the return uh and uh uh and and push submit and you're done uh now what if you don't trust the IRS they send you the draft you hit a race on your computer do it the old-fashioned way the folks at Turbo Tax have a big Lobby uh they are fighting this um they have promised uh several years ago a free system um but they've been held uh uh they've been fined substantially by the Federal Trade Commission by hiding the free system and only letting people know about the paid system uh but their system is a computer program where you have to fill in in everything and that also offers you a chance to make a mistake even if you can find your W-2 form and it did you know and it didn't get lost and you go to put in the numbers and you reverse a couple now you've got an erroneous return uh whereas if the IRS they don't have to input these numbers they get it all electronically there's no humans uh in involved they can't reverse the numbers uh well and if they do you'll catch it but uh so uh this is a much better system where the IRS keep has the information and shows you what the what they've got um I would say we're not going to be able to pass the bill this Congress we do not have any uh uh Republic we have very little Republican support I've got 50 of my colleagues in the house and Senator Warren has 22 of her colleagues in the Senate uh who have co-sponsored this bill and it's it's also being imposed by a philosophy that you once heard from Ronald Reagan who says a lot to say about taxes who said taxes ought to hurt that in the effort to limit government that if we just make the process of conforming with taxes more difficult uh that that people were sour on the entire experience and I simply don't agree with that my life and your life have enough hassles already and if our tax returns can be done more more easily and more cheaply and Turbo Tax doesn't get a fee uh that's so much the better now have the results from our uh first survey approval approval of Biden 73 percent disapprove 18 percent unsure nine percent let's take a question from the floor and then we'll hear from our next guest speaker all right Congressman we have a question from Barry from Woodland Hills regarding the other Ira the retirement Ira ah hello Congressman um Sherman thank you for taking my call uh my question is is Congress considering a moratorium on the required minimum distribution for senior citizens uh this year as was done in 2020 uh the reason being for this question is that the amount of rmd that is required uh is based on an inflated portfolio ending on January on December 31st of 2021 however the market has fallen a great deal as much as 20 25 percent and many of those portfolios of senior citizens are grass are grossly deflated now but the amount required to come out of those portfolios is still based on the inflated amount of 2021 uh giving us a year reprieve on that required minimum distribution would allow us to recover uh these uh greatly deflated portfolios and by taking the rmd based on last year's return would be uh accelerating the depletion of these Ira uh let me comment on this and let me translate it for those who are either too young or too poor to have enough money in an IRA for this to to be a big concern um the whole idea of the IRA is and do the 401K is you put money away for your retirement and then in your retirement years since you didn't pay taxes when you put the money in you'd pay taxes on the money coming out it's not supposed to be a system where you permanently defer um uh taxes on the income you're just deferring it to your retirement years and the assumption is that you're in some sort of retirement uh in the at age 70 and a half uh or before if you choose to do it before um there are people who are are doing well and have money in their 401k or their IRA and don't need it right now and would prefer to leave it there and um and particularly they don't want to have their Ira or 401K uh sell stock at today's prices the first thing I'd say is there is no assurance that tomorrow's stock market will be bigger than today's stock market we've all seen the stock market go down that doesn't assure that it's going back up uh and the second thing is that uh uh people ought to have a portion especially once they reach uh the retirement years a portion of their Ira in a liquid funds uh and no risk funds um it if the object of the IRA or 401K is to make she be sure that people can retire in dignity and that is its purpose to risk all your money in the stock market when you're fully retired um is is not what most you know everybody's free to make their own decisions but it's it's certainly not exactly in line with the purpose of the program um I do think that uh we will look at some amelioration of the uh rule that for this year that says that you have to distribute so much of your IRA or your 401k and be taxed on it by the end of 2022 I don't think it'll be a complete suspension and frankly uh uh uh I I I don't know but I think that uh of the 401K era and Ira is a a system where people who can afford to save are given a break on their taxes but it's not supposed to be a permanent break it's supposed to be uh realized at uh at uh once you well once you once you once you reach I believe it's uh 55 or 57 and a half you can start and certainly by 70 and a half you should be taking uh taking money out but we uh uh we have had an extraordinary disruption of our economy I can't imagine that we're going to change the rules every time we have a year where the stock market goes down uh but kovid has is still affecting our economy uh and now uh uh we're going to call on our next guest speaker and that is uh our councilwoman for the uh for much of the South San Fernando Valley uh nithya Rahman um she earned her bachelor's degree in political Theory from Harvard University and then got a master's in urban planning from MIT so she's got the best education the city of Cambridge Massachusetts can provide she has been redistricted so much more of her uh district is in the San Fernando Valley including Sherman Oaks and Encino and parts of Studio City and she has been a real partner of mine in looking at things to fight for to get funded out of the federal government the House of Representatives I've now got it pretty uh pretty well wired here uh will pass a number of things I can't guarantee that the that the Senate will go along but at least the house will provide the three things in in the nithia's district that she and I have worked on um three million dollars for The Studio City Recreation Center uh to construct a new gym and a community center uh some 750 000 to improve the surface seed Transportation uh in the Sherman Oaks Encino area and uh uh uh four million dollars to improve parks and and then ball fields around the South and West San Fernando Valley so uh a lot of people I know who call in uh or are part of our telephone Town Halls are concerned with City issues uh nithia why don't you take uh three minutes and summarize everything that's going on in the city great hi can you hear me yes wonderful okay well thank you so much Congressman Sherman for having me um I'm really really delighted to be here uh as as you said my name is nithya Rahman I am the LA City council member representing Council District Four which has 260 000 constituents and the district now stretches from uh Silver Lake Los Feliz and Griffith Park through the Hollywood Hills to Studio City Sherman Oaks Encino and a big chunk of Reseda and so all of the portions of my district that are in the San Fernando Valley are represented by you Congress member Sherman so I'm really excited to be here and grateful to be here and to be able to give everyone who's listening some updates about things that are happening in Council District Four and in the city of Los Angeles overall first and foremost I just wanted to reiterate uh details about this heat wave and resources that we have available uh everyone from our elderly those with disabilities those without air conditioning and those without homes have been suffering especially in the San Fernando Valley heat in the valley we have La libraries that are open as cooling centers during regular business hours and LA City Pools like the one at Van Nuys Sherman Oak Trek Center which are open during regular business hours the largest cooling centers in the valley in my district which are open from 10 a.m to 9 pm until Friday through the end of the heat wave are the Mid Valley Senior Citizen Center on Kester Ave in Panorama City and the Canoga Park Senior Citizen Center on Jordan Ave in Canoga Park so please stay cool and safe and if you need these resources you uh you should definitely Avail yourself to them I wanted to talk take a few moments also to talk about our office's work on homelessness which I know is one of the most important challenges facing Los Angeles right now and one that is really top of mind for so many of our constituents our office has really worked to end homelessness encampment by encampment in the district and we have successfully reduced the size and number of encampments throughout the entire District by doing exactly what we know works we do Outreach to people who are experiencing homelessness and we work with our staff and our team of contracted caseworkers to move people into housing these efforts to House people at encampments rather than moving people from One sidewalk to another which is what we've done in Los Angeles for many many years our our method is really different in Council District Four it results in real sustainable change on the ground in total in the district uh in the little over a year and a half since I've been in office about 250 people have gone indoors from encampments into interim shelter and about 150 of those have moved from their interim placements into permanent housing which is really exciting including at four of our District's major encampments in the valley that were there uh when I took over including at Van Nuys and 101 under the cold water in 101 underpass and at Ventura and Fruitland in Studio City this is a timely moment to be talking about homelessness because we're also going to get a progress report on the entire City's response on homelessness uh when we see the numbers from the 2022 annual homeless count so that's going to report on the population of people who are homeless in the city from account that was done in February of 2022 and it's particularly interesting because we missed last year's count due to coven so we're eagerly awaiting the results and hopefully seeing some of our progress reflected in those numbers hey thank you thank you so much uh nithya look forward to working with you in the years to come thanks for joining our town hall and now we have a another uh survey question um and this is question B and uh um uh Vicky I look forward to getting back together with you and and seeing some other projects we can try to seek Federal funding for affecting uh the South uh and West San Fernando Valley um and uh uh so question B uh do you support code of making the Roe v Wade standard in federal law by adopting the Woman's Health uh protection act uh if you support it press one if you don't support uh codifying and making Roe v way to a statute uh press two and if you're unsure press three uh with that let's oh I'd like to remind people if you'd like to ask a question dial Star three once again that's star three uh do we have another question from the floor should we uh do one of the written questions uh either way Congressman whatever let's take one from the floor okay we have uh Ian from Sherman Oaks Ian you are now live yes hello sorry about that hi hey uh so my question I'm sorry uh it's not going to be the best awarded question but uh my question uh congressman is uh has there been any talk um on the hill about uh kind of codifying any laws you know we we uh for couple centuries have depended upon the moral obligation and tradition for the president to behave in a certain Manner and you know we have the norms and traditions of the of the office and you know after 2016 with Donald Trump if there were a lot of things that you know we had we had all kind of taken for granted that this is what the president is just going to do um that uh he kind of bucked those traditions and has there been any talk of you know making any of those kind of norms and practices of law you know for example I I I I it it would be hard you know to just say all presidents shall be reasonable and shall follow the accepted customs and traditions of the country we have passed through the house I don't know if we can get it through the Senate a bill prohibiting this idea that Trump had at the end of his term uh to create what he called schedule F but basically it was a system to just fire civil servants unless they were part of his Maga group um the uh many of these Traditions are parts of law we have the federal records act that requires uh the executive branch files to remain with the executive branch um it's we do need to codify and be well before 2024 the process that was going on on January 6th that law was written in the 1870s I believe and when we instead need and I think will pass a law that says that the vice president's role clarifies I think what we all know and you can put this under tradition but I think it's law and it certainly needs to be explicit law that the vice president's role is merely ceremonial uh that this is a ceremonial process that once a state counts its ballots and then each side is free to go to the courts and say uh well these ballots should be counted this way or that and the courts resolve it and the state uh uh in the court system says okay this is who carried that state in the Electoral College the rest is just ceremonial yes the um the electors meet in the state capitol they cast their ballots consistent with the whoever won that state the ballots are then transmitted to the Congress the clerk has them the vice president presides over a a ceremonial process the idea that uh legislatures could say well we don't like how the people in our state voted we're installing these electors or that a vice president than a vice president Pence who had everything to gain he get to be vice president for another four years um but had the integrity and look I serve with uh with Mike Pence in the house for a decade and I disagree with him on everything but he did have one good day on January 6th and uh that's when he rejected the ridiculous idea that a vice president could say well the state has transmitted the fact that all of Pennsylvania's Electoral College votes go for Biden but I don't like that so I'm going to pull out of my pocket the fact that I had 12 you know 20 friends in Pennsylvania all got together in a room and they they said they want to count the ballots for uh Pennsylvania for for uh Trump Pence and so we'll just do put these forward instead I I think we have to have uh laws that make that that plane so uh I we don't have time to review each tradition that Trump violated uh and which ones are more than Traditions or but are explicit statutes but I think I've outlined there some of the the steps we should take now we have the results of our last uh hearing uh that last survey question codify Roe v Wade support 84 don't support eight percent unsure eight percent uh with that let me take a question uh submitted in advance by uh uh Douglas uh McLennan um of Studio City who asks can you provide your constituency up with an update on how you're fighting excessive noise pollution from Jets departing Burbank airport we are being assaulted from the skies exclamation point um I can provide the update what I can't do is tell you that uh we've been successful in uh in in dealing with the noise problem and to some extent to deal with the noise problem you need to force the FAA to reconfigure all of the airspace above LA County because you go and say well why does every jet um that leaves Burbank have to fly over Studio City can't it fly in any one of the other different directions and the answer is always well you've got this in Santa Monica you've got that in Ontario and so it's not an you can't just pull one string you have to design a system to minimize the noise and to make sure that if there is going to be noise it's not all over the southeast San Fernando Valley um the we've had a um a host of of forums what we've seen from the FAA is a refusal to act thank God we now have a new FAA director now our administrator and it happens to be Phil Washington and I organized an effort to get uh Phil Washington confirmed um we in the house don't have a vote on that but uh some 19 of us with the Quiet Skies caucus uh uh urged that uh President Biden and secretary buditage nominate an FAA administrator who can was concerned about the noise from Aviation and uh Phil Washington I worked with when he headed LA Metro he was a ground transportation person who had previously had some air transportation and he left La went to Denver and picked up more air transportation and now he is our FAA and uh before I I took those steps I talk to Phil and I at least have a pledge that he is going to take the health and safety of people on the ground uh into greater consideration than it has been and when I say quiet Skies caucus that's a group that we have here in Washington and we use the term quiet skies I realize that in La the LA area there are a number of different groups concerned uh with um with airport noise each person or each group has their own View and the quiet Skies caucus here in Washington is not particularly associated with the quiet guys group in the San Fernando Valley um I mean we're all trying to achieve the same thing which is quiet Skies but uh uh we're not taking sizes between different groups uh in L.A County um in last September we introduced the restore everyone sleep together uh act the rest Act to say that Burbank and Van Nuys and other airports can adopt a curfew I think that's critical and enforce it um we have introduced The Quiet communities act uh to establish an office of noise abatement in the Environmental Protection Agency because right now the only agency focused on Airport noise is the FAA and the FAA is a captured agency the airlines have captured it and controlled it really since the very beginning uh we got a report uh from uh the GAO the government accountability office it says what we already know and that is that the faa's system for measuring noise in the San Fernando Valley is completely wrong because you can't just look at how high does the noise get but you also have to look at how sustained the uh the noise is um so uh is you know can you hear yourself think in Studio City often not um am I fighting on this yes uh we have some support in Congress but the airlines are are powerful players with uh with a lot of control in Congress and even more control uh with the uh with the FAA and I'm not going to rest on this until uh you can get rest uh you know even you know in Studio City or in Sherman Oaks where I live um Don let's take a question from the floor if you want to ask a question okay Congressman um we have Brad from when that uh Brad you are now live hello Congressman Sherman um can you hear me yep okay um in the ira regarding Ira inter the inflation reduction act electrical vehicles are defined as a four-wheeled vehicle and I'm wondering uh could you include three-wheel vehicles in a definition of EVs and um and and allow that to qualify for tax credits well there aren't very many three-wheeled vehicles obviously if we included them in the incentive to create them I I could imagine that we cover both free and uh two-wheeled vehicles and uh you know um uh motorcycle doesn't burn a lot of gas but uh does create a fair amount of noise and uh you can certainly smell them uh and uh uh it would certainly be a step forward to move toward the electric uh two and three wheeled vehicles um that's not an area that I personally was involved in drafting uh but it's one of the things certainly for us for us to look at uh let's take another question from the floor okay sir we have uh uh you know uh you know what let's uh let's do a survey question first since we'll want to be able to report the answers if we can this is our final survey question do you support the 15 percent minimum corporate tax and that it's based on the not the tax the uh and it's based on the income that corporations of over a billion dollars report to their shareholders do you support the 15 percent minimum corporate tax push one if yes push two no push three if unsure let's take a question from the floor okay Congressman Brian from Woodland Hills Brian you are on hi good evening Congressman um good evening I wanted to ask a general a broad question about um your feelings on the reform of the Supreme Court um there are two issues on uh the Supreme Court that are being considered one is to apply the judicial standard of Ethics to the Supreme Court I certainly support that uh I'm angered by the way that uh the uh Obama administration was prevented from appointing uh uh a Justice uh in its final year and uh I could see expanding the Supreme Court to ameliorate that and that would require that we add two more justices the it is purely a matter of Statute how many justices we have and um uh we have had different numbers over uh the first century of our our Union it's only in more recent times that we've settled on nine I do worry that that sets a precedent that whoever is in or out uh you know okay gets into Power says oh let's have 15 let's have 30 and pretty soon you need uh uh you need the a basketball arena to house the Supreme Court um so I'm a bit wary of that but I don't think that the current Supreme Court reflects uh the voting of the American people it's supposed to reflect um uh decisions made by presidents and and confirmed by the Senate and the Senate isn't supposed to just block anyone so uh I don't as a practical matter think that we can get an enlargement of the Supreme Court through the Senate uh I'd be reluctant to go willy-nilly but I I do think that what happened in the final year of the Obama Administration was a travesty and I'd be willing to vote to reverse that effect and you'd need um you need to add two one to vote against the per you know Neil Gorsuch one is to have a different philosophy than the university and that and that would often cancel out his vote and then another one to be the Merrick garland that that I think should have been confirmed but uh um uh will as as a practical matter I can't imagine that uh uh that we really have a chance to put that into law um and uh obviously the Dodge decision on uh on abortion was was tragic but uh the better way to deal with that is to codify Roe v Wade as a national statute uh we have uh uh the the results uh of the last question uh do you support a 15 minimum tax yes 80 percent no nine percent unsure 11 I think we have time for one more question from the floor Don who do we have okay Congressman we have uh Gail from Woodland Hills Gail you are on now Congressman can you hear me yes thank you I want to know why we're pushing in the state of California for 2035 for electric vehicles when we're going through blackouts and brownouts and having to deter our you know keep our lights off I mean I'm sitting in the dark right now the only thing that's lit is my phone and how can we do that and demand that we have a you know all electric cars I don't understand can you explain it to me are we doing more nuclear power plants how are we going to generate more electricity well we're going to um first of all just saying you can't sell uh uh you have to sell electric car in 2035 doesn't mean every car is electric by 2035. um it'll be a natural phase out over the 10 years following that as people turn in uh their their cars uh we need uh the um in the the hours from 10 p.m or 11 p.m through 6 a.m We have uh on an awful lot more available electricity uh than we do at other times during the days because all the lights are off and most of the televisions are off and of course all the uh all the office buildings are shut down and all the factories are shut down uh so I do think that we'll be able to generate adequate electricity uh as these cars become efficient and as timers on them can cause them to be charged between the um uh uh 10 p.m and 6 a.m uh that being said uh if this is going to work we're going to have to expand uh our capacity to generate electricity with more solar and uh and more wind power and uh uh and and while we don't want to see fossil fuels being burned um it you've got to have the capacity to burn fossil fuels uh when when you need to in order to deal with with Peak demand or days on which uh the wind power is unavailable um there are you know Diablo Canyon is going to be kept open uh for a while and uh in the heat we've experienced in the valley uh this week we see that stopping global warming is an important goal it has to be uh reached in a way that's fair a the studies I've seen indicate that you that even if you had to burn uh natural gas in order to power an electric vehicle per mile that would generate an awful lot less carbon than If instead you had a gasoline engine so uh even if um we're talking about generating electricity this is the way we do now um we still move closer to achieving our our goals um uh you know it's it's a bold step I'm certainly concerned about the price of these vehicles and uh uh uh will of course the price of gasoline drives me in the other direction per mile you're paying an awful lot less in California uh uh for fuel if your fuel is is electricity but we can't all afford Teslas at today's Tesla prices and um the uh the inflation reduction Act provides the incentives that I think will allow some people to buy electric vehicles what we really have to do is push this industry to the point where everyone can afford an electric vehicle and we saw that you know 100 years ago um when cars were automobiles were the playthings of the Rich and as they got more popular uh the technology was better developed and the prices came way down so um I expect that will happen because even with the tax credits is today's prices most people can't afford an electric car um okay I think that's uh the last question that we'll be able to handle uh and uh uh I'm gonna ask people to to stay on the line for a second um and uh you can go to bradsherman.house.gov to learn about our next town hall which will be the week before Thanksgiving and you can submit a question in advance and RSVP um as soon as I say goodbye you're going to be connected to our voicemail system I'm going to ask you to do two things first give me your email address believe it or not even if I already have it because that allows me to keep you informed uh under house rules that say that I can't send emails sometimes to people unless I got the email from them and second you can leave a message either if you have a constituent service issue or if uh you want to express your opinion I won't listen tonight I will listen tomorrow so if you didn't get a chance to express your opinion during the town hall uh I can certainly hear that opinion tomorrow I want to thank uh Senator Bob hertzberg and councilwoman nithya Rahman for joining us I want to thank everyone for being involved and I look forward to seeing you in the San Fernando Valley this is Congressman Brad Sherman foreign

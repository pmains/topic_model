Good To Be With You John you know it's interesting to hear the justices finally admit what I think most Americans people like yourself understand this is not the job of the Supreme Court to regulate big Tech this is congress's responsibility talk to us about the efforts you're spearheading and why you think they may actually work well I really appreciate the Supreme Court saying that because for over a hundred years Congress has left it to the courts to interpret the Sherman Act and The Clayton Act which are the prime antitrust legislation that was passed by Congress and uh Congress has not done its uh responsible it has not fulfilled its responsibility under article one that being making laws we clearly see a an evolution of the economy into e-commerce and and social media and Congress should be passing laws and should have refined section 230 um and and clearly in this case you would see that it would save lives it was a uh Isis was able to recruit terrorists on uh on the internet now section 230 protects these companies um if they allow uh if they take down speech um that fits within a certain category um this speech was allowed to stay up and these companies are trying to see Community it's going to be very interesting to see what the court does in this case yeah section 230 came out of uh you know the belief that you shouldn't hold phone companies accountable for the things that people say let's just pretend for the sake of argument Congressman Buck you and I are two mafioso guys and we're planning some sort of hit we can't let the phone company be responsible for what we say over the phone but this also comes from 1996 and it's kind of like using a cell phone from 1996. you know that's the type of Technology that's how much things have advanced so it's it's almost ludicrous to think about using section 230 which is that old to regulate the modern internet what John I have to run for office so let's not pretend that I'm in the mall okay it was a joke it was for the sake of argument you know I understand though your position I fully do uh but yeah so so Congress wanted to make sure that these tech companies could take down child porn or recruiting terrorists or or other dangerous uh you know selling drugs other dangerous material from the internet um and gave them immunity for taking that material down um obviously we want to protect uh these social media companies um from uh allowing uh Speech regular people engaging in regular discussion now these tech companies have gone further and they've taken down speech of of individuals that they don't like they disagree with their opinion and now they leave up an Isis recruiting uh material uh incredibly dangerous so I I think the court is well positioned to make a determination in this case and I hope they do yeah my read on this Congressman you know better than I would but it was really to make sure that there was free and Fair competition when it came to the internet that was part of the motivation here as well so the the smaller companies could still Thrive uh in this burgeoning world of the internet yeah well clearly small companies don't have the ability to fight off lawsuits the way the huge companies do and so giving immunity for the smaller companies protects them from constant lawsuits um but what's happened is just a few companies like Facebook or Google control search or social media and in the process they have developed the ability to really influence speech As We Know It in America so you mean something that was passed by Congress with the idea of protecting little guy gets co-opted by the big guys and then is used to suppress wow I'm shocked that this type of stuff could happen but again a good reason why we need folks like yourself taking a closer look at it Congressman Ken Buck great to have you with us as always

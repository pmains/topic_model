I want to thank you mr. president before I get in my prepared remarks I just want to say that we've been a war for 16 years and the senator asked is correct we do need to rebuild our military there's no if ands or buts about it it's not something that just came about last night it's something we should have been doing with this budget that should have been passed to go into effect the end of September and if you really want to talk about the hypocrisy of this body and there's plenty of it the fact that we've got folks coming to the floor who haven't said a peep about chip in it also by the way ran out of money the end of September and talked about how important it is for those kids and by the way it is very important for those kids when it's the first time we've heard a peep out of them is interesting but the fact is is that we do need to come together and we do need a long-term budget deal and by the way what I'm talking about long term I'm not talking about years and years I'm talking about to the end of September of this year that's what we got to have budget deal to the end of September this year that addresses more than just chip and chip is important it needs to address our military it needs to address our southern border security the Chairman knows this we work together on the Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security he understands how important this is we've got to make sure our borders are secure and we've got to make sure we have domestic programs that working families and businesses depend upon for this country like chip like funding community health centers like making sure there's dollars there for rural ambulance services and the list goes on and on but we've had an incredible failure of leadership here I think we've had three patches to this budget three of them this was supposed to be done 111 days ago 111 days ago we were supposed to have a budget that lasted for the fiscal year 18 we were supposed to have a bill that kept the services for the US government open and operating so that Montana's anamur could have the certainty that they elected us to create but for a hundred eleven days the leadership on the other side of the aisle and I mean intentionally so I believe have played politics and kicked the can down the road this is not nuclear physics folks this is about fun in our government it's not that tough but we've hit deadline after deadline after deadline and what we've been told is look we'll extend it out another month or two and we'll get an agreement Oh we'll send out another month and we'll get an agreement look at Christmastime I was ready to work here through Christmas to get this done because families in this country deserves a certainty of the basic job of setting up a budget this was a basic job or elected for in this body but on I believe December 19th once again we kick the can down the road and it was said you know what we're going to have a deal by January 19th well guess what January 19th and now we're gonna move the goalposts again each of those previous patches I voted for why because I believed it I expect that the leaders this body to work in good faith and get the job done I was wrong because for 111 days they were refused to provide long term funding for community health centers for 111 a have failed to pass a bill that secures our borders for 111 days they've neglected our children by refusing to reauthorize chip for 111 days they've failed to do the most basic and fundamental aspect of our job and that has passed a long-term budget that works for this country and works for my home state of Montana now today we're about nine hours before the government is set to run out of money folks on the other side of the aisle are pointing the finger over here and say geez we've got to reauthorize chip if we don't all these kids guess what that same argument could have been made six months ago and was not we've got twenty four thousand kids in Montana who I'm telling you they've been watching and those families been watching and say why why hasn't it already been done why are we a hundred and eleven days after the budgets been passed and we still have nothing there's a chip bill that's been sitting on a Majority Leader's desk for many a month to reauthorize chip I believe it has 24 co-sponsors on it and now there are members of this body who are not even co-sponsors of that bill who have found religion and come to Florida and passionately talk about chip and we have heard crickets from them until the last day or two so the folks who have been down here on the floor and on cable television talking about what a great program chip is and it has been a great program it's one of the first pieces of major legislation that voted on when I was in the Montana Senate where you been why haven't we had it on the floor and voted on it it's important it's pure hypocrisy that's what the senator from Alaska talked about only on a different issue this dysfunction of failure here is way way way too deep this bill also fails to fund community health centers and I'm going to tell you I've talked to the administrators of these community health centers in in places like Riverstone and Flathead up in Kalispell and Bullock and Havre I'm going to tell you what these folks are sweating bullets they're afraid they're going to have to close their facilities down they provide primary health care to a hundred thousand folks that might not sound much like many people but in Montana a state of just over a million folks it's a big deal these are essential facilities to our communities across Montana they provide basic health and they keep families alive the folks that run these community health centers have told me face-to-face if we don't get the funding we're gonna have to close the doors it's been 111 days and we should have had a budget to fund the anyhow centers and we're still standing here today saying guess what we come back here in February things are going to be just fine just like they said in December I got news for you nothing's going to change between now and February so let's get a long-term budget deal today that addresses some of these issues this boat this bill also fails to make our border secure as I said earlier the chairman of the body right now and I have worked on the Homeland Security appropriations committee to draft a bill that works that invests in a wall where a wall makes sense it hires more Border Patrol agents that bill was never brought up to full committee and I'm sorry that that never happened because it would have been great and it's really it's not included in the bill before us today time and time again over the last four months good bipartisan bills have been piled up on leadership's desk and rather than bring these bipartisan bills to the floor rather than pass a long-term budget a more fiscally responsible budget the Senate has just said now guess what we'll do it next month and we'll do it the month after that and we'll do it the month after that it is time to stop putting the band-aid on our budget because in four weeks we'll be back here again if this passes and it'll be the same problems when in fact we can solve them today and we need to solve them today enough is enough Congress has three times past short-term stopgap crisis funding bills these bills fail my constituents and they waste taxpayer dollars enough is enough mr. president people are tired of this and I know they're tired and on the other side of the aisle because they've told me they told me it's time to do our job there's frustrated as aisle there as frustrated as Montanans are when I meet him face to face in town halls and coffee shops they tell me it's time for Congress to get off their Duff and do their job Montana's don't run their businesses like this and our government should not run like this especially especially after I hear promises to drain the swamp this is exactly the opposite bringing this garbage bill to the floor is a dereliction of duty its incompetent and mostly it is a failure of leadership it's a failure of vision in any other business in this country of managers acted like a leadership of this body they lose their jobs it's almost as if the majority have planned this all along to get us this point for political purposes well guess what we should not be here for political purposes we should be here as Americans doing our best to give people the certainty that they need rather than playing with a hot potato say and you know what we'll do it next month we were sent here to govern we ought to govern put politics in the closet we got 9 hours to do a job we need to do it if the majority leadership and the White House are going to continue to set back and twiddle their thumbs let's bypass them let's get a deal there's good people in this body we need to sit down and get a deal that works for this year for the rest of this year that's to the end of September not to the 19th of February the strengthens our border the reauthorizes chip that funds our community health center that supports rural hospitals that fixes daca now that I know that there are scores and scores of folks on the other side of the aisle that want to do this nobody should leave our deaths in this body until this job is done we are nearly four months into this fiscal year at some point in time the Appropriations Committee should be starting to work on the 19th fiscal year budget but we're not because we can't even get through 18 we need to stop governing from crisis to crisis nobody wants a shutdown and that's why we need to stay here and do our jobs

joining us now a member of the house foreign affairs committee and in fact a former intelligence official democratic congresswoman abigail spanberger of virginia congresswoman thank you so much for being up so early to start us off on this uh historic day as the president is set to meet with putin i'm just going to ask you to respond first of all to that stack of republicans we saw talking about president biden i mean it's extraordinary that we had a republican president the former president stand on stage in helsinki next to president putin and take the side of putin over the reporting of u.s intelligence officials and the fact that now we see some of my republican colleagues evidently forgetting the reality of that four-year time when we saw former president trump not acknowledge not understand not address the threat that was and continues to be russia is is extraordinary and and certainly we have seen president biden take a strong stance you mentioned the sanctions that he's already imposed in in response to the the hacking from russia do you have any concerns about that pipeline in particular are there any actions that president biden has taken or not taken toward russia that concern you at all so i'm i was glad to see him impose sanctions particularly after the solar winds hack uh i i do hope that in the conversations there will be a stern conversation about the fact that russia continues to give safe harbor to criminal networks such as the group that perpetrated the colonial pipe pipeline attack but but so far i think the president biden has taken a strong measured approach and by all accounts is well prepared to walk into the meeting today how do you think the president should balance the tension that exists kind of behind the scenes between russia and china and how the u.s wants to deal with china versus how europe is a little bit more concerned about russia because they're right there right it's a lot of nato countries for example right there near uh these these borders i think there is some sense that we want to try to stabilize the relationship with russia so that we can focus on beijing how does the president thread that needle so i don't i don't think that the intent is to kind of uh do one thing so we can move on to something else from a national security standpoint uh you mentioned the injection i'm a former cia officer from a diplomatic standpoint now serving on the foreign affairs committee um we can have concurrent relationships and ways of engaging various different uh either adversaries or partners so i think the focus here is recognizing the long-term strategic threat that the chinese government continues to pose to us and our western allies while also notably recognizing the continued threat that russia poses through its hacking efforts through its election interference so uh they're just strategically and operationally different challenges that we face and so we do need to approach them differently yeah one of the things that we were and i know we spoke about this briefly earlier this week this idea of swapping in cyber attacks uh prisoners with the russians is that something you think the president should engage with or not that enters into a bit of a challenging territory certainly we need to hold russia to account for the hacking of vital u.s infrastructure and certainly for giving safe harbor to criminal networks that continue to perpetrate these ransomware attacks in in terms of what tools may exist in the president's toolbox um you know i think that is something that he should judiciously look at pulling out potentials for for prisoner swaps but that's i think a bit further down the road while i have you let me ask you one question about uh some of the stuff that's gone on here at home notably the january sixth uh commission and how democrats in the house now may move forward nancy pelosi the speaker met with committee chairs yesterday do you think there should be a select committee to investigate january 6th or not there has to be an effort a there has to be an investigation of january 6 it was an attack on our nation's capital people died police officers were injured 140 police officers capitol police and metropolitan d.c police were injured people lost fingers lost eyes insurrectionists tried to stop us from certifying election certifying the election we have to have an investigation it would be my hope and expectation that it would be as bipartisan as possible this isn't the this isn't a partisan issue it is the health of our democracy it shouldn't be uh so there has to be um a committee and a commission on this unfortunately we saw so many of my republican colleagues were unwilling to vote on what had been a negotiated bipartisan commission structured modeled after 9 11 that republican catgo representative catgo of new york and representative thompson uh put forth and so in in the absence of that we have to move forward with a commission and if this is the only way to get it then you know it's unfortunate that the republicans were unwilling to vote on the negotiated one um but we have to understand what led to that day all right congresswoman abigail spanberger thank you so much thank you getting up so early to be with us i realize all of it is very new thanks to science we're very grateful to have you here we're all getting used to our regular clothes right thank you again

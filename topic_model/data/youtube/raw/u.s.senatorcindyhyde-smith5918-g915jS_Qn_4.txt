tonight is not an evening for celebration we all want our nation to be strong and prosperous but the american people know the reality that we are all paying for president biden's bad policies and misjudgments over the past year no amount of rhetoric will convince the american people that things are better for us since president biden took office families are reminded of his incompetent handling of the economy every time they go to the grocery store gas up their car or receive a home heating bill we know it doesn't make sense when we see president biden begging the likes of russia and others to increase oil and gas production while doing everything in his power to limit u.s energy production we know things are not right with the escalating violent crime rates everywhere including small states like mississippi we know that allowing tens of thousands of illegal migrants and tons of illegal drugs to flow across the border is not safe or secure regarding our national security the american people are also right to be concerned that president biden's leadership is weakening the united states is standing on the global stage clearly the botched withdrawal from afghanistan last summer emboldened adversaries like russia and china that tragic embarrassment could have given vladimir putin more confidence to invade ukraine it certainly didn't deter him just as the mere threats of sanctions didn't stop his evil assault on ukraine the world is a more dangerous place today along with people around the globe i am truly inspired by the bravery of the ukrainian people we must continue to rally to defend democracy and support them and we must pray that president biden makes the right decisions to keep our nation and our interests safe tonight we may not be celebrating the state of our union under president biden's failed stewardship however we are americans filled with the faith-inspired confidence that god will continue to shine his favor on our nation and that things will get better i certainly will continue to work toward that goal thank you and god bless america

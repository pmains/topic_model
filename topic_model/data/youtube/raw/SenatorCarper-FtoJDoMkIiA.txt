hundreds of Delaware all right thanks mr. president mr. president summon came to my attention today that I hadn't seen before it's actually say a blog friendly written by Ben Bernanke the media past chairman of the Federal Reserve and wrote it in for bookings Institute and he talked about they pay for one of the pay-fors for the transportation bill that we're going to be sending conferees off to to discuss later leader to today and you may recall the the House passed a six-year authorization bill six-year authorization for transportation roads highways bridges transit and funding for three years we sent that over to the into the house and they came up with some new pay-fors and that frankly you know it's not a user fees that it's not even like pension smoothing it's not like stealing a TSA fees or customs fees but something new and they found money about 40 50 billion dollars in federal reserve and said well why don't we use that for transportation spending and interestingly enough father chair inform the Federal Reserve former chairman is has written today and understand the Washington Post among others whose editorialized on us today and this is uh this is what they say I'll just read a sentence or two out of chairman Bernanke's comments if I can talk about this new pay for where we take money from the the Federal Reserve and we use it for transportation purposes here's what Chairman Bernanke says he says more substantively and this is what I want to focus on today paying he puts paying in quotes but paying for highway spending with federal capital is not paying for it at all in any economically meaningful sense this is rather this maneuver is a form of budgetary sleight of hand there would count funds that are already designated for the Treasury as new revenues and here's here's what the the other houses has said normally so there's extra money that the the Federal Reserve has when they actually turn moaning over every year to the try in fact maybe about it as much as a half trillion dollars goes in earnings that the Federal Reserve makes and they have different points during the year they turn money over the Treasury well what the house language says here mr. president is that we're going to reduce that amount of money that would normally go from the treasure from the federal reserve of the Treasury during some part of this year and we're going to simply pull that money out and use it for for transportation now that money was going to go to Treasury anyway it was going to go from the Federal Reserve to Treasury anyway and now we're going to sort of like slip in and pull that money out and say no no we're going to use it for four roads highways and bridges it is a slight of hand jo is blowing the whistle on it as well and I'm delighted that Senator chairman Bernanke's calling it for for what it for what it is look we had the opportunity mr. president to pay for transportation projects we had the opportunity to pay for roads highways and bridges and to it to do with the the old-fashioned way and frankly a way that the chairman of our committee you Pete he'll be sitting over here German half-wits in favor of and that is we have a tradition in history in this country of things worth having their worth paying for and users and businesses that use roads highways and bridges here in the past which said they ought to pay for the use of them and now we are looking at a transportation bill which has says well now we're going to take money from tsa tsa fee increases and instead of regarding made using the make our our skies safer aviation safer we're going to steal ten years of TSA revenues and put over here in transportation we're going to take money that ought to go to fortify our borders or at least to make stronger more better equipped our border crossings where we have literally tens of millions of dollars worth of traffic going through trade going through every day and instead of fortifying those and name let's do a better job to find out if what's in those trucks is really produce or you know some other product orders are really narcotics there instead of doing a better job we're going to take those revenues and we're going to put them over on transportation the idea of taking money out of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve where we paid 89 a hundred dollars a a barrel and now selling it for about half that and we'll use the proceeds from at buy high sell low and use that money to pay for for transportation and now this says latest trip from the house to take the money out of the Federal Reserve isn't it's going to go to Treasury anyway it'll go to Treasury anyway instead we're going to take that money away from the Federal Reserve and pretend like it has no no consequence well actually that 50 or 60 billion dog would reduce the deficit that's where it would have gone this not the way to do it it's not the way to do business this is not the way to do visit we had the opportunity to fully fund a robust transportation plan several of with Senator Durbin senator Feinstein an eye out for legislation that would raise the very much like both Simpson would actually restore the purchasing power of the gas and diesel taxes in this country we've not raised him since 1993 since 1993 to the gasoline tax federal gasoline tax has been roughly 18 cents it's now what less than a dime because of inflation the diesel tax since 1993 it's worth is worth less than fifteen cents anomaly 23 sins and meanwhile roads highways bridges they're more expensive asphalt more expensive concrete more expensive steel more expensive labor more expensive and instead of being able to fund transportation in a genuine honest kind of way we're spending about 50 billion dollars a year to federal level for transportation it's about one-third of what spring spent nationally but we out of that fifty billion dollars we're only raised in 35 billion through our user fees and the rest we just glad we borrow the money and when we run out of money in the general fund we go around the world and borrow money from China and other places so that we can build roads highways and bridges and when the Chinese are mechana rocket rock mucking around in the South China Sea with Spratly Island in those other places we swear like say well you can't do that and I say we thought you wanted to borrow our money or if they're manipulating their currency or dumping their their goods and produce products on our markets and we say you can't do that and they say where we thought you wanted to borrow money we should not be beholden to them or anybody else we should fully fund transportation projects and we could do that the legislation is senators Feinstein Durbin and I offered would gradually raise the tax on diesel and gasoline by 4 cents a year for four years in an index is going forward how much money would that generate that would generate about two hundred and twenty billion dollars about 220 billion dollars over the next ten years we have it we got a d-plus that's a great that our roads highways bridges get to these days that's the because why because about a quarter of our bridges are in bad shape and the service of our roads and highways are as well people say they don't want to pay any more money for user fees were for gas or for your for diesel about 30,000 gas stations across America last week you know people paid less than two dollars a gallon for gasoline less than two dollars a gallon my friends as it turns out if we actually did raise the price for gas and diesel by four cents a year for four years what would the effect be in 20 24 years from now on the most constituents are most average drivers the the cost the impact out-of-pocket would be the cost of about a cup of coffee a week about a cup of coffee a week meanwhile because our roads and bridges and highways are in such lousy shape we as consistent people who drive around this country the average cost for damage to our vehicles tires steering rims of our tires is over 350 bucks a year over 350 bucks a year that's not my number that is not all right that's a real number the other thing is going on here we sit in traffic a lot in our country of these days because we're not dressing our bottlenecks and and doing what we ought to be doing in terms of building and upgrading roads highways and bridges a Texas am every year actually doesn't analysis and what they what they do as they look at how much time we sit in traffic in this country the average driver in this country to now sits in traffic 42 hours a year 42 hours a year and cities like Washington DC numbers are more like 80 hours a year not moving just sitting there wasting time wasting fuel polluting the the skies and we don't have to do that we don't have to do that and then instead of doing something is intellectually honest what we're doing is really I think shameful I think it's shameful and initially I was just confused by what the house wants to do with the Federal Reserve and moving 50 60 billion dollars out of there now that I understand what they're doing it's even more shameful it's even more shameful we can do better than this and the American people deserve better than this is you're better than this a friends at mckinsey global institute i have a spent some time last year and they tried to figure out if we actually were investing robustly and our roads highways bridges in this country what would the effect beyond GDP and what would the effect beyond people putting people to work and if we're willing to make in robust investments for the next ten years instead of frankly not much at all in terms of investments here's what they said we would grow gdp by about one-half percent per year for the next ten years one-half percent gdp growth per year so far this this year it's been somewhere between two and two and half percent we get increase it by another one half percent if we make these kind of investments honest investments we're not going to come close to making robust investment the Jenna Mackenzie Global Institute also told us in terms of new employment if we're actually to invest robustly in roads highways and bridges in this country we put about 1.8 million people to work building roads highways bridges and transit systems but we're not going to do that we're not going to do that the I think of what the global mckinsey global institute was calling for and robust investments that actually grow gdp by one-half percent a year increasing plummeted by 120 million dollars 1.8 million people we're not even close to that in fact what we're passing here isn't even close to to the four cents a year for four years index it going forward we're not even close to that either that produces two hundred twenty billion dollars over the next ten years what we're doin is barely barely keeping funding at federal funding at fifty billion dollars barely barely and the way that we're doing most of that is by sleight of hand and buy things using money that has nothing to do with the roads highways bridges nothing to do with businesses in and people use those sub transportation modes to pay for them nothing and now about 22 named conferees and go to conference on that kind of deal the American people aren't stupid they're not stupid and you know if a bunch of states around the country like 12 states in the last two years states were finding they're running out of money to build their transportation systems in their states you know what they did they raised your the user fees they actually raised them and you know what happened when he had elections last November ninety-five percent of republicans who voted to raise the user fees that guy re-elected ninety percent of democrats who voted to raise the user fees in those 12 states they got reelected they didn't pay a penalty for it they got rewarded for it the people who voted the other way voted not to raise the user fees they didn't do as well people aren't stupid people aren't stupid mr. president we're gonna have an opportunity here to name conferees and go to conference and i just want to say this man was sitting here next to me Jim Inhofe good man chairs are committee and environment Public Works Committee we report out of our committee a very good author is a six-year authorization bill he's part of it gender boxer who worked on I worked on it other he worked on it I'm very proud of what we did and I want to commend offer for great one that's the authorization piece and if we could you stop there we'd be fine but unfortunately you have an authorization that's only half the game and what is the Wet Seal the picture of the guy that you had out here on the floor not long ago mr. president the fellow is like wearing big hat cowboy laying back to sleep and the the caption on the picture says all hat no cattle well when you have a great authorization bill but no real money to pay for it that's really all hat and no cattle and I don't think there's a better example of it that I've seen in the legislation that we're going to be conferencing on very soon I wish I wish I consider and say that it's all going to work out and will do just fine but that ain't the truth and we have let a great opportunity passes by we're about to let a great opportunity pass us by we're worthy a better effort than that and frankly the people our country deserve a better effort in yet with that I will yield my real the floor to my friend from Oklahoma and

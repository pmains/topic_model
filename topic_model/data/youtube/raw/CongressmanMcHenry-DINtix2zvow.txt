march uh report of this year you typically gave no indication there be problems with the irs's implementation reporting requirements is is that correct that's correct okay so does that include sections 6 60 55 that requires insurers to report about the coverage that they provide there are several information requirements from insurers employers from the exchange itself on a monthly and annual basis so all of that information will flow to the internal revenue service and has to be processed maintained and kept but you had no issues with that that is still not really done until 2014 will that data start to flow to the irs okay but does this include section 6056 that requires employers to provide information on the health insurance they provide so we're very concerned about that with the recent change in the recent um no no but but prior to that we're talking about your march report i mean because you're there to make sure that we're you know the the irs is moving along in the past here that's correct right and so in your march report you said they weren't didn't have any issues with this process of getting that information right that was the information that they were collecting for the income and family size verification and writing the overall plan that they had in place looked good look good okay so you know when when we see the president announce this change right uh on the employer mandate and then we see this other movement uh in terms of reporting requirements right which you have the business mandate then the reporting requirements the president and through this administrative procedure here they've said well we're just not really going to verify very much right but is there a basis basis in practice right saying that they really don't have that capacity i mean according to tigta yeah in accordance with what we reviewed and the application that we looked at at the irs and our understanding as of today is the irs will continue to provide to the exchanges through the hhs hub the income and family size information now we did not see in our review that there was a major change in the irs need or requirement to provide that information if it's available yeah but i mean this is the the verification uh process to ensure that people are complying with it right yeah i just want to make sure though that we understand that the irs information is only one set of information that the exchange will use in looking at and determining what the final income and family size uh data should be so let's run a scenario here okay so you know in a state that doesn't expand medicaid for instance north carolina being one and i represent a district in north carolina a man who earns 15 000 is going to walk through this scenario so people have an idea would would be eligible for a three thousand four hundred dollar uh subsidy um if his employer does not extend an offer of affordable coverage to him or or her for for instance and so in in 2014 with the federal government would they be able to verify whether this individual had an offer of affordable coverage at work i assume the hhs at or the exchange at the state level would be and they don't have an exchange at the state level then the federal exchange would have to be doing that and they would ask for information from the internal revenue service as well as other locations okay so if uh to ms tavner um if an individual fails to report that he has an uh offer of affordable employer sponsored insurance right uh will he receive a subsidy of that thirty four hundred dollars when an individual does do the self-attestation they would verify whether or not they had employer-sponsored insurance right right so they're going to say hey here's the deal didn't get it give me 3 400 bucks subsidy so so you know if you're if i'm verifying for myself right right if you're verifying for yourself and you say that it's a available and you didn't get it you would not be eligible for the tax credit and a reminder who's going to say i'm not eligible for free stuff so i would remind you that you sign when you complete the application this this is under law perjury okay so there are consequences to an individual who's not truthful on their application so what kind of enforcement are you going to have on that truthfulness obviously we would follow law right and but you have to have people to execute the following of the law are you going to ring them up and say hey by the way were you honest on this self attestation well we will look at ways to verify well you'll look at it okay we're talking about this going into effect this fall we want something a little more than a look for what is your process to verify that what they said was in fact true so we there are a couple ways obviously we will verify first with the irs with ssa information that's available if we're not able to get everything we need there we will work with private uh commercial products such as equifax if equifax would have knowledge on whether employee of my brother's business was offered a health insurance plan that was commensurate with the requirement under federal law equifax would have that knowledge we are looking at a process and i'll be happy to get back to you with those details so i need to get walk you through the process and but i would think you would sort of think this through with this big announcement that we're going to waive the employer mandate we are right but you leave the individual mandate so people are required under compulsion of law right which apparently you haven't thought about the enforcement of that law which is sort of interesting and maybe sort of liberating for some people by the way that you still have it on the law but you don't have any enforcement mechanism and i'm happy to get back to you with that process well i would hope you would get back with us and i hope you would think more deeply about this when you testify to congress about something this important that you have taken a little bit of time to think through that verification process and that enforcement mechanism that you have enormous authority as well as the irs to enforce it and so with that mr chairman thank you for the indulgence of time and i'm i didn't get to the fullness of the questions i had but this this is outrageous that the non-answer that i was given and i appreciate the chairman's uh work on this mr emmer about how much time do you need do you think to be able to come back on his question yes just a few days a few days great thank you for that mrs black

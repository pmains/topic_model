well good afternoon everyone and welcome to another edition of hot seat with Henson I'm congresswoman Ashley Henson coming to you from Washington DC we're actually in between boats out here and we have a very special guest today on this edition of hot seats and it is my pleasure to welcome with my complete endorsement and we're 100 behind you Brenna Byrd who is running for Attorney General of the state of Iowa we are in need of some change in the Attorney General's office and I'm so proud to support you Brenna so tell people watching today a little bit more about about your background and what you're currently doing in your fight to take back the Attorney General's office yeah well thank you and thanks for thanks for having me on today um I am running for Attorney General of Iowa my name is Brenna Byrd and tell you what we are campaigning Statewide everywhere because Iowa needs a new attorney general who will stand up for what is right especially in two areas stand up for law enforcement to back the blue and also to stand up against the overreach of the Biden Administration and and my background does really help me do that I was born and raised on a farm so I know how to work hard and and get the job done that's probably my most important skill I have in life and then of course I serve as Guthrie County attorney so I'm a prosecutor and I work with our law enforcement every day and I am proud to do that they are heroes and I love being able to help bring Justice to Guthrie County and also help Crime Victims it's a tough spot for them to be in when they're going through something like that and I've also worked as Governor branstad's legal counsel and so I learned a lot about how how state government works I've been a lawyer for over 20 years and I would like to bring all of that to serve the people of Iowa as Attorney General well and it's exciting to see another really strong conservative woman stepping up to run um especially in these Statewide races that's absolutely critical and we need to build continued support for you because when I look at my experience with the Attorney General's office I was a state legislator for four years and I served on the Justice systems appropriation subcommittee and I remember having many many challenges in dealing with the Attorney General's office not only about the frivolous lawsuits that they were entering into in our state but also with transparency issues with that office and I think that's hugely concerning from a taxpayer standpoint we need some someone in that office who's going to not only challenge the administration and enter the right lawsuits but also make sure that office is a is running accountable to the taxpayer as well so that's why I'm so excited now you mentioned um you know some of the cases obviously that you know we need to be standing up to the Biden Administration can you give some examples of of places where you don't feel like that's been done in the right way with the current attorney general oh absolutely and we wouldn't even have enough time to go through all of them today that's for sure you know the thing that I would note is that Tom Miller my opponent he found every chance he had to sue the Trump Administration but when Biden took over uh and that was someone that Tom Miller had endorsed in the caucuses he did not stand up for Iowa and some of the key ones would be you know our Farmers need somebody who will stand up against the EPA when they engage in overreach and go too far uh especially with what's coming with Waters of the U.S where they want to control our farm ground we know that Iowa Farmers Feed the World and we need to make sure that Washington knows that too another good example and here's a success story of good ages around the country they went to court and challenged that OSHA mandate that would force people to get the covet shot if they work somewhere with more than 100 employees and you know who stopped that that was State AGS that stopped that by filing a loss student and the federal judge told them no so yes I mean Iowa definitely needs someone who will go to court and fight for Iowa and I'll do that and I think this is also about you look around the country and in states where they have soft on crime policies and soft on crime rhetoric uh you have increased crime and they are truly making things less safe for the people who live there even in very very super Progressive San Francisco they're recalling their D.A and when you look at that policy and how it rolls up to the state level we need someone who is going to be a bulldog in that Arena to make sure we're holding bad people accountable and not being soft on that and so that's where I think that as you look at the Attorney General's office and holding other people accountable that's a really great opportunity to send a pretty strong message there oh it really is and Public Safety is so important it's something that we take for granted a little bit in Iowa that we have such a great place to live but the reason it is that way is because we have solid law enforcement and that we work to keep Iowa safe we hold people accountable under the law and I'll bring that experience with me to the AG's office especially with what I've seen uh with the drug drug epidemic around the state whether it's fentanyl or Methamphetamine those are serious problems that need to be addressed at the state level and as attorney general I will be involved and be part of that solution yes well and it's very important that we are holding people accountable and that starts with holding the bind Administration accountable one thing that we've seen is just a complete uh dereliction of Duty when it comes to our Southern border and you talk about those drugs and they are making their way across our Southern Border in record numbers and this is something that I've been very outspoken on since I took office here in Washington I serve on the homeland security Appropriations Committee and I've been to the Border twice advice and I see what that is doing to our communities around the country and our communities in Iowa and we know that the the cartels are winning the cartels are in our communities in Iowa and um I think you know we we do get very comfortable we have very very safe communities but um I don't think we can turn a blind eye to the fact that they are infiltrating our communities with their operations and those dangerous drugs are making their way into the hands of our young people fentanyl is now I think the leading cause of death for for young adults I think it's 25 to 54. um I'm not 100 sure that's the age range but I know it's a it's a huge increase in the leading number of deaths for for Iowans and for Americans and um that that should be hugely concerning so what do you see as some action we might need to be taking in that Arena to help prevent these deaths and also on the accountability side well first of all let me say thank you for your leadership with regard to our Southern border you are exactly right about the problem there so thank you for what you're doing in Congress to bring attention to that that is where the flow of drugs comes into our country and because that border is unsecured you know Iowa has many of the same problems that border states would have with the flow of drugs it's very serious so you know some of the solutions are to make sure that we are Prosecuting drug crimes to make sure that we are aware of those networks we need to be getting drug dealers and getting those drugs off the streets because with that illegal fentanyl that is coming into our country one dose one hot batch can end someone's life and that is very serious we've seen a number of young people overdosing around the state we have to stop that we have to get the message out to our young people that this drug will kill you don't even use it once yeah it's interesting because I have a supporter and a constituent who contacted me and said I'm concerned that the next pill my kid takes will be the pill that kills them and this is an epidemic that's showing up at high school parties kids may not even have an issue with drugs but they may be at a party and may decide to try it and maybe the pill that kills them and I think there are many many parents who are in that same boat where they're very concerned about uh what that what that could mean for their families and it is truly tearing families apart so that's why I think the accountability is so important Iowans are frustrated and Americans are frustrated right that they continue to see people get a slap on the wrist or continue to get away with policies that are making our country less safe and so that's where I think having someone who's strong and is going to hold those people accountable that we can work with also will be just incredible for service for service to Iowans and service to taxpayers so what can people who are watching today do to engage with your campaign how can they reach out to you if they have questions um and and most importantly how can they help you with the resources you need to get across the Finish Line well thanks yes so we have a Grassroots campaign and all 99 counties we have a website bird for iowa.com people can sign up there they can donate there it helps us get our yard signs and barn signs and to get the word out across the state and also we have a Facebook page Twitter you can follow us on all of those places to get our latest updates the latest thing we're looking for is we're asking our supporters to guess when I'm going to hit a hundred thousand miles on my car right now we're at about just over 96 000 on my odometer and I'm asking folks to guess what day and what of our which of our 99 counties will I be in when it happens oh that's great I I put a lot of miles on my mom van when I ran my first race also and so um I'm at a almost 190 000 miles on my minivan Brenna and it's still going strong so you got some more miles to go there which is great but I know Iowans are very happy to see you in their communities and you're making your way around the state and so um that's fun I'll have to get back and I'll play that game I think that would be really really great but yeah you are you're really hitting the trail you're getting out in the state you're working very hard and most importantly you bring the right background and the right tools to make sure that we restore the accountability and accessibility that Iowa taxpayers deserve I think it's very clear you know that the Attorney General works for the taxpayers of Iowa and I know I work for the taxpayers of Iowa and that's exactly what we need and the kind of leadership we need in the Attorney General's office in Iowa so Brenna thank you so much for joining us for this episode of hot seat with Hinson it's a true honor to support you and I look forward to seeing you in that role

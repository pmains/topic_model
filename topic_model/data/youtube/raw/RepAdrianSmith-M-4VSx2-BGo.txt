Thank You mr. chairman and certainly thank you to all of our panelists your personal story and professional perspectives we certainly appreciate it is clear that the increasing rates of maternal mortality I represent a major national challenge that needs to be addressed when I chaired the human resources subcommittee of this of the Ways and Means Committee in the last Congress we acknowledged and work to address the challenges faced by pregnant and new mothers during our work we authorizing the McVie program because of the proven benefits this program provides to at-risk mothers I pushed for a five-year reauthorization of McVie the longest reauthorization of its kind to ensure mothers and children get appropriate support they would otherwise be able to access we also included language in the jobs for Success Act last year which would have allowed States to recognize this need by using TANF dollars toward home visiting in McVean others in rural districts such as mine often face the greatest difficulties in accessing maternal care a problem exacerbated by the closure and consolidation of rural hospitals in clinics one avenue for providing pregnancy testing as well as antepartum and postpartum care new mothers need is through rural health clinics frequently the nearest source of primary care for those in rural America in fact because of the importance of rural health clinics in the provision of necessary primary and preventive preventive care in rural areas today I am introducing the rural healthcare clinic modernization act a bipartisan package which will help stabilize rural health clinics and stem the recent tide of closures another important aspect of overcoming rural health challenges including maternal mortality is the adoption of innovative approaches to transform care care delivery to rural populations

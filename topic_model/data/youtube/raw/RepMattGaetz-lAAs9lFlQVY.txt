there's a lot of potential felonies that happened and abuse of power from the Obama administration are they going to get away with it because it looks like potentially they might they were getting away with it under Jeff Sessions and Rod Rosenstein the hope is with Bill Barr as the Attorney General there's a new sheriff in town we had two dozen members of Congress who called on a special counsel to investigate the collusion that went on with the Clinton campaign where you had hundreds of thousands of dollars paid to the Clinton Foundation to influence policy also as I think Dan correctly pointed out the real collusion here were Democrats hiring a foreign spy who was a known liar to the FBI to work with Russians to tell lies about the president to destabilize what has now become one of the most successful presidencies in the entire modern era so here 675 days the Muller investigation took longer than the US the United States's involvement in World War one and the Whiskey Rebellion combined out of those we freed Europe and got cheaper whiskey out of the Muller investigation we didn't get a single indictment on collusion with Russia that was the underlying issue I don't think that that the president supporters should uncork the champagne quite yet I think there will be negative things about the president in the report but I mean this was a bias group of people that only looked at President Trump and didn't look at the true collusion that Dan pointed out and I know dr. Gorka and I have talked about on Salem radio so the report already said that Muller was not obstructed in any way whatsoever by the White House or the Department of Justice congressman I mean these people how wrong can you be it shows Jesse that the witch hunt continues they were wrong about the president's intentions the president's actions they were wrong about Russia I mean the entire Russia narrative is like the Democrats own version of the fire festival it's all hype and build-up but no substance and I suspect that this will go on the Democrats have launched an 81 pronged investigation into every element of the president's life because they need something to talk about and in the absence of evidence they have to continue to stoke their base with the theory that they're going to be able to undo an election that Donald Trump won in historic fashion and I think that voters who want to see better healthcare better roads better trade deals who want to see Wars ended an American economy rebuilt are actually going to appreciate this president for maintaining focus on the lives of the American people while Democrats have been so impacted by Trump derangement syndrome that they haven't been able to focus on anything else

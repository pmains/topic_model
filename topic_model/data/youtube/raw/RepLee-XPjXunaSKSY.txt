so welcome back to the program everyone a lots going on here in Washington obviously with just four days left until Donald Trump becomes the 45th President of the United States and by CNN's latest count at least 31 House Democrats skipping Donald Trump's inauguration on Friday two of them joining me now Congress California congresswoman barbara Lee Congresswomen i should say barbara Lee and Judy to thank you so much for joining us congressman I appreciate it how are you doing good glad good yeah Thank You congressman Lee you first you're on a growing list of democratic lawmakers not attending this inauguration you say you'll be quote preparing for resistance what does that mean well let me say I did not make this decision lightly actually I decided last week that I was not going to participate in the celebration and that's exactly what it is and the reasons that i'm not going to celebrate i think I laid out but one is I don't want to celebrate you know a president-elect coming in the campaign on a campaign of bigotry and divisive pneus and who has continued to campaign even after he won the campaign on the platform and so I decided that I'm going to work on a variety of issues with many in terms of planning details of how we're going to resist many of the policies that he has proposed such as to in the Affordable Care Act and take away health care for millions of people and other congresswoman issues okay can't you can you do that though and still go to the inauguration do you think it made backfire on you because you're going to have to govern with this man and with the Republicans in Congress no I intend to govern and that is it's my job as a member of Congress however there's some of us who have to make sure that the gains that we've made on behalf of the poor on behalf of people of color on behalf of the LGBT community on behalf of the most marginalized and the most vulnerable in our comes the country there's some of those who are going to have to resist this agenda that he campaigned on which is one of really not unity the divisive nison and bigotry and so I intend to do my job but I also intend to fight to protect the games that have been made and to represent the most vulnerable in our country and people should know that you decided not to attend the inauguration before the incident with Congressman Lewis you put this out last week but congresswoman Chu it was the incident with Congressman Lewis that was a decider for you made to help you make your decision why is that oh yes it wasn't until Saturday that I made up my mind I was trying to decide and going back and forth but when I heard that shrimp denigrated and disrespected the greatest icon in civil rights leader of our time John Lewis I could not believe it and I could not believe that he would do that on Martin Luther King weekend that added insult to injury so I immediately said that I wasn't going to go it was this on top of his insults to the disabled two women to gold star parents to me this was the last straw I Strad to ask you the day after Hillary Clinton law she said Americans Oh Trump an open mind and a chance to lead respectfully if she can attend the inauguration should you and your other colleagues reconsider congresswoman Chu I am open-minded to actually making some progress I actually issued a letter as chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific caucus and up on behalf of our 50 members to have a meeting with Trump we sent this letter in December but we had even yet to hear an acknowledgement of that letter I do want to see if he can make some progress but i think if we make progress it actually has to start from him i think he has to stop denigrating people gratuitously with his tweets on a continuous basis if I were him being only a few days before his inauguration I would attempt to unify the people who are coming from all kinds of different places is very diverse country of ours instead he deliberately picked on the leading civil rights icon of this nation on Martin Luther King weekend and chose to pick a fight with him congresswoman Lee I have to ask you about this because yeah you know some people are many people see an irony in this because they say Donald Trump try to deal with gitam eyes the current president not only as a president but as a person for years you have criticized him for fueling birtherism a means to question Barack Obama's legitimacy is that a factor and why you think so many Democrats are now questioning his legitimacy NL not going to 10 attendance inauguration there are many factors that i'm not going to attend the inauguration we know that there was foreign in Russian influence in the election that's a factor but we also know and have witnessed the divisive pneus that is continuing I had hoped really that this would not continue into his his present but it disappears that he's going to govern in this way and I'll give you two examples one is the the nominee for the Attorney General Senator Jeff Sessions when you look at senator sessions history of being on the wrong side of equal justice under the law for everyone in our country that's an example of going back and putting people in a cabinet that wants to turn back the clock and not be a representative of everyone in our country when you look at sea baman an advisor in the White House's who's a known and about white nationalist how can I celebrate these type of cabinet nominee Congress might have today he says he's not a white nationalist he just says that his I'm platform which was Breitbart was a was a platform for his website was a platform for white nationalists he denies being a white national I understand that but when you look at the platform and when you look at what he was one of the founders you have to make that connection and be unless you just totally are hypocritical and don't support your platform I what I think is interesting is that people may be sitting at home thinking that this is some coordinated effort on behalf of Democratic Congress people and you guys have told me that this is not this is organic you guys are not calling each other or it's not organized at all congressman's you kind of film and shoot yes this is not organized at all we did not text each other or email each other we each actually made our own personal decisions about what we were going to do and in fact there are people attending the inauguration for their own reasons or their own roles for instance are our leaders of the Democratic caucus are attending such as our leader Pelosi and are are a majority of our minority whip steny hoyer and there are others that want to be there with their constituents but I think that each of us are left to our own conscience in terms of what we feel about what is going on in this country with Donald Trent on especially his actions of the past few days well I appreciate both of you taking the time to come on congresswoman Lee congresswoman Chu thank you so much have a good evening appreciate it thank you my friend

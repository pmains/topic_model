and joining us right now on the phone a congress member Karen bass representing the 37th district here in Los Angeles representative bass good morning good morning good morning good morning we we noted your tweet that came out immediately after the news conference this morning and I'll read it to our viewers right now as we put it up on the on the screen it's now clear this attorney general does not work for us he works for president Trump this press conference was a final desperate cry to keep the truth away from the American people we're not falling for it give us the report would you care to elaborate sure you know I think for somebody who I believe has had a very good reputation I think he's certainly compromised it now to have the press conference I think to begin with was inappropriate but what he said in the press conference exonerating the president no collusion he repeated that six or seven times I thought I was looking at a press conference from the from the White House as opposed to a press conference from the Attorney General I have the report in front of me some of the things that he said is just a spin because when you actually look at the report it's not the way it is written and so I think you know I'm glad the report was released it is redacted but I have to tell you that it's not as much as I anticipated I will wait to see the redacted aparts though which we will be able to do when I get back when we're back in session representative bass where did Democrats want to go from here with this we know House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler had said it's clear Congress and the American people must hear from Special Counsel Robert Muller your thoughts on that yes well we're having a conference call shortly in the Judiciary Committee and we'll be able to strategize but I will tell you that I know that the Chairman is calling for Muller to come and testify but what we are doing right now is what everyone else is doing is actually reading the report and deciphering what what is in the report and I think that what you will find is that what the attorney general today did was essentially spend for the new so you could have the talking points but when you get into it there is a gulf of difference between what the Attorney General said and what is actually in this report there are a number of portions that this that have that are subject to interpretation with regard to obstruction of justice several instances that were subject to interpretation the Special Counsel left it to the Attorney General to make the final decision on that was that appropriate well I'm not exactly sure that was the case I mean there are ten examples of where it could be interpreted that the president obstructed justice but I think what Muller says in the beginning of the report which again I think we heard spent earlier is that he was not going to make a recommendation around obstruction because he knows a sitting president cannot be indicted so essentially what he did was left it to Congress in our role so maybe the Attorney General I mean maybe Muller felt that he couldn't say he needed to be indicted but he gave ten examples of potential obstruction and so it's really hard to see from these examples and again we're all just reading it at first blush it looks pretty obvious and some of them that obstruction of justice the only thing that held him back was the fact that a sitting president couldn't be indicted I want to ask you there are some Americans who are saying this has been two and a half years this is what our lawmakers have been focused on for this amount of time no obstruction of justice no collusion let's move on and do do other work for the country what do you what do you say to those Americans who are feeling that way well I say to those Americans you know they're right in terms of us doing other work unfortunately we have been doing a lot of other work we've been passing legislation on guns on health care a variety of things but it because this is an issue that is overwhelming to our country the work that we actually do beyond this report doesn't rise to the level of a lot of coverage so this is critically important though we are talking about the president of United States the most important powerful person on the planet and if there is evidence that he has had criminal behavior corruption etc it is absolutely our responsibility to address that what is different is that for the last two years when the Republicans were in control they did no oversight they did no investigation by the Constitution that is a part of our job so we are only fulfilling what the Constitution has determined the role of Congress should be it is up to the Attorney General to decide whether or not to indict the sitting president Justice Department guidelines suggest that that's not something that can be done but Congress can impeach is there anything that you've seen so far that would suggest that the Democrats in Congress will that will now move to that that next step no not just yet I mean again I think we have to thoroughly read and analyze this report I think there's a lot of hearings that we need to hold as you know speaker Pelosi has not wanted to go down that road at all however I think that with all of the information we have and remember we still have multiple investigations that are pending and so I think that it will be a while we don't want to go down the road of impeachment because it does take us away from the good work that we've been doing however if we have to then then we will I will tell you I will remind you though that this attorney general essentially said in the 19 page memo he wrote months ago he essentially said what his opinions would be and he has acted them out he is not he is not veered away from the 19 page memo that I call his audition from anything that he said over the last few days what we do know after you know hearing and seeing the the Mullah report is that Russia did interfere in the 2016 election and I think many people also saying well looking ahead there's another election that's going to be here before you know it you know are we making sure that this doesn't happen again you are absolutely right and that is a big concern of mine and I will tell you that we'll see what happens in this Congress because in the last Congress we were not able to get the Republicans to agree to even look at our vulnerabilities in terms of our election and put the resources there to address issues that we know are happening so I think that's critically important is there anything and I know that you're still absorbing the the hundreds of pages here but is there anything that has jumped out at you so far a page number a passage anything that that you are aware of that as we're doing the same thing that you would want to point out honestly the first and the second page of the executive summary yes where he were essentially Muller is saying that that the Russians interfered and that representatives of the Trump campaign you know perceived that it would benefit from what the Russians were doing and then later on it says but the difference was was that it doesn't seem as though there was an agreement in other words that Paul metaphor didn't say yes we agree but yet both sides were doing what was amounting to cooperating with each other so that that's a nuance again I am NOT a lawyer that's a nuance that's difficult for me to see if both sides knew that this information was benefiting them then how is that not collusion and remember one of the other things that Muller says in the first page is is occlusion is not a crime so the fact that the president has gotten us all adjusted to using this word over and over again knowing well in advance that it's not a crime conspiracy is the crime and so when when the AG says there's no collusion well Muller says well we weren't really even looking at that we were looking at conspiracy many Democrats some Democrats have been attacking AG Bars character and and saying things Nancy Pelosi has says she doesn't trust him she trusts Muller rod Rosenstein deputy AG who hired Muller been with the Department for 30 years was quoted as saying with Barr at the helm the rule of law is secure how do you feel when you hear of rod Rosen Stein talked this way about AG bar I appreciate you asking that he's been a disappointment to me because at one point he seemed as though he was objective and then he didn't but she do have to remember that when the president fired Comey remember that Rosenstein wrote that memo saying that the reason why Comey was being fired was because of B was because of Hillary Clinton and the way he didn't protect Hillary Clinton which was ludicrous but Rosenstein was the one that wrote that memo now he wrote the memo under the direction of the president but he still put his name on it now after that week and I've been in hearings with him a number of times and I know that he has objected fiercely to the way the president has attacked the FBI the Justice Department etc so I was hoping that he'd be a bit more objective but I don't feel that way now not the way he has responded to this situation

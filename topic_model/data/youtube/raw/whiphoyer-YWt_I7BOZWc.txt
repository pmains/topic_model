knows what the budget would be but thank you very much for all of that reporting so joining us now is House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer morning congressman good morning Alison how are you I'm doing well let's talk about how you are and what's happening there on Capitol Hill obviously the House passed a short-term budget deal to keep the government running past tomorrow at midnight but the Senate seems to have other ideas they don't want to just fund the government through March they have a two-year plan let me put it up for people on the screen here's what they're focused on eighty billion dollars of military spending and spending they're looking for 63 billion dollars of non-defense spending can you get on board with the Senate plan look I think that the Senate plan certainly is better than the House a plan which was a partisan defense only and all the domestic agencies and without any opportunity to plan for the long term so I think the Senate effort is better we'll have to see what the Senate ultimately adopts to see whether I could be on board but I certainly think it's it's a worthwhile effort and hopefully they come to agreement do you fear that the government is gonna shut down at midnight tomorrow I don't think the government will shut down I think nobody wants the government to shut down we don't want to shut down the government but there are a lot of things that have not been done one of the things of course that needs to be done is what you just referred to we need to agree on funding levels for agencies the Republicans who control all the organs of government have not sent a single appropriation bill to the president for signature therefore no agency knows how much money they're gonna have to spend and how much how they can plan and how they can make contracts hire people achieve objectives so in addition to that we have not dealt with daca which the president said the Congress ought to do and it ought to do by March 5th we haven't done that and so what about just sorry to interrupt you but what about since people are so focused on that how's that been done I have been working very hard as a lot of people have been working very very hard to get a deal on the dreamers we think it's a simple a thing to do you saw you may have seen the meeting with the president the United States with dick Durbin and I and 23 other members of the Congress sat around the cabinet table and the president said we need to solve daca now we need to do that as the first phase of more immigration reform we agree with that so we're trying to work towards that end but I had a meeting yesterday as you probably know when the majority leader I do want to party and John Cornyn yeah and dick Durbin I do want to ask you about that because I think that this plays into what the chief of staff John Kelly said about daca recipients and it was quite eye brow raising so listen to this moment the difference between 690 and 1.8 million were the people that some would say were too afraid to sign up others would say were too lazy to get off their asses but they didn't sign up what did you think of those comments well I was not happy with that but he said people would say that he didn't say he said it so we'll we'll leave it at that to insert that into the conversation that some of the recipients would be too lazy to get off their asses what's the point of putting that in you'd have to ask general Kelly but what I want to focus on is the effort to come to an agreement on this ASAP because I think we have a lot of young people who are extraordinary young people not lazy at all very motivated college students high school students people who are working people have served in the military people who are making a difference in our communities we want to make sure that they have the certainty that they're going to be able to be here in the country that they grew up in that they pledged allegiance to and that they love so I want to focus on that general Kelly I think has made some positive efforts towards trying to reach agreement and I think that's that's good and will continue to work did you share your thoughts with general Kelly I did and can you tell us what you said - no I'm not going to go beyond that again what I want to do is reach an agreement general Kelly's an important part of our discussions along with the four of us who are called the I guess the number twos leaders and in each party in the House and the Senate and we're we're really working towards trying to get to an agreement it's tough we haven't made much progress but I think we can would you like to see a military parade down the streets of the capital I have great fact for the military we ought to honor our military and men and women who we send into harm's way and who are willing to serve and defend and protect America and our people and they deserve great respect but I don't think a show of military might it reminds you of what the Soviets do and what the Chinese do we are the strongest country in the world we have the greatest military in the world and the world knows that and we need to honor our men and women in uniform and but I think we ought to do so in a way that does not necessarily appear bellicose or threatening to the rest of the world we want to be peacemakers not war makers well look we did the military parade after the first Gulf War with President George HW Bush I think that's that's that's a little different we celebrated that victory we celebrated the efforts of our men and women in uniform to have an extraordinary and yoora first Gulf War was extraordinary in terms of how Swift it was how well it was executed and how little loss of life we had and again a military parade is fine I don't think anybody has to be against a military parade but again I think what we ought to focus on is our military and its strength its training its readiness and its patriotism you know parade is one way of doing that and I don't think we ought to get deeply involved in that but it also can be perceived as jingoist in some respects sabre-rattling in some respects so I think we ought to well measure that and compare that to what we want to project to the world congressman Steny Hoyer thanks so much great to talk to you thank you yes jingoism you don't hear that too often especially in the morning so joe biden talked to him exclusively he didn't run in 2016 of course but what does Biden think about a run

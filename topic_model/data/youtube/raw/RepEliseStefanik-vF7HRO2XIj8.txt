my first question is for mr. Dahle in your testimony you stated that in 2008 that since Oh 8 your office has opened more than 750 criminal investigations involving the fika program how much time do these investigations typically take before they're completed and then my second part of the question is given limited resources how do you decide which cases to investigate thank you the let me break this up into two to quick answers they there's a claimant side of this a beneficiary side those cases are pretty straightforward and they they don't take usually longer than a year and many of those are handled by the IO IG from the affected agency and except if they're you know it's a smaller Oh IG than we might assist them and particularly in getting data from OWCP um we've shifted our attention to the to the medical provider side because of the greater harm to the program and we started doing that about four years ago and those cases are more complex involve multiple parties sophisticated means sometimes conspiracies and they may take two years or longer to complete and because of the resource issue that you alluded to we have teamed with our law enforcement partners from other agencies that are affected by this they include postal OIG VA o IG HHS OIG and others too to investigate these matters because we don't alone have the resources to do that another question I had you mentioned in your testimony that one of the updates that was made is requiring letters of medical necessity what other best practices and programmatic changes do we need to take to reduce fraud and abuse in the fika program well I think that just go back to chairwoman Fox's question about using data analytics both by the OIG and the program itself and I think that those can be or early warning signals that they did not see for compounded drugs so they can get on top of this because we all know that fraudsters are not going to stop defrauding a program because we've shut off one spigot they'll find another place to hit us and so we have to be vigilant and using data analytics tools to tell us when that's occurring and and putting in place the program putting in place measures of the front-end to prevent the fraud from occurring so that we're not having to investigate it on the backend Thank You mr. Dahle my last question is for MS Tanabe you note in your testimony that at least one in 15 injured workers in Massachusetts Louisiana and Wisconsin filled prescriptions for central nervous system depressant drugs within one week of an opioid prescription and that the rate of these prescriptions was even higher among claimants receiving opioids on a chronic basis do you think we need to further focus on the effect that opioid prescriptions may have on individuals mental health in addition to addiction thank you it's not clear that from the data that the benzodiazepine prescriptions were prescribed for mental health conditions that resulted from the opioid prescribing they may have been prescribed for already existing mental health conditions comorbidities or even for muscle relaxants much of the prescribing for that we see in the data are for cyclobenzaprine which is a muscle relaxant many treatment guidelines recommend an initial assessment of a history of the patient's substance abuse disorders and mental health condition before is initiating chronic opioid treatment because of the risks that are involved in chronic opioid treatment so it's important for future research to look at for insights on chronic pain management by studying opioid prescribing for people with mental health comorbidities thank you my time is expired

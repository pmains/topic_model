I'm proud to announce that the Connor Fitzpatrick has won the United States House of Representatives stem competition for his appt for Oregon's fourth congressional district Connor congratulations it's a great app I've actually have been having some fun with it obviously my favorite is the map race I think that'll be everybody's favorite I'm astounded to see you already have over 10,000 downloads but expect you'll get a lot more as people learn about it but I think the one that is going to be toughest for most folks and the one that will contribute most to their education or their re-education is the capital flashcards because that you know with 50 states out there a lot of us including me sometimes struggle with the capital of a certain state so that one I think is going to be you know really kind of the neatest one in terms of the full educational experience but this is this is really really great now I want to congratulate you and encourage anybody else who's watching I expect we'll have this competition again next year but for young people high school students to get more involved in in tech issues it's a huge and growing area in this country the US has been a world leader we want to continue to be a world leader which is why we're having this stem competition and we're trying to emphasize stem programs and provide scholarships and other incentives to get young young adults both men and women involved in both math science and obviously things that relate to computer technology and computer engineering so again Connor congrats great work and you know helps for help you know thanks for helping educate many young Americans on the geography of our country

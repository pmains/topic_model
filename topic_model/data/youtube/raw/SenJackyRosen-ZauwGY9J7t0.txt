good morning the senate aging committee will come to order i'm glad to be here today and i want to thank the college of southern nevada for hosting this important hearing i also want to thank our witnesses and everyone who has been able to join us here in person was as well as those of course watching online we're holding this morning's field hearing in las vegas to discuss a pressing need for nevada seniors lowering the high cost of prescription drugs the past two and a half years have been incredibly challenging for so many nevadans and as we work to finally put the coven 19 pandemic in the rearview mirror we must continue to invest in the health and well-being of our most vulnerable especially our seniors what does that mean well it means that making sure that seniors in nevada and across the country that they have easy access to quality affordable health care no matter what community they live in it means taking steps to address the high cost of prescription medications including by allowing medicare to use its buying power to negotiate or lower drug prices and it means capping out-of-pocket prescription drug spending for seniors on medicare part d medicare is a sacred promise it's the promise of guaranteed access to health care after a lifetime of hard work despite this promise we know that many seniors still have trouble affording and assessing much needed prescription medication no one and especially seniors living on fixed incomes should have to choose between buying groceries and taking life-saving medication but for years far too many nevada seniors have faced this impossible choice in fact unfortunately many seniors ration their medications or skip taking them all together because of high costs and we're going to hear real life stories of this today but simply put this is unacceptable that's why after nearly 30 years of inaction i'm proud to have worked with my colleagues in congress to deliver on the promises that so many have previously made and to finally finally lower drug costs we're bringing about bringing about real relief for nevada seniors and seniors across america and this hearing could not be more timely my democratic colleagues and i just passed the inflation reduction act and just last week president biden signed this historic bill into law this transformative new law will finally allow medicare to negotiate the best price of prescription medication for america's seniors the inflation reduction act will also cap seniors yearly out-of-pocket spending on prescription drugs at two thousand dollars and it will cap the price of insulin for medicare beneficiaries at just 35 dollars a month this new law will usher in an era of increased access to an affordability of life-saving prescription medication for nevada seniors and because private insurance often follows medicare the new negotiation authority included in this bill could end up lowering prescription drug costs not only for seniors but for all families as we prepare for this new law to go into effect i'm thrilled to have the opportunity to hear from our excellent panel of witnesses today about how the high cost of drugs has imposed have imposed burdens on nevada seniors how high drug costs impact seniors health and well-being how this impacts health care professionals and caregivers and how the new law helped pass will soon help reduce costs right at the pharmacy counter i'm also looking forward to hearing about how congress can best implement this new law and continue our work to lower health care across costs across the board for nevada seniors including through legislation i've introduced before we begin i want to remind the witnesses to please keep their remarks to five minutes and with that i'm going to introduce

proceed now to witness testimonies so um we'll begin with ms moore you may begin your testimony thank you thank you senator jackie rosie for having us here today aarp on behalf of our 38 million members including over 300 000 members in nevada and all older americans nationwide appreciates the opportunity to submit testimony on this important hearing of the senate aging committee aarp has been fighting for decades to make prescription drugs more affordable which is why we push so hard for drug pricing provisions in the recently enacted inflation reduction act of 2022. these new policies will go a long way to lower drug prices and out-of-pocket costs for older nevadans we thank senator rosen for her support of this law and the senate agent committee for this for its recent hearings and other efforts to keep prescription drug pricing reform in the spotlight for perspective on this historic nature of this new law it is important to fully understand the difficulty that so many older americans face in trying to afford the medications they need to stay healthy on average medicare part d enrollees take between four and five prescriptions per month often for chronic conditions that will require treatment for the rest of their lives at the same time medicare beneficiaries have a median annual income of just under thirty thousand one quarter have less than eight thousand five hundred dollars in savings in nevada the average annual cost of prescription drug treatment increased 26.3 percent between 2015 and 2019. while the annual income for nevada it residents only increased 18.8 percent this population simply does not have the resources to absorb the rapidly escalating prescription drug prices and many are really facing reality of having to choose between their medications and rising prices of other basic needs such as housing or food we know the number one reason someone does not fill a prescription is because of its cost for years prescription drug prices increases have dwarfed even the highest rates of general inflation if consumer prices had risen as fast as drug prices over the last 15 years gas would now cost 12 dollars and 20 cents a gallon and milk would be 13 a gallon just in january the drug industry raised prices on over 800 prescription medications just as the as they have increased prices for decades including three-quarters of the top 100 drugs with the highest spending in medicare part d after years of promises congress has enacted this his historic changes in the inflation reduction act this new law will finally require medicare to leverage its buying power and begin to negotiate with drug companies for lower prices the provisions will apply to a growing number of drugs that are among the highest costs to consumers and medicare resulting in substantial savings for both seniors and taxpayers the congressional budget office estimates this policy alone will save medicare nearly 100 billion over 10 years the law will also give peace of mind to millions of seniors with high drug costs by capping their out of pocket part d drug spending at 2 000 per year there is currently no cap on these costs and many medicare beneficiaries simply do not have the financial resources to fill prescriptions that cost them 10 000 or more every year the law also caps insulin co-pays in part d at 35 a month which will help which will be a major help for the roughly one in three medicare beneficiaries with diabetes these are incredibly important policies that will not only save millions of americans but it will also save lives the inflation reduction act will also require drug companies to pay penalties if they raise their prices faster than inflation this policy will address the long-standing practice of drug companies raising their prices year after year often at more than twice the rate of inflation this will help rein in seniors out-of-pocket sharing and medicare drug premiums in addition the inflation reduction act will make available certain recommended vaccines for seniors on medicare with no cost sharing like the shingles vaccine that has a list price around 350 dollars this policy already applies to medicare part b covered vaccines and a small group of private markets but for years medicare beneficiaries have had to pay some level of cost sharing for medicare part d covered vaccines depending on their plan coverage this will not only save seniors out-of-pocket costs but is also an important preventative benefit to help older adults from illness approximately 4.1 million benefit medicare beneficiaries receive a vaccine covered under part d in 2020. this new law is a historic victory for families across the country who are struggling to afford their prescriptions but the fight isn't over big trump big drug companies will spend millions trying to overturn or undermine the law so they can keep charging americans the highest prices in the world aarp will keep fighting big drug companies out of control prices and we won't back down thank you again to the special agent committee for holding this hearing in nevada and to senator rosen for inviting us here to raise awareness about this critical issue thank you thank you ms moore we'll now turn to dr madison you may begin your testimony i first want to take a moment to thank senator rosen for hosting this committee meeting focusing on an extremely important topic of prescription drug cost and how it impacts our nevada seniors let me first take a moment to introduce myself my name is dr christina madison i'm a clinical pharmacist and associate professor of pharmacy practice i am also the founder and ceo of the public health pharmacist which is a consulting firm specifically focused on public health i have been training the next generation of allied health professionals including pharmacy students and pharmacy residents as well as medical physician assistant and nurse practitioner students for the past 15 years in my nearly two decade career i have spent counseling patients on how to treat and prevent the spread of infectious diseases and for the past two years i have been working overtime on the covet 19 response providing vaccinations testing and treatment i've personally facilitated the administration of over 12 000 doses of the covet 19 vaccine and now i'm helping to coordinate the monkey pox response through the increased access to vaccinations which are currently in limited supply my work over the years and especially during the pandemic has put a spotlight on the need to focus on health equity which includes access to affordable prescription drugs it is my honor and privilege to provide witness testimony as a public health advocate who has dedicated my professional career to caring for the underserved and vulnerable populations i'm thrilled to be sitting here with you today following the recent passage in signage into law of the inflation reduction act by president biden on august 16th this new law is an historic down payment on a deficit reduction to fight inflation invest in domestic energy production and manufacturing and will reduce carbon emissions by roughly 40 percent by 2030. more pertinent to this hearing is the fact that this law will also allow medicare to negotiate for prescription drug prices and extend the expanded affordable care act program for three years through 2025. our country is on the verge of another health crisis and seniors across nevada are struggling with affordable care and coverage addressing health disparities and inequities is one of the main focuses of public health and as a patient advocate i know firsthand the importance of making sure patients have their basic needs met which includes making sure that they have access to their medications by making them more affordable understanding that seniors in particular those in the bipoc community our aapi and indigenous brothers and sisters are facing more than just issues with their medications but just getting to their doctor's visits in the first place as well as structural racism and historic trauma with most seniors taking multiple medications and having issues with polypharmacy we know that several are having to make the difficult decision of paying rent groceries or gas before paying for their prescription medications more and more are accessing food pantries and donations to supplement getting their basic needs met in order to afford their medications while living on fixed incomes the passage of the inflation reduction act of 2022 is going to make a meaningful and measurable difference in the lives of nevadans nevada residents are being disproportionately impacted by high prescription drug prices per aarp over 200 000 nevadans have been diagnosed with diabetes almost 270 nevadans have been diagnosed with either asthma or copd and over 230 000 nevadans have been diagnosed with some form of cancer these are three very expensive disease states that require chronic high cost prescription medications for example between the years 2015 and 2020 the price difference of these medications are as follows victoza which is a very common treatment for diabetes went from that little under eight thousand dollars to over eleven thousand dollars per year another medication reveal med used to treat some forms of cancer went from 185 000 to over 260 thousand dollars last but not least a spiriva handiheller used to treat copd went from almost four thousand dollars per year to over five thousand dollars per year just in a span of five years we know that this represents a significant price increase that far exceeds normal increase due to inflation these are just a couple of examples of the exorbitant drug costs that seniors are currently experiencing as i work with non-profits and community partners i see that more and more people are accessing these types of social services in order to just deal with their everyday everything costs more but that shouldn't include necessary life-saving medications i've conducted many medication review sessions called brown bags events with seniors in the community and i often see them holding on to medications because they don't know when they may need it again this is that depression-era thought process this is incredibly dangerous especially if they get these older meds mixed up with the new medications the first thing i do is i ask them what their medical conditions are why they're taking each of their medications and if they're taking them as directed often times there are at least a few that no longer have an indication or duplicate medication and can be safely discarded ultimately i know that this generation doesn't like to let things go because they're used to doing more with less because their meds are so expensive this just is one of these things that they just don't want to let go of did you know that 20 of all medications are never picked up at a pharmacy typically because of lack of transportation perceived need and ultimately cost reducing the cost of prescription medications through the inflation reduction act of 2022 is going to help not just the cost of prescription drugs but people's quality of life because they will be able to afford other things medications don't work if you don't have them and you can't take them if you can't afford them that's why i am relieved that congress just passed the inflation reduction act which will help lower costs for nevada seniors including for many of the patients i serve every day this new law will be the first time that medicare will be allowed to negotiate for lower drug prices in history it will cap seniors out-of-pocket spending at 2 000 per year and the price of insulin and other life-saving medications for thousands of nevada seniors at just 35 dollars per month thank you senator rosen and the congressional democrats for working to pass this legislation which is critical and it's a lifeline to so many who live here in las vegas i am providing this testimony to bring attention to these issues and to discuss solutions for our struggling nevadans so that they can live healthier and happier lives thank you so much for the opportunity to speak with you today thank you thank you dr madison for your statement we're going to proceed to mr klein mr klein you may now begin your testimony please on behalf of nevada senior services and our aging community in nevada thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony to the senate agent committee i would be remiss if i did not thank senator rosen for this invitation to appear and for the senator's steadfast support of nevada seniors and all our older nevadans i'm also grateful to senator rosen the senate special committee on aging as well as other members of our congressional delegation including senator cortez masto representative susie lee stephen horsford and dena titus for their support and passage of the inflation reduction act of 22. i have the privilege to serve as the president and ceo of nevada senior services and then also as a board member of both the american society on aging and the national association of nutrition and aging services programs a trusted non-profit leader in aging services for southern nevada nevada senior services provides a comprehensive range of quality programs and are designed to assist seniors and their family caregivers to live their best lives while aging in place our goal is providing remarkable care balanced with culture that supports autonomy choice and safety we accomplish this providing a no wrong door model of inclusive service delivery as the aging and disability resource center for most of southern nevada we offer adult day health care memory loss programs case management in-home respite and personal care home repair and modifications caregiver support programs and hospital to home which is a unique dementia friendly care transitions program this remarkable program has achieved a less than one percent hospital readmission rate nevada senior services serves over 2 500 seniors and their families every year by way of example hospital a home assists persons with complex health conditions cognitive impairment and those without home social supports to transition safely from the hospital to home without a readmission frequently this requires immediate resourcing to ensure available availability of critical medications nutrition follow on medical care and psychosocial supports for family caregivers nevada senior services has a long history of offering vaccine clinics for flu pneumonia shingles and most recently coveted reaching out to our most vulnerable seniors family caregivers and frontline staff our nevada care connection resource center assists persons to connect to resources and to ongoing long-term services and supports such as medication nutrition housing transportation case management and access to benefits including medicaid and snap last year we provided over 3 500 critical resource connections to our citizens home homemeds is our latest initiative an evidence-based medication review for identifying potential medication-related problems in collaboration with pharmacists and physicians it is designed to reduce the risk of medication errors and adverse effects including unnecessary medication-related hospitalizations this program targets seniors and persons with cognitive impairment and it is made possible actually by a grant from the us department administration for community living nevada's demographics and population characteristics make senior care in general and prescription medications critical issues to address we continue to be one of the three states with the highest rate of growth in the over 65 population in the country and 14.3 percent of our seniors live alone nearly 9 in 10 persons age 65 or older currently taking prescription medicines reporting that they take four or more prescription medicines in addition one-fourth of them report that it is difficult to report afford their prescriptions particularly those who are either in the fair or poor health status categories and whose income is below thirty thousand dollars annually and who take four or more prescriptions one-fifth of our older adults report not taking their prescriptions as prescribed due to cost many seniors are poor reporters not sharing their decisions about not taking their medications as prescribed with their prescriber it is not an infrequent occurrence for seniors to admit making difficult choices between nutrition housing pet care and taking their prescription medications polypharmacy is a significant risk factor for hospitalizations and falls frequently resulting in hospitalizations medication related issues associated with seniors in diabetes closely correlates with falls and with medication-related drug overdoses the inflation reduction act of 2022 makes an important down payment in addressing these prescription drug issues that impact the ability of older americans to have their best possible lives aging in place with their family and friends it accomplishes this by impacting a number of issues that have been long-standing priorities for our seniors nevada senior services asa nana's been many local organizations serving our aging community three of the priorities included in the legislation are the two thousand dollar cap on out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs for those on medicare beginning in 2025 it is estimated that over 1.8 million older adults spend more than that amount every year no co-pays or cost-sharing for vaccines covered solely under medicare part b d beginning in 2023 expanding the low-income subsidy the lis to include beneficiaries with incomes up to 150 of the poverty line beginning in 2024 as members of this committee know within part d prescription drug programs start standard benefits is an initial 480 deductible before coverage even begins for this is a high enough barrier to forego purchase and needed treatment for many of our seniors the legislation allows for the first time in history for medicare to negotiate for the price of drugs unfortunately not until the beginning of 2026 and starting with just 10 drugs it also caps co-pays for insulin for medicare beneficiaries at 35 dollars a month as of 2024 those drugs with high costs enough to qualify for the program's catastrophic coverage would no longer have to pick up the five percent copay for each prescription we have a duty to address these important issues associated with affordability and access to prescription medications we must be committed to helping seniors manage their health span while their lifespan increases and while they stay engaged in life maintaining their independence we're grateful for the support and work and contributions of the senate aging committee and making these objectives more attainable i thank the special committee for allowing me to speak today and i'm very happy to take any questions and we will wrap up our witness remarks with ms milner ms milner please you may begin thank you and your staff so much for having me here today to share my experience with insulin and other expensive prescription drugs my name is regina milner i'm a 60 year old type 1 diabetic patient a patient advocate a systemic lupus warrior and a resident of las vegas nevada i'm also a stiff person syndrome rare disease warrior whom is scad 65 sero-positive which has also caused my type one diabetes that is a genetic disorder that is one it is one in a million chance and strikes one in a million people however most importantly i am proudest of my titles of mother and grandmother my children and grandchildren have witnessed my 20 plus years of struggling and consistently advocating for diagnoses medications and equitable medical care and treatment all while navigating my way through an unfair and unequal systemic medical discrimination system in process of in the process of paying for my medical care and medication to try to maintain health as possible my health as possible i became completely indigent and i now presently rely on my daughter who also suffers from autoimmune disease to provide me with a roof over my head and the care that i need my many illnesses require me to use over 20 drugs actually 27 drugs and medical supplies that include two specific brands of insulin um tresiba and humalog which require prior authorization as well as my dexcom g6 device and glucose monitor in addition i take weekly injections of benalista for my lupus and autoimmune diseases i am now in need of ivig treatment the cost of maintaining my health isn't cheap one of my lupus medications been a list that has a retail price of almost five thousand dollars it's thanks to my enrollment in medicare part d extra help program which subsidizes my ventilis to pay payment to under ten dollars that i can afford it i also take insulin products and need insulin twice a day but the products i use are not included in the formulary during covet my glucose levels increased to over 700 while doctors offices were closed which is extremely dangerous and can result in diabetic coma unfortunately my physicians didn't understand my genetic type of diabetes and told me that i did not need diabetes medications or insulin the test results were repeatedly dismissed until i found myself sleeping into a coma it took several weeks of more advocating for prior authorization to get the correct insulins that worked for my illnesses i know all too well the dangers of not having access to the life-saving medications i need my father also deceased suffered from the same illnesses senator rosen your advocacy and that of your democratic colleagues is so much appreciated the inflation reduction act which has just been signed into law last week will cap out of pocket costs at two thousand dollars per year in cap insulin at thirty five dollars per month for people on medicare which is a life-changing amount for folks like me instead of rationing or skipping medications seniors and others like me across the country can finally put their health first without being worried about the cost related disease management and these exponential drug costs have cost me my quality of life i have worked in many administrative roles i used to type 90 words per minute i now have a muscle disorder i was also a game dealer for the monte carlo resort and the casino on the las vegas strip i am a single parent and i knew i had to make ends meet for my children but the diseases i have made it impossible to keep a job capping the cost of prescription drugs excuse me my muscle disorder is affecting my speech will make a difference for so many nevada seniors and so many other minorities and people who are struggling i don't have a choice in the medications i take or the genetic diseases i was born with but i do see a brighter future especially with the passage of the inflammation reduction act and the cost of savings to come i am losing my ability to verbalize myself clearly due to my muscle disorder and autoimmune disease but my next statement is loud and clear america's seniors have long needed prescription drug reform and these out-of-pocket cost caps for many people on medicare are the right step forward i know that i am not alone in this struggle there are so many of us who need our prescription drugs especially in the autoimmune disease and chronically ill community we can't afford to wait but with the inflation reduction act thank god we won't have to in closing i am thankful to wake each day and begin each day with gratefulness because it is by the grace of god that i am alive and standing before you today in the process i have had to fight for my life and i have dealt with a lot of disparity that has resulted in me being misdiagnosed receiving treatment that has endangered my health and i have been barred from treatment that i should have received unfortunately i am so grateful that you have taken the time to listen to my story and have me here today i thank you for all of your time and for listening to my medical experience i know that other people are experienced as well and i hope that i can be a help to them as well again i sincerely and truly thank you senator rosen and all of your staff they have been beautiful they've been wonderful this opportunity to share my story today and for your hard work and the successes that you've accomplished to help us well ms milner you're the reason why we're we all do what we do you're the reason why we're here today um your strength and your bravery is people watching people who know you your fight for those who don't quite have the strength and we're so grateful that you're here it's why we're here is why we're having the hearing and i really really appreciate you and um i think we'll get started on some questions so you need a drink if you need anything from our team you just let us know ms milner okay okay perfect so why are we here the high cross high cost of prescription drugs the new out-of-pocket spending cap it's no secret that americans pay far more for prescription drugs and people and other industrialized nations and in fact according to rand corporation a recent report from the rand corporation americans pay more than two and a half times more two and a half times more for the average prescription drugs than due citizens in 32 other developed countries and that's when it comes to brand name drugs americans pay nearly excuse me when it comes to brand name drugs americans pay nearly three and a half times more than our counterparts in other countries fortunately president biden just signed into law the inflation reduction act which congressional democrats recently passed all of our strong support my strong support and this new law as we spoke about you've heard will soon cap the out-of-pocket costs for seniors on medicare part d at two thousand dollars per year total no matter how many prescriptions they may take and no matter what those prescriptions are you said they're people are on sometimes 20 different medications um it's it's uh there's a lot for people to navigate and so ms miller you said how many prescription drugs do you take a month with my prescription giraffes and supplies that i need including my dexcom g6 which i am so grateful for it saves my life every day um i take 27 27 27 prescriptions and you're enrolled in the medicare part d extra help program which helps you subsidize those costs and i'm so grateful i i just began using it this month and um the shift program has been so helpful to me in helping me to get enrolled and to understand medicare it's been a new education and if you didn't have this program how much would you spend if you just had to pay for it you know they are still at this point itemizing the total cost of my drugs with my new uh right part d but at this point it looks like i would be well over 15 000 dollars per year because my monolith is 1 000 by itself per month and so if you're estimating about fifteen thousand dollars a month and we're going to put in a two thousand dollar a year cap that's just about a hundred and sixty seven dollars a month um i don't know maybe you could sum that up in a sentence or two what how that's going to change your life i thank god i am so grateful because every morning that i wake up is a blessing and i can take my medication i can still think clearly and still navigate and still advocate for myself being able to have my medication is a blessing being able to have your help all of your help is a blessing i'm so thankful and grateful that's all i can say is thank you well it's it's coming the help is coming and so we're going to talk now a little bit about medicare price negotiation because that's really going to make a huge difference because one of the core components of the inflation reduction act again i'm so proud to help have passed that we finally made it possible for medicare to negotiate directly directly with big pharmaceutical manufacturers to ensure the lowest possible drug prices for our seniors and so over the next few years the department of health and human services will be allowed to negotiate the prices of the most expensive drugs on the market to help lower costs for seniors in nevada and across the country many of the most expensive drugs which often have limited or no competition are for serious conditions like cancer and i'm going to repeat the statistics for nevada so cancer impacts more than 230 000 nevadans my mother died of lung cancer i was one of those nevadans that impacted my family diabetes it impacts more than 202 000 nevadans and asthma which affects more than 260 000 nevadans and so i'm pleased that as a result of this new law again i can't reiterate it enough medicare is finally finally going to be able to use his purchasing power to deliver those lower costs for seniors but rely like miss milner on the life-saving medication so ms moore we're going to talk about aarp nevada you have just been a long time advocate for medicare drug price negotiation and um can you just maybe give a few more words about um not just how hard you work but how you've come to this point the inflation reduction act you were a champion uh aarp is a champion for it how it's going to help millions of of nevada nevada well millions of seniors across the country um nevada seniors of course keep our prescription drug prices down thank you senator rosen and as you stated erp has made the argument for many years for decades that with more than 50 million americans getting their medications through medicare if the program was allowed to negotiate prices the power of those numbers would deal a much better deal for medicare beneficiaries and for taxpayers who ultimately foot the bill for the lion's share of the medication costs and after decades of pushing for this reform the inflation reduction act finally authorizes health and human services secretary to begin negotiating the prices of 10 of the highest cost medications and prescription drugs in 2023 and the negotiated prices will go into effect in 2026 for part d medications and in 2028 for drugs covered under medicare part b the number of drugs whose prices will be negotiated on behalf of medicare will increase in subsequent years and by 2029 a total of 60 drugs will be subject to negotiated price unnegotiated prices overall this process will create substantial savings for seniors and taxpayers by reducing the prices of the growing number of expensive and widely used prescription drugs the congressional budget office estimates that this program will save medicare approximately a hundred billion in ten years and according to the kaiser family foundation report medicare negotiation could actually drive down prices for drugs used by 8.5 million people on medicare accounting for nearly one in five eighteen percent after 47.7 million medicare million medicare part d enrollees in 2019. thank you you know i think we all know that an ounce of prevention worth a pound of cure so by providing these medications we can keep people healthier happier is better for their families of course for their pocketbooks they don't have to make choices and most importantly we can keep them away from the most expensive care which is obviously going to the hospital and so mr klein i'm going to turn to you because i would say not many but i would say probably all of the seniors uh that you serve are on medicare right and so this medicare negotiation provisions um being sure that people get their medication and they stay healthier they don't have to make the choices maybe they're not entering the emergency room um how do you think it's going to impact the work that you do and others like you we're very excited about the prospect this has been a long time coming as senator knows the va's been at this for forever so is the department of defense every managed care organization negotiates prices for drugs the people who have really been on the raw end of this problem are those people frequently who just above the poverty lines seniors on fixed incomes and without a controlled drug costs making those big decisions between food pets and and like every day we go through the process of trying to find resourcing for people to get medication uh because they have a plan that they can't afford they can't afford another plan the alternatives uh leave them the cost too high and so they're constantly making major health choices uh this is this is the cavalry coming for those people on fixed incomes and uh while it may not affect everybody tomorrow it will over time and uh with an aging population uh folks who are going to live into their 80s maybe 90s uh the long haul here is really important so we're we think this is going to have a big impact day to day in the short run we think it's going to create some incentives and opportunities for us to look at alternative medication funding mechanisms to try to help people on fixed incomes kind of span the the time while they wait for this to really hit home that's fantastic we know that people living with chronic disease we live better and longer the and that medication is what's helping that and i'm sure you work with many grandparents so those grandkids are the true beneficiaries perhaps of getting to know their grandparents but we're going to turn next to you dr madison because nobody knows better than you than the high prescription drug the costs the impacts in patient health outcomes compliance and and their health care providers you're being one of them unfortunately unfortunately we've far too often seen that the high cost of prescription drugs well it impacts both the seniors who need them and also the health care providers who manage their care doctors pharmacists other health care professionals well you didn't go into this not to help people you went into this business to make a difference to save people's lives and help them but when it comes to prescribing or recommending treatments you can only do your job everyone can only do their job if effectively if patients don't face those insurmountable financial barriers and for many seniors there are barriers for each and every one of their prescriptions think about ms milner again according to arp the average older american takes roughly five prescriptions a month typically on a chronic basis to treat conditions like we've talked about cancer asthma copd diabetes heart disease and others and shockingly the average annual list price for one brand name drug used on a chronic basis was over sixty six hundred dollars in 2020 which is more than one third of the average seniors social security retirement benefit think about that more than one third of your yearly income just spend on one brand name prescription drug even existing medicare part d coverage can't always make that uh affordable for most seniors so dr mattis i'm going to turn to you as a clinical pharmacist i know how deeply and passionately you care about this you've been involved in assessing both patients health needs and their medication evaluation if you've spoken to and their management so can you tell us about the times when you've recommended medications to your patients that you know that are appropriate and effective the best medication but had to instead suggest something perhaps less effective or less beneficial because the patient simply couldn't afford the choice absolutely so um one of the first things that i was thinking of when um when i was thinking of this question was um you know our lovely advocate over here miss milner and really the high cost of diabetes so there there have been amazing innovations in diabetes therapeutics over the past really just the past five years and seeing a lot of these newer medications that are injectable therapies that are taken maybe once a day but they're quite expensive so you know knowing that someone could benefit from an injectable long-acting medication and not being able to receive it having to use things like oral medications oral medications that are taken multiple times a day which we know directly impacts an individual's ability to remember taking their medication we're talking about seniors exactly so the more we can simplify their regimen the more likely they are to get the most benefit from their therapy and so so many times we've had to recommend a generic or something that is more likely to impact their kidneys or their bones or their eyesight you know i just i was so touched by miss milner's testimony and i see so many of the patients that i've worked with over the years in her and even just thinking about my own grandmother who passed during the beginning of the pandemic and thinking about her care and you know having dementia and not understanding you know all of the different things that she needed and caregiving and and making those decisions when you get to that you know twilight of our lives and it's really impactful you know the work that you're doing the work of congress and i i'm so excited to see the improvement and quality of life that our seniors are going to have and not just that but our economy because think about it if people don't have to worry about affording their medications they're more likely to engage in in doing and and going out and spending money and being consumers so it's not just about the amount of life but the quality of life that our seniors can live you want the best patient outcome and you answered some of my other questions but you didn't answer i want you to talk more about the hoops that you may have to go through as a medical provider if you know that there's a good medication out there that's really going to make a difference to try to get that financial assistance for your patients tell me about that so there's a couple of different things that we can do obviously there are certain manufacturers that have pay uh copay assistance cards so that's very helpful but not every pharmacy has the time to be able to go through and do that and so that can be a little bit challenging and then also uh you know if you're uh if you're having uh an issue with receiving your medication um there may be some things about you know delivery as i mentioned before 20 of prescriptions are abandoned usually because they can't access them or they can't afford them and so if transportation is issue being able to deliver the medication to the patient's home is extremely impactful um and then not being able to provide them with the best medication has other possible side effects so it's not as good so the medical condition that they have may not be treated to the best of its ability but then they may also be more likely to experience side effects from the medication as well and so those are the things that we really want to try to avoid um and unfortunately the hoops that we have to jump through are prior authorizations things not being on a formulary going and negotiating with the managed care offices because they put certain things on because they got it because there was two or three other medications that that manufacturer also made and they made a bundle and they said okay we're going to put all of these medications on the formulary and unfortunately the rhyme and reason of that is not something that the average senior understands they just understand that they're not able to access the bus medication and it's really hard time jumping through hoops when you could be actually dealing with patients and so that takes away your time for being able to do direct care absolutely um i have one more uh um a question for you while we have a bunch more to go through but i was a caregiver for my parents and in-laws as they age so i um i understand that aspect but have you seen the high cost of prescription drugs how does it impact the caregivers who take care of your patients maybe if people aren't able to get the best medication or they're having to ration or whatever you're seeing well we're seeing people consolidate households we're seeing people dipping into the savings if they even have savings you know if we're living paycheck to paycheck they're going to uh social services they're accessing food pantries they're accessing assistance programs uh you know meals on wheels uh dining with dignity all these different things that you know i'm seeing people that ordinarily wouldn't access those services or are coming but are reluctant because they feel embarrassed or they they feel um like they don't understand how they got into this situation and they're so thankful when they come and receive donations clothing you know some people lost their jobs during the pandemic and and lost everything and so the caregivers of people who have chronic medical conditions they need a respite as well and so you see a lot of stress anxiety depression in those caregivers because they're internalizing the hurt and the pain that the people that they're taking care of are experiencing giving people their medication at affordable prices um creates a better community for everyone talks about many things right there well we're going to talk a little bit specifically about diabetes now for a minute because currently more than 375 000 nevada seniors receive prescription drug coverage through medicare part d and over a quarter of them more than 93 000 nevada seniors have diabetes so across the u.s in 2020 part d enrollees spent a total oven this is 1 billion 1 billion dollars on out of pocket on insulin that's an average of 54. per insulin prescription for many nevada seniors living on that fixed income fifty four dollars for each insulin prescription we know we know it's just not affordable so despite being a life-saving drug many seniors including as we've heard today you ms milner are forced to sometimes ration your insulin or you simply don't buy it at all but again we're proud to report help's on the way thanks to the inflation reduction act so beginning next year it'll be here before we know it the cost of insulin will be capped at 35 a month for medicare beneficiaries not just here across the country and so um 35 insulin i know you take 27 medications but just tell me how that feels how that feels to you just that one change that one change makes me feel so relieved because as i stated as dr madison understands it isn't on the formulary i had to go through many hoops hurdles in order to have my physicians do the prayer authorizations um dealing with mcos who in prior authorization departments that sometimes don't understand how important it is because other medications uh insulins can make you very ill as it did with me and so having that relief is just a burden that i feel is just i can breathe it's gone it's gonna help the rest of your medical condition just to have that stress because when your glucose is not right nothing is right nothing feels good it is the worst feeling in the world so it is a total relief just that drug alone knowing that 35 oh my god i mean i'm so again only word i can use is grateful and regardless of how ill i am for me the solution is to wake up every day and be grateful for all that i do have for the people that have helped me the people who have sacrificed for me i'm grateful and i'm grateful for you and you and you for everyone grateful we're grateful for you too and we're this is a godsend we're proud to do this work and so i'm going to turn over to ms moore and aarp because this is just one story i probably could have a thousand people here and you would hear a similar story about their struggles about the relief they'll feel when just this one burden is off of their mind and you represent over 320 000 nevada seniors and so uh tell me i i know we're hearing from one but you can speak on behalf of them what what do you think if you just want to think about the emotional relief or what that might mean to people um just give your impression if you can consolidate 325 000 seniors uh into a couple of sentences what do you think just that one change means like miss milner she is one of many stories we know that many families across nevada and across the country really are struggling with the outrageous prices of insulin and really people needed to stay alive and healthy that's bottom line it's just one tragic example of the larger problem we've heard from dr madison of the drug industry that affects so many different medications and thankfully the 35 monthly cap for insulin in medicare that erp supported will affect very soon like you said 2023 is right around the corner and part d plans will require to offer this copay among even before the n rule meets the deductible for the year so people will see the co-pay changes at the beginning of the year and erp would welcome the chance to extend this cap to others beyond medicare as well whether it be at state or federal level erp offices across the u.s have been active in the state legislators and across the country as i said for over the past few years to pass insulin co-pays in state laws that would apply to private insurance so airp will keep fighting for americans 50 plus and for all so that they can afford their medications thank you so mr klein i know uh you work with so many seniors and um you're going to be able to maybe put some of your financial resources or some of the magic that you do to help those thousands of seniors every year um give me a little uh from your perspective 35 dollar insulin how's it going to help your team help others and um what what's the impact on what you do it's a huge boost first of all it's going to be a boost to the team uh folks who work in the trenches take this seriously it weighs on them every day every time somebody comes through the door a patient comes through the door uh who needs help and you don't have a resource it's a failure uh in the minds of the people who are attempting to take care of them and help them this this is the cavalry coming so first of all it's hope and hope is really important in this population uh it's almost more important than the immediate uh to know this is coming it gives you boost it tells you that there's there's an opportunity to impact it second uh for this particular population our staff are constantly looking for resources attempting to find other not-for-profits who might have a medication program that we could pair with well if we can lower the cost can we fill in the blank uh to help them uh cover get coverage for for the short period of time uh that might be the bridge between programs or to wait for something larger to come along so this this is major news it's major news not only for the senior but importantly it's major news for caregivers uh who've really been struggling with this and who take it home with them every night we'll be able to put those resources to some other benefits so uh dr madison from the medical perspective we know the impact it's going to have so just tell us the impact if people take their medications regularly on time at the right dose um tell me how you're feeling about that yes the three r's right right drug right time and the right way see there you go i didn't even tell people the three r's so i mean it's incredible right uh obviously you know we're talking a lot about about diabetes because it impacts so many individuals but really these concepts and these uh you know these interventions go across any chronic medical condition and so for me my biggest thing when i talk to my patients is do you feel better worse or the same and if it's the same or worse then i need to think what's going on is the medication that you're taking appropriate if it's not how can we fix it and so having the ability to be able to take your medication the right time and the right way and the way that it was intended by your health care professional by your physician by your nurse practitioner by your physician assistant right it's so critical because when you start getting between that relationship now now you've messed things up and the intended purpose of that medication goes away because now the patient can no longer be adherent because the medication only works if you can take it and you can't take it if you don't afford it and so this is incredible i think just looking at you know chronic disease management there's so many ripple effects that will go towards this if if you are able to be healthier because you're able to take your medications you're going to be a more productive member of society you're going to be able to do more things you may start a small business you there are so many different things that you could do as a senior you may be able to take care of your grandkids that you maybe weren't able to before and that could help the family and then you can then you can potentially help your children so that they don't have the burden of child care there's so many ripple effects that this can help help with just by simply making sure people can take their medication thank you well we're going to talk about some other prescription drugs now because this is just one of them the first one that's going to hit right away no deductible it's going to be so impactful but we're going to put caps on price increases for drugs under part d because we've discussed today nevada seniors including those with medicare part d insurance coverage well it goes without saying they're paying far too much for their prescription drugs and drug manufacturers have continued to raise prices at unsustainable rates and so in fact according to a recent kaiser family foundation study half half of all part d covered drugs had price increases greater than the rate of inflation in 2020 greater than the rate of inflation in 2020. this is just unacceptable and it's one of the reasons why democrats in congress why we did pass the inflation reduction act and so we're going to talk a little bit more about the law starting next year this new law will require manufacturers that raise the prices of drugs faster than inflation to pay rebates back to medicare this way drugs drug companies will either need to keep prices affordable in line with actual increases in the cost to make them or have to pay a rebate to medicare either way seniors win so i want seniors across nevada and across the country to hear us loud and clear this new law will bring relief to seniors by lowering their expensive drug costs so um ms milner i know we're gonna we're gonna keep going around the table but you take a lot of medications and so you've had some of them that have gone up and up and up and so i'm gonna ask you from your perspective not just the costs we know they're unaffordable but but what's the emotional burden when you see the drug go up so high year after year it's an insurmountable emotional burden because as you s you have all stated um it is a domino effect it affects not just me but my family um i think wow i've got three grandsons i want to still be able to get down on the floor and play race cars with my grandsons and i can't do that if i can't afford my drugs however i have noticed and i want to say since i am on the right diabetes medication i can afford to eat right and when i can afford to eat right god bless me i take less diabetes medication less insulin and it makes me feel so good because then i have more energy i'm more cognizant i can just do better all the way around so it means the world to me it really does i mean i think that if we have more people who could help others who are in the situation advocate for themselves they would be a whole lot health healthier i mean just understanding that yes you have to take your medication but you also have to eat right and that costs money so now you spend less money on your medication you can eat like a healthier i can afford to buy the vegetables i need that's right and eat right and keep my glutes close um at the level that it should be and it really matters so that's fantastic well ms moore i keep turning to you because you get to represent all the seniors in nevada and so on a bigger note um what do you hear from nevada aarp members about the drug manufacturers just raising this these highly inflated costs well over the rate of inflation um what do you hear from your a arp members about this senator rosin rosen the rising prices of prescription drug prices that is um the number one one of the things that we hear most from our members and it's no secret so you're you're um we hear your stories every day in the years leading up to the passage of the inflation reduction act 37 724 nevadans signed erp petitions calling on congress to take action to reduce drug prices i know that the senator got many of her emails letters taxes just about every day um we were relentless it was truly tragic when an older person fixed income has to choose like you said between essentials like food and rent and the medications that they need to keep themselves healthy it is a ripple effect and when the prices of those drugs are increasing at often much higher than the rate of inflation there's simply no way for these seniors to keep up you just can't it's also important to keep in mind that these increases are in the top of sometimes decades of annual price increases and those price increases add up over time thank you and i'm going to i want to say i'm grateful for your the aarp partnership uh those emails helped and those letters and those calls and all the conversations we had honestly i carry those stories with me i retell those stories so i am grateful for that partnership and mr klein i guess the same thing to you because you see different we have a patient you talk about all the seniors you have a lot of boots on the ground again we're going to try to get those uh it may go up but only to the rate of inflation cost escalation for people on fixed income since many seniors are just that people on fixed incomes and we can't forget that many of our seniors are taking care of even older parents taking care of a spouse taking care of a child and frequently taking care of grandchildren uh in today's world so you take someone who's on a fixed income who's also caregiving for a wider group and then you apply cost escalations uh that force them to make choices and those choices are serious they're not just choices uh about themselves and what they do for themselves but they're in effect choices of what they make for their entire caregiving unit that's right and at the end of the day some people end up in nursing homes when that cost gets to be too great for them to bear the consequences of high escalation and pharmacy costs really bring those costs home the bear so this is again this is as i mentioned earlier this really is in many respects the cavalry this is putting a lid on uh on just how much burden some of these families will have to absorb and also we think uh it will also put a lid on some of the other problems that these choices make so you know to regina's comment about nutrition when you have to make a choice between good nutrition and medication you can't win in that choice that's right uh so putting a lid on it creating certainty is really critical and i think this has been an amazing amazing and important accomplishment well and i think to your point whether it's a multi-generational household like ms milner's or whether they're the seniors who are living uh independently on their own we want to keep them there we want to keep them from moving if we can to a nursing home or some of those and keep them either independent or with their with their family where it's much better i'm going to just ask you a doctor as a provider now again you're looking to provide a medication or multiple medications so knowing that this isn't going to go up exponentially how do you feel as a provider when you walk in the room and you were going to have to talk to a patient incredible that's the best way to say it incredible uh you know when you look at a patient's face when you tell them the cost of a medication and you see sort of the life drain from their face and the emotion change it's devastating and to know that these prices will be capped and that now they don't have to make those difficult choices between their basic needs being met and their life-saving medications is is just incredible i i can't think of a better word other than that to say it and and really remove stress and burden from providers because you don't want to go in with the disappointing news so that's going to make your ability to care for patients so much better not to mention the fact that as a provider you take those stories home too right and so i think i think it helps everyone it's not you know i i think about many times where i i just think about just recently where i was um helping out at uh uh an advocacy agency and we were giving out food to seniors and a woman drove up and we were walking over to start helping out and she was turned away because they were closed at that time but because of a language barrier she didn't realize that they were just closed for lunch and not closed for good and so she had asked me earlier like i was walking over in the parking lot and and she asked me where to go and so when i told her i knew she was there for the food assistance and so as i saw her about to leave i noticed she didn't have the food in her hands and i said ma'am you know is there anything else i can help you with and she said oh no no no they they said that they're closed and i said oh they're just closed for lunch can you wait like another like maybe 20 minutes and they'll open up again and she said oh yes thank you thank you so very like sense of relief and then about an hour later we went back to help give out the food and she came back and i was so happy to see her because i mean it was just a difference of better communication but i was just thinking like how many other people in her house that she was feeding that were depending on that food so the ripple positive effects in in advocating for people and so i'm gonna that leads me directly into my next question which is really advocating for patients in need and of course all of you advocates but mr klein i'm so incredibly proud of the work that nevada senior services does to help educate advocate for seniors who need help finding health care finding resources navigating complex agencies trying to do those home modifications sometimes you may need in the bathtub the bathroom getting you know whatever those things are so you can age safely in place and services are just so important you know nevada's senior population is growing so quickly between 2011 and 2018 nevada's population age 65 and older increased by 40 percent i think that puts us in one of the faster growing states i might say and the population of nevadans aged 85 and older increased by 25 that's double the national rate and so one of the programs you do one that particularly stands out to me is your comprehensive geriatric assessment program and you bring together a team of medical and social service professionals to examine that patient's overall well-being and that of course includes prescription medication review and management so can you just talk to us a little bit or walk us through the comprehensive geriatric assessment process and in particular um well you're going to have hopefully have a little bit of help with the inflation reduction act but but how you help them navigate the the cost of the prescription drugs we're very proud of that program it was the first in nevada i i'd love to say it was the first in america but i actually opened one of these in 1972 in philadelphia which was the uh actually the idea of one of our medical directors at a hospital i was working at so i've carried it with me that's a good thing to carry it was and uh when we created it in nevada we created it as a collaboration so we have a board-certified physician in geriatrics who comes to us from tourism we have pharmac pharma geriatric pharmacy helper comes to us from roseman we have our own geriatric nurses our social workers uh occupational therapy that also comes from toro and that team gets together and spends about three hours examining the records and uh the history uh of the person who's coming to them usually with their family caregiver and then doing an uh an in-person exam team exam uh of the patient to try to get at the root of all the complex problems people have some of which are purely uh medical but most of which are combinations of complex issues that include family caregiving issues and always medication issues right it is not unusual for us to find people on drugs that they shouldn't be on in the first place they're contraindicated for seniors uh happens all the time and we're in a position then to go back to their physicians and your primary care physicians and say well you might want to think about some alternatives and it's not unlikely that we we get that story of the person that says sheepishly well i haven't been taking this one or that one right because and inevitably the because is is dollars and so uh one of the people in the room is a navigator a social worker who's got real skills in navigating uh where uh opportunities for reimbursement and uh other financial supports are and they go to work nobody leaves there without their medications nobody leaves there without a resource for medications nobody leaves there without the opportunity to get follow-up from the team and so it works well and it works as a family endeavor of not only the whole health care team but the family caregiver in conjunction with the person who's receiving services it seems like this great uh overall comprehensive uh project and group and i think that is what gives you so much success well um we're going to move on to our last question and something that we've been thinking about um well we always think about this but because of covet 19 it's really been on the forefront of everyone's mind which is vaccinations and of course for seniors there's quite a few vaccinations that they can take to help improve their lives and keep them disease free and so free vaccinations for seniors on medicare part d so dr madison many of the senior patients you see i i hope they have the part d plans and therefore almost half a million medicare eligible individuals in nevada 15 of our population actually has a part d and in rural counties have a higher percentage per capita of medicare beneficiaries with mineral nye and douglas county's medicare eligible populations currently over 30 percent 30 percent of their total populations so thousands of nevada seniors who could benefit again from reducing health care costs from the inflation reduction act because we're going to establish zero cost sharing for vaccines for seniors on medicare part d starting in january zero cost sharing this is what the inflation reduction act is doing so it's inspect especially important relief some of these diseases i know there's pneumonia and shingles and you could probably tell me all the ones there are but some of these vaccines like shingles we talked about the price are so expensive so can you tell me dr madison how you think the inflation reduction acts free vaccine provisions how that's going to make a difference for the population that you serve and what are the health care consequences of seniors foregoing these vaccines so first and foremost i want to say um public health is obviously my focus and you know vaccinations are literally the single most effective public health intervention in modern medicine right that's how we were able to get rid of smallpox and up until about a month ago polio right and so it's so important for us to be able to provide these preventative care measures in particular to seniors because these vaccine preventable diseases can be devastating to seniors when we think about hospitalizations especially when we think about things like influenza that 36 000 individuals per year being hospitals and potentially passing away is usually from the secondary bacterial pneumonia that they get after the getting the flu and so when we can provide things like pneumococcal vaccination um influenza vaccination it helps to not only keep those seniors healthy but out of the hospital which again creates more health care costs and more burden on themselves and their um their families and their communities and so this is extraordinary that they will be able to provide these vaccinations at no cost to seniors and i just think about individuals who've suffered from shingles if anybody has known anyone who's had shingles it is something i would not wish my worst enemy and now that the acip which is the advisory committee on immunization practices has now recommended it now all the way down to the age of 19. there are now people who can get it that have autoimmune diseases that are more at risk and because their immune system is suppressed and it puts them more at risk for getting things like shingles so extraordinary incredible can't think of any more um you know fantastical words that i can use but um just so great that we can provide these vaccination life-saving life-changing vaccinations to seniors so mr klein all these vaccinations are going to be free so how are you going to be sure that you get the word out to all the seniors even more working with your partner agencies every senior in nevada that who wants one can get one free of charge due to the inflation reduction act advocacy advocacy advocacy we're really proud we've been running uh vaccine clinics for as long as i can remember it started with flu and pneumonia and the latest flu vaccine comes out the next pneumonia vaccine goes out we try to get the word out into the community importantly we work with a network of other not-for-profits so organizations like helping hands so folks who deliver food folks who have food pantries we get the word out we collaborate we try to reach the people who are hard to reach those seniors who are uh not out about as much right and to encourage them to come out then we follow up with them right because they can't get all their shots at one time so we have to run a second clinic and then we say gee we're glad you got your pneumonia shot but it's time to you get your coven uh booster or it's time for you to get your flu shot and so we have a pretty aggressive and a most positive way loving way we can make it a line of encouragement with our partners all over southern nevada and then we run run programs and we run we provide food we we provide education we try to do things that encourage folks who uh otherwise can't get out and those who can't get out who are homebound we send somebody to them that's fantastic so uh you're gonna get the last question because speaking of advocacy aarp really you're the big umbrella organization looking at all of these things and so how are you going to help everyone here today be sure that the word gets out to every senior in nevada rural and urban regardless of the language that they speak that they have access to free vaccines starting next year we have a saying at arp that says what we do for one we do for all it's our founders um i i feel it's my favorite quote from her the free vaccines under medicare as dr madison said there's only one word for it incredible incredible and very soon so for this benefit and all benefits of this historic law we are certainly going to plan major public education and outreach and push various articles we have our comms director here with us today ensuring that folks know where to go for the best information and we will be producing videos we'll be doing lots on our website that's you know it's not only for our members but really anyone can access that information we want our members and the public to have a clear sense of what this um what what is expected and what's to come in this new law and we welcome the work of our members of congress you know we work really well with you senator rosen and we know that that will continue or really any other stakeholders we work with um jeff very well and other not-for-profits nonprofits and community partners because we want to keep a focus on this issue we want to help educate the public about the prescription drug provision in the inflation reduction act our work is not done well and you have a partner in me and i know that you have a partner with everyone here and of course the rest of the democratic federal delegation and so i can't thank you all enough for being here for contributing your time your expertise your emotions your passion all of it it means so much to so many and of course i want to thank the college of southern nevada for giving us this a wonderful space up to do this in and because you know what in a country as prosperous as ours we we should do better we should always do better especially for our seniors and no senior as we've spoken about should be forced to choose between paying for life-saving medication or keeping their lights on no seniors should have to choose between affording their insulin or putting food on the table and no senior should be expected to spend nearly all of their social security check on the prescription drugs they need just to live their everyday lives unfortunately as our witnesses have testified today this is far too often the case in nevada and across the country we can and we must do better and now thanks to action in congress we are going to do better and i'm proud again to say that democrats in congress well we've been listening to nevadans and to the american people we've taken your stories these stories here today and those you represent back to washington and we enacted bold historic legislation in the inflation reduction act legislation i am proud to have voted for that will finally lower prescription drug costs and as we've heard today i'm going to reiterate all of this this new law will do just this finally finally allow medicare to negotiate for the best price of prescription drugs finally cap seniors part d out of pocket spending at two thousand dollars per year finally cap seniors insulin costs at 35 dollars per month finally cap prescription drug price increases to no greater than the rate of inflation and finally increased medicare subsidies for lower income americans we're going to do even a little bit more we're going to ensure that all seniors receive all their vaccines at zero dollar cost sharing free free and we're going to reduce burdens on those health care providers like dr madison and others and the caregivers those angels and our family and those that work with us by delivering lower costs for seniors across the board and i'm so proud of the work my democratic colleagues and i have done to lower these costs for seniors to protect and to expand medicare but i want everyone to know this is just the beginning moving forward i will continue to fight to protect medicare to reduce health care and prescription drug costs for nevada seniors and i will continue to work with all my colleagues to make medicare even stronger for years to come our closing business if any senators not in attendance today have additional questions for these witnesses any statements you'd like to add for the record the hearing record will be kept open for seven days until next tuesday august 30th with that thank you all again for participating and this concludes today's hearing you

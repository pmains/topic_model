ARE. MR. CORNYN: I ASK UNANIMOUS CONSENT THAT THE QUORUM CALL BE DISPENSED WITH. THE PRESIDING OFFICER: WITHOUT OBJECTION. MR. CORNYN: MADAM PRESIDENT, AFTER A BUSY AND PRODUCTIVE TAME AT HOME FOR THE SEVERAL WEEKS, I'M GLAD TO BE BACK IN THE SENATE AS WE QUICK OFF -- KICK OFF A NEW YEAR AND CONGRESS. AFTER YEARS OF DEMOCRATS CONTROLLING BOTH CHAMBERS, THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE VOTED FOR A CHANGE IN THE MIDTERM ELECTION BS.  -- ELECTIONS. WITH THE REPUBLICAN HOUSE, DEMOCRATS OF COURSE WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO ABUSE THE BUDGET RECONCILIATION PROCESS TO CIRCUMVENT THE NORMAL LEGISLATIVE PROCESS WHICH MEANS THE END TO PARTISAN SPENDING BILLS. THEY'LL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO WORK FOR COMMON GROUND AND TO MOVE LEGISLATION THROUGH WHAT WE CALL REGULAR ORDER AROUND HERE, WHICH MEANS BY THE RULES. WHILE THERE IS A LOT WE NEED TO DO IN THE COMING MONTHS, ONE OF OUR TOP PRIORITIES MUST BE THE HUMANITARIAN AND SECURITY CRISIS AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER. THIS CRISIS HAS BEEN RAGING SINCE PRESIDENT BIDEN TOOK OFFICE TWO YEARS AGO. DAY AFTER DAY, MONTH AFTER MONTH MIGRANTS HAVE CROSSED THE BORDER IN UNPRECEDENTED NUMBERS. OVER THE YEARS WE'VE SEEN MIGRATION SURGES AT DIFFERENT TIMES, BUT NOTHING LIKE THIS. THE SCALE AND THE IMMENSITY OF THIS CRISIS ARE UNPRECEDENTED. LAST MONTH U.S. CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION ENCOUNTERED MORE THAN 250,000 MIGRANTS AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER. THAT'S THE BACKDOOR TO MY STATE, THE STATE OF TEXAS. A QUARTER OF A MILLION PEOPLE IN A SINGLE MONTH. THAT'S A NEW RECORD AND A SHOCKING NUMBER. TO PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE, CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION ENCOUNTERED MORE MIGRANTS IN NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER OF LAST YEAR THAN IT DID IN ALL OF 2017. TWO MONTHS, THE LAST TWO MONTHS OF LAST YEAR THAN IT DID THE ENTIRE YEAR OF 2017. THOSE FIGURES TELL YOU A LOT, BUT NO WORDS CAN ACCURATELY CAPTURE JUST HOW COMPLEX AND CHALLENGING THE SITUATION AT THE BORDER TRULY IS. TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE GROUND, YOU NEED TO SHOW UP. YOU NEED TO SEE IT FIRSTHAND. AND YOU NEED TO LISTEN AND LEARN FROM THE EXPERTS AND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DEALING WITH THIS DAY IN AND DAY OUT. I'VE TRAVELED TO THE BORDER MANY, MANY TIMES OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS AS THIS CRISIS HAS GOTTEN WORSE. I'VE SPOKEN WITH THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS THAT ARE -- THAT HAVE TAKEN AN OATH TO UPHOLD AND ENFORCE OUR LAWS, THE NONPROFITS, GROUPS LIKE CATT THICK CHARITIES -- CATHOLIC CHARITIES THAT PROVIDE HUMANITARIAN SERVICES, LOCAL OFFICIALS, MAYORS, COUNTY JUDGES WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE TO THEIR OWN TAXPAYERS FOR PROVIDING SERVICES THAT ARE OVERWHELMED BY THE SHEER NUMBERS OF PEOPLE COMING ACROSS THE BORDER. AND THEN THE PRIVATE LAND OWNERS WHO FIND THAT THEIR FENCES ARE KNOCKED DOWN, THEIR PROPERTY IS TRASHED, AND THAT PEOPLE TRESPASS UPON IT AT WILL. THEN THERE ARE THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS THAT DEPEND ON THE FOOT TRAFFIC THAT FREQUENTLY COMES BACK AND FORTH ACROSS THE BORDER AND COUNTLESS OTHERS WHO ARE IMPACTED BY THE CURRENT BORDER CRISIS. OF COURSE, THESE ARE EXACTLY THE KINDS OF PEOPLE YOU MIGHT WANT TO TALK TO IF YOU ACTUALLY HAD AN INTEREST IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT WHAT THE PROBLEM IS AND FASHIONING SOME KIND OF SOLUTION. WELL, I WAS HAPPY TO INTRODUCE THESE EXPERTS TO A BIPARTISAN GROUP OF MY SENATE COLLEAGUES A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO. BOTH OF US REPRESENTING BORDER STATES, SENATOR SINEMA, THE SENATOR FROM ARIZONA, AND I HAVE HAD WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL AN EXCHANGE PROGRAM BETWEEN OUR TWO STATES. A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO I VISITED TUCSON, ARIZONA, AND SENATOR SINEMA IN RETURN VISITED THE RIO GRANDE VALLEY FOR A SERIES OF BRIEFINGS. THE FIRST THING THAT JUMPS OUT AT YOU IS THAT THE BORDER IS BIG. 2,000 MILES. IT COVERS A LOT OF TERRITORY, AND IT VARIES A LOT DEPENDING ON WHETHER YOU VISIT URBAN AREAS LIKE EL PASO OR RURAL AREAS LIKE YUMA, ARIZONA. THAT'S WHY WHILE I'M HAPPY THAT PRESIDENT BIDEN FINALLY WENT TO THE BORDER IN EL PASO BRIEFLY, I KNOW HE COULD NOT HAVE GOTTEN A FULL AWARENESS OF THE CHALLENGES THAT THE CURRENT CRISIS AS A RESULT OF HIS OPEN BORDER POLICIES PRESENTS. NEVERTHELESS, SEEING TWO VERY DIFFERENT BORDER CROSSINGS WAS VALUABLE TO BOTH SENATOR SINEMA AND MYSELF, AND WE DECIDED IT WAS TIME TO SHARE THAT INFORMATION WITH OUR COLLEAGUES. SO WE INVITED SEVERAL OF THEM TO JOIN US. IN TOTAL THERE WERE EIGHT OF US, EIGHT SENATORS ON THE TRIP. ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE WE HAD SENATORS TILLIS, LANKFORD, MORAN, AND MYSELF. ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE WE HAD SENATORS KELLY, MURPHY, AND COONS. ACTUALLY NOW THAT SENATOR SINEMA HAS DECLARED HERSELF AS AN INDEPENDENT, SHE SAID THIS WAS NOT A BIPARTISAN TRIP BUT A TRIPARTISAN TRIP. WE SPENT A DAY IN EL PASO SPEAKING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS. IN RECENT MONTHS THE CITY OF EL PASO HAS BEEN GROUND ZERO AND OVERWHELMED BY THE INFLUX OF MIGRANTS. IT DOESN'T HAVE THE CAPACITY. NO BORDER COMMUNITY DOES, TO CARE FOR THE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE COMING ACROSS THE BORDER DAILY OR THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO HOUSE THEM OR TO TRANSPORT THEM SAFELY TO OTHER LOCATIONS. FORTUNATELY, AT LEAST IN THE NEAR TERM AND IT TENDS TO GO IN WAVES, UP AND DOWN, MOST RECENTLY THE PACE IN EL PASO HAS SLOWED DOWN BUT SOME OF THE SIDEWALKS DOWNTOWN ARE STILL LINED WITH MAKESHIFT TENTS AND SLEEPING BAGS. MIGRANTS CAMPING OUT IN THE CITY, NOWHERE TO GO, WAITING FOR THEIR NEXT MEAL AND WAITING FOR SOME PLACE WARM TO BE ABLE TO SLEEP. WE HEARD ABOUT THE TREMENDOUS BURDEN THIS CRISIS HAS PLACED ON LAW ENFORCEMENT AT ALL LEVELS. YOU CAN IMAGINE. THEY'RE ALREADY UNDERSTAFFED AND NOW THEY'RE OVERWHELMED. WE HEARD ABOUT THE GROWING STRAIN ON THE NONGOVERNMENTAL ASSOCIATIONS AND THE CITIES AS THEY TRY TO MITIGATE THIS CRISIS. AGAIN THIS IS A CRISIS OF THE PRESIDENT'S OWN MAKING AS A RESULT OF HIS OPEN BORDER POLICIES AND FAILURE TO ENFORCE OUR IMMIGRATION LAWS. WE HEARD FROM BUSINESS LEADERS WHO DEPEND ON CUSTOMERS COMING TO THEIR BUSINESS AS WELL AS OTHER LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT THE LARGER IMPACT THIS CRISIS HAS HAD ON THE EL PASO COMMUNITY AND THE SOUTHWEST BORDER REGION, ESPECIALLY THE EFFECT IT'S HAD ON LEGITIMATE TRADE AND TRAVEL WHICH ARE VITAL TO THE REGION'S ECONOMY. I DON'T KNOW IF MOST NONBORDER STATE SENATORS UNDERSTAND IT OR NOT, BUT WE HAVE THE LARGEST LAND PORT IN AMERICA IS LAREDO, TEXAS. THEY HAVE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 14,000 TO 16,000 TRUCKS A DAY COME ACROSS THE BORDER FOR LEGITIMATE TRADE AND COMMERCE. OBVIOUSLY THAT LEGITIMATE TRADE AND COMMERCE, IT CREATES A LOT OF JOBS ALL ACROSS AMERICA AND ARE IMPEDED BY THIS VAST INFLUX OF HUMANITY THAT ARE COMING CURRENTLY AS A RESULT OF THE NONENFORCEMENT POLICIES OF THE ADMINISTRATION. THE DAY AFTER WE VISITED EL PASO, WE TRAVELED TO UMA, ARIZONA. IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT A MAP IN ARIZONA, IT'S IN THE SOUTHWEST PORTION OF ARIZONA, RIGHT NEXT TO CALIFORNIA. VERY SOUTHERN SOUTHWEST TIP OF ARIZONA. IT'S AN AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY BY AND LARGE, SMALL TOWN, LOT A LOT OF INFRASTRUCTURE, HOSPITALS, SCHOOLS, OR OTHER PLAYERSES FOR MIGRANTS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF WHEN THEY COME TO THE BORDER. SO IT'S NOT SURPRISE THAT THE BORDER PATROL IN UMA, ARIZONA, A SMALL TOWN ON THE SOUTHWESTERN BORDER OF ARIZONA, THAT THE BORDER PATROL AGENTS ARE STRAINED. SECURITY MISSIONS ARE TAKING A HIT, AND IT'S BECOME EVEN MORE CHALLENGING TO PROCESS AND CARE FOR THE VOLUME OF MIGRANTS COMING ACROSS THE BORDER. LESS ANYONE THINKS IMMIGRATION IS JUST RELATED TO MEXICO AND CENTRAL AMERICA, PEOPLE FLEEING POVERTY AND VIOLENCE, THE BORDER PATROL TOLD US IN THAT SECTOR ALONE, THEY ENCOUNTERED MIGRANTS FROM SPEAKING 200 LANGUAGES FROM 176 COUNTRIES. THIS SLEEPY TOWN IN SOUTHWEST, ARIZONA, PEOPLE SPEAKING 200 LANGUAGES FROM 176 COUNTRIES. YOU MIGHT ASK HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE? WHERE ARE THESE PEOPLE COMING FROM? I THOUGHT THEY WERE ALL COMING FROM MEXICO OR MAYBE EVEN CENTRAL AMERICA. IT JUST SO HAPPENS THERE IS A MAJOR CITY JUST SOUTH OF YUMA CALLED NEXT CALI. WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS INTERNATIONAL HUMAN SMUGGLING OPERATIONS FLYING PEOPLE INTO NEXT CALI -- MEXICALI AND THEN TURNING UP IN YUMA AND CLAIMING ASYLUM. AGAIN, OVERWHELMING THE CAPACITY OF THIS SMALL LITTLE BORDER TOWN TO BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH THESE HUGE NUMBERS. AND PEOPLE FRANKLY AIF BUESING -- ABUSING THE ASYLUM SYSTEM WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO BE PEOPLE FLEEING FROM PERSECUTION, PEOPLE WITH GUCCI LUGGAGE COMING ACROSS THE BORDER AND CLAIMING ASYLUM KNOWING THAT BECAUSE OF THE BROKEN ASYLUM PROCESS, THAT THEY'LL BE TRANSPORTED INTO THE INTERIOR OF THE UNITED STATES AND GIVEN A NOTICE TO APPEAR FOR A FUTURE COURT HEARING. BUT BECAUSE OF THE BACKLOG OF THE IMMIGRATION COURTS, IT WILL BE LITERALLY YEARS BEFORE THEY ARE NOTIFIED TO SHOW UP. IF THEY DO SHOW UP, 90% OF THEM WILL BE UNSUCCESSFULSUCCESSFUL N OBTAINING SLUM. BUT THE FACT IS THEY DON'T WHICH SHOULD BE A SURPRISE TO NO ONE. AS I'VE SAID, I'VE LEARNED A LOT FROM THE EXPERTS ON THE GROUND AND I HOPE OUR COLLEAGUES, OUR BIPARTISAN SELL GAITION OF SENATORS, DID AS WELL. AND I APPRECIATE THE SENATORS WHO TOOK THE TIME TO VISIT EL PASO AND YUMA AND I KNOW ALL OF US APPRECIATE THE MEN AND WOMEN ON THE FRONT LINES ALREADY OVERWHELMED BY THIS HUMANITARIAN CRISIS AND BORDER SECURITY CRISIS. THEY TOOK TIME TO TALK TO US HOPING, JUST HOPING THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING TO HELP THEM. NOW, EIGHT SENATORS, IT WON'T SURPRISE YOU, HAVE DIFFERENT VIEWS AND IDEAS ABOUT HOW TO SOLVE THE CRISIS. STANDING TOGETHER ALONG THE BORDER DOESN'T MEAN WE AGREE ON EVERYTHING. BUT IT DOES MEAN THAT WE'RE INTERESTED IN FINDING SOLUTIONS. THERE ARE CONVERSATIONS OCCURRING IN THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE, AND MEMBERS FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE ARE FLOATING A RANGE OF IDEAS TO ADDRESS THE CRISIS. THERE ARE SOME -- THERE ARE SOME BIPARTISAN CONVERSATIONS OCCURRING, INCLUDING SENATOR SINEMA FROM ARIZONA, SENATOR TILLIS FROM NORTH CAROLINA, AND I'M GLAD THEY'RE WORKING ON THIS, AND I'M EAGER TO SEE WHAT THEY COME UP WITH. AS WE ALL KNOW, PRESIDENT BIDEN HAS SHOWN THAT HE'S COMPLETELY UNWILLING TO USE HIS CURRENT AUTHORITIES TO SECURE THE BORDER. AND THE TRUTH IS HE HAS PLENTY OF AUTHORITIES BUT REFUSES TO DO HIS DUTY AND ENFORCE OUR LAWS. SO IT'S TIME FOR CONGRESS TO TAKE ACTION. OF COURSE, SOMETHING THAT'S EASIER SAID THAN DONE, 535 OF US, 435 IN THE HOUSE, 100 IN THE SENATE. IT'S NOT EASY TO GET EVERYBODY OR AT LEAST A MAJORITY ON THE SAME PAGE. AND WE HAVE THE NEW REALITY OF DIVIDED GOVERNMENT. AS I ED EARLIER -- AS I SAID EARLIER. BUT WE DO HAVE WITHIN OUR CAPACITY THE ABILITY TO TRY AND TO ACHIEVE CONSENSUS AND THE ART OF THE POSSIBLE. I KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE A HUGE REACH, A STEEP HILL. PICK YOUR METAPHOR. IT'S GOING TO BE HARD BECAUSE THE DEMOCRAT MAJORITY IN THE SENATE HAS A VERY DIFFERENT APPROACH THAN THE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE. BUT WE HAVE TO BE REALISTIC ABOUT WHAT CAN PASS THE HOUSE AND EARN 60 VOTES IN THE SENATE. A BILL THAT WILL PASS ONLY ONE CHAMBER WON'T ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING IN DEALING WITH THIS CRISIS. OF COURSE, AT THIS MOMENT THE BORDER CRISIS IS CONSUMING ALL THE OXYGEN IN THE ROOM, BUT THIS MUST BE ADDRESSED BEFORE WE'LL BE ABLE TO COME TO AN AGREEMENT ON ANY OTHER IMMIGRATION REFORM. IT'S A PREREQUISITE, A FOUNDATION FOR ANY LARGER AGREEMENT. THE MILLION DOLLAR QUESTION IS WHAT WILL THAT LOOK LIKE? AS MY COLLEAGUES AND I SAW A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO, ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES IS PROCESSING AND HOLDING CAPACITY. THIS IS A FEATURE OF THE CURRENT CATCH AND RELEASE POLICIES OF THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION, NOT A BUG. IT'S A FEATURE OF THEIR CATCH AND RELEASE POLICIES. AND IT'S BEING EXPLOITED DAILY BY THE CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS THAT CONTINUE TO GET RICH SMUGGLING PEOPLE AND DRUGS ACROSS THE BORDER. OUR SYSTEM SIMPLY WAS NOT DESIGNED TO KEEP UP WITH THE INFLUX OF THIS MANY PEOPLE CROSSING ARE THE BORDER EVERY DAY. AS A RESULT, BORDER PATROL AGENTS TOLD US THAT THEY'RE BEING SHIFTED FROM THE FRONT LINES TO PROCESS PEOPLE IN THE BACK OFFICE, LEAVING HUGE SECURITY GAPS. FULLY 40% IN SOME INSTANCES OF THE BORDER LEFT UNPROTECTED BECAUSE THE BORDER PATROL HAS TO PROCESS THE MIGRANTS, AND THEY HAVE TO LEAVE THE FRONT LINES TO DO SO. WHICH MEANS THAT THE DRUG SMUGGLERS HAVE AN OPENING, WHICH THEY EXPLOIT ON A REGULAR BASIS TO MOVE ILLEGAL DRUGS INTO THE UNITED STATES. CARTELS ARE USING THESE CORRIDORS TO TRAFFIC FENTANYL AND OTHER DANGEROUS DRUGS INTO THE COUNTRY. THE DRUGS THAT TOOK THE LIVES OF 108,000 AMERICANS LAST YEAR ALONE. 108,000 AMERICANS DIED DUE TO DRUG OVERDOSES, ALMOST ENTIRELY COMING ACROSS THE SOUTHWESTERN BORDER. YOU WOULD -- YOU WONDER WHAT IT WILL TAKE TO GET PEOPLE'S ATTENTION TO WAKE UP TO YOU THIS PUBLIC -- TO WAKE UP TO THIS PUBLIC HEALTH SAFETY HAZARD, THIS HUMANITARIAN AND NATIONAL SECURITY CRISIS. AT THE SAME TIME, MIGRANTS WITH WEAK AND EVEN FRIVOLOUS ASYLUM CLAIMS ARE BEING RELEASED INTO THE COUNTRY TO AWAIT A COURT DATE THAT IS YEARS DOWN THE LINE. AS I SAID, MANY ARE NO SHOWS HAVING MADE IT SUCCESSFULLY INTO THE UNITED STATES WITHOUT ANY RIGHT TO EMIGRATE. THAT'S GOT TO CHANGE. WE ALSO NEED TO STRENGTHEN BORDER SECURITY, WHICH I WOULD DEFINE, AGAIN, BASED ON LEARNING AT THE -- FROM BORDER PATROL AND OTHER EXPERTS ALONG THE BORDER, BORDER SECURITY REQUIRES A COMBINATION OF PERSONNEL, TECHNOLOGY, AND INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT INCLUDES APPROPRIATELY LOCATED BARRIERS, TEMPERATURES, LEVEES. IT INCLUDES SENSORS, COME RAS, ROADWAYS AND MORE AGENTS TO PREVENT DANGEROUS PEOPLE AND DANGEROUS SUBSTANCES FROM ENTERING OUR COUNTRY. A SAFE AND SECURE BORDER RELIES ON ALL OF THESE ELEMENTS, AND IT'S CLEAR THAT CONGRESS NEEDS TO INVEST IN MORE RESOURCES, BUT MORE THAN THAT, IN CORRECT POLICIES SO THAT IMMIGRATION ACROSS OUR BORDER WILL BE SAFE, ORDERLY, HUMANE, AND LEGAL. THIS MOVEMENT OF MASSES OF HUMANITY -- 250,000 A MONTH -- THROUGH -- HANDLED BY HUMAN SMUGGLERS AND BY THE CARTELS THAT ARE GETTING RICH, THIS IS NOT GOOD FOR ANYBODY. IT IS NOT FOOD FOR THE MIGRANT -- IT IS NOT GOOD FOR THE MIGRANT, WHO IS VIEWED HAS A MERE COMMODITY, MANY LEFT TO DIE, MANY YOUNG WOMEN AND GIRLS ARE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED EN ROUTE, BECAUSE THESE CARTELS DON'T VIEW THESE AS HUMAN BEINGS. THEY VIEW THEM AS A COMMODITY. SOMETHING THEY CAN TRADE FOR MONEY. WELL, THERE ARE A RANGE OF OTHER REFORMS THAT I'M LOOKING AT AS WE TRY TO FIND OUR WAY TOWARD A SOLUTION, AND I'M OPEN TO HEARING FROM ANYONE WHO HAS AN IDEA AND I HOPE WE CAN HAVE A SERIOUS DEBATE AND SOLUTIONS WHOER IN CONGRESS. WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAW IN EL PASO WAS A SNAPSHOT OF A SANITIZED BORDER. I HAVE NO ILLUSIONS THAT HE HAS ANY DEPTH OF UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE COMPLEXITY OF WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH THERE. BUT I AM GLAD THAT HE FINALLY SHOWED UP, AFTER TWO YEARS. GIVEN A REPUBLICAN MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE AND A DEMOCRATIC MAJORITY IN THE SENATE, WE NEED TO BE REALISTIC ABOUT WHAT IT IS WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH. BUT, AGAIN, THIS IS ALL ABOUT WHAT SOMEBODY HAS CALLED THE ART OF THE POSSIBLE. THAT'S WHAT LEGISLATING IS ALL ABOUT. BUT THE FACT IS THERE'S AN UNPRECEDENTED HUMANITARIAN AND SECURITY CRISIS AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER, AND IT'S PAST TIME FOR CONGRESS TO DO SOMETHING TO ADDRESS IT. MADAM PRESIDENT, I YIELD THE FLOOR.

northern panhandle veterans council and helping heroes retired umw member thanks john if that's have we called everybody let me just thank all of you for being involved i really appreciate very much in attendance on such short notice uh let me just say for all of you all the press is also probably monitoring and being on you know because we want them to know exactly what we're doing and if they can just see the the about the ability to bring this many people together in such short notice of the importance of the urgency of this issue because this thing will move faster than we know and we're making sure that they hear loud and clear from west virginians how important our health care services are to our to our veterans and the communities that basically have housed them and also the employment base that comes from all this so uh what we'll do is set up some of the ground was what we're going to talk about today um i've always said you know uh we have if we're not the most patriotic we are one of the top most patriotic states in the nation and that comes by the percentage of veterans we have per capita so i've said if you want to know the the amount of commitment we've had to this country just look on the vietnam wall you'll see more west virginians per capita on that wall than any other state so we've given everything that we possibly could and have basically paid the supreme price for what we have today what we're talking about is them um what we've been hearing and that because of all the things we've done now just whatever way they're gathering information and i've always found sometimes information is not gathered accurately and some and then you have times when there's assumptions being made and it's not favorable for small rural states and in west virginia we have we have four hospitals how many see box do we have you know exactly how many we have okay um but anyway on our see boxes we have and then also we have the port at what clink we saw the one down south our portable clinic so we've done everything we can to give the services to the veterans and we're going to continue to do that i think a lot of you know that va recently published their initial recommendations to the asset and infrastructure review or what we call the air commission and it was created as part of a 2018 missions act and signed into law by president trump at that time uh i i think all of you should know that in 2019 senator rounds and i cinder rounds is a friend of mine from he's a he's my colleague a republican senator from south dakota mike and i were governors together so we had a long relationship a long friendship and we introduced a bill to eliminate the air act which did not go over well but we still tried and now i'm thinking about reducing again we think now we need to really double down on it the air commission is supposed to modernize the va and so far that what we've been able to find has been just unfairly targeted rural areas because of population not because the amount of service or the amount of concentration of service but just population and that's exactly what senator around nice thought would happen um let me give you an idea how the government looks at things whenever you see money going to hospital like this is we're putting 100 million dollars to help hospitals you would think it would be done proportionately 20 percent of the population of america lives in rural we call rural america that's 66 million people that live in rural america that's 20 you would think just by simple math that any type of appropriations the 20 would always be directed towards rural america that's the only people that can compete if you're in rural america you competed for this pot of money it's not the way it was the first cares act that went out i think there was a hundred and some billion dollars that went for hospitals seven percent went to rural hospitals when we found that out i made the readjustment we're putting in a legislation that any amount of money distributed in categories has to be set aside 20 percent for rule so it's it's this is something traditionally has happened for a long long time the air commission plan is it's far from final uh it's going to be under deliberation for at least another year that we know about and uh and i'll get to vote on any recommendations for the come final i'm on the veterans committee in the senate uh john tester is a chairman right now dear friend from montana and jerry moran from kansas to good people a republican democrat um there's three committees that'll really matter what this topic appropriations i'm on appropriations shelly more capital is on appropriation so we have our two centers there's only two states that have both of their senators us and montana the only two states have both both senators on appropriations so we get a double bite at the apple or to be able to stop some bad things so we have appropriations and veterans i'm on veterans and i'm on armed services so all three committees that i'm on this is going to have to be approved through those three committee processes president kennedy said a nation reveals itself not only by the men it produces but also by the minute honors and the men the men it remembers and i think that we have tried to do that better than most any state uh i'm always stand by and fight for the things that we believe in and when we got to that the the we had our troubles it was horrible situation we had at clarksburg and um that's something that will never be repeated again and it's something it should never be but basically it was just lackluster just a lack of attention to detail going through the vetting process of how we hired people to serve to serve our veterans it was a pure lapse of anyone really caring and we brought that to attention and some families paid a horrible price about that so i'd like to hear from you all and hear from those who have concerns about what you're thinking or what basically you've heard that hasn't been uh properly uh reported hasn't been accurately recorded and it won't be evaluated properly if if the act if the numbers aren't correct i'll guarantee the outcome will not be accurate and if they're trying to skew it to basically downsize into rural areas they'll be able to justify what they're doing if we don't speak up and push back um i think is general hoyer on i'm on senator how are you i i think you've been through some of this before in the old brack and how we handled it and what went on then so maybe jim you'd like to say something and and be able to uh to to speak up on this issue yes sir senator i appreciate you letting me go unfortunately got to drop off here shortly but uh first let me say as a veteran and amy and eyes the parents of two veterans how much we appreciate you jumping on this and and taking the lead on this and working with the governor and senator capito and i know congressman mckinley has been engaged as well this is really important to our veterans and and i greatly appreciate all your your efforts there i'd like to just focus on four areas that i think are important number one as you pointed out we owe it to our veterans to put them in a situation where they are comfortable getting care and they get care along with other veterans and people who recognize their specific needs so to to take these four va assets and either reduce them or take them out of west virginia just an absolute disservice to to our veterans and we we've got to address it and we appreciate you taking the lead on it i'd like to also cover a couple other areas that i've been engaged in and now engaged first is during emergency response i don't think people at the national level understand how important our veterans hospitals and their staff are to part of our state emergency response to care for our veterans so to lose that capacity would really be a detriment to our veterans but to our state's response as a whole and that's an area that they aren't considering they aren't quantifying and they really need to pay attention to the other area is in my role along with clay marsh and leading the governor's pandemic response task force i cannot stress enough how important our va hospitals were to quickly executing support to our veterans in the pandemic and specifically the roll out of the vaccine to our older west virginians which saved countless number of lives in west virginia and without the va hospitals and that access to those veterans and we know that people get care where they have trust and confidence and feel comfortable we could not have hit the numbers that we hit with our vaccines for our older west virginians so they've got to consider in an epidemic or another major event like that how important uh they are uh the last area and this comes from my counterpart clay marsh and i both and clay is the chancellor of health sciences we believe that wvu and i'm sure our sister facilities like marshall can be more involved and provide more care but we believe the best way to do that is in affiliation with our our veterans facilities our hospitals our cboc and one of the things that that limits that right now is the va has refused to to provide the appropriate level of scale reimbursement for technical expertise coming into and supporting those facilities so adjusting that and providing that support through our existing facilities is the best way in our opinion to serve our veterans who deserve the care and again i both as a veteran and as a parent i greatly appreciate your your effort and the way you lead the charge on veterans issues hey general thank you so much and i believe i appreciate so much you're taking the time i know you have to run to another committee meeting and everything but i appreciate you giving us some time on that also i think i'd like to hear olivia leaving you on with us olivia is she runs the committee she's on the committee staff for me on the veterans committee so she's the one interfacing with them continuously uh we have her on terry olivia can she hear us sir she can tell you what she's hearing from the committee's side and what the committee staffs are hearing what got us all concerned about you know this thing could happen when they start moving the moves pretty fast if they start evaluating pretty soon when that when those decisions are made it's pretty hard to reverse them the hospitals are what i'm i'm understanding the hospitals what the most are in concern right now ted you want to you want to go over some of the things you've heard thank you sarah there are so many pieces to this that that concern me that actually as a not just cabinet secretary for veterans assistance but also as a customer uh i get my i get my health care through va to caveat what off of uh general hoyer he is absolutely correct what many people throughout west virginia and throughout the country do not realize va's fourth mission is this exactly what he was describing va's fourth mission is to support support the communities in times of emergency whether that be man-made natural disaster or what we just experienced with the pandemic it's the fourth mission that is statutory other parts of this that that bring concern to me the emergency room care in the three facilities that have well for lack of a better term been targeted emergency departments would be converted to urgent care centers here when you say targeted your won't you go ahead and mention which ones you've heard now the three the three hospitals the three va medical centers that i've that have been recommended for these reduction in services beckley va medical center clarksburg va medical center huntington va medical center if you follow that line that goes through the heart of west virginia that those facilities provide access to care to west virginia's rural population of veterans their outreach is the reason why we have so many is because we are a rural mountainous state as the crow flies may not be very far to to go to these facilities but if you're out in the hollers i still have family down in mcdowell county i have family up in morgantown area up in harrison county monongahela county and these facilities are a lifeline so when when i say targeted the reduction in services that we're looking at are remove converting the emergency departments into urgent care centers removing inpatient care removing inpatient surgery removing outpatient surgery these are services that our veterans rely on this is something you all been notified that could happen yes that is that is the plan i actually the hospital is itself it won't be a hospital correct it'll be a very large urgent care and primary care center where their doctors will be their primary physicians will be if those physicians haven't haven't left to go to other hospitals either in state or out of state hey uh mark as you say olivia's on now live are you on hey sir can you hear me now no i can yep okay sorry sorry about that sorry about that everyone had a few technical difficulties um hey olivia no problem no problem tell us from from the committee standpoint olivia she she's on my staff she attends all the committee meetings with me she prepares all the back and forth that we have questions we ask and also any of the details you know she's able to get with them va can you give us an oversight of what you're hearing olivia and what they're wanting to do and what the purpose of all this is about yes sir there's a lot of murkiness right now because senator chester whose own recommendations from the air commission also substantially hurt his state he has an obligation to make sure that the commission is seen through senator manchin or senator schumer pardon who runs the senate um also does not is not comfortable with the recommendations that his state has received either so both the leaders who plan the votes and schedule the nomination hearings are going to be in a tough place so um we're not sure quite yet how they will go through um go through the process of having us vote on the nominees and having us vote on the final recommendations um but we have when you speak about nominees you're speaking about what the commission nominees um who have not been who have been put forward but haven't been confirmed yet they will do that i'll make the decisions you're these saying people these are the people that will be nominated to make these decisions yes they will be nominated to review the initial initial recommendations that we have and make changes um and then submit final recommendations to the president who will get to vote in or wrote them down or up um the purpose of it is what to save money is this for the purpose of it cost reduction yes the the purpose of it is to modernize and realign the va but i think general heuers hit on some pretty big points that um it hasn't taken into consideration current investments we have clarksburg just built a new parking garage and it's we're not sure if they even took that into consideration we're unsure if they took into consideration um how much the state benefits from the va's infrastructure it really does seem like the data they used to make their recommendations was flawed and had a lot of gaps in it so we've been spreading that word throughout the committee like you said we have center rounds but we also have a much larger group of bipartisan senators who were trying to lead the charge and they have some serious deep concerns as well so we've formed that group of about 13 senators as of now who are who are coming together to try and make sure that we uh deal with the commission in the best way possible as any of our hospitals do you all know of any of the hospitals we have you're saying that three out of the four have been targeted for some changes that's what you're saying ted right yes sir three out of the four martinsburg's the only one that because of high utilization being over in a very populated area does not look like they're on the cutting board that's correct sir due to their uh proximity to the dc beltway so they would be saying i guess olivia that utilization they don't think that we have enough utilization and there are other three hospitals is that what they're looking at yes and they also the recommendations that diminish services in three of our hospitals um they use the verbiage establishing strategic collaborations to provide those services elsewhere in the community um and it's very vague about what that means and whether or not they even assessed our capacity in the community to take on those services so if we're no longer uh offering emergency uh services or is the local community gonna be able to take that on where it's unclear whether or not the va assessed that and um i have a feeling they did not i have a feeling like you said senator that they're overly reliant on population are you collaborating with some of our other senators who are going to be in jeopardy also their hospitals or the larger facilities are the c boxes any of our see boxes in threat um we have uh there's some initiatives to relocate box to new uh new areas and um i've been talking with some groups on in the meeting today secretary diaz we had a great conversation um about how much those make sense some of the calls to move our sea backs to different areas that there's a higher population of veterans um may seem like a logical step because we're we're going closer to certain veterans but it all might also make the burden of getting to the c box much higher or there might be you know a bad snow bank there um so we've been we're looking at their proposed uh locations to move some of our cbox and and i'm going to be very interested to hear uh other folks thoughts about that on the call let me ask if there's anyone that we have here today that want to add anything to or ask any question or concern or something you might have heard that would be effective go ahead um one of the concerns that i had when we were talking about uh moving services from a v8 facility to um a local hospital like from in huntington for instance to saint mary's right if that happens what happens 10 years down the road when saint mary says hey we can no longer afford to do this this way we're going to have to charge more we're going to have to charge the veteran more to do these services that's the kind of thing that scares me when i read that what they're considering what they're saying is the private sector they want the private sector to do it for what the federal government's responsible for doing right now and what's a guarantee that the private sector will continue to do it when they're not can't be forced to i don't i don't know how you would uh you would enforce a contract that would force the private sector to do responsibilities what the federal government has is really what you're asking olivia on the the things that we're talking about now i'm hoping you're keeping taking running notes on all of this because this will be part of the dialogue and john tester's a dear friend of mine and i'll be talking to john and them when we go back because they have the same concerns that we have too we have the same concerns anybody sorry uh senator uh thank you again for uh having us here um and and some of this is kind of new as as far as how deep this this actually goes i've been reading a little bit but but some of this is new information and having been to 20 appointments at the huntington va for physical therapy for my knee here recently um i have to wonder like you said is this just population because i've been to the va both for myself and with helping another veteran who was uh severely crippled in the back recently and been to the huntington va at least 20 times this year and it is utilized to the max um you know there's never a time that the waiting room isn't full of any of the departments i go into you know the parking lot is hard to find parking in the middle of the day because of how much it's utilized and i just i cannot foresee um how i work in huntington at marshall as well i don't see how the private sector could handle um at least in the huntington area uh that influx well the thing about you know we've always said we've what we've made very clear that that if you if you take a survey of veterans where they want to get their services it'll be at another veteran clinic or a hospital a veteran hospital usually the people that are working there are there for purpose more so than just having a job and a paycheck they have a respect and appreciation for the services that that every veteran gave to our country and the services they can give back there's just a certain bond and i've never met a veteran that didn't wouldn't prefer what happened in some areas around the country their wait times were great and this and that say says well we want you to get the best care anywhere possible rather than unusual long waits and things of that sort well this has turned into a whole nother thing and and this is what we're concerned about now maybe it's been an intention of moving out of government uh sponsored and responsible into the private sector and see if they can blend them in and we don't i have not supported that at all i will go right here and then to rob and back up turn here i'm sorry uh when i first got out of the military in 1968 i had a very interesting experience that ties into what we're talking about today i was 20 years old i was recently married had a baby zero money and i went to the va in huntington because i kept having throat problems and so they had to do surgery in my throat and take my tonsils out a couple other things i couldn't get it to va in huntington i had to go to cincinnati well i drove down to cincinnati and literally barely had enough gas to get there and i planned on having enough gas to get back i was there four days and i was still still very sick they literally took me down and put me in the car and sent me home after i'd had surgery and all that the va that i've dealt with in the last 10 years it's a total different ba they're very service oriented i go with family and friends to emergency rooms and in local hospitals they're nothing like the va the va are the most welcoming people that you never get in the health care facility in west virginia now this would be a tragedy yeah for people that well we're we're jumping on this early enough to make sure it doesn't happen that's why you're all here today and that's why we're going to continue to stay on this rob yes sir uh this is we're all drinking from the fire hose right now i haven't read the report a lot of rumors of innuendo out there uh one of the things that crosses my mind is when i worked for you years ago before we ever went with me with you before we went down any road that would lead to a decision you made us do estimates of affordability time money manpower and constituents tell me what it means and if we hit a dead end somewhere and we couldn't get past it then we didn't do it it seems to me it that this should have some pro forma estimate of supportability where it lays it all out what are the consequences because what if you don't do that you're going to get this everybody's going to tell you their story and it's going to pull at the heartstrings but i don't know what effect it's going to have on the big va i would like to see the detail where they come in and say this is how this is the impact so it's more my concern is more process on a personal note i read in the paper that they were going to close the charleston clinic which is relatively new that place is a cadillac that's got to have a couple of 20 30 million dollars worth of equipment in it i can't believe that they would even think about closing that that's fraud waste and abuse in my mind you just built the damn thing well the whole thing everything you all have on your mind you're talking about right now i hope you all keep a record of what you questions you want to ask and what answers you're trying to get so that we can fit all this together so when it comes time to the formal review that we're going to have in our veterans committee it'll come to veterans probably go to armed services and appropriately the last to see it he has to go through that gauntlet first and they're going to have to justify what they're trying to do and i don't think they're going to get through but i want to make sure that we can articulate from a rural state with a high percentage of veterans with the devastation because we can't replace the services the veterans are getting right now can't do it james out here just a few minutes later introduce himself at first but james thank you sounds good senator thanks for inviting me and your staff for inviting me your staff's been instrumental in my transition from the military to to civilian life we're still in that transition mode um a little bit younger maybe than than some of you but i you guys paved the way for me beforehand and somebody said beside me did also that being said i've got three things for you our civilian hospitals are having staffing shortages i'd like to know what the staffing shortage comparisons are in the va i think the va's our staff better ems emergency medical services are having huge wait times at civilian hospitals where would we go in the prioritization of that if we come there i don't think people want to go there i'm confident they don't want to go there i recently had an experience where a foster care veteran didn't even know this existed but a gentleman was living in a veterans foster home in logan county or boone county he was sitting beside me as an inpatient at the huntington va he had no one he's had no one for years where will he go and then finally olivia probably has access to some metrics and those metrics she needs to be looking for are probably h-caps it's the patient's perception of the care they receive at the hospitals they receive and what are the hcap scores for a va a hospital in west virginia and what's the hcap score for a civilian hospital and those will be a metric base that'll give you some data to move forward and again i thank you for having this forum thank you james we have brian uh brian hunt is on zoom brian do you have a question or a comment yes sir i do um i'm with uh clarksburg i'm the vice president for the union there i'm also a army combat veteran the patient there as well um to the point of because what they've been talking about with veterans care uh at the classroom specifically their recommendations are to close the emergency room making urgent care get rid of inpatient uh care get rid of surgery get rid of icu um so basically what you got the hospital and turn it into uh an urgent care but you know arsenal know before i wasn't being a police officer before my current position i'm there now and veterans before coming that veterans would come to that hospital just just to come there it's a sense of community uh it's veterans serving veterans um and and there's been many times where veterans have bypassed other hospitals to get to do the clarksburg va their uh nursing staff and i have taken veterans who are nearly passed away out of their car to get them richer because they they wanted to go to the va that's where they wanted to go and and i think what this is just another attempt at a privatization of the va and your office do it in 2019 obviously when you introduce that bill to repeal the title ii air commission and i think everybody now is getting to know what you knew in 2019 which is this is going to be damaging to all veterans especially west virginia that they're going to they want to close the parsons uh c-bomb and open their seabock and buckhannon i don't know i mean if they tried to drive from parsons area to buccaneer in the middle of you know a winner or something like it's it's not an easy drive uh and even the government even the gao report for this even published said the va's information was incomplete they didn't they they didn't have enough information to do their recommendations and i think that's uh the main problem and when it comes to the er i know olivia has this um information that we sent it to or about there's a sniper study about elderly veterans for civilian ers versus va ers and elderly veterans had they had a better outcome and it would cost less for taxpayers to go to the va that that's there's actually a higher mortality rate for elderly veterans at non-va emergency rooms versus va emergency rooms and that was a stanford study um so and i know the va seems to now be trying to redo some of their information after post code and it's going to delay this whole process i was just curious you mentioned um your bill earlier i just didn't know if you were considering reintroducing that now that everybody knows what you knew uh and and and there's because i don't it seems to be i haven't met one person yet that uh is in favor of the va's recommendations honestly i don't think there's not one single person from anywhere that thinks it's a good idea let me say brian this so our whole purpose basically when senator rounds and i introduced it before we'll introduce the bill before and have them come before the va committee to basically tell us what their purpose of the actual purpose of why they want this air act why they think is they downsizing because of efficiency they're downsizing because of money or basically they believe the private sector can pick up the care which we know that can't so we'll put them on the spot on that one but i think that's the purpose why we need to reintroduce it like i said we're jumping on this quick enough right now to raise all the concerns i think that everybody should have and the families that depend on the veterans uh and if there's a hospital that's that's basically not been kept up and one that's in terrible uh fiscal repair you know just can't be done uh then that would be a decision be made but if they've been well maintained well well-equipped and they've all been maintained properly then to get rid of them you're not going to have anything to replace it i've got um well i'll go back to our panel here if you have one anybody here i'll go back and forth i've got three people i think i've got john powell danelle harmon and jim doddrill on virtual and i'll come back to you all do we have anybody here go ahead i've downloaded and printed this off and thumbed through it a little bit and there's a statement in there that says this has to be every four years reconsidered am i reading that right olivia sorry could you could you repeat that what they're saying is every four years the way the air act is it reads that every four years it has to be reevaluated uh i have not read that so maybe you and i can talk um after this i haven't seen that yet because as i understand it this is kind of a uh one one and done um but we can talk separately and if i read this right again there's 51 billion dollars in assets they're considering 51 billion yes if i read it right i could be wrong i just you went through the error yeah i printed it out and you want to write all these concerns down and find out and get an answer oh yeah do you know do you know that the amount did they list the amount as far as 51 billion million or billion billion so i i have a couple questions too that a couple veterans asked me to ask please do they they want to know uh oh what's the wrong pace i'm sorry um will the be if if they move services like on tv the other day they were saying some people would have to go to connecticut to get to get some services this was on the news specialist specialized services that the va could get at another va facility and you would have to go there and maybe whatever specialty that would be it would be connected it could be the closest one so they're wanting to know is the va going to pay for their way up there and they're they're like if they have to take their spouse they need a sure place to stay and stuff like that and one of them was every four year deal that's one of them but we'll find out about every four years we'll find out about 51 billion that looks like that's the amount of assets they're in but my main concern is we went with through this say four years ago with the vet centers and they kept saying we're going to just oh we're only going to reduce services we're not going to do away with these vet centers but we lost our vet center so is this the first shot across the bow about of getting rid of the the va hospitals that's my concern okay that is really my concern one more thing huntington va hospital was a five star rated hospital nationwide we had a meeting with the director and all the hospitals in the united states including civilian hospitals were raided huntington has raided a five-star hospital why would you get rid of a five-star hospital that's another question i have also okay when all this came up or the same concern you are that's why we're here to make sure that we just got a fisher house fisher house was that that and we i mean our our relationship mr fisher we will clear back when did all that begin that's about but that was about what when we had him step number one that we ran out of money and they had to shut down and we couldn't pay the death gratuity uh ken fischer at that time right the death gratuity for troops in combat their families and i said can i need help will you backfill he says i'll pay for everything that the federal government doesn't pay for until they start paying again he picked up every death benefit for every family until so we we just really became very good friends came time he said joe he said what do you think and he said i think you have one down in in huntington west virginia and i says ken you can't find a better one in the country he would not have done it and invested down there and put a fisher house if he didn't see the quality of carrot was being given there i guarantee you that yeah okay i have on the line then danelle is danelle still there harmon danielle you still on yes senator thank you again for having us today um my concern is is this not only for all all veterans but particularly for our female veterans um it can be hard for my sisters to be convinced to get their va benefits in the first place um but and the va has greatly improved services to female veterans in the past few years um and i get my va care or my health care from va and i'm well pleased um but if we take these centers either the c box or the hospitals out of these communities our female veterans are going to have nothing um and they're just starting to get the different care that we need as opposed to our partners as i said now it's taken quite a while for us to give the female veterans the attention they needed and the health care they that they need and deserve and we're just getting i think now getting acclimated to that and you'd have to start all over again as what you're saying yes sir okay do we have anybody else on the panel here please please sir go ahead i have i have a true concern about going from to civilian hospitals i have three heart attacks dr carter was my doctor here at cnc he retired they sent me to to huntington huntington's been taking care of me now they want to send me back to camc but no doctor wants to deal with me back here because i wasn't their patient since carter's gone so i'm kind of between a rock and a hard place you're still getting services i'm getting services at huntington yes but they wanted to send me to camc huntington did i think they did yes so i went up there i called all the cardiologists not one of them would take me because of it now there's a new new cardiologist over he said well come over and let me check you so he went over he walked in the room he looks and i'll see in a year the cardiologist in huntington said come back here he said we need to take care of you back here i see him three times a year the person over there didn't even put a scope to my chest or anything i've had three heart attacks the huntington va put a pacemaker defibrillator in me i get better treatment down there and fortunately for me i've been the state commander of the vfw and other things and i've been in your office several times in washington if i have a problem with veterans i come to you or i call kim or someone and they they get it fixed i can't do that with the civilian hospitals as well we can't either the veterans are taken care of and we need to make sure it stays that i got you thank you john john powell john yuan yes sir senator uh a couple of points and i'm reading the report and one of the things that states is through 2029 they're predicting like out of the pittsburgh area specifically in the northern panhandle a 14 decline in enrollment i question any decline in enrollment for veterans especially since we've been in a conflict since 2001 i think that our veterans eligible for care is going to be greatly increasing not decreasing during that period and i question those numbers we're questioning the same numbers in many cases not just that when olivia do you have anything on the accuracy or the concerns that other senators might have on the numbers yeah i think yeah we're all quite concerned with the um accuracy of the numbers i think brian mentioned the gao report um that that outlined some of those concerns they're really looking at all of these recommendations on a national level so they're saying veterans are all heading to the southwest so we need to beef up the southwest states like alabama and places like that um and and so i think there's an assumption that our population will go down and our enrollment will go down and a lot of um rural states especially like center rounds and senator sanders up in vermont we have a lot of concerns about how accurate those are so we'll we'll be flagging those concerns and making that gao report more well known and well circulated just another another point on on history in itself as we repeat ourselves tricare was a great thing for retirees and now all of a sudden that benefit is they've cut the benefit they've cut the funding on it retirees are now paying co-pays they're now having to pay enrollment fees uh their prescription costs are going up and all because we try to save money and it is this is what is this is what is going to happen to the va if we if we allow them to get a bite of the apple or they're going to keep taking more and more and more if we're not if we're not if we're not vigilant as we are right now we don't start early enough absolutely i have one more question okay no thank you sir okay thank you in the report i read that and if again if i read it i'll just skim through it if by 2020 by the end of twenty it was a report it's about that fit right i printed it out i mean him read it what was it so in that report if i read it right it says by the end of 2023 if congress doesn't adopt a resolution to to fix this whatever we want it fixed it then it becomes adopted and and the va goes forth with this recommendation is that true a lot of things are written that way basically what they're saying there's no objection then we must say it's all accepted so it will be accepted if you don't anything that's usually things will happen it'll go through there with any objections then then what happens if no one's on top of it and all of a sudden it comes to us you're not able to basically build the defense against why you shouldn't do that that's why we're starting early enough now a year in advance almost two you a good year in advance and if you don't and you start don't don't start these questions that you all have given us today that we will follow up with olivia go back i'll go back into the va committee uh and and the secretary of the veterans is a friend of mine and dennis we'll talk about all these things and i said dennis we want to meet with your committee the people that you have putting this together or wrote the report so whoever the draft of that report would be will be the person assimilated all the stuff in you know sometimes they do it in a cocoon to the standpoint they're going what the what outcome they want not really what the needs are the desire maybe it's the outcome they need trying to make this fit with this whether it be dollars or logistics or what it might be and that's the problem they run into and they just try to justify it and if you don't push back it'll happen james real quick thanks what civilian staff has the training with someone that has a heart surgery or a knee surgery that wakes up in the middle of a post-traumatic stress nightmare who can who can handle that who has that training i would say probably the va and a rare few civilians that's my concern also that's a great question because they don't i mean the average citizens and they're not trained for that they're not trained for the ptsd and we know that and that's been the biggest challenge we have right now within our veterans all organizations i have jim dodrill on the line jim thank you senator for for having this meeting one of the areas that i've concentrated on for many years and continue to concentrate on it is our homeless and nearly homeless veterans population and i think as you know the va has provided for some time valuable service in va or veterans homelessness an example of that is the homeless veterans resource center in huntington any any given night in america we have more than 40 000 veterans who are sleeping on the streets of our country and i'm wondering will is the va recommendation include curtailing or limiting this important service that uh that the va provides now jim i would say that would be suicidal if they're doing something to do away with that because one thing we've attacked is two there's two things we've attacked there's not a veteran in america that should be homeless now if there's a mental problem and something we haven't addressed or gotten to but there we should be out there following these veterans we know pretty much where everybody is and you know in a discharge and they've gone for services one place or another we have a record but to have a veteran that's basically homeless is unacceptable and have a veteran that's unemployed that wants to work is unacceptable and that's why we've raised the stakes and we have a lot of corporations now that are saying i hire a vet now i hire a vet first they'll look at that and it gives you an opportunity to to get a good job these are things you have to continue to monitor if you don't they'll fall through the cracks and that's what's happening it's just it's just atrocity i i can't i olivia have you heard anything from that standpoint did you all read anything in the report that might have showed homelessness uh yeah senator so um the air commission is just focused on infrastructure so any um infrastructure they relocate reduce expand whatever you have it there making the assumption that that service will be provided elsewhere so um the services shouldn't be impacted especially like the one you're speaking about um but the recommendations just don't go into enough detail so again they're making an assumption and we're worried that they're making those assumptions blindly without understanding the rest of the community um so in theory those those services should not be impacted but like senator manchin said we want to get ahead of it early because we don't want them to just not worry about it and just you know assume it's going to happen and on the past question of the um timeline i'm sorry i couldn't see who was asking that um but i'd be happy to talk after this in a little more detail about um what happens if the recommendations get voted down by the president or voted down by congress and what happens then i can talk a little bit our intention is not to go that far with us we're going to stop it before it gets there ted thank you senator thank you thank you very much jim thanks for bringing that up as far as the resource center goes and services that are provided by resource centers across the country with regards to homeless veteran population many of them are affected by mental illness and one of the things it doesn't directly impact the resource centers however there won't be any inpatient mental health available at huntington beckley or clarksburg we're going to take a few more questions because we're trying to we're trying to keep everybody on time i think we had set for four o'clock one hour but does anybody on the panel have anything else that you all want to ask or contribute to it go ahead sir i hate to be the one no no no no you're the one you want to read the reports it is this is jim creaseman i had a couple of comments if i could sure jim go ahead all right sir uh thank you for uh your attention to this but uh i just wrote down a couple of comments i'm a 75 year old disabled veteran and an advocate for the area pertinent to beckley bamc in regard to the air commission recommendations uh beckley medical center has demonstrated very little to no transparency on disseminating info to local veterans we've had no town halls no vso meetings and a tremendous downturn in veteran participation in committees for access to the current administration now community care access helps in some cases but is not the panacea to expanding veteran health care in my own personal experience i was referred to a local cardiac cardiac electrophysiology office and i was thoroughly disgusted with their lack of professionalism disrespectful attitude toward veterans and general condescension i refuse to go back i believe that a study of the financial impact of community care visits compared to the cost of retaining at least one va position of a given specialty in each visit network over a six month period is needed i personally believe that there would be a significant disparity in the cost not to mention wait times involved in scheduling outside positions i personally would prefer to see a reputable physician within the va system considering my understanding of the asset infrastructure review and their recommendations i believe that our two existing cbox and possibly a third coming in summers bill would become inundated with patients and incapable of providing the quality care that they now provide lastly in reality i believe that the impact of the air review fails to compare apples to apples and oranges to oranges west of west virginia veterans are in the majority restricted to a rural health care atmosphere and we cannot be compared to our brothers residing in metropolitan areas considering that we mountaineers represent the largest per capita veteran population the va needs to consider this and consider all potential impacts on the essential health care that we fought to deserve go mountaineers thank you david beard thank you sir um i'm good thanks i've just been listening taking a lot of notes this is all new to me so thanks you have anything said david you okay i appreciate i'm okay thank you okay appreciate it in huntington that we we just built a in in-house rehabilitation how's that gonna be affected yeah it's brand new well i'm just telling you fisher house brand new sports veterans right all the things we've done there we were named at woody williams yeah i mean the whole thing that we've done now thinking all that could be gone it's just ridiculous and i don't know where they're coming i really don't know i was surprised i've been here long enough when i was governor and they went through the bracket or the national guard we almost lost the c-130s and this and that and then we've come back now we have the j models we have all brand-new c-130s so we're a very intricate part of the military installation if you will and also in martinsburg air guard over there with the 17 c-17s tremendous air aircraft capabilities i've been through this nothing made sense i was there when senator byrd threw all the report his report was this big and i'm sitting there and i don't know i mean i'm thinking well you know here's senator byrd you know he's gonna make he got up there and just threw it and kicked it off and i said oh we're in trouble now and that's what he and i said well if that's what you do that's the way you do it so i don't have anything to kick right now but when it's time to start kicking we'll start kicking well i won't make one statement and i'll shut up i wanted to say this for 10 years i think the messaging when when you go to talking about veterans and military like if you want to fund the military when when you when you come on on the tv and you say we're we're spending 600 billion dollars on the military 780 now but people in the real world they don't know that that's just for military they think that the we're spending money on veterans that way i see that all the time they come in the next day and they say they just spent 660 billion dollars the veterans is going to get took care of and then i have to say no they're not that's not us so that's been killing me for 10 years can you do anything about that well we can get it accurately how much we're spending uh the veterans and the bottom line is it's not in the united states america has a responsibility we take care of our military and our veterans but any place in the world we can see what's going on with russia right now big mighty russia we thought we know that people aren't taken care of well we know there's a lot of big morale problem there and they're just they don't have the same the same care no one gives as much as we give and i think anyone that serves in you in uniform first of all anyone puts a uniform on is really willing to give their life for any of us so you take that first of all the commitment sacrifice you know what you're doing you put a uniform on and you know the ultimate price you could pay that means that there's an ultimate price that we must pay to support the person that was willing to do that that's the thing so i uh we've and really i can tell you all the all the men and women on the senate veterans committee takes us extremely serious and then uh dennis donald uh uh mcdonough mcdonough i won't say mcdonald but dennis mcdonough dennis mcdonough had never served in the military a lot of us for whatever reason didn't have that opportunity but i've never seen a person more committed and dedicated to fixing it and he's he's the right person at the right time so i really appreciate dennis and he and i've spoken quite a few times he took the seriousness we had at them at our clarksburg with the deaths we had up there and we we're getting to the bottom of that making sure that we're changing procedures so it never happens anywhere in the country because that was a lack that could be anywhere we just unfortunately got hit to hardest with it so anything i want to say to all of you this is the first of many means we're going to have everything we raise today we'll get back with you all we might call it another follow-up but i want to thank the martin and terry and the team and marcus know them and pulled this together mike and all of them that was involved very quickly this is something that we're going to stay on top of guys if they think that we put our guard down i guarantee you things will slip through and the question you ask if we don't do something does that mean it goes into effect very well could that's what it says very well could yeah that's you know because huh that's the way i really yeah and and people do that they count on that and say well no one's going to read it no one's going to pay attention and before you know it out of sight out of mind it's gone and he said what happened well you never said anything but we're saying something and they i think they expect us in the spirit of robert c byrd if i didn't speak up he'd come back and get me so but and like i said i have a good partner in shelley she'll fight we'll all be fighting this very hard david mckinley's been great to work with and and he's uh i go back and forth to david on the house side because we need to make sure that we're a joint as we move through on this but it's in all three of my committees will be uh the so i'll go through three committees so we're gonna staff is great but we want to tell you we are your minute men you call us we come right exactly well you've done that and i appreciate it so everybody on the line thank you all anyone have any last comment before we sign off did we miss i have one last i have one last comment senator i'd like to say this is ronnie wheeler again um i always notice a lot that when they want to cut back on money it seems that the first thing they go after are the veterans they go after um any benefits that we're getting they want to go after now in this case the va hospitals and i'd like to echo exactly what you said we're the ones out there putting our lives on the line for this country and we see things like this that come up and just this one when i started going over this uh error act and and reading through it i'm looking at it and going wait a minute if you're looking at wanting to cut back money let me come up there to dc and give me the budget i'll show you where you can cut back on some money to save money for the veterans amen to that one brother i need you i need more help like you as i tell you they want to cut back until it's theirs and then it's always somebody else out of sight out of mind but i can tell you that the veterans have a strong voice in washington and i'll say this final thing as we close as divided as our country is and it's more it's not so much the country it's really congress is divided the political system is divided we made it worse uh there's only one thing that holds us together and it's our military our veterans and our military basically hold us together and the reason you hold us together is because for the same purpose we owe we can't we can't repay you for what the sacrifices have been made and will be made so you know we've been able to govern in a crisis but right now the world's in trouble we don't know what this was going to happen i i can tell you there's we don't know what the no one does i've spoken to some of the top generals they don't know what the end is going to be what this endgame is going to be but it's not going to be pretty this is not going to be an early exit this is not going to be something that all of us aren't going to be involved in right now we are and a couple signs to watch for finland and sweden jump into nato it's going to rile up he's going to have to do something if he uses a low-grade nuclear weapons we got to do something you know sooner or later you're not going to sit by and watch us atrocities and genocide and people getting annihilated you can't sit back and watch this forever and it's got to change we're and i've said this so the united states of america we have given uh tremendously to ukraine and we're prepared to give a lot more we've given them everything they could use that we knew they could that they were trained on and could use we've been doing training with them since 2014 so they're up to speed better than what russians were to be honest with you and some other services and i know people are criticizing we should do this and now i thought well the airplane remember we heard about the migs get more migs the bottom line is the mig's coming from the nato allies versus the migs that they're flying in in there they're not nato they have different radio there's different communication equipment different armament on them and they were saying that they could do that but they have 70 aircraft they're not flying only five five or six forties a day so the air defense is pretty good on what the what we've been told the air defense that the russians have is is pretty adequately and and pretty well mobile to where it put them in in jeopardy so the s-300s is the one that's the equipment that really and i think they're getting more that that's a russian-made defense weapon missile defense for air defense they're getting that um and can you imagine here's russia losing their flagship moscow can you imagine and they're going to say it happened because there's a fire and we know it was a tomahawk missile that took that baby down it was no it wasn't no fire in the hole uh as they would say so the thing of it is i'm proud of what we've done i know we're committed to doing whatever how long we're going to be on the sidelines whether we're pulled in or jump in i don't know but that's a possibility i you know nobody wants to go to a world war and who would have ever thought in the 21st century we'd see a land war in europe who would have ever thought that that could even happen imagine so with that we're just concerned about how it's going to escalate where it's going to end but i can tell you we've been able to unite the nato allies someone said putin's did something that hadn't been done in 600 years he got sweden off the bench they're involved and they haven't been involved in 600 years so you can tell the united states is organizing you have to give president biden credit for what he's been able to bring his uh bring the allies together and i do and we're making uh i think decisions on getting things to them as quickly as we can but there's a lot of things that that just that's not been trained up on so we've got to give them what they can use and and we're doing everything there the thing i would like to see for the united states of america to lead the charge on a uh on a marshall plan to let the ukrainians know the world will come and rebuild ukraine with them as we did in the marshall plan to give them something to fight for because after a while if you don't think you're going to have a homeland why are you fighting and dying for some is not going to be back to where you came from if they know that we're committed and the world is coming behind the free world to be behind them every country does their part and so the glorified marshall plan for ukraine will call to ukraine plan that we're going to help them rebuild ukraine so guys just keep fighting and my god don't give up and you i think they can they can take the whole country back i hope so so with that let me thank you all we'll get back to you quickly as we can we'll get some answers to all this we'll have another round okay and we'll get together but if you'll start gathering information from all of your friends and all of your veteran organizations and and those that you you know interact with please do so and what you're hearing on the reports we'll get more information on the reports and we'll uh olivia if you're still on i want to make sure that with uh with mari here and our contacts that we can distribute any information you have on the breakdown of the report that we should be very much concerned about okay you still there olivia oh sorry yes sir yes sir i hear your line crew i want to make sure you get all that done get the break down okay make sure we have a great on the total report we'll give you all the control troubled areas that we see if you all would interact with us and give it to mar anything that you've seen in the report that you want us to look into as what we got today with that we say thank you all we appreciate it very much and be careful and be safe going home bye-bye

the chair recognizes the gentleman from New York I rise in support of my amendment to bar funding for the creation of any national marine monuments in the EEZ through presidential proclamation I do this on behalf of commercial fishermen on Long Island and throughout the nation who like so many other hardworking Americans are increasingly under assault from the executive overreach of this administration this amendment uses the power of the purse to ensure the President does not abuse the antiquities Act to lock out commercial fishermen from portions of the EEZ that contain essential fisheries any efforts to create a marine protected area must be done through the transparent process laid out by magnuson-stevens not through executive Fiat that threatens to put thousands of hard-working men and women out of business the antiquities Act has been an effective tool in the past to preserve historic sites like the Statue of Liberty but the overly broad interpretation of this of this law held by the current administration is threatening to shut down thousands of square miles of ocean from fishing through a presidential proclamation in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean fishermen from my district and throughout this region work in some of the most productive fishing areas in the world this area is currently under consideration for a marine monument designation with little public input and zero transparency the concerns regarding the Marine monument designations reach nationwide where the administration's closed and secretive process have left fishermen and regional fishery managers extremely concerned recent marine monument designations proclaimed by the Obama administration have been the largest in US history locking out all fishing in perpetuity a severe departure from the original intent of the antiquities act to preserve historical sites and archaeological treasures mr. chairman protecting the seafood economy coastal communities in the hard-working men and women who provide for their families through commercial fishing is a top priority for my constituents on the east end of Long Island I would like to thank chairman Calvert and chairman Bishop for their support of this amendment to rein in executive overreach on behalf of America's fishermen I urge all of my colleagues to support this critical amendment and with that I reserve the balance of my time

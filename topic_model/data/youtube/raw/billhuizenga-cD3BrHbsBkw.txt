Thank You mr. chairman and chair Yellen I think we share a respect for rules based monetary policy as you put it when you served on the Fed board in the mid-90s the Taylor rule is quote what sensible central banks do and it looks like we're in pretty good company dr. Charles plosser media past president the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia expressed support for rules based framework by setting monetary policy and quote him one of the most important ways to support credibility and thus the effectiveness of forward guidance is to practice it as part of a systemic systematic policy framework I believe that indicating how the evolution of key economic variables systematically shapes current and future policy decisions is critical to such a policy framework testimony before this committee in December of 2013 dr. Douglas holtz-eakin former director of the Congressional Budget Office also endorsed a rules-based monetary policy saying certainly I would like to see a far more of a rules-based approached by the Federal Reserve that doesn't rule out discretion because they can pick the rule that they want to operate but if they can provide it to the Congress and the American people the American people will know what they are up to and they themselves have said forward guidance is critical we need to know what they're going to do rules provide that close quote so I'm curious when when you and your colleagues at the Fed will adopt a rules-based policy so you used the term systematic policy and I want to say that I strongly endorse in the FOMC and strongly endorses following his systematic policy and during my term is vice chair and as chair I have tried to promote a systematic monetary policy and I believe that we do follow with systemic monetary policy but not to rule that you're willing to share correct not a simple rule based on two variables but let me point you first in the monetary policy report on the second page of the report we have a clear statement of our longer run goals in monetary policy strategy any systematic policy has to begin by articulating what the goals are very clearly and the strategy that will be followed and that's what we do there but you do agree that a rule based policy is a better way to go I don't agree that a rules-based policy is a better way to go there is not a single central bank in the world that follows a rule that would rely on only two variables so well as what we do is welcome to account wealth of information informing our judgments about the economic outlook and the way we make policies systematic is we provide and you can see this in section 3 in part 3 of the monetary policy report each individual each participant writes down their own forecast for the economy and the appropriate policy that goes along with that and from that you can get a clearer sense of how we expect to conduct policy if the economy evolves in line but our forecast I'm not convinced that is clear because others in the market don't believe that's clear other economists don't believe that that is clear and we're not trying to handcuff you but we are asking that you write a rule within descriptive parameters to use as a reference point it purely use it as a reference point I know one of the things that you've expressed here as well you know we could be we could find ourselves if we had a rule we may find ourselves in negative interest rates well simply solve that by writing a rule that says once we do that we're going to go to zero and no lower or maybe point 25 as you have indicated which are what we won't call it the Taylor rule will call it the yellin rule let's we can have some of those things that are going to give some predictability and i think is whether it's douglas holtz-eakin or others that have been within the federal bank reserve have said that that predictability and that transparency is is the way to go so I know you know that we have a discussion draft floating around that that has some of that information in there and so you just so I'm clear you don't believe that there is a time that will be right to again go towards a rural based policy I think we need a systematic policy but I would strongly resist agreeing to follow any rule where the stance of monetary policy depends on only the current readings of two economic variables which is what your reference rule relies on that's what the reference rule does but it doesn't say that's the rule you have to follow and we've got a lot of confusion out there the IMF is saying you shouldn't be raising interest rates bank for international settlements which is the central bank of central banks as you well know Claudia borio had said lower rates we get lower rates and we've got a lot of confusion out there as to the direction we're going and that's what we're asking for is clarity I think it strongly

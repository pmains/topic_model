thank you very much Madam chairman and welcome chairman Powell um when you're setting these rates and making these decisions uh and seeking that two percent magic number are you considering the cost of borrowing for the United States knowing that Congress has over borrowed and that we have overspent and that the national debt is at now at least 97 percent of GDP and that were um going to face challenges of our own making this is not about what the FED has done this is what about the Congress has done that you have to factor in to your decisions do you think about the costs of borrowing for the United States itself no we do not and we're not going to in other words that's that would be fiscal dominance if we were you know constrained in our in our monetary policy by the budgetary situation of the United States and we're not we're clearly not the the path we're on is not sustainable but the level of debt that we have is not unsustainable is not just is not is sustainable put it that way so we don't think about about interest costs when we make monetary policy we think about maximum employment and price stability it's your opinion that the level of debt we have is sustainable yes I mean we could clearly we we have the you know the largest economy in the world we can service this debt that's not the that's not the problem the problem is that we're we're on a path where the debt is growing substantially faster than the economy and that's kind of by definition in the long run unsustainable and the way countries have gotten or fixed that is is with long longer term programs that have bipartisan support and that address the actual problem in the budget that that's really the the the formula thank you I'm going to switch to stable coins uh you're a member of the president's working group on financial markets uh the working group called for Bank like regulation of stable coins in late 2021 then on January third of this year in a joint staff statement uh the Federal Banking agencies stated that even after the bank's Capital BSA AML and risk management uh a bank issuing a stable coin on a quote open public or decentralized network is highly un excuse me highly likely to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices I'm going to say that again even after A bank's Capital BSA AML and risk management a bank issuing a stable coin on an open public or decentralized network is highly likely to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices so I'm a little confused about where we're heading on stable coins does the January third statement mean that the FED has decided that stable coins on a permissionless distributed Ledger have no place in Banks so I think that there are real concerns about permissionless public blockchains and the reason is that they've been so susceptible to fraud to money laundering and all of those things so I think what you heard from the Federal Banking agencies in one of their reports was that they were there that they would tend to look at those as not consistent with safety and soundness and what really regulated stable coins do you think they could have a place in our banking system I I certainly think that in a world of appropriate regulation where the same activity where stable coin activity gets the same regulation as comparable products in different places then then there certainly could be a place for stable coins in our in among in our financial services sector thank you um the UPN Union UK Australia Switzerland Singapore and others have all moved over the last few years to create a legislative framework for digital assets the European Union in particular is attempting to be a standard Setter again like it was with its data protection rule is the United States in danger of being a rule taker not a rule maker when it comes to digital assets I do think it would be important for us to have a workable legal framework around around digital activities I think that's that is important and something congress in principle needs to do because we can't really do that yeah thank you Senator gillibrand and I agree with you one area we've already seen um is in the Basel committee on Bank supervision uh they propose Prudential treatment for crypto assets framework setting forth bank's Capital standards for digital assets the Basel committee's framework does not impose a capital charge for digital asset custody whereas the sec's staff accounting bulletin 121 imposes a prohibitive capital charge through the back door and places consumers at risk in bankruptcy similarly the Basel committee framework allows Banks to issue or hold digital assets on their balance sheet if the requisite capital is set aside so back to January 3rd 23 the fed and other bank Regulators have said that it is forbidden for a U.S Bank to conduct these activities no matter the capital so my question is what does the rest of the world know about digital asset regulation that we do not that the FED does not so as we discussed this is a an SEC staff accounting bulletin and it's it's uh it's not something that the FED issued and I'd be loath to uh comment directly on it is and and what concerns me is that the fed and other Federal Banking agencies are not following International Norms on digital asset regulation that's just my comment um thank you chairman Powell for being here um I now recognize Senator Smith

for what purpose does a gentleman from florida seek recognition madam speaker ask unanimous consent to address the house for one minute without objection so thank you madam speaker for more than 40 years the hind amendment has prevented taxpayers from funding abortions through government programs historically it has been included in annual spending bills by both parties but recently democrats voted to eliminate hyde amendment protections even president biden previously said those of us who are opposed to abortion should not be compelled to pay for them but it would appear he and his democrat colleagues have abandoned this critical position with nearly 60 percent of americans agreeing the taxpayer dollars should not be used to a fund abortion we must stand for life accordingly i support hr 18 the no taxpayer funding for abortion act madam speaker i ask unanimous consent that the committees on energy and commerce ways and means and the judiciary be discharged from further consideration of hr 18 and ask for its immediate consideration in the house with that i yield back as the chair previously advised that request cannot be entertained absent appropriate clearance

out here on the side of the interstate where they have dumped him congressman gary graves how are you hey i'm doing well how about you i could not be any better gorgeous day going to the memorial day weekend fantastic uh we're out here to talk some traffic and you've been passionate about traffic in the city that you're from for a long time so right now let's start our conversation with this college drive flyover loop tell me what that's going to do and it's all behind us and kind of a completion date that they're targeting well look first i think it's important to note that look this is something that should have been done decades and decades ago so on the one hand it's exciting that finally we've got dirt turning things are moving in the right direction but it's also kind of frustrating because just think if we were able to take advantage of the nearly two years when people were home for kova to a large degree and we would have had much less traffic and complexity in trying to manage all of this so why didn't that happen well it didn't happen and i'll give you my two cents it didn't happen because this really wasn't addressed with the urgency it should have been addressed everybody look johnny to be clear we can go back and point to you know governors for decades and decades back that didn't properly prioritize this but the fact that we're talking about this in year seven of a governor we're talking about a new bridge it's probably going to get kicked to the next governor it really is unfortunate but i'm going to say it again i'm going to try and stay positive here the fact that we've got all this going on right now is fantastic it is going to help clean up this whole interconnection between i-10 and i-12 i think we've got some other improvements that we're continuing to work on to see if we can further help with some of the connections actually getting people off these roads because what ends up happening right here in baton rouge is this is largely our main street this is our mainstream you have people that get on in college and get off at acadium or essen or what have you and that's not what interstates are really designed risking life and limb to move over especially on the weekend no you're exactly right and and look you you can look at the safety numbers i mean you do have increased accidents you have people getting hurt this is not a safe way to live and i'll say it again traffic models showed decades ago that this was going to happen this isn't just a corridor you know connecting downtown to o'neill and millerville this is connecting california to florida i mean this is a major east-west corridor for the united states a major trade corridor as we're going to see 18-wheelers i mean like on cue right now boom boom boom all these 18-wheelers coming along here so so this is something that's absolutely critical for our region but also for the nation i've been in baton rouge since 1979 i'm from the houston area originally i covered a city council meeting when i was a kid in college just as a stick in front of a city councilman and there was a councilman that had aboard an easel in 1980 showing a proposed loop that they wanted to present to the legislature back then and now that land that was the proposal is all developed now nobody wants it in their backyard but i also saw a national televised program i think it was a the travel network where they were interviewing truckers all over the country and this lady was interviewing a trucker that pulled tanks liquids and she was trying to see if he had any uncomfortable situations with his equipment she said is there anything that ever makes you uncomfortable and he said and i quote if i can plan the trip i will never go through baton rouge louisiana in the daytime wow wow i mean look it's amazing i don't know if if you've traveled much to small towns but look you go to small towns and sometimes you'll see these t-shirts there where we'll say new york milan paris bunkie you know and so the top four the top four worst traffic cities in america new york la miami baton rouge louisiana i mean it's like the it's like the t-shirt it is unbelievable and what this ends up doing is it ends up undermining our efforts to try and lure economic development here to try and lure people here because nobody wants to sit in traffic people come to towns this size because of the convenience because you can get around but but we have really complicated that by being so slow to make investments in infrastructure like we need here this is one of the major areas where east west calif coast to coast gets bottlenecked that bridge can't come too soon what are your thoughts on the new bridge what are your thoughts on turning a shovel for the first time when is this all going to happen well so new bridge look i want to commend the governor for agreeing to to attempt to put 500 million dollars aside which we know the bridge is going to be substantially more but it's a good down payment it helps us at the federal level because then we can show that there's a clear commitment from the state of louisiana but i'm also very bothered that i mean we were talking during the or i heard people talking during the campaign this governor and other candidates in the in the original campaign for governor six seven years ago talking about how a new bridge was going to be a priority and here we are seven years later and we're virtually in the same spot the fact that this much time has passed and they've narrowed it to 30 different options i mean you've got to be kidding me we can give a kid a crayon they can figure this out the the good news i'll say it again they've made a down payment it looks like the legislature is going to protect a good bit of that money but my guess is right now best case scenario we're still probably four to five years away from from actually putting stakes in the ground turning dirt on a new bridge but but i want to say this johnny i am absolutely convinced that we are going to get a new bridge this is one of the most important bottlenecks one of the worst bottlenecks in the nation one of the highest priority investments for that i-10 corridor and i'm convinced we're going to get a bridge and whether we have to hold garage sales bake sales and flip couch cushions over to pay for it i think you have people in this region that are willing to do just that they know how important this is and this isn't just a convenience project this is a safety project we have lives being lost particularly on the west side of the bridge as a result of the bottleneck but we've got to continue making these investments and looking forward because something that's really important to keep in mind look that that whiskey bay at shaffly basin crossing that's all an elevated roadway going down in new orleans we have the same thing we have the four mile bridge and the spillway elevated roadways it is going to be very expensive and challenging but as we're looking at traffic trends we've got to start planning and investing in improvements or alternatives for those routes as well otherwise we're going to just be moving the bottleneck from right here to right there to right there and that's not those aren't options we can be pursuing right now i'm so passionate about the bridge and about a loop that probably won't happen i could go on for 30 minutes about that but i do want to move on to a couple of other projects the piku lane project that's coming along and that's going to really relieve i'm thinking people that go down to highland road and get off to access areas look just once again to get keep people positive and optimistic on this we had people for decades and decades saying that the washington street exit never going to see a configuration change we've got that new terrace street exit that's open today you see construction here we've made major progress on piku i'm sure everybody who's driving between segan lane and highland road on the on i-10 they have seen that reconfiguration of the piku lane coming over the interstate the reason that's been done is to facilitate this new exit project to to make sure we have more capacity there and i know in the afternoons when highland roads backing up that exit is backing up and blocking the the right lane of i-10 that is going to be a very much utilized exit when it opens up and i think it's going to relieve a lot of pressure so once again things that should have been done decades ago we're seeing progress and and even the new lane on i-10 i mean we can celebrate that one as well between highland road and the prairieville touchdown exit a new lane there so continuing to move forward but my gosh we've got decades and decades of inaction to make up for it i try to talk on the air a lot probably more so than any traffic reporter about visit these businesses that are in the construction routes this is a temporary problem for a long-term solution and uh the i-10 widening project i'm starting to get questions about can you speak on that for a minute look i-10 widening you know we all know such a critical project but what's going to end up happening is as you know you've got the elevated section that as soon as you cross over college it goes up and when you're headed toward downtown they are going to be taking down completely taking down for example the eastbound route and going to have all traffic on the westbound route which means we're going to be losing one half of all of our capacity and i told folks the other day i think that hoverboards and horses are good investments right now it is going to be very very challenging in order to get through some of these areas for for a few years but it is going to be paying for for long-term gain that we're going to there we're going to see more capacity we're going to see better configurations of roads and obviously much better flow through here as well have they talked about a date when that's going to kind of start so they are probably about a billion dollars short right now on on being able to fully finance this thing so so what they've talked about doing and obviously doing this in stages let's take some of the the parts we can afford right now so reconfiguring some of the interface at the 10 12 split and where we are right now is going to be the first project i think that you're going to end up seeing some of the opening of the new lanes probably within about three years but keep in mind that just means that they're going to build a new eastbound route to move all the traffic over to that one deconstruct the westbound route and and so we're not going to see the full benefits of this thing for probably somewhere in the five to seven year range i often said that when katrina happened we had an overnight population growth and when all the dust settled some of that population remained as a permanent stay i feel we've outgrown our infrastructure before katrina is that an accurate statement and will we ever catch up you're exactly right traffic models showed it not just traffic infrastructure flood protection infrastructure didn't didn't really stay on track with development as well i do think we can keep a catch up but it is going to take a sustained investment we are going to have to keep this on the front burner we cannot allow it to slide back and so i am confident that we can actually catch up and even get ahead but it is going to have to take us keeping this on the front burner continuing to make this a priority and making the right investments which in some cases means very challenging political decisions to decide that we're going to prioritize roads over some other things but this is a fundamental need and it is strangling our economy and our in our community and it's simply not safe family in the houston area mentioned i grew up in that area they have toll tags on their cars what about tolls i don't think we understand them here like they do in some of the bigger cities but you don't stop at the toll booth much anymore you got a tag it reads as you drive speed limit speeds what are you have you heard anything about tolls can we do something and pay for it with the uh with the tolls so john that's a great question so let's keep in mind that roads are supposed to be paid for under a user fee model that user fee right now and has been around for decades is you pay a tax at the gas pump so when you buy a gallon of gas they're both state taxes that go to roads and federal taxes to go to roads but what's happened over time as a result of new technology like hybrids and electric vehicles you have hybrids that are getting discounts you have electric vehicles that are free loaders on this user system right now you also have a greater efficiency of vehicles so cars are paying a lower user fee to drive a mile now because of fuel efficiency so the bottom line is that user fee model is no longer one that really reflects the need for investment so my migrating to some some other type of of user fee system is something that absolutely makes sense if people want to have that trade-off for paying a different model that's going to allow us to keep up and then getting the convenience of more efficient transportation features through our community so that is something that absolutely needs to be on the table one thing about dedicated toll routes that i do think is important if we're going to do that it's got to be on new capacity new features only and allow people to continue to drive on these other kind of legacy roads that um that don't have tolls dedicated there well i totally agree uh and and you really can't compare houston with baton rouge but houston's got three losers right a lot better thank you houston's got three loops tyler texas has a loop lake charles has a bypass shreveport's got a bypass will we ever see a bypass or a loop in my lifetime you know you know johnny there was a project that was proposed years ago called the bump project it was going to use the excess capacity on the old bridge where you're going to come across there tie into airline highway and ultimately come into i-12 keep in mind the majority of traffic of the 10-12 split actually goes on i-12 not to i-10 to new orleans they're continuing that east route so so one thing that you could do and i do think we should keep this on the the the drawing board to continue thinking through you think about it we're going to build a new bridge it's going to be south of the old bridge so we're going to have a new alignment coming in you potentially build this bump project at some point and upgrade the old bridge as well as airline highway you start seeing what looks like a circle at some point i think something else that needs to be done is a better connection between for example the gonzales area up toward walker doing a connection between i-10 and i-12 in that area so again you're going to get you know 320 degrees of 360 degree circle and so i i do think that it's going to make sense to move in that direction but you nailed it earlier you've got a lot of development in some of these key areas particularly that last part of the circle i talked about that is going to make it very challenging so one of the things i think we've got to think about is additional investments for example to florida boulevard no regrets huge investments need to be made in nicholson la-30 and what this does is it creates alternative routes to the interstate that certainly can help us through construction but also going to help facilitate long-term growth in the case of highway 30 that should have been done 10 or 20 years ago as well and then over on the west side additional investments to la-1 over there because the last thing in the world we want to do is build a new bridge and take people from a traffic jam on the west side to a traffic jam on the east side we've got to make sure we have the roads there to facilitate people actually moving yeah we don't want to move the bottleneck and create the problem just a little further down that's right that's fine with me if it was past my route of travel do it uh i know you've got a busy schedule your staff is here with us thank you so much for coming out to the project here in college drive at the 10 12 uh merge or split depending on which way you're going anything else we need to uh you want to address that i want to you know it's your time i'll just tell you that we're actually headed right now to ascension parish to go meet with a a coalition that's advocating for la 30 investments and so we're just going to continue talking about alternative ways of addressing this problem the interstate is critical but we've got to keep in mind we've got a lot of these other routes u.s highways florida boulevard airline highway la-30 la-1 a lot of other options that are there and we cannot forget about those because those are going to be key alternatives for us as we move forward gary graves you're awesome thank you so much thanks johnny appreciate it gary graves everybody

I'd like to yield one minute to the always erudite gentleman from New Jersey my friend congressman Pasquale one minute good morning mr. speaker as New Jersey's recognized for one minute this is the sequel to weekend at Bernie's you know but this doesn't work you know the headline yesterday the post was the GOP campaigns ditch touting tax law the first ones thunk this is even worse look Republican economist Douglas halts akin a good good guy he said just made this past May there's just no evidence that the tax cuts actually paid for themselves of course they don't and that's why you're targeting health care that's why you're talking a targeting Medicare that's why you're targeting Social Security you're already targeted Medicaid so look in New Jersey the average salt of course still estate the average salt deduction claimed that 2016 was more than the 10,000 limit and my district the average is over 18,000 and one of the counties in my district is 24,000 what have you done that means that the average taxpaying household Jersey listen up now has to pay income tax on an additional 40,000 worth of income we may have 12 Democrats by the end of the election if they're a middle-class family being taxed at 24% that's an extra $3,400 I yield the gentleman an additional one minute the general from New Jersey is recognized for an additional minute Thank You mr. speaker Claud thank you for your courtesy thank the courtesy to the Chairman and ranking member for hundreds of thousands of New Jersey families that is a mortgage payment that's it tuition bill that's money for unexpected medical bills it's that it's going to be moving to pay more bills and Montana and South Dakota I offered an amendment to restore the full salt party vote so every member who votes for this monstrosity today is voting to make the salt caps forever and to impose a permanent tax on middle-class families it is mind boggling a member would want to hammer his constituents like that I asked my colleagues how could you vote to punish your middle-class constituents to give them more money and what's even more fascinating a number of people on the other side mr. speaker no wonder they're voting for this thing today they get less than 1% of their donations from folks like you and me so that's why they are tuned into corporate America have a great month mr. speaker

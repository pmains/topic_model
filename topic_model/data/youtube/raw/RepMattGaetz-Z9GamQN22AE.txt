Florida congressman Matt Gaetz so congressman enough with these people you know what I mean hey if it gets any weirder in Washington Jesse we're gonna have to build a wall around Congress and then pad the insides of that wall but you know you focus on all the weird things that liberals are doing remember this past week was Valentine's Day week so love was in the air I even got to wish a happy Valentine's Day to AOC and I hope she finds love that burns so bright that it's illegal under the carbon emissions of the standards of the green new deal did you send AOC like a little card or did you give her one of those little candies that say I love you I just told her that you know my love for her was so rich that she'd probably want to tax it at 70% I mean Republicans love a OCI she's the gift that keeps on giving let's go to another gift that keeps on giving Andrew McCabe certified liar he gave a big interview on 60 minutes because he needs to make money and sell books because he's probably going to go to jail and this is what he said basically admitting that he was investigating the president United States early on roll it I met with the team investigating the Russia cases and I asked the team to go back and conduct an assessment to determine where are we with these efforts and what steps do we need to take going forward I was very concerned that I was able to put the Russia case on absolutely solid ground in an indelible fashion that were I removed quickly or reassigned or fired that the case could not be closed or vanish in the night without a trace so Trump fires James Comey which the Democrats would have done if Hillary were elected and this guy mccabe launches a counterintelligence investigation against the President of the United States an obstruction investigation against the president United States and then starts rounding up other administration officials to see if they could invoke the 25th amendment administrative coup ends talking with other high-ranking officials about wiring themselves to speak to the president and secretly record him is this the deep state this is an admission he's deep state it most certainly is a year ago I said that there were unelected bureaucrats planning a coup against the president who was duly elected the mainstream media widely panned me for those comments and now that very same mainstream media is covering the fact that Andrew McCabe is saying that unelected bureaucrats were conspiring to oust the president the United States you'll also remember that Jim Baker who was the top lawyer at the FBI confirms McCabe's accounts and says that Rosen Stein did want to wear a wire on the President and you'll also remember that Peter struck and Lisa Paige were texting each other ten months into the investigation that there was no there there there was no evidence of collusion and McCabe's admission is crazy he wanted to establish an investigation that was unclosing even if there was no evidence that's not justice that's a politicized FBI right and the Senate Intelligence Committee after two years just came back with their report on Russian interference and so-called collusion found no collusion between Trump and Russia and you know what the networks did they never even covered it absolute blackout now one of the other reasons we had you on besides you're amazing analytical skills congressman it's because your last name is kind of ridiculous it's GA etz it's pronounced gates but no one knows how to say that i'll tell them it's gates I wanted to rattle off a few Democrats running for president and I want you to see if you can pronounce their names correctly because no one else can now Kamala Harris is it Kamala Harris or Kamala Harris what do you think I think it's you better not get too comfortable with your private insurance Harrison's gonna end it Kamala is it common it's Cibola that is correct okay Kamala like like the punctuation moving on who is the senator from New York the the blonde not Chuck Schumer the other one it's Kirsten Gillibrand you nailed it how did you know that Kirsten not like we should pay her some attention because the national media never does when they talk about serious contenders for the presidency I know this is the most press she's ever gotten right here all right so kirsten gillibrand not gillibrand it's a soft shade now the Minnesota woman who apparently throw shoes at her staff Amy [Music] snow globe clothes our clothes our clothes sugar clover sure I had too much shear on the char yeah too much shear okay khlo Bashar that no one's gonna ever get that name wrong right moving organs also gonna vote for her so I don't think it'll be two instruments they're only going to be mispronouncing our name for a very short period of time till the Iowa State Fair that's right now John hinking pink and looper that's right that's right I got so much legal cannabis in Colorado nobody's gonna be able to pronounce that that's a good thing he's not a write-in he wouldn't get any of those all right last one now this tripped me up because I've been pronouncing this guy's name wrong from the jump it's Beto O'Rourke not bado it's Beto did you even know that I did I was on committees with Beto and he Beto decide whether or not he's gonna run for president or not because the fields are getting pretty crowded okay and then lastly you know the senator from I think it's Ohio Brown is the last name is it sherrod is it sherrod do you know sherrod Brown sherrod Brown you know you're better you know I know why you you did so well is because everybody mangles your name so you have to really get everybody else's name right I try to remind them it's like open gates just be easy to remember all right Matt gates there is everybody thank you thank you

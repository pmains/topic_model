thank you all we have uh one thing i do welcome the secretary here who's had feels like she is probably back as a member of congress with the amount of time she spent up on the on the hill recently but uh madam secretary we all appreciate it it's and it's all very helpful to us and note that each member sitting to my left is new to the subcommittee so i want to welcome all of you publicly and i'm sure senator graham who senator graham and i have served together for ever we'll get a chance to recognize him as we go ahead one of the nice things about senator graham he and i worked together on judiciary committee where his expertise has been very good we run the together the bipartisan national guard caucus and traveled around different parts of the world some enjoyable in some about as miserable places as you're ever going to see together so but he has unique knowledge as a former judge advocate general and i welcome him because as i mentioned earlier when we were meeting the chairman and ranking members of this committee have usually worked to try to produce a bipartisan usually unanimous uh bill as senator mcconnell and i did when we were one time or another either chairman or ranking member senator greg and i have and others will and you were mentioning that rich burma is leaving and i understand richard going back to the practicing law but we'll miss you we we missed you when you left the senate when down there we'll miss you now ma'am secretary of congress yet to finish work on the fiscal year 2011 budget received yesterday the justification materials for the fiscal year 2012. my question probably straddled both the house majorities proposed drastic cuts in your budget for the remainder of 2011. the impact of those cuts on the operations of our embassies which all americans who travel study or work abroad depend on uh every time there's a problem in a country in america in that country goes first and foremost to the american embassy we saw that in egypt and libya on our national security programs that go from afghanistan to mexico and you mentioned that the president mexico is coming here tomorrow we work on the development of foreign markets for u.s exports which of course create thousands upon thousands of jobs here in the united states and we have our influence on international organizations all of which are going to be affected by these cuts we've all been passed in by recent popular uprisings in tunisia egypt libya iran yemen elsewhere i think that the courage the determination of people these countries and overcoming generations of fear and anxiety apathy is extraordinary it's inspiring but it also raises the question what comes next and in fact in many ways it's hard to see how the government of iran doesn't come out stronger as a result of all this upheaval and that concerns everybody here i think the u.s should be a strong voice for people living under repressive corrupt regimes who are demanding the freedoms we often take for granted the support we need in countering terrorism around the world we've seen the power of internet facebook twitter and other social media media we saw how the mubarak regime tried to silence it and failed we know how iran rulers are cracking down on it and since 2000 the reason i mentioned this subcommittee since 2008 i mentioned especially for our new members has appropriated 50 million dollars for programs to promote internet access and circumvent government censorship around the world it's something that other countries hadn't done we've done and it's been it's one of the reasons why people have their voices heard now and so i want to talk about how the state department is using these funds i think that your budget request is a more response far more responsible approach to national security challenges we face and what we've seen in the other bodies fiscal year continuing resolution fiscal year 2011. we face threats we have important interests now in the middle east and south asia and every continent china our biggest is expanding its influence in every single hemisphere and we've got to be in every hemisphere if we're going to combat that there's a global food crisis some seem oblivious too we can't punt these challenges down to the next generation we have human rights and tolerance transparent accountable government the rule of law is why i wrote the leahey amendment a decade and a half ago and it was passed with bipartisan support so i'm going to put all my my rest of my statement on the record turn over to senator graham and then yield to you madam secretary and go to questions

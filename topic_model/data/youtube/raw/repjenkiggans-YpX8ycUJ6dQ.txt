thank you Mr chair I just want to take a few minutes to talk about uh privatized unaccompanied Soldier sailor housing so I represent Virginia's second congressional district down in the Hampton Roads area and and although we lost Norfolk Naval base with redistricting is still very close and we're home to the largest Fleet on the Atlantic coast and I have the master jet Bay Association in my district so uh housing there's atrocious you know as a Navy veteran mayor it was a Navy Wife for 20 years I go on base all the time I shop at the commentary you know I see where those guys live and the quality of life aspect we talk about that and I know recruitment retention is down and I mean not only is housing a social determinant of Health for people but if we don't offer and at least get that quality of life piece back we are never going to improve our numbers and we we talked to the leadership over at Oceana uh specifically those guys are so there's three condemned enlisted Barracks there's no privatized housing on base there there's only one at Norfolk we're charging our enlisted Sailors for Wi-Fi usage I could not believe the Wi-Fi plans range from 50 to 200 dollars for I mean the first weekend that I held off is here I brought my DC staff down to Virginia Beach and I put them in my minivan and we drove to Norfolk and we drove to Oceana and I said look at where we are asking our single Sailors to live here's the barracks here's the galley now think of any four-year college or university you have been to lately and think about how beautiful those those places are and think about what we're asking those kids in the same age regions to do I've been to college I know what those guys are doing every night of the week and think about what we're asking those 19 and 20 and 21 year olds to do so if we don't prioritize that so I hear you about all these other in the energy project things specifically if we are sacrificing quality of life like housing and Barracks issues for things like energy projects that's not the right place to prioritize we're not going to have people to prioritize energy projects for if we don't focus on that first for me as a nurse practitioner as well that suicide issues have been real in my district quality of life is absolutely impacted by where these guys and girls live so we've got to do a better job for them so I know there's Alternatives out there and and listening to the discussion and thank you so much for your testimonies and briefs but I'm very interested in privatized housing I know there's probably pros and cons I I think I know the pros so I'd I'd be interested to hear some of the cons and then also is there a way that we're prioritizing amongst the service Services it seems like armies made some progress I think Navy especially in my in my district I feel like we're really behind the power curve down there for for utilizing some of these public private Partnerships but can you explain just kind of the order of of how we're prioritizing who's getting these privatized barracks and uh and then also if if there are any major cons we should consider I I can tee this off I as part of the the asceine job I am also the Department's Chief housing officer so I am responsible for working with uh and ensuring that the military departments exercise their oversight's Authority with with respect to mhpi projects and I think that there's progress that has been made so the tenant Bill of Rights couple years ago um the the fact that we've hired several hundred uh housing oversight Personnel to be in installations and work but there definitely is as you've as you've noted work left to do so the commitment that we have to ensuring that there are service members and their families have places to live that are respect the Dignity of the work that they're doing is something that that we're all committed to um it's a it's a critical Readiness issue because of the health and um if I wrote this down right your reference to the social determinant of health is something that is right up right up my alley I'd love to talk more about that with you if we get a chance um because there are aspects of this that we can that we can focus on um in terms of prioritization I'll turn to my colleagues to let that be something they can speak to in congresswoman it's nice to see you um and thank you for your focus on quality of life in a in a place that um it is very important to our Sailors um as you as you know there are barracks in in disrepair there's an example though of what is a great Authority that we've been excited to have which is the privatized spirit because I will get back to you on how we prioritize those but that is something that we are looking to do more of within those authorities and your your district is one of those places and on your note on wireless I I recently learned that too and it is top of my list to fix because I understand the connectivity and the mental health that can come from making a simple change very much thank you thank you and real quick any cons to privatized housing that we should be considering when we're you know requesting or is it as good as it sounds and seems from our perspective it has been a very good experience and we would love to see more of the opportunities The Authority great thank you so much mistakes I'm going to extend your time a minute because I want to give the Army an opportunity not from an Army Navy standpoint but they have but the Army has been moving out uh uh on this issue um particularly when it comes to the boqs the apartment type yes uh complexes and and I'd like to give Miss Jacobson a minute yeah and if I could come into I would concur it's it's painful for me to say but yes I think the Army is really blowing some of the the other branches out of the water especially on some of this privatized lodging so good job we have that on the record Miss Higgins feel free to elaborate guys thank you we really really obviously the this very important to us as you say for quality of life purposes uh on the privatized housing side we've been um with respect to privatized Barracks we are considering this very very carefully we've commissioned a Rand study to give us sort of the pros and cons and do a deep dive and at the same time we are right now looking at two proposals from our housing providers about how they would address uh privatized Barracks we have a great situation at um at Mead no I need yeah I think it's a meat I'm sorry and where where it's working but of course it's it's for for uh more senior single Soldiers the question is how do you how do you ensure continuity of leadership and unit continuity how do you make sure that leaders have access to the barracks how do you basically unit cohesion is is critical there and making sure that uh leaders have access to those Barracks for a whole Suite of reasons so we're examining it very carefully and expect to make some decisions this year good and that should be a priority as well thank you for that I know uh on Norfolk Naval base with the ship deployment schedules they were housing those guys just in empty Barracks room so there was no unit cohesion it was very difficult for our enlisted leadership to be checking in on those guys they were scattered amongst if you've ever been to Norfolk Naval Base and a lot of Acres so so being able to house them together yes for unit cohesion to be able to you know provide just some positive activities and things for them to do would be so meaningful for quality of life so thank you uh thank you and and to that in uh Miss kagan's we're going to request the department come back for a more detailed briefing uh and really diving into what where the services are going what the Commodities Are From osd's perspective where you're prioritizing and hopefully we'll get out of that as some cross service lesson learned um and and areas to sustain and areas to improve and really what the trajectory is going forward

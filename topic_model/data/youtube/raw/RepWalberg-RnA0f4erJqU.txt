and it's good to see you governor I appreciate you being here I recognize the fact that we're all doing this for the first time and we're learning as we go so I appreciate that I guess I would just follow up being ranked at 5th in the nation for 4 overall deaths in nursing homes with most recent what I saw off from CDC which was beyond what you have now put out was so 16:54 1060 16 1,650 for patients who died in 12 staff members on top of that why why did it accuse so long to change the policy not only of putting covered patients back in the nursing homes but also reporting because it was just I believe this past Thursday or Friday you began to report and that report was low and it's been changed since then but could you inform us why it took so long to begin the reports so congressman Walberg I think what Michigan has experience with kovat 19 is different than what other states have we have such exponential growth early on when we've just started learning about how incredibly contagious this diseases and how people can carry it without having a single symptom and infect others we were working with the best counsel of our public health experts across the country and at the University of Michigan every policy that we instituted was informed by that data we recognized that of course in retrospect probably a number of decisions we would have made some adjustment in but the fact of the matter is when it comes to the data one of the inherent challenges with cope in 19 is that people don't necessarily reflect on a death certificate that it is koba 19 I know a lot of other states have seen exponential reporting on their pneumonia cases well if their public health goes back and looks I a lot of those could be coma 19 deaths and so I think that that's just the inherent challenge here we've done remarkable things in terms of sharing information I happy to follow up with you sorry

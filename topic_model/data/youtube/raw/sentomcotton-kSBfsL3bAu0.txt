Dr Mehmet Oz joins us along with Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton who's going to be campaigning with him today he is in Pittsburgh guys good morning to you morning morning Steve okay so Dr Oz let's start with you you're finally going to have a debate but it's next week I know has an early voting started why why so late and why only one John fetterman stalled he obfuscated he created every excuse possible finally because it was a huge onslaught of media pressure on him agreed to a single debate as late as possible you write the early balloting has already started the absentee ballots but here's the thing you know he's only agreed to an hour of one debate even though he's been asked by multiple Outlets to do several debates or at least give me a little more time in an hour because he needs closed captioning which means when I speak because he's unable to understand or process the words that I'm saying apparently he needs to have it on closed caption so he's going to read the questions and then ultimately answer them I think for the voters of Pennsylvania this is an issue of transparency we're trying to figure out is he able to do the job of a U.S senator and Pat Toomey who's been on several events with me has over and over again said you guys are going for my job I know what it takes to be a U.S senator you have to be able to debate to answer questions and closed captioning doesn't exist on the senate floor so we've also asked them to release his medical records which again he's fuse over and over again despite multiple different Outlets asking it in fact now demanding it of him Senator cotton why are you on the campaign Trail for Dr Oz today Steve I'm back in the Keystone State because Dr Oz will be a great United States senator for the people of Pennsylvania he's been traveling all over the state he loves so much I think one episode earlier uh in this campaign Trail really contrasts the differences between him and John fetterman Dr Oz visited a open-air drug area in Philadelphia talking to the addicts trying to understand how they became hooked on these drugs trying to get them help that's the kind of compassion Dr Oz will bring to the United States Senate John Federman on the other hand wants to release violent criminals from jail wants to keep our Southern border wide open that would just flood Pennsylvania with more drugs from cartels or as part of Dr Oz's tour across the state later today we're going to be at a natural gas facility Pennsylvania has the opportunity to provide thousands and thousands of good high-paying jobs for its workers and to help get energy prices under control in this country that's what Dr Oz will do in the United States Senate John fetterman said he wants to ban fracking which should only only do more to drive up Energy prices and cost Pennsylvania's pennsylvanians thousands of good high-paying jobs Dr Oz so cotton just did a good job laying out uh John fetterman's positions uh they are you know they're uh obviously there's a clear choice between your positions and his positions on a myriad of issues why is he ahead of you right now according to the real clear politics uh average of uh polls throughout the Keystone State he's got he's at 46.2 you're at 42.8 what why so close well it's a toss-up I've in fact when it comes to the most recent polls and the reason it's even close is because the Democrats have poured a ton of money into the Commonwealth mostly from California and New York they think they can buy the 51st senate seat they don't know anything about uh John Federman they don't realize he's far to the left of Joe Biden they don't realize that he would advocate for the kinds of changes in America that none of us want to see and conservative Democrats are going to break for us we're getting the independence already that's why we're going to win this race if you're concerned about money in Pennsylvania you should be please go to Dr oz.com and contribute because it helps a lot we're using it very frugally but we will win this race because of crime because fetterman believes that we should legalize all drugs which is a crisis in a state where fentanyl deaths are top five in the country and because of inflation which fetterman has advocated for even more spending even more of the Reckless spending of our children's money than Joe Biden's Administration has accomplished sure uh and Senator cotton before you go at the top of the program we were talking about how Republicans are spending 150 million dollars in ads to remind people about inflation and the Democrats the New York Times had an item yesterday the Democrats uh essentially gave away two trillion dollars worth of stimulus money but they don't want to talk about that because that Republicans say is where inflation came from well that's exactly where inflation came from Steve and inflation is devastating the budgets of Pennsylvania's families John fetterman uh will be a rubber stamp for Joe Biden's agenda and that agenda has driven this inflation by spending trillions of dollars we don't have and driving up the price of energy costs for Americans a vote for John fetterman is a vote for Joe Biden and more inflation a vote for Dr Oz is a vote for stable prices a growing economy Safe Streets and a strong America all right I got a feeling if you lived in Pennsylvania I think I know who you would vote for Senator Tom Cotton we thank you very much Dr Oz thank you as well

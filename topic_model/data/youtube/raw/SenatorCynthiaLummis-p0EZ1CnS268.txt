chairman and thank you ranking member capito for uh hosting this hearing and uh Senator Kramer and I have been sitting here uh proud of our two states and their leadership in carbon capture utilization and storage there's been a lot of Forward Thinking in your state mine from policy leaders the University of Wyoming School of energy resources the Wyoming Energy Authority have been involved with you all in North Dakota and you're making real genuine progress substantive goals are being met thank you for that so my first question is for Mr Haru um thank you for your testimony I understand from Dr Holly krukka at the University of Wyoming that uh in a few days we'll be calling you Dr Haru so congratulations on that um I want to focus on one aspect of ccus with my questions and that's geological storage uh Mr how are you you mentioned in your testimony one of the challenges to expanding geological storage is the complicated legal and Regulatory regime around poor space ownership and long-term stewardship so can you talk a little more about what North Dakota and Wyoming have done to address these challenges particularly around long-term stewardship thank you for the question Senator Lewis um yes uh um North Dakota and Wyoming have a had a wonderful working relationship for a long period of time and uh um I'm delighted to uh call uh uh Dr kruck friend and colleague um and our states have shared our experiences over time and uh and copied one another's successes and avoided one another's misses so um anyway it's uh always been a pleasure so with respect to long-term liability North Dakota established a long-term liability trust fund because it concerns that companies may not be around in perpetuity and the fact that a trust fund would be a reasonable way to manage any long-term stewardship associated with ccs projects so the way that this works in the state of North Dakota is companies pay into this trust fund over the life of their project and the fee is set administratively and based on it essentially you could almost contemplate it like a state-run Insurance Fund is the way I would I would look at it in North Dakota after a 10-year post-closure monitoring period where the site is carefully monitored at the expense of the project developer and operator the state is authorized to take title to that injected CO2 I believe the similar program in Wyoming has chosen a post-closure monitoring period of 20 years as the default well thanks for your explanation uh I think this is part of an the example of the forward thinking that's going on uh in uh expanding geologic storage so you know good on you good on our states and uh proud of the work you're doing so my next question is for all Witnesses should the ceq support Expediting ccus permitting as a way to encourage and support carbon capture uh so I think there there are always opportunities to to be more efficient and permitting and I think CQ and its guidance laid out some opportunities on how we can do that by Regional approaches and and other tools that they have I think that has to also be balanced with uh making sure we're doing thorough reviews and getting strong uh Community engagement in those reviews so that we get good outcomes at the end of the process so I think we can achieve both and I think that's the right direction to go I I agree very much of Mr albritton's comments I think that again that that coordination and communication both uh from all federal agencies with the states is absolutely essential to moving these projects forward these permits are extremely labor intensive we we understand that the modeling and the geophysical aspects for class six is some of the most extensive that that's out there right now so having Folks at the table working together is absolutely essential so yes thank you very much I I would concur I would uh especially urge the federal government to work toward a uh responsible means of Permitting an accident accessing Federal poor space it's a really big issue as you get to the west and uh for instance in in Senator loomis's State uh roughly half of the state is is under Federal uh poor space ownership and right now I do not see a means of accessing Federal poor space to do these kinds of projects so when we see Federal poor space on the map in North Dakota as we contemplate projects we step away from it because we just see it as more of a risk factor than an opportunity yeah great Point thank you all for your testimony

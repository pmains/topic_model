Thank You mr. chairman mr. Floyd I don't know that the cameras picked it up or saw it but when Angela talked about her brother dying I saw a physical reaction from you I saw you leaned over in your chair I thought I noticed your body even tremble with empathy and care for Angela and her brother Pat passed away if you could say anything to the people who killed Pat what would it be life is precious everybody should be able to live and be able to walk this earth to in a journey that they want to nobody should have to be filled with hatred and so much animosity that they want to kill somebody dr. King said a long time ago he wanted everybody around the world to be able to join hands together and I think right now if he was here right now he would understand that the world is united right now and we all are coming together that is so powerful and I deeply thank you for that and and I want to test that sense of unity and mr. chairman if we could get the witnesses who are joining remotely to be on the on the screen so we could see them I have a question I would like to ask everyone and I apologize for the crude nature in which I have to ask this but there's just so many witnesses if you believe that we should defund the police will you please raise your hand mister yes is there anyone on the okay so that's unifying and wonderful that here we are gathered I'm sure someone will be able to ask you that question but I've limited time here I didn't see anyone raised their hand to defund the police I certainly didn't see any the Republican witnesses and so so I'm going to now go through and and see where that sentiment may have been reflected here's a tweet from one or two of our congressional colleagues supporting this group black visions Minnesota and the next please and then here's that group that same group black visions Minnesota that might some colleagues are raising money for saying that they should we should end the police in kundo the next one and then here's that same organization retweeting rebel scum abolish the police and then here's the same group saying that instead of police we need therapists doctors and street medics not cops Mr Bond Gino in your experience every time someone calls 911 pissed or a medic be sufficient or some time do people need cops I'm quite unclear how a medic is gonna help with an armed subject who's assaulting his wife in a domestic violence situation or elsewhere I'm not sure how that's going to be of any value and here again is that same group saying that we need lasers to disorient surveillance cameras and we need water balloons filled with milk to throw at people again this is the organization that my congressional colleagues are raising money to support if we could go to the next one and then in here again that that same organization that multiple members of Congress are supporting saying it's not enough to only abolish police or prisons we need to abolish race abolish ice abolish the military abolish the state abolished the borders and again this is what our colleagues are raising money for and and I and it's not just any member of Congress it's actually one of our treasured colleagues on the Judiciary Committee of the gentlelady from Washington raising money for this very same organization miss Underwood Jacobs your brother is someone who was part of this law enforcement community when he gave his life when you learn that my colleagues in Congress are raising money for an organization that promotes defunding the police destroying our borders defunding our military and taking apart the state altogether how does that make you feel actually I find that conduct to be deplorable and we elect officials to represent everyone and the idea to have our communities without protection and safety is wrong so my my response to that would be for people to get out and vote and get the right person in office to ensure that we feel protected and our children feel protected for generations to come I appreciate that greatly mr. Floyd again I appreciate your calls not only today but in the direct aftermath of your brother's killing you showed grace and care for your fellow Americans and I you know I don't know if everyone is religious but I do believe God is working through you to try to call us together and finally I wanted to thank miss bass for the legislation she's introduced in that constellation of ideas while I think that we can fine tune elements to ensure that we don't defund the police that we don't make our communities less safe I do think there is not a legitimate defense of chokeholds or lynching or bad cops that get shuttled around and you will be able to count on Republican cooperation as we hone these ideas and hopefully pass them and get them to the President's desk Thank You mr. chairman I yield back the gentleman yields back

listening to the remarks of my colleagues I think it's important for us to learn from what we've tried in the past and so forth but the conundrum is North Korea is not easy and it will require partnership with the countries in that region in many cases we all land at the same place that China really does have to take a leadership role here china is the the one country that does have some leverage with North Korea but it will take a partnership between you know the Chinese government the Russians Japan are Korean allies along with us leadership in order to address this it is in all of our interest to deescalate tensions to try to bring North Korea into the 21st century and the other goal that I think many Koreans have of seeing reunification you know it's not going to be easy it will take world leadership it will take the nation's along with the United States in that region working together but it can be done if we put our minds to it and we have to there's an urgency of now as indicated by there there the recent North Korean nuclear tests it is complicated and you know the president talked about the threats that you know we face in the Middle East but those are not threats to our very existence as a nation and North Korea with a hydrogen bomb with ballistic missile and I've CBM capabilities are a threat to world stability and we've got to direct this there is the urgency of now and mr. Chairman I look forward to working with you to kind of navigate this path forward and it's incredibly important Thank You mr. Schaben

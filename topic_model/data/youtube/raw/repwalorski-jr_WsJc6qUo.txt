 LADY FROM INDIANA, JACKIE  WALORSKI. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE  GENTLEWOMAN FROM INDIANA IS  RECOGNIZED. MRS. WALORSKI: I THANK MY FRIEND FOR YIELDING. FOR EVERY SINGLE PERSON BORN OR  UNBORN SHOULD HAVE THE  OPPORTUNITY TO LIVE THE AMERICAN DREAM. BUT THIS ABORTION ON DEMAND BILL WOULD DESTROY OUR COUNTRY'S  FUTURE. TODAY, WE'RE EMBARKING ON THE  BIGGEST STEP BACKWARD IN OUR  NATION'S HISTORY. THIS VOTE COULD BE THE MOST  CONSEQUENTIAL VOTE THAT ANY OF  US TAKE. TODAY, THE SCIENCE IS EVEN MORE  CLEARER THAN IT WAS IN 1973. A CHILD IN THE WOMB IS A LIVING  PERSON. AND YET, MY COLLEAGUES ON THE  OTHER SIDE REMAIN OBSESSED WITH  KILLING UNBORN BABIES IN THE  NAME OF FEMALE EMPOWERMENT. MANY SUPPORTERS OF THIS BILL,  LIKE ME, CALL ALL OF PRO-LIFE  AMERICANS EXTREME. I HEARD IT ALREADY THIS MORNING. BUT I HAVE SEEN EXTREME. I'VE WITNESSED THE CRUELTY OF  ABORTION AND IT'S UGLY. IN SOUTH BEND, INDIANA, A DOCTOR PROVIDED ABORTIONS FOR DECADES. WHEN HE DIED IN 2019, HIS FAMILY FOUND THE MEDICALLY PRESERVED  REMAINS OF 2,411 CHILDREN HIDDEN IN HIS GARAGE. THAT IS 2,411 HUMAN BABIES  PRESERVED IN FOR MILD HIDE IN  HIS GARAGE. IT WAS NEWS FOR WEEKS. THIS LEFT A LEGACY OF DEATH AND  DESTRUCTION. THAT IS WHAT EXTREME LOOKS LIKE. ABORTION SOLD AS HEALTH CARE IS  A SICKENING VIOLATION OF HUMAN  DIGNITY, THAT AMERICANS SHOULD  NOT AND COULD NOT TOLERATE. SO I'LL ASK THIS QUESTION --  WILL WE ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN  AGAIN? AS A NATION, WE HAVE AN  OBLIGATION TO FUTURE GENERATIONS TO REJECT ABORTION-ON-DEMAND AND FIGHT FOR LIFE. I IMPLORE MY COLLEAGUES HERE  TODAY, JOIN ME IN OPPOSING THIS  BILL AND STANDING FO

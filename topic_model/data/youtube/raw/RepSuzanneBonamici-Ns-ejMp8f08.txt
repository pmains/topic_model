thank you the gentlelady from Oregon was Bonamici Thank You mr. chairman I move to strike the last word five minutes Thank You mr. chairman we know that surprise billing is a challenging issue that can devastate families we all have heard from either our own friends and family or constituents but one thing is abundantly clear it's outrageous it's someone in need of emergency medical attention or someone who seeks care with the understanding that their insurance will cover the cost would find themselves through no fault of their own facing exorbitant bills from an out-of-network provider we all agree that we need to solve that issue providing excellent care is a driving motivation of our wonderful nurses doctors surgeons specialists and we know that they want to be practicing medicine not dealing with complicated bureaucracy or worrying about their bottom line unfortunately our health care system and the ways we pay for it are simply broken if and when we solve surprise billing this system will still be too expensive too complicated for too many Americans we must do more to protect patients and support care providers who would rather be serving those who need it most than filling out paperwork and fighting claims the legislation we're considering today is a small but important step in the right direction but we absolutely need to do more I appreciate my colleagues on this committee who have worked so hard on this issue and the chair and the ranking member and everyone who's working to solve this this issue and I do want to follow up I know chairman Scott introduced into the record the NPR story from November of 2019 and again with all due respect to my colleagues who I know work on this this issue from New York according to an analysis of data from the New York's Department of Financial Services the New York New York model is making health care substantially more expensive in the state arbiters are typically deciding on dollar amounts above the 80th percentile a typical cost we have to solve this issue of mr. chairman and colleagues I look forward to working with all of my colleagues on broader reforms that truly improve access address the drivers of cost and advance health care for all as a human right our communities and our economy do better when everyone has access so again I appreciate the work that's been done on this this is a one step in the right direction but it's not going to solve the overall problem of our health care system and I yield back the balance of my time

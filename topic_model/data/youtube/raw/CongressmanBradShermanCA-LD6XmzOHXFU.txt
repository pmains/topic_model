imagine buying a flawed automobile deciding it's a bad deal and in some jurisdictions you can just take the car back to the dealer and you get back all your money but imagine if you lived in a jurisdiction where if you take the car back to the dealer the dealer keeps the car and your money Iran may is going to keep our money we unfroze a hundred billion dollars of their money people argue about whether that's a larger or smaller than that amount we delivered over a billion dollars in currency we can renounce this deal Iran keeps the money and is then liberated from all of the restrictions on their nuclear program now I oppose this deal because the restrictions on Iran's nuclear programs or temporary but US obligations under the deal are permanent what we should be trying to do is extend and enforce the nuclear sanctions if we renounce this deal we don't extend and enforce the nuclear sanctions and restrictions on Iran we end them now there are two methods by which we can get to that bad result the first is on our minds now because it could be triggered the first stop could be on October 15th and that is the president could fail to issue the certification under the Iran nuclear review Act I think if he did that the press might overplay it but all it does is change Senate rules it says that there could be a bill that would get immediate there 60-day attention or it would get expedited attention of the Senate to reimpose one or more of the sanctions that we agreed to get rid of as part of the jcpoa and they need 50 votes instead of 60 I don't think the Senate will use that I don't think that they will impose the sanctions because I don't think they want to take back the car and let the dealer keep our money to the other way and is that we could reach the same bad result would be in January of next year because the only way that jcpoa works is for the president to issue waivers under four different at least four different sanctions bills and all of those sanctions waivers expire in the middle of next January now if the president were to fail to issue those waivers then regardless of the wisdom of Congress we would get the bad result so my hope is if the president has to do something for then based on his need to repudiate anything that mr. Obama is associated with that he would take the action that just kicks the matter to Congress and then Congress could wisely refuse to take a bad just to make a bad decision if he instead waits till January and refuses to issue these waivers not in cod as a result of congressional action but just as a result of his own action then there will be celebrations in the Islamic Republic what we need is more sanctions with European support the way we get those is as mr. Sullivan points out we're free to impose sanctions for there other evils and a number of us asked John Kerry about this in 2050 alive 2015 when he came before us I specifically asked about the central bank sanctions and he's and I said is Congress and the United States free under this Agreement to adopt new sanctions legislation that were main enforce as long as Iran holds our hostages or supports Assad I could have added or supports the Houthi er engages in terrorism his response was we are free to adopt additional sanctions as long as they are not a phony excuse for just taking the whole pot of past ones and putting them back so we have to convince the world that we are sanctioning Iran in a different way for different reasons the more we say we hate the deal and we are in the process of repudiating the deal the more the sanctions of 2017 begin to look like a phony excuse for taking the whole pot of passed one and putting them on and letting Iran argue that they are liberated from the sank that from the nuclear restrictions the more we say that we're going to live with this deal that we respect the deal and that we are imposing new sanctions because of Iran's other evils and here I want to thank the Islamic Republic because they have committed such incredible evils such mass murder in Yemen and in Syria that they will more than justify any sanctions any of us can come up with I've used my time I would ask the witnesses to respond for the record and particularly I'd like mr. Sullivan to outline what are the toughest sanctions we can impose that meet carry standard

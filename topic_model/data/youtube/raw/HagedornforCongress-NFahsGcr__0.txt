this is radio works director of news and information Justine wet track and today I'm talking to Jim Hagedorn who is the Republican candidate for Congress in Minnesota's first District and I haven't talked to you for a while so welcome back it's nice it's great to be here and I love nobles County in this whole area we get here as often as possible well glad you could make the trip over especially on such a cold time of year it's been awfully chilly lately so what have you been up to I'm not even sure where you want to go with discussion today it's gonna be a crazy election year and you are up against Tim Walz again it's going to be a defining election year last last time in 2014 I was on the ballot against congressman Walz we received 46 percent of the vote across this district which is 21 counties all the way across southern Minnesota so a big district like this sometimes a challenger needs to run back to back and keep building up the name and keep getting known by the folks and and what we do is we try to get out and shake hands and let people know where we stand on the issues very clearly in this is a defining election this is pretty much going to be whether the voters want a third Obama term which is what is represented with Hillary Clinton and Tim Walz or they want big bold change in Washington and I think whoever the Republican candidate for president is I'll I'll run with that person and that's what will offer the voters well I know last time i wronged you really had some serious momentum you you have things just growing in leaps and bounds so do you do you see that just continuing to grow I think so what happens is when people get a little bit more familiar with you that that helps but the issues are resonating even more so today and they're pretty much the same issues than from the last campaign when you look at what's going on around the world with the rise of Isis and radical Islam you know people are paying attention to that differently today than they did in the last election Obamacare is something that's on people's minds and their families out here going broke because their premiums are skyrocketing they're spending twenty thirty forty percent of their income and it's just not affordable and for many people the insurance is worthless because the deductibles are so high and then you look at other issues in the economy in general it's very stagnant high wage jobs are disappearing there's problems across the board with regulations I just think this is a defining election in many ways and we're going to have a have a very very stark contrast between the two political parties well let's touch on some some real basic issues just recently President Obama came out and talked about gun control and congressman Walz really didn't have much to say about it other than that he was kind of looking into the issue I don't remember what exactly his exact quote was but he really didn't have a whole lot to say about Obama's speech what were your thoughts on what President Obama had to say well I didn't like it about two hours after President Obama made his proclamation that he was going to effectively legislate from the White House and issue what I thought was an unlawful executive order on firearms we put out there that look we need we need to defend the Second Amendment and people's rights to keep and bear arms and if it's the Congress of the United States that's supposed to write our laws not the president so I was completely opposed to what President Obama is up to and you know a little very disappointed that the congressman walz has not come forward with a position he says he's carefully reviewing this I'd say look you either believe the Congress should write the laws or you don't and you either believe President President Obama is right or wrong on this issue but take a position when it comes down to basically the the last part of President Obama's presidency sometimes people refer to it as kind of the the redundant part of his eight years do you think he has the time or the ability to pass something like that well unfortunately what's what's happened is we have a president that's kind of gone rogue where he's just decided he's going to take it upon himself to issue proclamations from the White House not not work it through the legislative process look what he's done on immigration trying to give amnesty to 5 million or more illegal aliens who are here unlawfully rather than go through the process he circumvents the Congress in that way he's done it on a number of EPA regulations that have come out against farmers and businesses where he and is shut down the coal industry basically with with reg that the Congress never supported I'm that's why I'm for regulatory reform the Congress should be in charge of writing the rules they should be in charge of writing the laws not the president and the executive agency bureaucrats so we need to get back to what works in our country and and some of that is the rule of law and following the Constitution in the process so we need strong leaders in Washington they're going to step up against President Obama and others who would recklessly use their office against the people you had mentioned Isis before and during the last election the last time that you were running it wasn't quite at the crisis level I guess I'll say that it is now have your thoughts or ideas changed on what we need to do about that yeah I think in the last election what you saw was people were just starting to figure out that Isis was becoming a huge threat globally now we know it's a threat in the United States there's a thousand ongoing FBI investigations for Isis and other types of radical Islamic terrorists when you look at what's happened in the Middle East this week foreign policy of President Obama foreign policy that congressman Walz has supported a hundred percent it's a disaster effectively Obama has lost the war in Iraq that Bush had one and because when when President Obama took over in 2008 we had a relatively stable Middle East with very pro-american or neutral actors throughout and they've gone and destabilized Iraq and Syria they've destabilized Egypt and eamonn and of course Libya look at that war that Hillary Clinton prosecuted against Gaddafi has been a complete disaster it's given us all these refugees that are infiltrating Europe coming into the United States causing problems the rise of Islamic extremism whether it's Isis or Al Qaeda or al-shabaab Boko Haram it's it's it's horrible and then of course the slaughter of Christians and the loss of prestige so I think we need to get back to elekton people a president people in Congress that are going to give us Reagan's peace through strength policy that means projecting out strength standing for American values standing for our allies but it doesn't necessarily mean mean ground wars around the world you know look at Reagan defeated the Soviet Union and he didn't commit one troop to that effect he supported our allies and he projected out strength and got it done that's what we have to get back to so then when you start talking about immigration in general are there any kind of ties between those two or are you looking at two different subjects no that's they're very well-connected I mean the first responsibility of anyone who's going to serve in Congress serve in Washington DC the first responsibility is to defend the United States and protect the American people and I think one of the primary ways we do that is we have to secure America's borders once and for all that hasn't been done we have President Obama and congressman Walz with an open borders policy it's a disaster look at the millions of people who have overstayed visas we don't even know who they are where they are we're not doing anything about getting them out of our country and now we're bringing in hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people this has been that what's been going on with Obama hundreds of thousands of people from Muslim countries that that hate America and it's catching up with us we're not they're not properly vetted and that's why I've called for a complete timeout on future refugees coming to the United States until we can figure out how to deal with this because we have a terrorist recruiting problem an Islamic terrorist recruiting problem in Minnesota already from existing refugees and that's not for me that's from the president's own US attorney in Minnesota who said those things so we need to we need to step up and start defending this country and protecting the American people well if I can play devil's advocate here for just a moment what about when you look at the refugees themselves who just need need a home and are living in these war-torn countries where they're they're just desperate yeah I know it's it's a sad deal I I'm for having safe zones over there and doing everything that we can to provide them an opportunity to live safely and hopefully get back to their country but you know we want to help people around the world to help their countries be more like America we don't necessarily want America to become more like other countries and and that look the United States spend the most generous country around the world as far as accepting immigrants and refugees so the concept that maybe at this point given the threat of radical Islam giving all the investigations and the problems we have of taking a time out and trying to figure out what works for our country you know that that's not being a bad actor around the world that's just trying to be protective of our country at these critical times so you're not saying nobody's ever coming in again you're saying it's time to just maybe stop take a deep breath and figure out a process yeah because I mean let's face it there are a lot of people coming into the country and President Obama's plan over the next year alone is to is to grant 300,000 visas to people from countries that frankly hate us in the Middle East and elsewhere and you know is that the right thing to do when we see that people have been taught and have very radical attitudes and come here sometimes as refugees sometimes immigrants sometimes people on visas like the lady in San Bernardino and you know the intent is to harm us to wreck our country to do everything they can to project out their ideology and the superiority of their religion and so I think we have we have to be honest about that and I'm not afraid to address the issue all right again we're talking to Jim Hagedorn the Republican candidate for Congress in our first District here in Minnesota are there any other subjects that you wanted to hit upon today Jim no I think in general this is a pretty important election where we're going to have an opportunity to decide we're going to have more government in our lives more washington DC control I'm for really bold reforms out there I mean regulatory reform tax reform and a lot of this is predicated upon I think Washington DC needs to get back its authority we have to take the power from the bureaucrats the politicians the interest groups and give it back to the states and the people something like tax reform that means the people should be deciding how to spend save and vest hold their own money not those interest groups and those politicians that are trying to get them to spend in certain ways in order to promote what they think is right so the more we can get to that the better country we're going to have the better it's going to be for our family and hopefully we'll get back to being able to create some high wage jobs to help people live better lives here in southern Minnesota and elsewhere all right well I think it's going to be a very interesting election year and we wish you the best of luck in it I'm sure we will talk to you again before the election thanks for your time Justine

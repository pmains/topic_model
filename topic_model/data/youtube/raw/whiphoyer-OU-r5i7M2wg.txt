let me say at the outset we ought to both put sanctimony aside both sides are accusing one another of closing down the government mr. speaker you voted to close down the government and then you voted against opening up both sides have accused the other of doing what they have done now the fact of the matter is ladies and gentlemen we are here because we have not succeeded in being the appropriation bills and sending them to the president that is why you need a continuing resolution my Republican friends are in charge of the house and my Republican friends are in charge of the Senate and they are in charge of the White House we have not passed a single appropriation bill my view is we have not done so because we have been unwilling to compromise that's what this is about it's about Republicans frankly being unwilling in our opinion to work together to get to agreement we don't want this shutdown our Republican friends are saying they don't want the shutdown and we've said from the beginning that we're ready to work across the aisle to prevent it in fact Republicans have had four opportunities 100 percent of the Democrats voted for a 90-day CR to give us time to get to agreement on appropriations bills and a level of funding mr. speaker you know that we've been talking about there for some time we've not come to agreement and therefore we find ourselves notwithstanding the fact that we agree on a lot we have asked to adhere to parity mr. speaker as you know it is the process that you agreed with senator Murray that we have followed for the last four years all we are asking is let's follow it again that is why we're here because we have not been able to get such an agreement we have also asked that we be able to protect at the request of the President of the United States dreamers put something on the floor as he said and send it to him and he sign it we want to reauthorize the chip program in the community health centers and other health programs we agree on that the American public has got to be so distressed that they see this going on on this floor of the house we want to provide disaster relief to those in Texas those in Florida those in Puerto Rico those into the Virgin Islands and yes those who have been subjected to fires in the West one additional minute at least one let me give you one and a half the gentleman from Maryland's recognized for an additional 1 and 1/2 minutes I thank my friend the presiding officer and the timekeeper I urge my Republican colleagues who are in the majority and control the legislative process end this shutdown use the authority you are asking for under this rule to bring to the floor the items on which we agree Mr Speaker you have said you would do that take the tough issues head-on one at a time I admired that statement I will tell my friend the Speaker of the House that I will environment more the performance speaker Ryan said in 2012 we will not duck the tough issues we will not kick the can down the road we will lead we will not blame others [Applause] Mr Speaker I ask you to do just that stop ignoring the responsibility as the majority party to keep the government open and serving the American people now Mr Speaker I ask unanimous consent to bring up HR 487 to the end of shutdown act of 2018 a continuing resolution through Tuesday that would immediately reopen government while negotiations continue on a budget agreement that adheres to parody reauthorizing the children's health insurance program and other critical health care programs addressing the issue of dreamers as was requested by the President of the United States and providing assistance to Americans impacted by natural disasters as the as the Minority Whip must surely know the time dedicated in this debate is for debate purposes only missile the question is to the gentleman from Texas would he yield for that purpose I would not the gentleman from Texas does not yield and as such the request cannot be entertained mr. speaker can i holla man to inquire the normal status inquiry I am stretching the parliamentary inquiry the nature of this but did the speaker hear mr. meadows objecting to my unanimous consent request request was not even entertained the gentleman from Texas is recognized mr. speaker at this time I'd like to yield three minutes to this

Thank You Madame president this week General Motors is set to lay off thousands of workers in Lordstown Ohio and around the country tomorrow was the day that most of the first shift lose their jobs several months ago the second shift lost their jobs a couple of years ago the third the third shift lost their jobs totaling about 4500 human beings with families what's the president's response he boasts nonsense and rub salt in these workers wounds last week he said these were his words as if he didn't know about Lordstown and Hamtramck in other places he said we have car companies up opening up in Michigan and Ohio in Pennsylvania in so many other places unquote I don't know where those mystery factories are in ohio that the president brags about they aren't in Lordstown where people are about to lose those jobs presidents Trump's remarks his uncaring feelings his ignorance of even knowing what's happened in Ohio the state that he seems the most credit for his victory his remarks are a slap in the face to the workers and the fact that he hasn't that he's done nothing to help think about the workers who are out of a job at the end of this week think about their families think about the other families in Lordstown that are about to lose customers senator Portman and I spent a lot of time working with General Motors visiting a restaurant near the plant talking to the workers there who know their jobs are affected as fewer Lordstown workers come to that restaurant multiply that hardware store police and fire jobs and teacher jobs and all that afflict the valley moaning Valley when GM does what it does remember what Donald Trump promised people in communities like lungs Youngstown he said he'd fight for them he'd fight for their jobs last year he told the people the Mahoning valid morning Valley's Youngstown Warren Lordstown that area he said don't move these are these are the president's words don't move don't sell your house we're gonna fill up those factories or rip them down and build new ones then he said we never again will sacrifice Ohio jobs in those in other states to enrich other countries think about that the president's comes in in the midst of these GM layoffs and said don't sell your house don't move we're gonna fill those factories up we're gonna rip them we don't fill them up we're gonna rip them down and build new ones they went on to say workers will come back jobs will come back from these country then even when I called him and talk to him about the second shift layoffs you didn't even know about it not sure what his staffs telling him maybe Fox doesn't cover these stories but the mainstream media does these are real stories these aren't political opinions 4500 people lost their jobs and the president doesn't seem to know or care those weren't the only promises he made over and over again candidate Trump president then president Trump promised American autoworkers he'd fight for their jobs in Warren just a few miles from from Lordstown in 2016 if I'm elected you won't lose one plant I promise you that if I'm elected you won't lose one plant I promised you that in Michigan fall of 2016 another state with all-out auto jobs will bring back your auto manufacturing business like you've never seen it before February 2017 he promised again a lot of jobs are going to come back into Ohio in Michigan and Pennsylvania and all the places have been hurt so badly in March 2017 the assault on the American auto industry believe me is over last year after GM announced the layoffs he said Ohio is going to replace these jobs in two minutes Ohio's gonna replace these jobs in two minutes well first of all why would he say this stuff second does he not ever follow the news does his staff not tell him what's happened in the seventh largest state in the country the country the state that he in part credits for his electro you know he lost it elect he lost the popular vote by three million votes he won the electoral college because of Ohio and because of a couple of others two or three other states but wouldn't he'd know this is going wouldn't he know that a valley of 450,000 people just lost during his time since the election has lost 4500 jobs just in that plant alone in another 5,000 manufacturing jobs that make the components that go into the Chevy Cruze and another five to six to eight to 10,000 jobs nobody knows for sure how many he will lose in restaurants and hardware stores and car dealerships and in cuts in in public dollars because there's a the local governments have lost tax revenue so fewer police and fire and street cleaners and people that work in the cities and the counties and in the school districts the work mr.president the workers who are going to be out of a job by this week are still waiting these people trusted him President Trump did really well in the election and this valley of 450,000 people he did really well he did better than he didn't better than then Republicans ever do but what did he do for them after he made those promises instead of working to save their jobs he turned around and this this is this is one of these statements I'm gonna make that is provably true but doesn't even almost doesn't even make sense that it could be his tax bill says if you do your production in in in Lordstown Ohio you pay a 21 percent tax rate but if you move your production to Mexico you pay a ten and a half percent tax rate so in other words because of Trump's tax law that frankly mr. president was written down the hall here in Senator McConnell's office but with the president's signature on it under the president's tax law these companies get a 50 percent off coupon for moving overseas think about that these companies they move over soon as they get a 50 percent off coupon on their taxes I talked to the president about that I asked him to reconsider that law and he said where'd that poured that law come from and I said well it was president it was in your tax bill and you signed it and then I talked about the American jobs American car American Jobs Act how he could fix this and it's it's it's here here's what the bill does customers who buy cars made in the US get a 3500 discount dollar discount at the dealership if the American car is electric or a plug-in hybrid they get an even bigger discount these are the cars GM says it was going to start making instead of the Cruze there's no reason they can't make them in Lordstown instead of Mexico second companies that that cut the number of American jobs they had on the Jay the GOP tax bill passed if they move those jobs overseas they lose their tax break so they lose their tax breaks they lose that 50% off coupon under my bill the American cars American Jobs Act and then that money that they have to pay because they lose their tax break goes to car consumers at the dealerships meaning they'll buy more American cars so what will happen is will actually do what the but Canada Trump said he wanted to do and promised that he would do is that is bring bring American jobs back but you know there's phony populism this president that says you know I'm the workers best friend I fight for these jobs well it's this kind of phony populism but you know something Madam President populism is never racist populism is never anti-semitic populism doesn't divide people populism doesn't push people down to lift people up populism doesn't give tax cuts to rich people and then turn around and cut Medicare and headstart populism fights for people fights to lift all workers up that's what we're not seeing here now so I'm calling in the president again to try keeping his promises and actually fighting for auto workers fighting for these communities like Lordstown helped us pass the American cars American Jobs Act 10 in the tax cut for corporations to shut down American plants it moves jobs overseas take this coupon away this 50% off coupon that some of the richest people and biggest corporations in this country enjoy when they send jobs overseas because if you love your country you fight for the people who make it work

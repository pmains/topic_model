Mr chairman this being on this committee is like a wicked Indulgence because we get to uh ask you questions as some of the most Cutting Edge brilliant people in our country and as I looked at your uh bios I'm just extremely impressed with your capabilities Dr Albritton I I have a question for you that I'm going to uh start with and then I want to go to Mr lupian who is at the University of Wyoming um Dr albrin I'm interested to hear about projects in your specialty that you're working on um it it you have such an impressive background are you me personally or at the University of Washington ether or both uh so me personally I'm a biomedical engineer by the way uh but I advocate for the entire college and I can give a wonderful example about how AI needs more cultural context I work on digestive diseases in the intestinal tract Google is always offering me digestive AIDS and other remedies because it can't distinguish what's research and what's an actual physical problem so that's what I do and a lot of Entrepreneurship but my major job now is really as Chief advocate for the College of Engineering and the fabulous part is I get to learn as you said it's it's wickedly fun I learn about Quantum information I let her learn about great battery storage we have a new technology Senator Cantwell was talking about our test bed facility called qt3 that we're trying to roll out at the University of Washington where anyone can come in and play with a cubit the students can it's just amazing fun and excitement to learn about other things like our AI centers AI for social good really trying to make our technology benefit humankind lead to allow people to live Better Lives it's just super fun job so um thank you yeah this is an outstanding panel and a great subject I want to turn to Mr lupient thank you for joining us today and representing some of the Cutting Edge work happening at the University of Wyoming my alma mater I want to start by asking you to explain distributed Ledger technology and how it can be used in many different Industries and and sectors and also could you take us into what you see as the future of distributed Ledger technology well I thank you Senator um that's a that's a very big question for um a couple of minute uh answer distributed Ledger technology um as I mentioned my testimony is really just a new type of database unlike my uh colleagues on the panel who are dealing with high performance Computing applications in Quantum and AI blockchain is actually not a high performance Computing application it is an applied application that um that will touch um pretty much everything that we do in our daily lives very much like we're experiencing today with the internet and um where we're gonna see the future Senator I believe is um how how value is going to be moved much more easily electronically around the world and um you know we're going to be able to move value um almost instantly and with settlement finality that doesn't exist in our existing Financial systems today which are based on you know netting balance sheets to to move value well you know we're going to move actual value and where I really see the future Senator is how digital assets are going to drive some new technologies such as the metaverse and you know it within the metaverse which is the way I basically describe it is you know kind of the internet on steroids it's going to be a a an immersive use of the internet uh well digital assets are going going to drive that drive that technology it's it's how we're going to be paid within the universe it's how we're going to buy things within the metaverse and so I think that's the that's the exciting part of where this is going but you know blockchain technology itself is kind of in its you know entering its bread and butter stage where um you know it will be doing a lot of things for for consumers in industry and our financial services industry where we don't even realize that that technology is what's driving the back of the house so I hope that answered your question um um Senator lemus thank you and I have only five seconds to spare so I will yield back but if there's another round I I find this a fascinating panel and I want to thank you all for taking the time to be here

[Applause] well thank you very much uh administrator uh for a gracious introduction and i will tell you regardless of who gave you what longitude and latitude as to what you are in southern new jersey there is no doubt about that so uh maybe if you go by woodbridge there's a debate but in any event but it's not a debate here so it's great to be back in cape may with the mayor mayor good to see you our neighboring community commissioner thank you for joining us to all of the officials who are here to the chairman thank you for joining us in the vice chair thank you for joining us as well as well as to all the hospital staff which we'll hear from some of its leadership in a moment or two and please give my condolences to the president uh for her loss let me start by thanking jaina celta who is our state director of a fabled family in southern new jersey and we are so proud of the work she is doing at usda for us and mr joaquin who is the usda regional housing administrator these two representatives make it incredibly possible for us to achieve what we are achieving today let me first start off by saying we are able to do this because we had to fight for the designation of what was rural when i came to the senate uh and visited southern new jersey i was told consistently how we could not get the monies because we were not defined under the usda definition of what rule is and i said how's that possible and new jersey was seen as a whole and of course if you think about newark or jersey city you don't think rural but if you're here in cape may and in other parts of our state it is rural and the definition basically did not allow us to qualify for these monies so i went to work changed the definition and we are here today so i'm glad that we are here today to celebrate uh cape regional health system i'm glad we're here to celebrate cape regional's health system and its 989 thousand three hundred dollars usda emergency rule health care grant it's funding that is incredibly important an enormous benefit to the community the cape regional will use this grant to purchase new diagnostic equipment think ct scans x-rays ultrasounds that will reduce waiting times for patients and their families as part of a new nine-bed treatment way to support the emergency and radiology departments it'll allow cape regional to better serve dealing with the continuing challenges of the pandemic we have with covet patients as well as other seeking critical care these are crucial upgrades all part of our effort to ensure that every new jerseyan from our cities up north to small towns like made down south can access the high quality health care facilities they deserve it should not matter what zip code you live in you should have high quality health care and the facilities that can deliver it now let me just say a few words about this grant program the emergency rule health care grant program which in my view is a prime example of government at its best we have a problem in our country the declining availability of rural health care providers since 2010 we've seen more than 100 rural hospitals across the nation close their doors leading residents to travel further and further away to access care so imagine for a moment that you're facing a medical emergency and the closest hospital or clinic is 45 minutes or more away or even further imagine that you're one of new jersey's rural providers dedicating to providing care but that for technical reasons you're not recognized as a rural hospital despite facing the same challenges as sister hospitals in other states that's unacceptable that's why i successfully fought for a rule floor fix that brought uh care of this entity cape regional over two million dollars for fiscal year 22. it's how we define payment for rural hospitals again we were not included and we changed that in the law as a member of the senate finance committee hospitals like cape regional are vital members of our community the services and care they provide are invaluable and when cobit first landed it hit rural providers like cape regional especially hard putting them under financial stress unlike anything we've ever seen in 2020 after not receiving funds from the provider relief fund which is a provision of the american rescue plan that i authored which basically provided assistance to hospitals throughout the state cave regional didn't get anything and we went to work and successfully fought for seven million dollars for cape regional so we're thrilled of the things that we have been able to do to make sure that this hospital can continue its high quality delivery of service to the people in this area programs like the provider relief program and usda's emergency rule healthcare grant program are critical they provide necessary funding to hospitals like cape regional helping them meet the challenges we face today while also expanding services for the community and as part of the american rescue plan which i was privileged to vote for with my democratic colleagues which congress passed and president biden signed last year these grants have helped facilities expand their covet testing and vaccine programs improve telehealth to reach patients where they are invest in collaborative efforts that ensure the long-term sustainability of rural health care which brings me back to my point about this program being an example of government at its best i think that's a true statement why we faced a crisis during the pandemic in terms of providers and their staffs being pushed to the limit i just saw a bunch of the nurses and the doctors i recently had a shoulder operation so i really appreciate nurses and doctors i can tell you that you worked overtime against unprecedented odds to the liver care to those who needed it the most and now almost two and a half years after covert started we still have a responsibility to help we have a responsibility to ensure our hospitals have the resources they need to meet ongoing and future healthcare challenges a responsibility to ensure that every american no matter who they are or where they live can access life-saving treatment when they need it a responsibility to support rural communities like cape may through thick and thin when they need it the most that's why we're proud to join together to announce this emergency rural health care grant the cape region today 989 000 makes a difference we would have liked to have rounded it up to a million but when i would take what we can get it makes a real difference for the providers and the doctors are on the front line and it makes a difference to most importantly to their patients and their families who depend on facilities like cave regional to care for them when they need it the most so with that i'm happy to turn it back alternate to mr peratsky on behalf of the hospital to say a few words please join us

for some time now welcome to the show your be great to have my care we're talking this morning about tax reform and overhauling the tax code jumpstart America program tell me first off what are the goals of it well jumpstart America is a program we put together to begin to empower small business owners and moms and dads to be able to frankly make some money and small businesses to hire people what we talk about doing is we talk it we've talked we've tried a lot of things here at last couple years that haven't worked we got an economy that's got 47 million people on food stamps 48 million people 1864 age group at work one day 12 months we got a problem so we empower small business owners to do some things we cut the corporate income tax we cut to personal income tax we cut the cap gains the dividends tax we do a totally of inheritance tax which we've already passed out of the house we cut the payroll tax in half for employees and employers we allow one hundred percent to write off sun on purchases that business me businesses may make which will empower small businesses to hire people make money we're consumption-driven nation America needs to consume and I believe it will put people back to work get our economy going again because Main Street America is not back wall street's doing great but main street of which I'm a Main Street guy owned businesses and they need some help and this is the way to get it done those small mom-and-pop shops that really make up right here the business of Texas the business of America congressman you've been very busy over the last few weeks tonight you have a big meeting on the overhaul as well as tomorrow and coming into the next few weeks what are you hoping to get from your constituent in terms of information feedback well we're talking to our constituents all over our district goes all the way from Burleson Texas down to wimberley and as diverse as this district is the one thing that people really want to talk about is the economy how to put people back to work again fix the economy and let the American Dream take over as opposed to what I say the American scheme which I think we're involved in now so we're talking about that putting people to work getting people to where they can maybe own their own business one day but realize how great this country is and we're doing great in Texas but we can even do better the last question on this topic here on the US tax code has not been overhauled since 1986 there are many changes since and what are they and why the overhaul well it's a 70,000 page document and people don't know where they are and that and frankly the system promotes cheating it's real unfriendly we need to make it easier we need to let people realize to go make money pay your taxes then it from the government standpoint let people know where their taxes are going we got an 18 trillion-dollar debt we're going to go further in debt it appears and so we've got to fix the spending in Washington and create the cash flow in America so looks like any other business so we can create prosperity and opportunity in this country congressman I want to transition over to the story that has been in the headlines dominating the news for the last few months which is the Iran nuclear deal Congress gets back in session next month where do you think our representatives and our senators will begin with this issue well this sir Randy L is probably the worst deal since Neville Chamberlain a world war two it's really sells America down the road to the enemies I don't think the deal will pass the house I'm almost sure it won't sure what'll happen the Senate I don't think we'll pass the Senate President Obama has said he'd veto it and so forth but the deal is a bad deal I mean to make a deal with people it says depth Americans death to Israel is not a good starter for me I believe in sanctions I think sanctions were working so it's a deal that we need to try to not make happen it's just not good for the world and I'll be one of the guys out front attempting to do that in the last minute that we have continuing with Iran can you not necessarily break it down for us but tell our viewers why it's so important to them to understand what is happening with this deal well what it does it it empowers it empowers our enemy I mean I ran all of a sudden now it gets 150 billion dollars in sanctions relief its cash there now can go out and sell oil to the rest of the world which we can't even do in America it opens up 27 of their banks that were shut down it has a 24-day period that they can take their nuclear assets and move or hide or whatever before inspectors get there and in many cases Americans can't even be the inspectors and it's a challenge to to Israel our only friend in the Middle East right now so it's not a good deal it was a deal cut and from a defensive standpoint not an offensive standpoint and it's like I say it's a it's a Neville Chamberlain all over again when he came back said the world we live in peace forever it's a bad deal for us we need to fix it I'm sure it'll be very busy for you the next coming months thank you so much for joining thank you perhaps we should we look forward to the news that he put out in the next few months you and we will be right back with what

time a texas army veteran is calling on president joe biden for flip-flopping in his tone and addressing the covet 19 pandemic take a listen i'm not going to shut down the economy i'm not going to shut down the country but i'm going to shut down the virus joining me now wesley hunt he's an army veteran and a u.s congressional candidate for the 38th district in the great state of texas mr hunt listen i think i'm probably like most people i want consistency in our leadership and more importantly i do want them to react to new information but it seems to me this is a bridge too far for a lot of people what say you of course it is and today since obama administration we've had two million illegal immigrants enter our country and if you ask me we don't need a booster shot we need a booster wall now i recall a tweet from president biden criticizing president trump when we were at 200 000 deaths to the covet and right now we're sitting at over 400 000 deaths during his presidency and last i checked we have not seen his resignation we can all agree on one thing and that this is actually a state's issue it's not a federal issue but there's a very different tone from candidate biden to president biden and yet and still he is still trying to enforce vaccine mandates at the federal level on small businesses there's a constant contradiction in the hypocrisy is nauseating well what's interesting too is you point out this attempt to federalize some of it and yet the administration is now admitting there is no one-size-fits-all solution to this circumstance and we had a conversation with a researcher yesterday and she basically said look we're all going to have to in one form or another live with this we have to learn to manage it better when you look at what the administration is doing in particular you mentioned we have seen a massive number of individuals come over the border and to say nothing of those who've been intercepted are they being tested are they being vaccinated i mean this is a real health crisis for the people in your state it most certainly is and look kovit is here to stay but but president biden and vice president harris politicized this thing from the very beginning if you recall when they were running for president when he was running for president he said that they weren't going to take a vaccine if it originated from the trump administration so you wonder why people have vaccine hesitancy at this point but you're absolutely right about illegal immigrants we haven't tested them they don't have mass mandates they don't have vaccine mandates so why would we expect more from our taxpaying american citizens than from people that are entering this country illegally people are actually awake this is why i'm running for united states congress to make sure that we take back the house and stop the bleeding and end this hypocrisy wesley hyundai texas congressional candidate from the lone star state let me ask you this if there's an overarching message i think a lot of people are obviously concerned about crime they're concerned about the border they're concerned about american sovereignty there's so many ways you can go and your candidacy if there's one issue that you want to hammer home as you try to convince the people in your state to support your candidacy for office what would that be it's our constitution it's freedom and there's a reason why the populations here in texas and in florida are growing exponentially because people are actually flocking to states where they're allowed to make their own decisions make their own choices about their health based on what their physician tells them to do and also decide what's best for their children what are we going to teach our children and how are we going to continue to remain in a free state and abide by the greatest document ever created outside the bible and that's our constitution and that's what i am running and that's why i am running to preserve that right for all of us and every tax paying citizen here in this country u.s congressional candidate for the great state of texas we appreciate you spending time with us wesley hunt joining us today

i now recognize representative young kim of california who's the vice ranking member of the subcommittee on asia the pacific central asia and non-proliferation for five minutes thank you chairman mix ranking member mccall who is not here at the moment but congressman smith good to see you and thank you for holding this uh hearing and i want to thank our witnesses for joining us today the importance of accurate reporting and transparency in conflict zones cannot be overstated in helping protect vulnerable groups from further violence and enabling actors involved in resolving the conflict to make informed decisions so as we see as we have seen over the past few months journalists have been harassed barred from entering tigre and even detained for reporting on the conflict so question to you secretary goldack what is the state department doing to push for access and protection for journalists and even civilians providing necessary documentation of these atrocities thank you for the question congresswoman so um freedom of the media is obviously very important to the united states it is a fundamental right and we believe everyone should have freedom of expression and there should be freedom of media we appreciated the the steps uh frankly towards a freer media more freedom of expression that prime minister abi took when he first came into office unfortunately the situation has changed dramatically there is harassment um imprisonment of journalists and others who are seeing appear to simply be expressing their views we've seen certainly domestic journalists under considerable pressure but also international journalists so for example new york times reporter simon marks was essentially expelled the administration has uh frequently uh raised this with prime minister abi with other senior ethiopian officials we have pushed for protection for these journalists we've pushed for more freedom of the media and and and we will continue to do so um it is critically important uh as you indicate um that the people of the country have access to accurate complete reporting and that's not gonna happen in a in an environment that is uh controlled and where journalists voices are suppressed and other voices are suppressed uh thank you i would like to talk about uh the famine and humanitarian issues so i'd like to address the next question to miss charles uh um the as you know administrator of power recently said that over 900 000 people are currently experiencing famine in ethiopia we also know that the humanitarian crisis in ethiopia is not limited to starvation but also a lack of adequate civilian infrastructure and access to medical care so what are those biggest impediments to scaling up to the humanitarian response in ethiopia i'm going to give you loaded questions all at once so you can answer all at once so what is the u.s and our partners doing to overcome these impediments and push the government of ethiopia to allow for fully unfettered humanitarian access throughout the tigray region and further how much of tigre is still inaccessible by humanitarian aid and what regions or specific routes and can you report on existing blockages to humanitarian aid in recent weeks thank you for those questions the the biggest impediment no doubt is the presence of armed actors and and the harassment of aid workers the blockage of of assistance we we welcome the unilateral ceasefire announced by the government of ethiopia yesterday we're hopeful that this could potentially provide uh the first necessary step to allow for access but we immediately need to see the lifting of the communications blackout around tigray we also need to see the amharic regional forces to remove checkpoints from the three main arteries that we need to access in order to access those that are out of reach currently there are more than a million people in tigre that are out of reach of assistance and so we need all parties to allow for unobstructed access thank you very much um secretary goldack i want to turn the attention to gerd uh grand ethiopian renaissance stem so i want to ask you what is the current impact on the ongoing fighting integrate to negotiations with egypt and sudan as they work on water projects to make up for the water loss from the nile as ethiopia feels it's gerd and what is the current status of these negotiations thank you congresswoman um so uh efforts are ongoing by um the administration and by others um to uh assist the parties to reach uh an agreement on the grand ethiopian renaissance dam um it it is a technical uh solution that's needed we believe that there are technical ways to address um the the interests of ethiopia sudan and in egypt the challenge has been the absence of political will at the leadership level we have been engaged directly with the african union which is leading the effort we've been engaged with the uae which has been providing some very useful support and assistance for the negotiations and we're going to continue to to press for a resolution of of the the dispute over the dam and as i indicated we believe it is possible to reach a technical solution that satisfies the needs of all the parties general ladies time is a

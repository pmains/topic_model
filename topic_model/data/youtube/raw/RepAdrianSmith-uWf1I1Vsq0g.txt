Thank You mr. Speaker I rise today in support of HR 63 the increasing access to lower premium plans Act and expanding health savings accounts Act this bill gives all Americans the option to purchase a catastrophic plan if they so choose which under current law is restricted to a limited population this bill will increase health insurance plan and pricing options as we continue our work to address the underlying problems of Obamacare Nebraskans continue to tell me that they are desperate for more options to buy health insurance for their families we are down to only one insurer in Nebraska in Nebraska's exchange and with premiums for a family which can exceed $30,000 before even factoring in four and five figure deductibles families need more options Nebraskans need more options the way to create access to health care for more people is by understanding better the buyer-seller relationship if you want to reduce cost through increasing participation whoever is doing the selling must create products the consumers willing to buy the more barriers are wedged between the buyer and seller the more transparency and competition will decrease and the more health care costs for consumers will increase it is obvious the Obama care policies which have restricted choice through one-size-fits-all requirements for insurance products continue to fail and this bill will help give Nebraskans and all Americans the choices they need and deserve I think miss Kraus mr. Roskam for bringing us this bill I urge support and yield back the balance of my time

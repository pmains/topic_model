mr. president i chair the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and in that capacity I want to take just a couple of minutes to speak against the to me amendment that's amendment 115 that would slash in effect the biofuels program at the Department of Defense and of course we are going to hear that this will save money that with the sequester in a very tough set of financial circumstances president of the Senate knows all too well the argument will be we cannot afford to have this biofuels program in the Department of Defense my argument mr. president would be we cannot afford not to have this program and I'm going to take just a couple of minutes and try to just describe why that is the case right now the Department of Defense is the single largest user of energy in our country with annual fuel expenditures in excess of sixteen billion dollars so you have this massive need for energy at the Pentagon really a thirst for energy at the Pentagon and fluctuations and global energy prices have in effect enormous effects on defense spending every ten dollar increase in a barrel of oil cost the american military annually an extra 1.3 billion dollars now for some time there has been a recognition among military experts and some are in the president's home state massachusetts where they have spent a lot of time looking at these issues and there's been a recognition that the military particularly the pentagon is exactly the place where we ought to be looking for fresh innovative approaches in order to cut energy use and find alternative sources now for the life of me I cannot figure out how somehow this effort by the Pentagon let me repeat by our trees you know military has somehow been conflated into some kind of green plot some kind of plot by those who are obsessed with green energy and are simply interested in promoting programs to satisfy their ideological you know interest I can tell you mr. president that the reason this is being pursued at the Pentagon is not because this is somehow some sort of green plot some sort of subversive green plot this is being pursued at the Pentagon because they have made the judgment that these kinds of alternative fuels and supporting them is a pivotal national security matter this isn't about some kind of ideological green agenda this is about national security and their judgment is that we need exactly this kind of effort and DOD contracts are particularly crucial because they help promote research and development you know efforts what we have seen repeatedly is a lot of the most exciting alternative fuels the biofuels have enormous you know potential and the challenge is to keep driving down the cost and do it in a cost-effective kind of way that is exactly what goes on now at the Department of Defense's it relates to biofuels and it is exactly what would be undermined if the to me amendment the amendment 115 was passed and signed into into law last point I'd make is president is a Bloomberg which has a new energy finance unit a special unit that looks at these issues their analysts predict that some aviation biofuels are going to be cost competitive cost competitive with standard jet fuel in just a few years that will happen mr. president if we don't undermine current development rates in this area of biofuels at the Department of Defense that's why mr. president and colleagues I feel so strongly about opposing the to me amendment on biofuels at at the Pentagon I hope my colleagues will agree it was president with that I would yield the balance of my time and I awesomes present the absence of a quorum clerk will call the roll mr.

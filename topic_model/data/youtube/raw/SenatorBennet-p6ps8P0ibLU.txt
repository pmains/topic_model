MR. BENNET: THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. OUR AMENDMENT WOULD FORMALLY ESTABLISH THE JOINT CHIEFS PROGRAM AT USDA. I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVEN'T HEARD OF THIS INITIATIVE, BUT IT'S REALLY, REALLY IMPORTANT. AS I HAVE SAID ON THIS FLOOR BEFORE, IN WESTERN STATES LIKE COLORADO AND NORTH DAKOTA, OUR FORESTS AND OUR GRASSLANDS ARE AS IMPORTANT TO OUR ECONOMY AS THE LINCOLN TUNNEL AND THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE ARE TO NEW YORK, BUT THEY HAVEN'T RECEIVED NEARLY ENOUGH INVESTMENT OVER THE YEARS. THE RESULT IS THAT WE HAVE PEOPLE ON THE GROUND ACROSS THE WEST WHO ARE WORKING WITH INCREDIBLY CONSTRAINED RESOURCES, BUT DESPITE THERE IS BEST EFFORT THERE IS A LOT OF IMPORTANT WORK TO MAINTAIN OUR FORESTS AND GRASSLANDS THAT THEY ARE UNABLE TO DO. THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS HAVE BEEN TERRIBLE IN THE WEST. IN COLORADO, WE HAD THE THREE LARGEST WILDFIRES IN OUR HISTORY LAST YEAR. THE FIRES WERE STILL BURNING WHEN THE SNOW FELL FOR THE FIRST TIME. THAT'S NEVER HAPPENED IN ANYONE'S MEMORY. AS WE CONSIDER THIS INFRASTRUCTURE BILL TONIGHT, ONE OF THE MAJOR EAST-WEST CORRIDORS IN AMERICA IS CLOSED BECAUSE OF MUDSLIDES THAT POURED DOWN THE BURNT SCAR FROM THE WILDFIRES LAST YEAR. NOW I-70 MAY BE CLOSED FOR WEEKS. AND SO WE NEED TO DEAL WITH THIS ON THE FRONT END, AND THAT'S WHY THE JOINT CHIEFS PROGRAM MATTERS. AT USDA, THE FOREST SERVICE WORKS MOSTLY ON PUBLIC LANDS WHILE THE NATURAL RESOURCES AND CONSERVATION SERVICE SUPPORTS PRIVATE LAND. JOINT CHIEFS ALLOWS THEM TO VOTE IN A COLLABORATIVE WAY. I THANK SENATOR HOEVEN FOR HIS SUPPORT, AND I

Friday morning and about five o'clock today we passed our budget deal finally it was a very challenging bill something that really wore on my heart particularly because it added to our national debt but at the end of the day there were so many great things about this bill so many good things for Kansas I decided it was in our best interest to vote YES on it first and foremost it fully funds the military that's something that I was committed to as a candidate something that I think is our nation's top priority so for the first time in a decade we're gonna fully fund the military and I think that you know was looking the situation we lost some 80 troops last year people dying I in training accidents because partially because we're not funding our military properly so I think that's the right thing to do and next there's a significant amount of money for disaster relief and not just disaster relief for the hurricane victims but there's disaster relief for Kansas farmers and cattlemen so we're gonna go back and help those folks that were hurt by the blizzard and the prairie fire there's lots of other great things in here we're gonna help find more veterans issues we're gonna have some funding for infrastructure fund community health centers we have some funding for chip which is Medicaid for children a ten-year extension on that but what I'm really excited about is we're gonna clear the deck so we can get the farm bill done we've funded some issues regarding cotton and milk so that's gonna free up more money so we can get a farm bill done on time and fully fund crop insurance in the day the benefits outweighed my concerns about it and think that this is the right thing to do for Kansas

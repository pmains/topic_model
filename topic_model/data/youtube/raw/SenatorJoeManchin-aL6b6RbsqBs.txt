thank you mr chairman um so just real quick back on taiwan again do you believe taiwan is prepared to defend itself your evaluation of what taiwan's been doing the only thing i keep seeing we keep they want more f-16s and we think they're going to be able to go to air war with china and defend taiwan i don't think so i think i think taiwan could do more sir are you all right are you all strategically giving them different things that they can use whether it be in the sea or on land to protect their island i think i think they're in close consultation with our with our partners in indo-pacom and uh within the department of defense uh how about ukraine can can ukraine win now that we've as senator king so rightfully pointed out and senator holly followed up on we misread that one are we reading it now they have the ability to win if we continue to support without us being pulled into a land war with them on their own can they win i think that is a uh that is a difficult uh prediction to make uh right now i think where where the agency is at is a as a as a prolonged stalemate should should no factor change uh on either side in other words the russians continue to do what they're doing and we we continue to do what we're doing for the ukrainians i see that as a stalemate not necessarily how do you how do you evaluate this i'm sure you've been kept up to speed on this and evaluating them my other concerns you might want to answer is our ability to maintain and manufacture the weapons that are needed to not only help ukraine not only to backfill our allies but also keep our own supply chains up are we running critically low could it be that we could put ourselves in a dangerous situation thank you senator so i think uh a few things one is um just taking your last question first uh something we can do maybe a little bit in uh closed session is talk about not just our military assistance to ukraine but also a number of other countries that have provided military assistance to ukraine and ask the questions are we are you concerned about the ability to have the supplies that are needed for us for our allies and what ukraine is going to need to sustain and hopefully win this war so that's why i was talking about the allies piece no i'm not concerned because i think frankly between all of us there is the capacity to provide the kind of assistance that they're asking for okay and as you identify can you identify other hot spots we're very much concerned about and i'll give you other than china because we know china's challenges we have other hot spots that we're worried about could stem up or rise up during this very difficult time and the geopolitical unrest that we have in the world what would you i mean in iran north korea some of the ones you're more watching and concerning worry i uh the agency's worried about north korea for sure and their ballistic missile development timeline and as well as potential uh nuclear testing we're always we're always thinking about iran and the the actions that they have to to pull malign influence within the region against our neighbors and certainly u.s forces they're always always thinking through how to sustain partnerships to be able to keep a beat on these on these threats director haynes are you concerned about basically the tensions that we have with uae and with saudis and also their more visual movements intentional movements towards china for support or basically the wand being used now as the currency that they're accepting for payment of energy things of this sort that could also put us in a more precarious situation with uae and saudis thank you senator i mean i think obviously as you indicate we are always looking at um efforts that both china and russia make to try to make inroads with partners of ours across the world and uae and saudi arabia are examples of that in both respects cyber security is my final one for you all cyber right now semi can be just a convoluted area where people would report whether whether it's private companies in america that are getting hacked and what's going on but also who is in charge where do they go what is the chain right now within the federal government and military especially on cyber that you would consider the the premier spot that we should be working with or are we putting things together are we still so fragmented throughout our agencies i mean my experience it's gotten better over the years i mean i would never say it's perfect it is one of those things that continues to be worked through but there's a very clear chain of command with respect to taking action in the lead who takes the lead so when it comes to offensive cyber operations to defend the country obviously the department of defense does so when it comes to defending uh you know helping to defend infrastructure and critical right exactly resiliency its department of homeland security and the fbi and it's um and everybody has a role to play and we obviously support uh in the intelligence community all of them in the work that they're doing national cyber security how about the senator how do you evaluate the national cyber security center you mean the national cyber security director the new position all the stakeholders are involved in that that's why i'm saying the convoluted who who's taking the lead who is the lead person who's the lead agency yeah cisa is the main how you evaluate that i think they're doing very well yeah okay no further questions

this as the Federal Reserve this week warned a potential economic Calamity if the stalemate isn't resolved how does this end senator well it's going to end with us paying our bills we have to uh you know you get a mortgage and you decide you're sick of paying the mortgage and you uh say you're not going to pay it that ends badly and that's essentially what the Republican uh Advocates are saying about the death ceiling will default that ends badly and that will have havoc in the markets people will lose jobs Social Security checks won't be sent out our military won't be paid we can't have that happen it's just a question of whether the Republicans are going to come up with what they claim is a plan which they haven't revealed at all there's enormous division within the narrow uh majority that the Republicans have so at the end of the day we're going to raise the debt ceiling because America can't default we pay our bills but we are always willing to have a discussion about how we balance revenues and how we balance expenditures

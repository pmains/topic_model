we're following new reaction to the derek shoving murder conviction and what it means for the future of policing here in the united states for more on that we're joined by democratic congresswoman karen bass of california she's a co-author of the george floyd justice and policing act congresswoman thanks so much for joining us i know you say this verdict could help get police reform over the finish line in the u.s senate you've been working on this with republican senator tim scott where do things stat stan where do the talks stand right now well we're still in informal talks there's no formal negotiations that have begun but i just have to tell you that all of us exhaled when we heard that verdict and the energy that is there it's the type of momentum and positive momentum that i think will help get us over the finish line if the verdict had been another way it's no telling what we would be talking about right now but it certainly wouldn't be positive so i was just on the floor talking to my republican colleagues they're energized and we need to stick with it and our next step is to begin formal talks which i hope will begin soon senator scott says democrats are in his word receptive to a compromise on what's called qualified immunity which protects police officers from civil lawsuits is it enough for you that police departments could be sued but not necessarily individual police officers well you know i think it's important that we examine it but what's most important to me is that police officers have to be held accountable and qualified immunity and section 242 which is lowering the standard to prosecute officers which is why they're so rarely prosecuted those are real key components to the bill and we have to make sure that that's there that's why derek shelvin felt so cavalier about torturing george floyd to death president biden uh will address this issue it's a very important issue when he speaks before a joint session of congress next week but can any police reform pass in the senate not talking about the house in the senate with the filibuster in place can you get 10 republicans to join all 50 democrats that's what you will need well absolutely we will and i think with the leadership of tim scott and cory booker i think the stage is set for us to do that we've had very fruitful uh conversations i know that senator scott is an honest broker he is serious about getting something done and he's also committed to working with his colleagues and bringing those republican votes i can't bring the republican senators along but i do have confidence that if they will follow tim scott's lead that we will be able to get the votes we need in the senate yeah clearly he might be able to do it among his republican colleagues i'll be speaking by the way in the next hour with george floyd's brother philonus he says it's time for the senate to do its part his words and pass the bill named after his brother do you think congress will be able to deliver by the anniversary of george floyd's death next month i think we have to i don't think there's any reason for us not to put a bill on president biden's death by that but desk by that time we have been talking about this now it will be a year so there's no reason for us not to act and that's why the momentum from this verdict and frankly the positive peaceful protests have been helpful in contributing to that momentum what was it like when you and your colleagues uh heard the verdict yesterday take us into that room i know it was an emotional moment for you well it was a particularly emotional moment for me because i had i had to flash back to 1992 and rodney king and um there i was devastated at the verdict and yesterday i was just uh renewed um relieved and but i will tell you though that it was a great verdict from my uh point of view but the verdict is step one now we need to have a sentence that is the maximum sentence you know we won't really be able to relax until that happens because the few times we've seen people convicted we also have seen judges turn around and give them a slap on the risk and he just cannot do that this time he has to have the maximum sentence the world watched that crime take place and that is the only thing that will be an example of justice that maximum sentence could be up to 40 years we'll see what happens uh when he sentences in about eight weeks or so from now before you i'll let you go one final question uh congresswoman your democratic colleague maxine waters she as you well know all of us know she had urged protesters to get more her word confrontational if derek chovin was acquitted are you concerned she may have inadvertently actually given chauvin a leg up in a possible appeal i can't see how that could possibly be an appeal point and what we saw after the verdict were peaceful positive protests and not protests it was really more of a celebration so i think that would be an incredible stretch to say that's why there should be an appeal the jury was sequestered so i don't know what that would have to do with the verdict that they came to congresswoman karen bass thanks so much for joining us thanks for having me on

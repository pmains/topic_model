Thank You mr. chairman is secretary Cooper the administration has repeatedly asserted that issuing these licenses is essential to deal with an emergency in fact you said earlier in our hearing it was a policy decision by the secretary of state based on an emergency so urgent so urgent that you can't even wait for a 30-day congressional review in fact Secretary's determination on May 24th is based on exactly that finding that was the determination I would just remind you again that came three days after a classified briefing for the entire house with the Secretary of State where while it was clearly under consideration he didn't take the time to even mention it to the Congress but you've clearly made an assessment that the weapons and ordnance in these licenses are available for delivery very soon right if it's an emergency yes the ones that were direct commercial sales was order you know right but that's a that's a determine if it's an emergency to deliver these you've considered when they can be delivered right so I've got you as part of the calculus right so you've got to have specific information about when each of these items in these licenses will be available for delivery to the Saudis and Emiratis right again part of the calculus I'm just asking if you've done that have you done you've done that for each of these right yes so we from not just the Department of State's side from the near agency side regardless if there's an emergency status it's exact on the timing issue sir we actually know all right I get it I get it I've sat through this whole thing okay it is a timing issue and it's such an emergency that you couldn't wait 30 days so what I'm trying to figure out is and what I'd ask you is if you could provide the information to the committee here which we've not had an opportunity to hear from you on when these when each of these items is going to be ready for delivery I can't to say on specific on specificity on each one what I can say is if it's a dcs sale a divert commercial sale if it's already off the shelf it's going it's moving out what what is it what wouldn't be moving is if it's in a manufacturing I get it I understand okay all understand that that's what I'm asking you not I don't need you to tow me no no let me just finish I don't need you to tell me if it's manufactured it's gonna come later I want to know if this is an emergency what's the time line how long will it take not that I'll get to the other ones I'll get to the commercially made ones how long will it take to manufacture these two to produce them for delivery to your question yeah per case per case not all cases per case it is conditions-based part of it is contractually based so we can talk based on it's either going to be a few months or longer which is contributed to the emergency calculation I got you so it's a few months it's a few months or longer for all but the commercial which I'll get to that's correct months or longer so it's it's such an emergency a few months or longer for every single one of the other items but there wasn't 30 days for Congress to review you understand why that's so difficult for this institution to understand right the review never stopped congressman the Rivera's very early how there was no four come on this isn't secretary please don't you said earlier that the review is ongoing because we know about this there is no formal 30-day notice correct the informer advocate for Milotic there was no formal 30-day notice given Congress was in communication with is there a formal 30-day notice given the forms no can you direct him to answer that mr. chairman yes yes there was formal notification in the formative emergency declaration by the secretary that is not what I'm asking you and that's the problem that we have with the way this whole thing has been handled let me move on and you and you understand that assistant secretary and I don't appreciate that I don't appreciate the attempt to try to be clever and simply refuse to answer the question which is no pursuant to law you've not granted that 32 notice you've gone forward with this emergency on a list of items that none of which will be available for at least months except for the ones I'm going to talk about now and you couldn't find time to give us the 30-day notice let me talk about the commercial ones two and a half over two billion dollars of precision-guided munitions are available now is it typical for those to be manufactured before approvals is gonna be given by Congress there are gonna be items that are gonna be on the Shelf ready for any partner at any times there's I want to make sure I understand that so one company manufactured over two billion dollars of precision-guided munitions just to have on the shelf in case it was decided that perhaps they'd be available someone might have interest in purchasing them is that you're telling us there are other weapons that systems that are I understand but with respect if it's not if it's a earlier generation item it's gonna be hiding us I want to know about these two billion dollars in P GM's that are scheduled to be delivered to the Saudis in the Emir oddities by one company were these you're telling me that that company built these hoping one day to have a buyer that it wasn't part of a longer plan that it wasn't part of a discussion that the President had when he was in Saudi Arabia two years ago that none of that happened they just built them and up here we come perhaps we'll have a chance to sell them I would offer that Saudi Arabia is not the only partner that we work with in security cooperation security assistance so the the that particular item P GM's wouldn't be limited to just Saudi Arabia just I understand son time we have eight minutes seven minutes to vote and and we still have mr. al redden we we do I just don't I don't think it's too much to ask whether the assistant secretary is telling us that two and a half billion dollars over two billion dollars of precision-guided munitions manufactured to be sold to the Saudis in Emiratis weren't actually manufactured for that purpose and it's a coincidence that they're available now pending this emergency declaration I would say the the non answer does answer the question

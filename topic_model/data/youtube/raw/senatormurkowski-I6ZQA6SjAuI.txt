fairbanks is a hometown for me when i was when i was growing up here this this downtown this heart of fairbanks in the golden heart of our state was it was a pretty lively happening place but over the years we've seen the downtown just become sad it desperately needs to be revitalized the key piece to all of this is taking down a 20-year blight that has been in the center of fairbanks downtown and that's the polaris building this is the players building it's been abandoned since 2001. this site is ground zero for redevelopment in fairbanks this building had to come down how often do you come up and see a building danger asbestos this building has pcbs in it asbestos mold everything the only hope the only chance we had was from senator murkowski getting 10 million dollars appropriated through the epa to knock this building down senator murkowski cut through the red tape got us the 10 million funding to do it within one year of us meeting over it the federal government has come in and invested in our community that can be the catalyst to help others the private sector then come invest in the community so i think that 10 million will really be a great starting point for the community in general in removing that old building working with the community following their advice to be able to direct congressionally directed spending specific to this project specific to addressing this building that will allow for an economic revitalization of the heart of fairbanks something worth working towards i'm very proud of what we were able to do together you

- Hi I'm Michael Berry. You know I wish we didn't
need money in politics. I wish it could just be about ideas. And service. Who's gonna cast the best votes. Who's gonna be our
voice in Washington D.C. But unfortunately while
we get to decide who goes to Washington D.C., D.C.
thinks that they should decide for us who we send. Well that's not gonna happen this time. They're flooding this district with money. They're saying awful
things about Dan Crenshaw. I know Dan Crenshaw. Dan Crenshaw is a patriot. He served this country
wearing our uniform, he served this country as a Navy seal, and he will serve this country as a United States Congressman
with your support. We need your vote, unfortunately
we need some financial help as well. Any amount will make a big difference. Go to Crenshawforcongress.com. Any amount that you can
contribute, tell the swamp they can't buy this district.

Thank You mr. chairman I'm going to put on my doctor cap here and public health perspective so with regards to travel advisory for those listening at home just go to CDC Zika travel advisory and you'll get a lot of information and country-specific information going back as far as februari the advice has been if you're pregnant do not travel to endemic areas if you're of childbearing age the advice is not to travel to endemic areas but if you are going to travel to take precautions birth control etc we've also been working with global health agencies to increase access to birth control in endemic areas until we get ahead of Zika virus and and we fully understand what's going on if you have to travel to these areas obviously take mosquito precautions you know repellents etcetera avoid going out you know at Baskar or the times when the mosquitoes biting in addition you know back in February we had a hearing we had dr. Frieden and dr. pouchy come over from the national institutes of allergies and infectious disease doctor foul Chi at that time was quite optimistic by the end of the year that we'd have a vaccine for clinical trials I will be honest I was skeptical that we'd be able to develop something as quickly as that you know a few weeks ago I had a chance to go visit dr. pouchy and his team at the National Institutes of Health they will be ready for clinical trials phase 1 trials starting in September and a very important aspect of our getting ahead of Zika is that vaccine development and the science behind vaccine development so you know September's still after mosquito season but we are moving fairly rapidly to get ahead of this and and address it the bigger component here though and and each of the witnesses touched on this is two years ago we were talking about Ebola we're talking about Zika this summer and the world is a much smaller place right now and vectors infectious disease viruses move much more quickly it's not as though we haven't known about Zika for you know yours we've known about this since the 40s and it's not that the virus has mutated the virus has moved it's now in a densely populated area and you know we are starting to see this pop-up and what we have to do as a body and as you know is provide adequate resources to the CDC to the NIH to do the research but to understand that we are going to be battling these infectious disease is much more frequently and we've got to support the science you know dr. Ernst I'd you know probably toss it over to you with regards to you know both Zika you know certainly as we as we got to get a vaccine developed you know disseminating that vaccine and making sure it's effective but then also just more broadly as an epidemiologist and someone who studies this yeah what we ought to be doing right now to prevent the the next infectious disease and how he should ought to be thinking about some of this you're talking more broadly any infectious disease more broadly yes more broadly I mean I think some of the things that we can do is really understand where a lot of these infections are originating from a lot of these are diseases of poverty their diseases where you have countries and places that have no infrastructure to be able to respond and control the epidemic in their own boundaries and when you have something that is going on in another place and you have as you said a very globalized world it doesn't take a lot for those viruses or bacteria to come over here so I think shoring up resources in other places to ensure that there's fewer pandemics in those areas as well is a critical step and then also investing in research and understanding where those threats might be more likely to come from is also very important it's wonderful and again I think for for the public and for my colleagues in Congress it is very important that we don't just fight the disease here that we actually go to where the these infections and these viruses are endemic and originating and there's a reason why we fund Global Health there's a reason why we you know fund the CDC to go do research and go to these endemic areas and as we look at these these fundings and we look at our bed it's it's really important for us because if we don't get ahead of this in those endemic places where the viruses they will certainly pop up here and we've seen it time and time again what's ours with you know I'm various infectious diseases and again a smaller world we will see this more frequently you know I'm running out of time I miss Bonamici said I could spend you know five hours asking questions but we also have to then adequately fund the science as well so we come up with those therapies to both control the vectors but then also to get ahead of this and with that mr. Chairman I yield back

Mr. Speaker, In Illinois’ 10th district,
one doesn’t have to look far to see America’s strength in advanced, 21st century manufacturing. In fact, my district has the fourth highest
concentration of manufacturing jobs of any district in the nation. Manufacturing is still key to our nations future prosperity
because it creates a multiplier effect that generates economic growth and jobs throughout
our economy. So last week, I visited 12 local manufacturers
as part of my Made in Illinois 10 tour. I had three key takeaways from my visit: First, innovation is alive and well in Illinois
10. I saw new applications in design, additive
manufacturing, robotics, and more. And at every turn, innovation is creating
new, quality, well-paying jobs. Second, we have to close the skills gap. We need more teachers, parents and especially
young, smart, talented people to recognize that working in manufacturing can be a stimulating
and rewarding career. Third, when the global market is fair and
level when the playing field is level, American companies not only can compete, we can win
and we can prosper. We need to hold bad actors like China accountable,
but the President’s shoot-from-the-hip actions risk sparking a destructive cycle of retaliatory
tariffs. The companies I visited are worried about
that, and indeed already feeling the impact of a prospective trade war. Mr. Speaker, I was encouraged by the ingenuity
and drive of our local manufacturers, and I remain committed to supporting this crucial
sector of our economy. I yield back.

I'm standing here outside the supreme court chambers in Washington DC and obey the fifth 2010 a group of school children who have been taking a tour the Supreme Court came out to these very steps and with the leadership of their teacher gathered in a circle and began to pray for the United States of America they were approached by a court officer who told them it was unlawful to prey on the steps of the Supreme Court the school group moved out to the street and in the gutter they continued their prayer for America we have lost our vision of America the vision that our founding fathers have and we must return to those principles of Faith Family and freedom on which our nation was founded on these very steps that these children were told was unlawful to pray I want to read a prayer by George Washington for the United States of America if it be thy holy will we shall obtain a place and name among the nations of the earth grant that we may be unable to show gratitude for thy goodness by our endeavors to fear and obey thee bless us with thy wisdom and our councils success in battle and let our victories be tempered with humanity and Dow also our enemies with the enlightened Minds that they become sensible of their injustice and willing to restore our liberty and peace grant the petition of thy servant for the sake of whom thou has called thy beloved son nevertheless not my will but thine be done and finally that that will most graciously be pleased to dispose us to all to do justice to love mercy and to demean ourselves with that Christian humility and Pacific temper of mind which were the characteristics of the Divine author of our Blessed religion and without a humble imitation of whose example in these things we can never hope to be a happy nation grant our supplication we beseech thee through Jesus Christ our Lord amen

joining me now is congresswoman karen bass a leader of the cbc she's worked on these civil rights issues for a long time she also introduced the george floyd justice and policing act uh which we will get to but let's begin with your response to what we're learning about this case and the investigation well thank goodness we have a new administration with the justice department that is intervened so quickly i think it's incredible do you know that that department invited the family to see the videotape and then when they got there changed their mind and said no we need to redact it or edit it now how could that possibly generate any trust between that family or the community about the police department i believe this is a wholesale cover-up and uh the fact that they would only show them the last 20 seconds of their loved one's life is despicable uh and what do you expect to come from the investigation the federal review well i expect that the uh doj the department of justice will be able to get the entire tape i certainly hope they haven't destroyed the evidence i worry when they say they're redacting it i don't really know you know what that means in terms of will they completely alter the tape or what so that's what i expect and then of course it has to lead to an examination of that department if they would do something so egregious as as this what else are they doing what else has happened that's a single case very important turning to what many experts have said has needed a wider reform i just want to get your views on these negotiations because we're hearing a lot about republicans doing some sort of middle ground if they can get certain things out of what is essentially your bill do you trust the process at this point do you have any concerns as we've heard from some activists that this is an effort to dilute a bill that most if not all republicans won't ultimately support anywhere oh i well first of all i absolutely trust the process because i trust the individuals that i'm dealing with this has been a bipartisan discussions informal discussions that started right after the bill passed the house on march 3rd and so we have built up a lot of goodwill i believe that uh senator tim scott wants to see this done mitch mcconnell has given him the authority and so i believe that we will have a bill on president biden's deaths i feel about 80 um sure that we will be able to do something and then ari you know when a bill moves from one house to that to the next it doesn't stay exactly the same but i think it's important to say that this is a significant piece of legislation but you know so much more needs to be done yeah stay with me i want to bring in neil concho his former acting u.s listener general he was a special prosecutor in the show and murder trial and we're going to get to some of that expertise and behind the scenes uh details on that legal process shortly which is part of why neil's here and good to see you neil the congresswoman first for you and then and then i think neil will weigh in as you both have such a voluminous experience here i want to play something from tim scott here as recently as last summer really ruling out the idea of reforming any of the immunity that officers have which has been such a sticking point take a look qualified immunity is off the table they see that as a poison bill on our side so we're going to have to find a path that helps us reduce misconduct within the officers but at the same time we know that any poison pill in legislation means we get nothing done your response because many activists including those who've been appeared on this program have said that having at least some reform to that kind of immunity which we've seen in a couple of states is key to having accountability well you know one of the things that we did is we brought in uh top experts from around the country on qualified immunity both democrats as well as uh republicans and i think over the course of time we have all been informing ourselves about the nuances the problems especially because you know qualified immunity is not a law it's a court decision and it's created a lot of havoc a lot of really crazy examples of officers getting off on immunity because this this is such a mangled uh court decision there was one case for example of officers that stole 250 000 from a drug dealer they got off with immunity because you couldn't find another case that was exactly like that that would have removed the immunity from them so it's a flawed area of the law i wish the supreme court would act it hasn't but i do believe that we will come to some type of agreement around qualified immunity okay uh congresswoman thank you so much for joining us tonight i greatly appreciate it

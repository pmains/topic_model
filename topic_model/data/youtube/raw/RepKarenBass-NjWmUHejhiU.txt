now with all that in mind we want to bring in our special guests mark morial ceo of the national urban league and congresswoman karen bass chair of the congressional black caucus uh thanks to both of you for joining us good evening to you congresswoman your thoughts as you thank you to both of you we're on a slight tape delay but thank you to both of you and i was going to say to the congresswoman um your thoughts on this on this man that you knew so well that you served with well you know today we're back in session and i have to tell you that there's all of us are walking around with a heavy heart uh we had a moment of silence and uh several members got up on both sides of the aisle and spoke about mr lewis and we'll be doing various tributes throughout the week but it's different you know the chair that he always sits in there's a bouquet of flowers there and i think all of us have been there you know acknowledging uh his absence but let me just tell you though because i think what's so important mr lewis has expectations of all of us and he absolutely expects us now to honor him by getting that bill passed i mean it has been languishing in the senate for over 200 days and one of the things every year is we would go to selma for the pilgrimage across the bridge my republican colleagues would come with us and then come right back here and uh and vote against and stand against the very thing they stood next to mr lewis iv it is a shame that so many decades later in the united states we are still fighting for the right to vote and we're less than 120 days away from an election and we know that this time there's a new way to suppress the vote and that is to make people risk their lives by exposure to covet in order to vote instead of voting from home well congresswoman uh you know let's do it you said this is a part of the legacy here and that's what's important um let me put up on the screen for everyone to understand what's been going on just since the voting rights act itself was weakened by that supreme court ruling you have these polling place closures uh we've had new voter id laws you have the elimination of something that is just helpful to people who are busy and working jobs which is being able to show up and register and then vote it's all part of the same goal early voting as well has been shortened congresswoman what is important in your mind if the senate holds this vote that would address some of those issues well i think one of the reasons why uh mcconnell doesn't want the vote held is because it might pass i think that he is afraid of that afraid of it passing but you know i mean if you just think of it you ran down the list of things that have been done it's all under the guise of voter fraud but isn't it interesting that every time they do find the one in a million case of voter fraud it's a republican so just this last week one of my republican colleagues was brought up on charges for voter fraud so you know i'm happy to work with my good friend from the urban league mark mouriel we work day in and day out on these issues and it's just inexcusable i also work in the international arena i go over to countries around the world telling them about democracy we look ridiculous now making people risk their very lives to vote you remember after the vote in wisconsin more than 50 people became uh infected and exposed to uh to covet you saw that scenes in kentucky with people banging on the window this is an absolute embarrassment to our country how can we talk about democracy when we actually are doing everything under the sun to limit people from voting but it's also only certain people that we're trying to limit it's not everybody uh all important mark your thoughts yeah my thoughts are that this what we've seen since 2013 uh with the case of shelby beholder is nothing but a naked assault on american democracy what we see today turns the hands of time back uh to the 1950s and this protection of the vote is essential to american democracy mitch mcconnell i think the record will reflect has voted for extensions of the voting rights act each time he's been in congress what's changed why does he have cold feet why can't he bring this bill up for a vote and protect people's vote uh we can honor john lewis by passing this bill yeah we can also honor john lewis by putting this bill on the ballot in the fall if this u.s senate is going to drag its feet and say no on this vote right well and and you just hit it you both are saying something so important that could get lost in this which is it is precisely the strength of the legacy the voting rights act what john lewis what martin luther king with so many people fought for that it is still hard to vote against it even if you're a republican that there is a there is a political cowardice that relates inverse proportionately to the strength of what of what congressman lewis bill mark so two things i was a intern on capitol hill in 1982 working for george mickey leland as a law student at georgetown when the 82 extension passed i was here at the national urban league when we put together this powerful bipartisan coalition in 2005 2006 to extend the voting rights act the republican party has retreated turned its back on the legacy the legacy of the idea that protecting the right to vote is central to democracy and above partisan politics so in this instance this is a sad day uh when majority leader mcconnell will not call for a vote so we're going to keep continuing to put the pressure on majority leader mcconnell and we're going to continue educating the american people as to why this is so essential this these voter suppression taxes are just outrageous right they smack of a medieval effort to just block access to the ballot box and they're unamerican and inconsistent which is why you seem to fight them and that's why we are staying on that story and scrutinizing it i know both of you have done so much work uh i'm bringing in another special guest related uh to congressman lewis so i want to thank congress congresswoman bass and ceo of the national early marc morial thanks to both of you

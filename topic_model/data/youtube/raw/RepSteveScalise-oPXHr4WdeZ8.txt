this is going to be something we're going to continue to do we're going to continue to raise awareness to this crisis at america's southern border it was exclusively created by president biden when he with the stroke of a pen right when he took the oath of office undid policies that were working to control our southern border it had a ripple effect that immediately resulted in people coming by the thousands a day illegally across the rio grande and other parts of our southern border with the members that have gone down the border they've all seen the same things uh we went with border patrol agents uh we went to a shift change and then they took us out to one of the temporary processing centers right by the rio grande river and it was it was alarming as ann said it was heartbreaking to see what was going on within minutes we saw just parades of people coming across and they were coming across in groups of maybe five or six because that's how many would fit on the rafts that were being deployed from the mexico side right across the rio grande they'd send them over a group of five or six would come through the the brush and then they would go and start getting processed and then a few minutes later another group and another group and it was constant the entire night around midnight we went over by the rio grande and as we were going that way we saw more people just coming through under brush young children many of them unaccompanied uh the abuse the sexual abuse and rape that is happening to these young girls is heartbreaking it should be something that president biden acknowledges and stops he can stop this today he won't go down to the border we're calling on president biden to go down to the border himself and see what he created this mess that he's created and the carnage these kids are going through right now this is a detention facility right here it's a cell it's a holding cell that's set up by the federal government this one was designed for 33 people there were over 400 kids in that cell the day we went there and there were multiple cells like this set up every one of them with over 400 people that were designed for 33 kids they're on top of each other a large percentage have coveted which means it's got to be spreading through everybody but in the meantime imagine a restaurant back home in any state in america if you're over 100 percent capacity with state guidelines they're going to probably shut that restaurant down here you've got the federal government running a facility with holding cells over a thousand percent above capacity where the government would shut somebody down if they were doing this in the private industry the federal government is doing this to these young kids it's the definition if you read texas's law on child abuse and neglect what's happening in that federal facility and the the biden administration is running violates texas's own laws it's it's it's a national disgrace and president biden puts kamala harris in charge of it and she refuses to go down maybe she because she doesn't want to be associated with this disgraceful policy but if she's the vice president united states and the president put her in charge of this vice president harris needs to go down to the border and see this for herself because maybe she would then encourage president biden to reverse his policies that have failed again you can go back to the trump policies remain in mexico everybody will tell you that policy was working the border patrol agents tell us it's not like you get 10 opinions when you ask the same question to 10 different people our border patrol agents are all telling us the same thing one they signed up for this tough job because they want to stop the drug cartels from bringing drugs into america what's happening now is the drug cartels are running america's southern border they're making millions of dollars a day off of this enterprise that was created by president biden's executive actions and they don't want to be at midnight changing diapers when instead they could be stopping fentanyl and heroin from coming into america's border but that's what they're doing right now because that's what president biden's policy has created president biden created it he can reverse it today he needs to go see for himself the damage that he's doing and stop this madness one final point i'll make before we open it up to questions starting shortly we are going to be initiating a discharge petition on ann wagner's born a live act so cat connect from florida will be filing the discharge petition if 218 members of congress sign that discharge petition it will bring the bill to the floor immediately that says if a baby is born alive outside the womb it can't be murdered and called abortion unfortunately that's happening in states like new york and others that are looking to to continue this barbaric practice the only way to stop it is with an act of congress speaker pelosi won't bring the bill to the floor but with 218 signatures that bill can come to the floor on its own so we are going to be found that discharge petition this morning hopefully we'll get enough signatures five democrats signing on will bring that bill to the floor and i know a lot more democrats than that ran saying they were pro-life you can't be pro-life if you don't sign this discharge petition so that's going to start today and of course at noon today we're going to be very proud to be at the swearing-in of julia letlow which she will be our newest member of congress but as the dean of the louisiana delegation i'm especially proud of julia getting sworn in we were so sad to see the death of her husband luke just days before his swearing in julia just got elected in special election she will become the first republican woman ever elected to congress from louisiana we're incredibly proud to have her joining our conference and louisiana's congressional delegation in a few hours would that be happy to open up the questions um a few days ago uh former president trump had some tough words for senator mcconnell i'm not going to repeat what he said but i'm curious uh your thoughts on this changing thought does the former president bad matching republican leaders complicate your task of taking control of congress we're very focused on taking back the house next year and frankly when you look at the socialist agenda being pushed by speaker pelosi and president biden people are turning away from it they're talking about an infrastructure bill it's soviet-style infrastructure what they're talking about over 90 percent of the bill they're proposing has nothing to do with roads and bridges uh people would expect if you're going to have a trillions of dollar two trillion dollar bill that it would be all about roads and bridges there's is not it's a lot of green new deal it's uh you know expanding the role of the federal government it's raising taxes on hard-working families national association of manufacturers said that hard-working families would lose over a million jobs in america if they got this bill passed so president obama should be working with republicans on a bipartisan agreement he still refuses to even meet with republican leadership so when you look at all of this far left socialist policy they're pushing it's no surprise that a lot of democrats are getting nervous they know that our opportunity to win the house back has never been greater next year and we're focused on doing that you saw the record-breaking numbers that we've raised over this first quarter record-breaking and i think it shows you that people are focused on getting the house back putting a check and balance on this radical out of control biden administration play a role in that oh i'm sure president trump will play an active role and you know he's said it's it's very uh you know very he's very interested in helping us win the house back and i think a lot of americans across the country who may have voted for president biden and some of speaker pelosi's democrat members of congress are alarmed by just how far left uh towards the socialist agenda they moved in a short time um with the allegations swirling around the conference and that gates do you have confidence in him well you know we've heard a lot of stories i mean obviously i've met the red the media reports but there's been nothing that we've seen yet from the department of justice if something's going on obviously we'll find out about it uh you know right now it's hard to speculate on on rumors uh but you know if something really formal happened from justice we would of course react and take action well look i haven't talked to him to get his uh you know get his explanation of what what's been alleged serious things alleged obviously we want to get the facts do you plan to talk to him i would imagine i will be this week i haven't seen him we just had a conference meeting you know we're still hybrid where we have in person and people virtually he wasn't he wasn't there in the room i'm not sure if he was on we uh and if you look historically uh you know there have been a few cases where members have had charges filed against them for various things and we've removed them from committees uh immediately when that happened that's been the precedent that we've always followed last question can you get your reaction to the hold on the johnson johnson vaccine there's some concern that this is going to increase vaccine presidency as former president trump decides that well you know the first two vaccines that were approved are still very effective and safe this one we'll see if it may actually be reinstated let the fda run their process we have dr fauci and dr wolinski the cdc director coming before the select subcommittee on coronavirus which i'm the ranking republican on uh majority webcliven is the chairman of that committee uh they will be coming before our committee thursday tomorrow and i'm sure this will be one of the many things that we'll be discussing are you concerned about it making people more hesitant to get vaccines well you know you you want to encourage people to to get a vaccine if they want to and if you look at the johnson and johnson decision it was based on not not a specific finding but they said they saw some people that had blood clots that had gotten that they want to see if it's related to the vaccine this is the fda process and the fda fda is still the gold standard in the world for approval of vaccinations we we were able to get a vaccination out for multiple vaccinations out for covet in record time but they didn't cut any corners if you look at modern pfizer they were heavily tested on tens of thousands of americans and and it seems to be yielding very positive results with johnson johnson let's see what the fda process yields there i i have confidence in the fda's process i think we're still the gold standard in the world and other countries look to us still for guidance on how to properly approve and distribute vaccines thanks guys well thank you all we'll see all on the floor for julia swearing in

the gentleman from Arizona is now recognized mr. Gosar for five minutes I'd also like to tell my colleagues about the multiple use doctrine and the royalties off of public lands too so a deputy assistant secretary a Miss Leiter guests is a volatile right it's a gas it is a gas okay so BLM is moving forward with a venting and flaring rule that includes air quality regulations that clearly exceed its jurisdiction since EPA's and states have Clean Air Act authority do you agree that the EPA has exclusive federal jurisdiction over air quality and emissions regulations under the Clean Air Act as prescribed by Congress I agree that EPA is charged with implementing the Clean Air Act we are charged with I asked a question I mean to quantify it they have sole jurisdiction along with states in Clean Air Act under the Clean Air Act yes so several provisions in the proposed rule are similar or the same or similar to what EPA recently proposed in its new source performance standards quato a EPA has not yet responded to public comment on the standard and and finalized rule how does BLM justify proposing and relying on another agency's proposed regulations that are still subject to review and potential revision in terms of our assessment of the costs of the rule we actually went through and very carefully evaluated the costs and benefits of the rule if EPA finalized its rule and separately if they do not okay now in the Senate hearing on the proposed rule a few weeks ago when questioned about the fact that BLM often holds up the processing of right away is approval that are required before companies can lay gas gathering lines and pipelines to capture gas and reduce flaring you stated that sometimes companies ask BLM to put right away Zahn hold however the example you gave was in the San Juan Basin of northwestern New Mexico which is an area of primary natural gas development and these right-of-way applications would be primarily for new wells that are not getting constructed at this time because of the low prices of gas obviously if a natural gas well is not going to be drilled there's also no need for Associated right-of-ways on the other hand the issue with higher rates of flaring in the Permian Basin of southeastern New Mexico or the Bakken in North Dakota is a result of oil oil wells with associated gas in those areas there is a backlog of right-of-ways the BLM is yet to process so now was your answer therefore a red herring to divert attention from BLM's role in causing high rates of flaring or do you actually see companies asking BLM to put right-of-ways on hold in the Bakken for example well in the Bakken actually our numbers suggest that there's not a significant backlog I understand that there was a right-of-way that was denied actually by the Bureau of Indian Affairs I gather because of tribal concerns but when we look for example in Dickinson North Dakota there are only four or five pending right-of-way applications there there's not a significant record please be happy today now the proposed rule includes requirements for liquids unloading operations just yet just six months ago the EPA declined to include such requirements into this quality zero a because EPA did and I quote not has sufficient information to propose a standard for liquids unloading at the end of code what information does BLM have that EPA did not have six months ago well for existing wells we would only require the best management practices the the specific requirements that we have to change liquids unloading practices would only apply to new wells going forward oh well I mean what your sidestep the issue again so what information do you have that the EPA doesn't have we are looking at the issue and you're looking at so you don't have scientific back back back this is a proposed rule at this time and we we solicited comments so going on going on you're going on hearsay not actual scientific fact right I I would disagree with that we're asking you a scientist for the day are you saying actually amazon okay so where's your science we've asked companies for data about the liquids and loading practices I mean we use the best information that we have available to that's what we put in the proposed rule we've requested industry to comment if they disagree with what we've used we'll take account of those comments and we'll modify the final rule accordingly unbelievable so I don't have enough time to grill it even further I yield back

in California several counties and cities are suing the big oil companies to hold them liable for the damages that climate change is causing to the infrastructure out there as judges consider these cases one thing that they will be asked to keep in mind is Big Oil's history of deception and lies a group of scientific experts filed this friend-of-the-court brief out in the Ninth Circuit carefully charting that history that pattern of deception and lies the group of scholars and scientists chronicled how the fossil fuel companies had actual knowledge of the risks of their products and had taken and I quote here proactive steps to conceal their knowledge and discredit climate science end quote while at the same time taking steps based on that science to protect their own assets from the impacts of climate change it's a 51 page document so let me cut to the chase Big Oil knew for a very long time that the production and burning of fossil fuels would be disastrous for the planet yep they did everything in their power to confuse the public undermine the scientific evidence of the dangers and prevent action to stave off this worldwide problem the brief makes a fascinating read here are some highlights way back in 1959 when I was a kid and Dwight Eisenhower was president Columbia University held a symposium attended by oil industry executives to mark the hundredth anniversary the petroleum industry at that event the legendary doctor teller the physicist warned the industry about global warming 1959 he said a temperature rise corresponding to a 10% increase in carbon dioxide will be sufficient to melt the ice cap and submerge New York this chemical contamination he said the release of these emissions this chemical contamination is more serious than most people tend to believe 1959 a few years later in 1965 at the American Petroleum Institute San yule meeting API President Frank Rijkaard briefed the big oil trade group on a report from President Johnson's science advisory committee that predicted significant global warming by the end of the century caused by fossil fuels and warned quote there is still time to save the world's peoples from the catastrophic consequence of pollution but time is running out end quote American Petroleum Institute 1965 API then commissioned a Stanford Research Institute report on the climate problem which was made available to its membership in 1968 the report said and I quote here rising levels of co2 would likely result in rising global temperatures the result could be melting ice caps rising sea levels warming oceans and serious environmental damage on a global scale and quote then in 1969 Stanford produced a supplemental report for the American Petroleum Institute as the authors of this brief tell the ninth circuit I quote the report projected that atmospheric co2 concentrations would reach 370 parts per million by 2000 what it turned out to be end quote so that was 68 and 69 very clear warnings that have come to pass and Big Oil did not just rely on the American Petroleum Institute to do its research on climate change Ed Garvey was an Exxon scientist at the time mr. garvey said quote by the late 1970s global warming was no longer speculative did you get that by the late 1970s global warming was no longer a speculative said the Exxon scientist the issue was not were we going to have a problem the issue was simply how soon and how fast and how bad was it going to be not if indeed Exxon did a lot of climate research and they understood the science well a 1979 internal exxon study found the increase in co2 concentration is due to fossil fuel combustion and the present trend of fossil fuel consumption will cause dramatic environmental effects before the year 2050 meanwhile back to the American Petroleum Institute they had put together a taskforce on what they called the co2 problem in 1980 dr. John lohrmann told this API task force that foreseeable temperature increases could have quote major economic consequences and globally catastrophic effects American Petroleum Institute 1980 back tax on Roger Cohen the director of exons theoretical and mathematical sciences laboratory warned in 1981 the next year about the magnitude of this problem it is distinctly possible he said that exons planning scenario will later produce effects which will indeed be catastrophic pairen at least for a substantial fraction of the Earth's population in 1982 Roger Cohen reiterated his warning over the past several years a clear scientific consensus has emerged he said this is 1982 a clear scientific consensus has emerged regarding the expected climatic effects of increased atmospheric co2 he continues there is unanimous agreement 1982 again unanimous agreement in the scientific community that a temperature increase of this magnitude would bring about significant changes in the Earth's climate unanimous agreement in the scientific community in 1982 Exxon's own scientist said this but almost four decades later the Trump administration pretends that we just don't know well we do know so back to the brief in 1982 an internal Exxon corporate primer said that in order to mitigate the effects of global warming there's a need for what they called major reductions in fossil fuel combustion there are some potentially catastrophic events that must be considered they said once the effects are measurable they might not be reversible and quote so on into the late 70s and the early 80s they knew this is from a 1998 report by Shell Oil's greenhouse effect working group I quote man-made carbon dioxide released into and accumulated in the atmosphere is believed to warm the earth through the so called greenhouse effect by the time the global warming becomes detectable it could be too late to take effective countermeasures to reduce the effects or even to stabilize the situation so long story short that mr. president big oil new API new Exxon new shale knew they knew but Big Oil also realized that understanding climate change meant limiting carbon emissions and that meant less oil sales so they began to tell something very different than what they knew to the public a 1998 Exxon internal memo acknowledged that and I'm quoting it here the greenhouse effect may be one of the most significant environmental issues for the 1990s end quote Exxon's position would be to try to emphasize the uncertainty in scientific conclusions regarding the potential enhanced greenhouse effect and that became the drumbeat of the industry minimized the danger the one they knew that greenhouse effect may be one of the most significant var mental issues for the 1990s but instead undermine the science so the industry set up front groups with innocuous sounding names like the Global Climate Coalition or the information Council on the environment to do this PR work for it the scientific brief notes this bit of industry propaganda from 1996 from the so called Global Climate Coalition if they say if there is an anthropogenic component to this observed warming the GCC this Global Climate Coalition believes that it must be very small well here's what an earlier draft of the same document said the scientific basis for the greenhouse effect and the potential impacts of human emissions of greenhouse gases such as co2 on climate is well-established and cannot be denied is well-established and cannot be denied they just weren't telling the truth they knew and they said things that they knew were not true money poured from the oil industry into these denialist groups in 1991 the so-called information Council on the environment launched a nationwide campaign with one goal to reposition global warming as Theory not fact this thing that they said was well-established and cannot be denied they decided to reposition as theory not fact the polluters kept this up all the way through the 90s in 1998 American Petroleum Institute strategy memo tells what they wanted people to believe even though they knew it wasn't true they said it is not known for sure whether a climate change actually is occurring or B if it is but whether humans really have any influence on it again well-established cannot be denied on the one hand and not sure whether it's occurring or whether humans have anything to do with it on the other hand here's Martin huffard who was an Exxon scientist for twenty years he said even though we we meaning the Exxon scientists even though we were writing all these papers saying that climate change from co2 emissions was gonna change the climate of the earth the front office the front office said otherwise the front office which was concerned with promoting the products of the company was also supporting people that we call climate change deniers so even as they spun this massive fraud out to the public Big Oil internally took the evidence of climate change seriously they took the evidence of climate change seriously enough to factor it into their own plan so while they were telling the public that this wasn't for real and we don't have anything to do with it and the science isn't secure they were doing their own planning based on that very science for instance in designing and building disable gas field project off the shores of Halifax Nova Scotia mobile shell and Imperial Oil explicitly told their own engineers about sea level rise that quote an estimated rise due to global warming of 0.5 meters may be assumed big oil protected its own assets against predicted sea level rise based on this science while at the same time funding a massive campaign of deception to fool the public and policymakers about this science they protected themselves and they connived to prevent the public from taking steps to protect itself mr. president there are some unsung heroes in this climate battle among them number the dedicated and assiduous group of scholars and scientists who track this climate denial apparatus that the industry built many of them are the authors of this brief Robert Brule Justin Farrell Benjamin Franta Stephan Lewandowski naor Morris keys Jeffrey suprem and they're just a few there are many many others who are watching and examining and reporting and subject to peer review chronicling the climate denial apparatus set up by the oil industry to fool the public patiently and thoroughly they assembled in their brief a record of Industry malfeasance and they are helping to make sure that the long history of industry deception is part of the courts official record I thank them for their work and I yield the floor

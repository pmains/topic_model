today my colleagues is a sad day it is a sad day for us to say a day for this institution and it is sad day for America we have lost a wonderful human being a good and decent human being a human being who made a difference for this institution for all of us who knew him where and his friend for his constituents and for all Americans all of us in this house lost a respected colleague many of us lost a dear longtime good friend he came in 96 to this body and every time I ran for a leadership position my friend Elijah Cummings nominated me the passing this morning of Chairman Elijah Cummings of the Committee on Oversight and reform was a painful shock to all who have served with him more of course to his family dr. rocky more Cummings his wife his children his three children Elijah was a prophet of God whose name means my God is the Lord Elijah Cummings was true to his name he was a leader for our country for our state of Maryland and we have the members including our favorite daughter he was a leader for our state he was a leader like our brother John Lewis for principal for comedy for civility he was a quiet man who did not seek the limelight but he was not afraid to step out into the arena and fight hard for the causes in which he believed strongly and as all of us know those causes were justice equality opportunity civil rights education children he liked to say that children are the message we send to a future that we will never see his parents said Elijah into the future and how much better the future was he was beloved by his constituents both those in the city of Baltimore and those in its suburbs and indeed Elijah was probably better loved in my district than I am most of my colleagues will understand that of course he worked hard even in his final days the speaker is going to speak and I'm sure she will say something about a telephone call she had with him just days ago doing the people's business as his health faltered his passion for his work did not in the days ahead we will have many opportunities of course to speak about our friend Elijah about his passion for service his many contributions to Maryland and our nation and his deep convictions as a moral leader and a man of decency and love for his neighbor some of you recall Elijah at the time of great distress in Baltimore anger outbursts and Elijah walked among them as a man of peace and like no other person in our state brought peace where there was no peace we'll have opportunities to remember that and we have a chance to reflect on the love Yin for his wife Maya and for his three children today and remembering Elijah Cummings we have a chance to promote the vision he held of the people's house coming together in a spirit of unity and purpose sadly today that purpose is to mourn his passing and remember dear friend who will no longer be with us as we continue his work to which he gave his all but hopefully his example will be with us Elijah used to say when he saw conflict and confrontation when he saw things he thought were not up to the standards we had set for our country and for ourselves because of our faith or our constitution in our declaration he would say we're better than that let us all say as we human beings do things that from time to time are not kind to one another not thoughtful not respectful to one another let us say to ourselves we are better than that that's what Elijah said to himself in that spirit of unity I will be yielding shortly to the Republican leader to share his reflections but first as I referred to her as Maryland's favorite daughter I am honored to yield to the Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi Nancy Pelosi dela Sandra now she would say Nancy della Sandra Pelosi I understand that but we are so proud of our speaker madam Speaker very disco sir disconcerting day for so many of us here Thank You mr. Hoyer for bringing us together to mourn the loss of our dear friend and colleague Elijah Cummings thank you for your beautiful statement calling forth so many of the beautiful attributes of Elijah Cummings as you spoke I was reminded of how he always was a calmer calming of the waters no matter how rough and tumble things would be he would always just calm the waters reach out whether it's across the aisle or across the issue across the Capitol down Pennsylvania Avenue if he I know that the people of Baltimore in the United Congress in America have lost a voice a bunch of past moral clarity and truth our beloved mr. chairman Elijah Cummings I'm personally devastated by his passing as I know many of us are and we have the flowers in his place where he sat where we all sought counsel learned more or calm down were lifted up by the wisdom and the graciousness and the goodness of Elijah Cummings in the house Elijah was a North Star he was a leader of towering character and integrity whose Stern voice and steadfast values pushed the Congress in the country to give rise to a higher purpose of why are we here his principled leadership as the chair of the Committee on Oversight and Reform was a perfect testament to his commitment to restoring honesty and honor to government and leaves a powerful you see for years to come as a senior member of the tribe now people think of him as that chairman but meaning so much to meet him was his role as a member of a senior member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee he was always fighting for his district for his state of Maryland and for the country he was a powerful voice for building the infrastructure of America and for creating good-paying jobs it's a working class guy in terms of who he was here to serve I was very proud of him as a member of the u.s. Naval Academy Board of Visitors he took great pride in the Naval Academy his role on the board and Maryland's role in our national security I know we have some Naval Academy grads here and that was a source of great prize me said you've taken me to a new level of decision-making in terms of national security chairmen coming story was the story of America sharecroppers son was dedicated who dedicated his life to advancing justice respecting human dignity as you said and ending discrimination he believed in the promise of America because he had lived it and he did it his life to advancing those values that safeguard our republic justice equality Liberty and fairness as mr. Hoyer said our distinguished leader said earlier we were always listening to Elijah and these flowers remind me of it because of growth and renewal that are there he said children are the living messengers we send to the future a future we will never see but he also wanted to build a future that was worthy of the aspirations of our children he always wanted to make sure that they took with them the values the values which nurtured him and that he was promoting in his public in his public service earlier this year becomings he asked us when we're dancing with the Angels the question will be what did we do to make sure that we kept our democracy intact he's now with the Angels out of pain Maya said this morning he fought the fight right up until the end and those of us who communicated with him I didn't know it was this close I thought he was coming back in a few weeks but our members I want to say to our Republican colleagues we had a conference call on Friday this past Friday not a full week ago in which Elijah as always passionate about what he believed in dispassionate and how he conveyed a plan for how we would go for it with fairness with justice with dignity worthy of the oath of office that we take to the Constitution worthy of a vision of our founders establishing this institution and worthy again of the aspirations of our children his words messengers to a future we will never see his leadership made a difference in strengthening our democracy again during difficult times that a straw strength from his righteous words that the leader has been reminding us of all day we are better than this we are better than this in the Congress will miss his wisdom his dignity the brilliance of his mind the kindness of his heart the friendship that meant so much to us and that we could all call upon in Baltimore we will miss him as a champion may it be a comfort to his wife Maya whom I conveyed the good wishes of the Congress to whom I convey the good wishes of the Congress this morning may be a comfort to Maya to his three children and chairman Cummings entire family and I want to add to that his dedicated and devoted staff in every capacity as a member as a chairman as a member of a committee he just treated with such fairness and respect to his staff to may be a comfort to them all that so many mourn their loss and are praying for them at this sad time and may he always be inside of our hearts as we makin decisions about our responsibilities and how we will be accountable when we are dancing with the Angels god bless you darling Elijah we all love you we miss you but we'll never forget you and your legacy will live in the Congress of the United States in this House of Representatives pleased to yield back sadly thank you very much madam Speaker for your remarks I know Elijah felt very strongly about you and his support of you and your leadership and how proud he was that you were from the city of Baltimore that he loved so greatly and now I'm privileged to yield to the Minority Leader another good friend of Elijah's my friend mr. McCarthy from California I think my friend for yielding I think him for his words and I think the speaker we lost more than just a member of Congress we lost Elijah Cummings as a speaker spoke of his life she talked about him bringing calmness I want you to reflect for one moment when have you ever served in this body that we've been this calm and this quiet and this reflective Elijah's work is still good with us right now chairman Cummings at enormous presence there's many times he'd be an adversary he was a respected adversary because he was tough he had such a presence on this side of the aisle and an impression that when we would sit inside our steering committee and maybe I'm breaking a rule we're never supposed to talk about what we say in there when we do we would select a chair or a ranking member this is the one committee we weighed who we went against and every time we spoke of selecting an individual that can rise to the occasion to be in debate with him we would look for somebody that was strong and every time someone would select it they'd come back to be a very best friend of Elijah Cummings it's a tough committee it's a committee of accountability it's a committee of debate I can't tell you how many friends would call me and be in fear cuz they got a letter from Cummings but he was a man of fairness you don't know this because in committees at times you have these debates but when you're sitting as a chair and a ranking member what we would talk about our Elijah Wood ser with us the life lessons you know what he would say privately to the chair or the ranking member on the other side what he would say to Jim Jordan what do you say to trey Gowdy tre shared with this with me today they never stopped talking even though he left Congress Jim Jordan shared with me today that he was talking to Elijah just last week about committee business tre talked about a story the tre was pretty tough on one person and tre is good tre could that prosecutor in him could get to the point and Elijah turned to him and said she's not a government employee she has a family and she has children you can be a little softer next time and that hit that hit on his heart and what I fear in a world today that they wouldn't look at us they get this persona through cameras and social media but it doesn't show our character we are the only ones who get the window into one another's character of how we act we are the ones who should share the message because he was so strong in his beliefs I'm afraid some people in America won't know what type of character he actually had not as a member of Congress and not as a political figure but as a person because that's how I knew Elijah he was a fighter so many times in his life people told him no and he'd say yes he could he was a leader but not not in the sense that America probably thinks as a member of Congress his entire life he wanted to overturn racial injustice remember shared with me the first time he got to know him was on a Codell down in Mexico most of the bus people were asleep because it was one of those long trips and Elijah sat and talked to him and this member was from the south and he talked how his grandparents were there but his grandparents moved him away because he felt he would have a better chance just because of the color of his skin that he'd get a better education Elijah didn't was not upset by that he felt this country gave him the opportunity that's why he wanted to serve so all of us are here to honor the fortune and the privilege to know him if you were a freshman if you are I hope he took a few moments with him cuz it didn't matter if you were a chair or rank or if you were a Republican or Democrat he would spend that time with you I feel I'm better Fred no no and I want you to know from this side of the aisle no matter how hard of the debate we were in I've only heard respect for how he carried out the business we respected him because he was good we respect him because he beat as many a times respect him because of what he fought for he believed in our deepest prayers go to Maia because in those life lessons and in that window that we get to see it's not the easiest to have a family in these jobs we have a lot of things pulled on us but we knew where his heart stood where his family mattered and where he continued to believe in so yes today we lost more than just a member but I hope as the day's progress as the times change and our debate gets heated again that we reflect on this moment of calmness reflect on this moment of thinking of one another and we reflect on the idea yeah television may give us a different persona of of who we are but yes you and I get to see the window of the character of in each and every one of us I think that's what Elijah would want us to do when his honor less fine that tomorrow will be better than today and that this calmness will last longer than the next vote I yield back I thank the gentleman for his remarks in that spirit Mr Speaker I will ask for a moment of silence but but before I do that let me mirror the remarks of the leader on the other side of the aisle a moment of silence will not be enough to respect life of our line Jo Cummings what will be enough is prefer oh his example for a lifetime not for a moment but for a lifetime if we give one another the respect that he would give to us if we give one another the consideration that the leader indicated that he gave to him so Mr Speaker I will ask that we stand for a moment of silence and a lifetime of following an example but you asked that all members to please rise for a moment of silence in remembrance of our good friend and colleague egit the Honorable Chairman Elijah E Cummings

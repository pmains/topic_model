i'm very troubled by the increase of cyber attacks which seem to be designed not only for monetary purposes but also to instill this trust in our economic system and our institutions just between 2019 and 2020 our country saw 400 in cyber intrusions successful cyber attacks on our small businesses also discourage future entrepreneurs from establishing a small business and creating jobs some estimates say that 60 of small businesses go out of business within six months of a cyber incident so let's think about that cyber attacks are putting six out of ten of our entrepreneurs out of business so given this urgency of the moment i was happy to join my colleague representative crowe to introduce the sba cyber awareness act to find ways to improve the sba's cyber security infrastructure and share information with congress if there is reasonable basis to believe that a cyber security incident occurred at the administration let me pose the question to all witnesses but let me start witness with default in your testimony you indicated that threat sharing for small companies is complicated because usually they left the resources to join and participate in information sharing and analysis centers can you elaborate on what can congress do to incentivize higher participation of small businesses in isex thank you congresswoman it is a difficult task to create an incentive that would really cause small companies to participate in a robust way in these information sharing uh enterprises and uh one one of the ways that that you we can at least start on on that on that task is to provide potentially additional liability protections at least right because the the couple of issues that small companies face when when they're being asked to share information about the threats that they receive or even incidents that they that they are victims of um is that number one the reputational fallout will cost quite a lot of money over and above the cost of actually remediating the breach and then number two it's it's uh just a a matter of am i going to be liable for anything associated with sharing this this information whether it's a privacy cause of action um or just simply that they didn't take the precautions necessary to protect their networks and therefore uh they run afoul of data security laws in the states or or at the federal level the federal trade commission act so it's the liability and the reputation and so a good start is to help them defray some of that potential liability ms todd could you briefly elaborate on that too thank you i think the other piece is that when we look at the supply chains that small businesses are a part of it does there is a responsibility on the larger companies to work with them to incentivize because those large companies as we saw with solar winds and cassaya can be taken down if the small businesses are vulnerable and there is a better infrastructure of support that can happen within supply chains and i think as we've seen the interdependencies grow with the digital economy this is another opportunity to incentivize that engagement that threat sharing we lurk we work with large manufacturing companies and one of them has put out very specific efforts and information to their small businesses to help them understand where the threats are but also to facilitate that sharing because they know that as a large company if their small businesses get taken down that will affect them so there is more responsibility in collaboration that can happen across supply chains than we've seen before thank you very much um you know i'm a big proponent of advancing stem education especially with underrepresented communities to increase our 21st century talent pipeline and our economic competitiveness so i'm sure you understand the importance of stem education and computer science in training and expanding our cyber security workforce how could our small businesses and our economy benefit from increasing cyber workforce thank you congresswoman is one of the most significant problems my member companies face is access to folks that are trained in software development or computer science more generally and so my member companies would benefit quite a bit i think from from investments in k-12 education uh but also in workforce development programs i mentioned earlier that some of our member companies develop these training programs on their own but there is a role for federal investment as well and that's why we support the computer science for all act and also the master teacher corps which is a training program for uh k-12 educators to to provide computer science education thank you i see that my time's up i yield that

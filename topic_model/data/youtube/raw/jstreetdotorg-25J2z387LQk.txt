thank my friend Carol for that really wonderful in spirited introduction and it's it's so it's so wonderful to have a close friend introducing me and presenting this beautiful award her work and you know Carol's work with J Street Leadership Forum and her dedication to peace in the Middle East that cannot be overstated and so I am so pleased and thankful to call not Carol not only an ally but a true friend so Carol thank you so much for your friendship and for your leadership also I have to thank a Jeremy our fearless leader of J Street give Jeremy a round of applause from day one from day one I have seen how he has worked and the team has worked his staff the board to educate members of Congress advocating for peace in the Middle East and throughout the world it is truly tremendous also I just want to recognize all of our panelists and participants who are going to be with us this weekend members from the Knesset to thought leaders and to experts in Washington DC it's really great to join you also on the panel today it's appropriately titled fighting for our values how Americans and Israelis can stand up to the Trump and Netanyahu agenda which for me are very similar very similar also I just have to recognize my constituents who are here with us today I think we have one of the largest chapters of J Street people have traveled all across the country from my district to be here and of course I must say that my congressional district continues to be the most progressive and enlightened congressional district in the country and that's because of my J Street chapter so thank you I want to thank all of them for their advocacy and for their presence and to all of you it's really a joy to be part of this conference so I think I was at the very first one and I tell you it is just amazing to see how J Street has grown and grown and grown and that's because I think you recognize and the country recognizes that you are the voice for today with the vision for tomorrow so this time you really are and that's why you you've grown like you have because you're speaking truth to power so it sets the stage this theme Ford J streets 10th anniversary it's hard to believe 10 years - happy birthday and congratulations J Street Wow you've been a force you've been a force in the community for the past decade and your goal of building a grassroots movement for peace and justice it has grown and it has blossomed and throughout the challenges of these years J Street has really shared a bold and bright vision of peace throughout the world and when we get to a two-state solution which we will in spite of what we hear but we will it will be in large part due to your work due to your work and while the tradition of Jewish peace activism is long J Street has really transformed and elevated this movement over the last decade and so I can't overstate the value of your work you've been in the forefront of conversations around peace and social justice in the Middle East your work has changed the discussion in Washington DC making peace a true possibility and keeping peace the notion of peace alive on Capitol Hill I've worked with J Street as I said since its inception and so I know firsthand how important your work is on the hill educating members of Congress like myself from advocating to secure Israel's future as a democratic homeland of the Jewish people to promoting justice and inclusion here in America J's Street has been a vision and continues to be a vision for progress and at a time when our world needs more social justice healers Joyce J Street is embodying this idea of Takuma takuna alone tikkun olam he'll in the world and one of the greatest examples of your work came in 2015 with the Iran deal as we all know yes I have to give you credit for this deal passing that was a major step for diplomacy national security and global peace but even after the negotiations the fate of the Iran deal was not certain and J Street played and continues to play an integral role in protecting this deal and ultimately preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon you work tirelessly meeting with representatives and this was tough and I know it because I was part of the working group and still part of the group on Capitol Hill to ensure that this deal was not rejected by Congress your members all of you spent long hours organizing at the grassroots level to ensure that our message of peace went far and wide and not only did you educate members of Congress and everyday Americans on this you also showed the nation what it means to be pro peace and pro diplomacy and so your incredible advocacy around the Iran deal made it possible for many members of Congress to support this step toward peace so thank you for that now unfortunately President President Trump at every turn at every turn has undercut the Iran deal his refusal to to wreak recertifying the deal twice now that's reckless it's illogical and it's dangerous and with another deadline looming in less than a month them and with John Bolton over there as national security adviser we need your voices more than ever more than ever with your efforts we can provide not only yes a voice for today but also a vision for tomorrow and so we have to keep that focus even with all the challenges we're faced with and rest assured in Congress you have many members supporting you and your work every day now like many of you my work for peace and justice it's really grounded in my faith and I'm particularly drawn to the Jewish idea of tikkun olam healing of the world tikkun olam shares a philosophy with one of my favorite Bible verses in the book of James faith without works is dead both ideas teach us that it is not enough to be a person of faith our values must be evident in our actions as well sadly faith without works is dead and sadly right now many people who cloak themselves in religion are really ignoring the most fundamental tenants of most faiths compassion love and peace compassion love and peace and I have to say nowhere is this more evident than in our federal government and in Trump's dangerous rhetoric now and that's why we need J Street vision more than ever because this is a dangerous time for our world let me be clear now those in power including President Trump are stoking the flames of xenophobia racism and anti-semitism none of us will forget the horrors that we saw in Charlottesville last year when Nazis and white supremacist came together in hate don't forget that as an african-american woman I know the deep consequences of institutional and individual racism similarly many of you have experienced the pain of anti-semitism and I know it hurts we must learn from these horrors of history and fight back against those seeking to repeat these terrible mistakes so this movement requires what was is known as intersectionality and understanding people of goodwill coming together to fight for peace and paint fight for justice in both the Jewish and Christian traditions the concept of loving thy neighbors as thyself that also is a central tenant of faith right now in the United States and around the world governments are building walls to keep our neighbors separate some of these walls are metaphorical like the unamerican travel ban written by the Trump administration or Prime Minister Netanyahu's DC to withdraw Israel from its commitment to resettle African migrants and believe you mean many of us have raised our voices and in some statements and letters about this and some of these walls are literal like the one that President Trump is trying to build on the southern border but Jay streets work is about tearing down these walls between neighbors and really building bridges of understanding across cultures and faiths and I've spent many years it seems like a lifetime working for peace in the Middle East and yes even when I stood alone as Carol mentioned in Congress people around the country and throughout the world understood they understood that vote which was against a blank cheque for any president to go to war it was a vote for peace and security and it was against unfettered executive power to use force we must always seek diplomacy and development and global peace and security before we determined to exercise a military option we must do that as we see right now this taking place was Syria this president is bent on alienating our allies pushing us to the brink of war with Iran and if he's left to his own devices he will unravel years of diplomatic work that J Street has fought to preserve and it's not just any run the announcement last year that the United States will be moving our is our embassy to Israel that was a really an antagonistic step step I think in the wrong direction coupled with the continued settlement growth in Israel at times it seems that peace may be moving even further out of our grasp but I know that everyone in this room I know you've watched the Haro now that the violence is taking place in Gaza these protests and the ensuing ensuing violence have once again shown us the need the urgent need for peace and security for a two-state solution and for Israelis and Palestinians to be able to live with peace dignity and security every day we see something new that reminds us of what your work is about and so thank you for sticking with your vision for a two-state solution because it does represent the best way to ensure that Israel remains a democracy in a national home for the Jewish people and thanks to your health thank ya you know you you really have kept that on the front burner for us in Congress and my bill h.res two to six I know many of you know about it and I introduced it several years ago because I just wanted that policy in the Congress to have a ledge have legislation supporting a two-state solution to promote Israeli and Palestinian peace that's how our decisions should be made on these votes that are brought before us does it promote a two-state solution in peace or not and so thanks to your health we've put together a strong whip team with members and you've got some phenomenal members who have the vision of J Street like David Price and jan Schakowsky and many more you know they are on it each and every day to help support our efforts on the inside because we know that we work best when we have a very aggressive inside and outside strategy so you're building quite a movement on Capitol Hill with many phenomenal members of Congress who embraces the vision for Jason the J Street has really put forward for the last 10 years make no mistake the path to peace it runs through this room right here right here your voices today and your vision for tomorrow really gives me a lot of hope for a more peaceful and empathetic and just world in just 10 years 10 years may seem like a long time but it's really not when you look at the history of the conflict in the Middle East but in just 10 years you have changed the conversation on Capitol Hill about the possibility of a two-state solution in ten years in ten years your work to build a firewall around the Iran deal your members are consistent voices for peace and diplomacy and this is no small small feat and so let me just say in closing how proud I am to see you show up every day every day in our communities and in the halls of Congress you are showing your faith through your works and you are healing the world and make no mistake we are as I said it's an uphill battle with this current administration and we could not do any of this without you all of your organizing and our neighborhoods and in our congressional districts on college campus as I understand that there's some UC berkeley's students here with us go bears my students are phenomenal they are woke you know my Millennials remind us to stay woke as Carol said and so they're whoa you're woke and you continue to build a grassroots movement is felt in the Congress and we're to succeed we know need both people of goodwill around the world to work for peace as well as members of Congress and most importantly you that's how we practice tikkun olam that's how we heal the world and so together with some of our for my faith I know and our works we can't ensure that our children and grandchildren inherit a more peaceful planet J Street is certainly a voice for today with a vision for tomorrow so I want to thank you for this tremendous honor and really I look forward to our continuing work for peace for security and for yes justice because faith without works is dead tikkun olam thank you very much hey god bless [Applause] there [Applause] [Music] good morning welcome to this plenary session and congratulations Mazel Tov once again to congresswoman Lee this is a crowded panel and I am excited to hear from all of them and I'm going to go a little wonky to start because the title of the panel polarized her galvanized progressives in America and in the United States and Israel facing a liberal democracies speaks to mine and perhaps Peter by nartz wonky heart because it addresses something that we thought was settled at the end of the 80s the beginning of the 90s we thought we were seeing the end of history with the rise of liberal democracies and the end of the Cold War but we're not seeing that we're actually seeing fragile democracies we're seeing the democracies that were models wobbling we're seeing the rise of liberal democracies in places that we once thought were settled of course we look at it in certain places you know there's Hungary with Viktor Orban and that's very clear but even in places like France where milking the pen 135 percent of the vote though she lost that 35% was unprecedented and in Germany we saw the alternative for Germany the far-right group come in third and here in the United States we've seen the rise of a certain type of populist leadership a demonization of the press questioning of the rule of law questioning of the judiciary that seems unusual in our modern history and in the in Israel as well we're seeing questioning the press questioning the judiciary and what we want to look at on this panel is what does it mean to face this and be in the opposition is there a global progressive answer are there conversations that we should be having between each other and actually I know we've just heard a great job from congresswoman Lee but her example on 9/11 and her example now is something I wanted to turn to first actually wanted to quote years of speech on right after 9/11 you said that September 11th changed the world which we all knew and it was in those early days when we were all shocked our deepest fears now haunt us and you said as we act let us not become the evil that we deplore but with that statement becoming the lone dissenting vote on the authorization to war you paid a price at that time for isolation but you've consistently spoken out and I wanted a quote from the press release that her office issued when she decided to make a statement and not attend the State of the Union this year you said since my election to Congress in 1998 that you've attended every State of the Union but this one you skipped because this president you wrote has not honored or respect of the office of the presidency and has shown a total disregard for our democratic institutions from relentless attacks on the press to outrageous statements to undermine the intelligence community and the Russian investigation and repeated threats to our judicial system President Trump you wrote has launched an all-out assault on our democracy I'd like you to start the spin off by talking about what it meant to dissent in 20 2001 and what it means to dissent now and what that looks like and what that leadership means for us today well thank you very much I think one of the and that's a very good question because one of the fundamental tenants of our democracy is the right to dissent and what happened after I wrote it against which it was a blank check in 2001 it was 60 word words and all it said was the president is authorized to use force against any nation individual organization deemed connected to 9/11 period dot dot and I knew that would set the stage for perpetual war I mean there is no way I could vote for that but what happened was when I voted no and was the only no vote all hell broke loose and the death threats and what some of the horrible reaction of people around the country told me one fundamental thing and that is some have many people in our own country don't understand what democracy is all about and that it's okay to say no or it's okay to debate different points of view so it's okay to push back on Authority and and I was called unpatriotic I committed an act of treason I mean it was it was terrible and so I think a lot of what we must do is educate the public about what democracy really means and that it's okay to organize and to exercise our First Amendment rights and to not go along to get along if we think something is wrong or unconstitutional and it's so yes it was very difficult but now 17 years later that authorization has been used in a Declassified report from the Congressional Research Service over 41 times in places like Yemen Somalia Guantanamo some everywhere in the world and until we repeal it which I try I'm trying to do we're going to have an authorization that any president is going to use to use force as a first option last year we were able to repeal that in the Appropriations Committee Democrats and Republicans voted for the repeal vote but guess what speaker Ryan in the middle of the night out of a 325 page report coming from the defense from the Appropriations Committee of the bill in a very undemocratic and underhanded manner and so guess what we're gonna do this again and we will win we're going to get this done because we need gonna get it done and finally no I I couldn't go to the State of the Union but I decided I wasn't going to normalize what this administration is is involved and and their agenda and I'm not going to do it thank you m'kay Hasan you're in the opposition in Israel and obviously even just the last few weeks with the refugee question which I'd like to also throw it to him Cairo cuisine with the in the current conflagration on the on the border in Gaza which we'll get to eventually in this panel I'm sure but what does it mean to be in the opposition today and how has it changed over time because what we've seen as well is language has changed the use of incitement has changed tell us a little bit about that and what does it mean to be in the opposition first of all let's talk about the meaning of democracy in Israel something interesting about Israel you know Israelis may be the from few countries that from the first day of the establish of the country start as a democracy as a democratic state this is something unique most of the countries in the Moldy destroy as a democracy democratic states and even with that we are sitting or living in a situation that for most of the Israeli or all the Israeli democracy is obvious it's something that they don't know something else this is something that it's the daily life for them and because of that maybe because of that more and more Israeli fill the democracy it's something that we can test and the situation in Israel is that when you are I am the opposition whip I need to lead opposition and to act in front of the coalition but I don't have not like you congresswoman you have a democratic enough laconic Republican party we have few parties in the coalition and few parties in the opposition so for me as opposition opposition first of all I need I have some issues with my parties with my group ok I need to to deal with my parties in my opposition group before I start acting in the front of the coalition the situation today the Knesset is that you are living sitting in a reality that everything became to be more loud the speeches are more extreme you find yourself in a situation for example we in the last few weeks we had a lot of filibuster in the Knesset we fight against all kind of and initiatives and we made a lot of filibuster discussion so people from the coalition in the Knesset told us why you need all this time to make a speeches why you need all this time to speak and all this time to fight and I told them this is exactly the meaning of a position this is exactly the meaning to fight because we are the opposition this is the only thing that we have to shout to say to fight to give speeches that's what we have and more and more Israelis even access agree with the politician from the coalition that said no the coalition don't need all the opposition don't need all this time to speech they don't need all this filibuster filibuster is bad it is damaging the Knesset or the process of the Knesset to run the country and this is exactly the thing that we are in front of to explain the people that to be a position is first of all what is making the democratic making Israel a stronger democratic states but Peter I'm gonna throw this one to you we are in an era where to be in the opposition either in government or externally as an op-ed writer is to be subject to a sort of post truth era right we are not always sure of our truth because when our leaders turn to the news and say well the Washington Post is fake news or channel 2 in Israel's fake news or hobbitses fake news what happens when traditional means of communication are consistently undermined from the top I was thinking listening to congresswoman Lee kind of what the equivalent of her act of bravery in 2011 would be today because it's easy now in retrospect to say oh you were right right but very very few people actually and I bet a lot of people were thinking it privately when you and you did it but they didn't have the courage to do so and so I think in terms of kind of part of the way of kind of breaking out of this set of kind of misleading facts that have been have been created is that very often times in my experience progressives in the American Jewish community self-censor them selves there are things that they think and believe in the privacy of their own hearts and minds that they're too afraid to say and and and that's part of the larger that's part of the problem as well and I think you know I think to follow in your example today especially for those of us in the American Jewish community means first of all acknowledging that this community the American Jewish community is knee-deep in anti-muslim bigotry that many of the most prominent many of the most prominent anti-muslim bigots in the American public life are funded from prominent people in the American Jewish community I'm talking about Frank Gaffney and Pamela Geller and the gatestone Institute if we are very deeply implicated in this wave of bigotry which is making life so difficult for Muslims in the United States I think the second thing is that we need to push American politicians especially those who are going to run for reelection to go beyond what Barack Obama did Barack Obama was willing to rhetorically say that the United States government was against settlements we need Democratic politicians who are willing to say if I am elected president not one cent of US money will go to support the and and if we have Democratic leaders in Congress like Chuck Schumer who will fight against the Democratic president who wants to do that as Harry Reid did when he betrayed Barack Obama when Barack Obama did the outlandish thing of suggesting there should be a Palestinian state near the 67 lines then we need different kind of Democrats in Congress [Applause] and and the last point is that we have to be willing to talk honestly about Gaza Gaza according to United the Gaza according to United Nations will be unlivable by 2020 there is barely any water left there is barely any electricity children are going to school often only four hours a day and that Hamas fares a fair amount of blame for that absolutely Hamas bears a lot of blame the Palestinian Authority the Palestinian Authority bears a lot of blame but you know who else flares blame the American Jewish community bears for because we have been a critical part of a strategy which has been utterly ineffective in weakening Hamas but has devastated the people of Gaza and we need to be have politicians and elect politicians who are willing to talk not only about what Israel is doing in a particular moment when people are coming towards the the fence but about a completely different strategy these are the Gaza one that actually recognizes the destroying the people of Gaza is not ultimately the best way of moving them towards accepting Israel's right to exist [Music] so to me that would be living in the spirit of congresswoman Lee Peter Reinhart never doesn't come and I came speaking a double negative always comes with a statement Nancy where is the role for grassroots where when leadership is leaving us with holes when there isn't leadership from the top in certain spaces and when we have to turn again and again to the same Congress women and men occasionally just step in the void where is the grassroots and what are those bridges what are that what are the bridges that we can make if Peter is putting the onus on the American Jewish community what are the bridges between the American Jewish community and Israelis and where are those progressive spaces is there a global progressive conversation taking place thank you for the question it's a really important question particularly in front of this audience I happen to be from an organization that's been making change since 1893 for 125 years old that we're not going away and we've been part of every major social movement in this country since then so we're talking about the suffrage movement talk about the civil rights movement we're talking about the LGBTQ movement we're talking about the women's movement you name it and I am optimistic because I think what happened to us and I'll speak both from Unity United States and to Israel in Israel many of you heard women wage peace last night it's an organization we support they are unbelievable I am hopeful when I listen to women wage peace I am hopeful when I talked to people from darkanian's Imam and and the grassroots movement of 220,000 people were pushing for two states I am hopeful that there is a grassroots here in the United States I can honestly say that there was a wake-up call in 2016 I think we had among us maybe even many people in this room enormous number of people considered themselves active Liberal Democrats maybe even progressives but either who didn't vote or didn't do anything about the election and I think the women's March showed a year ago and then again more recently for speaking from women that we're not gonna stand idly by and we're going to take action and that we're going to engage and we're going to organize we're going to organize and I think there is an opportunity and we've seen the opportunity of organizations that are coming together I was a founding member of the Jewish social justice Roundtable we started with six Jewish organizations that's now many over 50 that have come together as a grassroots movement from the Jewish perspective so I'm seeing more and more and more activism and I think it goes to the heart of what we've talked about democracy you know and if we remember the Tocqueville who warned us who warned us in the mid 1800s that the two big fears he talked about when he talked about democracy in America if you remember was the fear of what he called soft despotism and the tyranny of the majority and look where we are so I think we have to let our voices be heard and I'd like to think that women are going to lead the way impaired Lizzy and I did not mean to leave you to last but I do want to get into the case of the Eritrean and Sudanese asylum seekers one of the things we've seen in both countries is a rise of a certain kind of ethno-nationalism and an anxiety about immigration and refugees that has been often described as exploitative what can you talk a little bit about your role and you went to Rwanda to investigate the alleged deal which was never really exposed it was reported that there was a deal to hand asylum seekers to Rwanda you actually went there to talk a little bit about this and what this actually connects also as well to the grass roots question because in Israel we did see popular protest against the idea of deportation yes first of all thinking um I can talk an hour or two about the issue of silence occurs in Israel in the refugees and tomorrow we'll have a panel on this issue and I invite everyone to talk about I think when I fight on the issue of asylum seekers there's a lot of similarity with the fight for Palestinian rights and the two-state solution because at the end we want Israel to be the home of the Jewish people but also a democratic state and with equal equal rights to all of our citizens and of course human rights so I think when we fight all the civil and human rights organization against expanding the settlement and against the demolition of Palestinian villages in Area C in trying to have still the two-state solution alive it's the same as fighting for the good solution or the best optional solution of the asylum seekers in Israel the asylum seekers in Israel from Africa are only 0.4% of the population in Israel we are a strong economic country democracy country and we can observe this amount of refugees in our country given them some kind of social benefit and social rights until they can go back to their countries and the fact that our country and I think that's a little bit similarity to what's happening here in the United States both of our leaders portrayed the Israeli or the American to be just of one religious one ethnicity one you know even race and religious in Israel for example or even here in America so I think the fact that they use fear angry against strangers any stranger there's not different if there are refugees asylum seeker or even migrant workers or if they're Palestinians citizen or not citizen of Israel so I think the way that we behave through minorities in Israel it's the same way we behave to the Palestinian behind the Green Line and the same way we behave to the asylum security refugees that coming to us to look for a safe haven so I think there's there's a thin line going and it's not just in Israel also in United States also all in Europe you gave example we can talk about Poland Hungary Italy a lot of places and we see how those leader take advantage of the migrant crisis it's a crisis we need to face it but they take advantage of it you know to be Mohnish annalistic more full of hate and reject the other so I think there's a thin line that that's why I promote the issue of the asylum seekers and I went with another member of where it's party most IRA's we went together to one the end to Uganda to speak with the international and local refugees organization and to ask them if there will be a deportation from Israel to the asylum seekers from Africa to 100 ganda will they have any chance to work any chance to stay there for years do they have any legal status and what we find out and came back to talk with the media in Israel and to tell the public that the government is lying he's lying to the people is lying to the Supreme Court saying that we achieve the best agreement they will have in legal status they can be refugee and all of that and we find out that they will not be legal they are illegal they are transparent they will have no rights if something happened to them they can not go to the police because they are illegal and if they cut on the border or something like that they will go to prison or even more worse and most of them had already been deported from Israel to wonder or ganda find themselves moving on with the refugees path you know going back to Libya finding themselves in the cell slave market going trying to get a ship to Europe some succeeded but some dead on the way so and then maybe they come back to Uganda and they they will recognize as refugees so anyway everyone told us don't let them come here it's unsafe to them it's Jane dangerous they are illegal and please prevent it we came back to Israel and we did that and unfortunately Netanyahu didn't give me and more serious the credit he said it's the ally and I asked today of course it's a lie but that i-i think you can live without the credit of netanyahu MKS on when we spoke on the phone a week ago you mentioned how social media has changed the political landscape in israel the same as it has in america and you spoke a bit about some of the changes that netanyahu has made can you talk a bit about what you would have done in this situation if you were in power where would you have taken this situation with the refugees and also what is that influence what is changing how has it changed leadership and what is it doing to democracy about the refugees i think the best the big big mistake that the israeli government did and actually it's not only netanyahu government even even start from the allman government that all the people come in and getting into israel it's the factor from the beginning we didn't really start the process to understand exactly with refugees and it was not a refugee and I think if from the beginning were starting all this process I think today we've been in a better situation in different situation and and for now I must say that you know it was very funny I remember when the Prime Minister declared is first plan now to deal with this problem I remember I've been in my car and I was so surprised from the Netanyahu declares about that and what he said and I said this is Netanyahu this is the Prime Minister I was not really sure he said okay I need to tweet now I need to say that I support what he said so I wanted to start the Twitter name and I said okay wait a sec you little Yahoo let's wait let's wait maybe one hour two hour let's wait to see maybe something happen I don't know and even me that I am young but I have experience in politics I was not so prepared at what happened few hours after okay and and and you know the story about the refugees the other issue two-state solution all that is the fact that actually the right wing in Israel took themselves the the fact or the reality that they are actually the Patriot there are the Patriot they are the group that care about Israel and the others not I don't accept that I'm actually fighting against that all the time I think to be a patriot today is to make sure that we are going to state solution and coming back to the negotiation with the Palestinian this is the meaning of to be patria because if you are not doing that you're putting in a risk the existing of Israel as a Jewish Democratic state and this is actually what we want we want to create almond for the Jewish people safe and strong and thank God Israel is a very strong country and you know something else it's interesting when our father established Israel when they write the Megillah tots moat I'm saying when they wrote it okay it was so liberal so open so putting a tense to a minorities and to all the groups in Israel and when they wrote this amazing paper when Israel was in the weakened situation that you can even imagine small country very weak few months ago I took this paper this historical paper and I asked the member of Knesset Israel to sign again on this paper when Israel is so strong with the stronger army economy technology I take everything very stable country maybe 55 and Keynes was agreed to sign maybe and this is show what happened to us and this is also shown that we have a lot of things to do and first of all convinced the Israeli people we are the opposition that we are not lest Patriot than the others that we are care about Israel that we can run Israel better than them better than them for sure and keep them for important security interests of Israel and also and very important and it's a very new issue of the Israeli agenda keeping strongly the democracy in Israel I want to follow up because that declaration of independence of yours that came 240 two years after ours and ours was also pretty liberal except yours did mention sex as one of the freedoms that I didn't know that our Constitution nor have we since but I just a footnote III do want to mention though that the language is important and in in your declaration of independence he talked about the the you know Jewish immigration but also the in gathering of the Exile Zinn in a state of all of her inhabitants I think that includes refugees in ours we talked about the consent of the governed than we talked about that when that the government that we no longer have that it's up to the people to then change the government and so we have this in language is really important in all this they come to the refugees I think the Lord that you house was missed anonym is that right infiltrating fraternity infiltrators what are coming back to the Arabs coming from Jordan to Israel you talk about in st. Peter's our IRA IRA leaders some of them talk about illegal aliens and I think we really have as we talked about a liberal democracy we really have to go to those core documents that were supposedly that were brilliant they were done by our founding fathers in both case and they were all fathers but they were brilliant documents and I think that we have to that Lane which makes a difference next week our Supreme Court and the courts make a difference by the way our Supreme Court a week Wednesday's gonna start oral arguments in the anti-muslim ban and those you and the DCR I hope you'll join us on the steps of the Supreme Court to speak out against the the ban but if there's so many similarities that are going back and forth and that one of the among between the two strongest democracies two of the strongest democracies in the world so what is that and that's where we come back Sarah to the grassroots and the importance and the power of everyone in this room and the power of the grassroots in both Israel and the United States I know you want to follow up but I want it I want to turn to something congresswoman Lee you have been a consistent supporter for the two-state solution and now we've heard it from more than one of these panels this two-state solution the two-state solution but we now have an administration who that recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel is planning to move the embassy we have an administration has changed the language that has been used consistently for the last twenty five years about the settlements no change questioning whether or not they're an obstacle to peace what is the role now of the United States have we lost our role as independent moderator of a potential peace process and if we look at Jerusalem what can you do from Congress at this moment to advance a two-state solution with the administration moving in that direction and I'm going to start with you and I'd like Peter to pick that up because I'd like you both and Michal as well to look at how Trump himself has changed Israeli politics and what role we're playing in that role in that context as well I think taking this unilateral action to move the embassy to Jerusalem was it was a grave mistake I think it undermines first of all the peace process it also signals to me that they're really not serious about a two-state solution because as I think Donald Trump said that he wanted to take this off of the table before we could move forward on any two-state solution or peace process well how do you take that off of the table when in fact that is key The Jerusalem in terms of the embassy and in terms of the United States role in in being part of a process that would lead ultimately to a two-state solution so if you take that off at the table and this has been policy US policy forever because we knew that this had to be negotiated and had to be part of an overall comprehensive plan so I worry tremendously that this does once again first signal that they don't believe that a two-state solution is is viable or should not be the ultimate out goal outcome of our involvement and then secondly it signals to me that we are not going to be viable in this process as I wouldn't even say now a honest broker it just as part of the overall legitimate process to try to seek a two-state solution so I'm troubled by that tremendously and what Congress can do I would love to see legislation passed to say no to this but of course that means changing the dynamics in terms of the Congress and who we elect to Congress which of course grassroots organized and a J Street is very critical in in achieving but it it's it was a mistake and and I've read some of the polls that said what twenty percent of Jewish Americans think that unilaterally to making this move was not the correct move to Maine and so I hope we can build more groundswell support to at least make a strong statement that even if this happens that that somehow we've got to get back to them and go table because I'm trip tremendously worried and like I said I think it was a big big mistake Peter look I think Frederick Douglas said power concedes nothing without a demand which is to say that the Israeli government there was always this argument in the American Jewish community that if you simply reassured the Israeli government more and more and more then it would become more and more willing to move towards the two-state solution we've seen in fact that that's been fundamentally profoundly disproved right that the Israeli government is and I think frankly would probably the same case even in a more centrist Israeli government will be satisfied with status quo the only way to move the Israeli government from the status quo is by pressure and it's there there is there's disruptive pressure and there's constructive pressure right the pressure has to be nonviolent that's should be in support of Israel's right to exist but the notion that simply giving the Netanyahu government more and more right basically saying you know on this Jerusalem movement we've seen what Netanyahu does right it's just been an acceleration of the settlement process I think that the discourse of the two-state solution is fading and there's a very wide generational chasm among young on the left and among Americans among Palestinians and among American Jews I am deeply invested in a two-state solution I think it's the most practical outcome I also believe as a Jew in a post holocaust world that I do want there to be one country in the world that has a special responsibility for the protection of Jewish life but I will tell you that that when I talk to younger people if they if they become convinced that the what is on offer is one state that that they will move towards saying the fundamental issue for us is basic human rights and if we cannot secure basic human rights for Palestinian people in a two-state solution because the Israeli government through its settlement actions with the support of the American Jewish community has made that impossible then you want to have a debate about one state solution we'll have a debate about one state solution we will support one secular binational state with equal rights for all that that's not that's not my view but when that horse leaves the barn on the American left it will be very very powerful and it and and it is we're good we are closer and closer to that tipping point I don't know when it will come but we're ever closer to that tipping point in which people will say if we have to have one state solution I have very little doubt that a very large percentage of younger American Jews and younger Americans in general will choose what they see as human rights and equality even if it means the end of the Zionist dream if I land okay I want I want to respond and I want you know I will start with a say does it say that when the wind of change blows you can either become a windmill or become a windbreaker if it's a good change so you have to challenge channel the wind to do the best of it but if it's a bad wind like we experienced it should be the best wind breaker you could be and I think that we are not brave enough and we are not fighting this fight together is to collaborate together progressive and liberal in Israel States together to fight that wind change and and bad wind change and I think for example there are few things we need to do together it's not enough just to talk about the two-state solution and put it on the Shelf like this is the ideal and we want to get there we need to talk all the time and to raise awareness to what happens in the serie especially in the West Bank the Israeli doesn't know the American doesn't not just be doing the use of J Street doing an amazing program yet with the ski area nobody talks about the next section annexation attempts of the government nobody talks about the government trying to make area C do all area without Palestinian trying to push them away from areas city area being a and then they can say you know what Area C sixty percent of the West Bank only Jews living there no Palestinians so we can enact area we have to talk about it we are not talking about it not in the Knesset not everyone maybe only one party or two parties in the Knesset in the opposition we have to talk about Gaza we withdraw from Gaza and created the biggest prison in the wall and this is our responsibility and we have to talk about Gaza and we have to talk about Gaza even in a very very delicate and you know what difficult time to talk about it and Baba you talked about it after the 9/11 during the protective edge war merit was the only one running from one media a platform to another to speak about against the the military escalation about against the military combat getting inside Gaza and also now the march of return now in Gaza the only one the spoke against it is Merritt's party we need to speak against what's going on we need to ask question the government before during and after and not to be silent by the government also we need we need to fight against the attempt to silence the civil and human rights organization especially the one that is fighting against the occupation and promoted two-state solution we need to be there we need to align with B'Tselem and breaking the silence and and peace now in all this organization and women wage peace we need to be there for them and to fight even when it's hard even though sometimes they say think that not everybody agree but we need to fight for the rights to say all of that that's the mokra see and of course we need to fight to save our Supreme Court independent the free media of course to attack Israeli Palestinian citizens and residents like East Jerusalem residents and refugees and asylum-seekers we need to be in all this fight we can't be picky we can say we will talk about the two-state solution but Gaza is another issue we will talk about Gaza but refugees that's another issue we need to understand that the old picture and we need to have ideology of full ideology and alternative to Netanyahu not to be a wannabe Netanyahu like some of the opposition party we need to change Oh cute yeah those are the good guys interject right if we don't get this especially in our own country given what what is being said and given Netanyahu and Donald Trump's lack of clarity or or commitment to a two-state solution what's happening here is you get given feel to the BDS movement and so we have to speak out loudly and clearly and more aggressively why we want and need a two-state solution before the time is lost because this is a defining moment but we need leadership we need leadership at the top and I think one of the Leo leaders all of us we're all waiting for the leader just mahou we're all leaders but we have a problem we have a problem it's cause one with the V the V word we have the power of the vote we're talking about democracy we're talking about you know the importance of democracy we have the power to vote and in this country we have an important election coming up in November the midterm elections are going to be critically important the situation in the Middle East day is that we are need to deal with the moderate exact strings it's not only by the extremists that dealing with terror and all that I'm going to say something about them later I'm going to speak about the extremists that we have in Israel and in the Palestinian Authority groups that pushing from different reasons and different interests pushing to one state solution if you go to then the Palestinian Authority you meet more and more Palestinians that saying very clearly very openly we don't want two state solution anymore we have patient we can wait one day it's going to be one state we're going to live together and the meaning of to live together for us for all of us is what they may be because it's a democratic state to losing our majority our Jewish majority or maybe losing Israel as the way that we know so this ask the question that we asked today is how you deal with this in front of the Israeli people most of the Israeli people still believe in a two-state solution but in the other hand when you ask them do you believe that we have a chance to achieve it or do you believe that we have a partner even bigger majority said I don't believe I don't believe we have a partner and then to try to explain them that the fact that we don't have a partner if we can call it like that it's our problem peace two-state solution it's our problem it's not we are doing favor to the Palestinians this is really our problem and trust me it's very difficult to explain it today because of the situation and you know you spoke about a trump declaration about Jordan and moving the embassy to Jerusalem I'm not agree with you I support that I support that I think it was a good decision because Jerusalem is the capital of the State of Israel forever nobody said what is Jerusalem nobody said what is Jerusalem because still if we take the issue of Jerusalem and disconnected from the old Jerusalem that unites with the Israeli Jerusalem the Jordanian New Jerusalem you have so many Palestinian villages that inside Jerusalem today that everyone know this is not part of Jerusalem so the decision it was good but the question if it's going to be a second step if it's going to be a peace initiative that coming from traffic good administration and this is a question and when it's going to be a peace initiative and I want to be optimist that they are actually working on that and I have some information that they are doing that I don't know if finally they're going to declare it I don't know maybe finally they are not going to do it but I know that they are working about some people the question is what Israeli government going to set and what also the Palestinian leadership are going to say and if they're going to say yes just to go back to the room and to the table and to negotiate again even without discussing the detail now just coming back and discuss and this is I think the main issue and maybe maybe I don't know maybe wrong maybe the fact that the actually moving the embassy or putting the issue again on the table maybe this is what's going to lead to a change because what happened now with the Gulf states it's not something that we need to take it as a small issue something happened there and it's not because of Israel it's because they understand that if they are not going to be part of a normal coalition the reality finally going to be like Syria and Iraq and they want to fight against the extremist against the terrorists they want to fight and they need coalition for that is well part of that United States can be part of that and Europe also and this is can maybe make the change and finally it's important to say I know and we know our people we know these very people and you know I can say something that I never said in public before we said it to Prime Minister Netanyahu once we said to him if you're going to bring a peace agreement that includes a lot of compromise with the Palestinians but in the other side bring peace agreement with eight or nine Arab countries in the Middle East we're telling you that you're going to be got 70 percent support of the Israeli people and you know that and Netanyahu know that the problem with Netanyahu is that is not ready to pay the price about the Palestinian issue because he's afraid from his political base is afraid to losing his voters basic voters and going to this historical options that is on the table today and it's tragedy that we are not there do you have a comment no no I just want to say it's the same with the refugees agreement with the UN the same he knows that the that's the best plan it doesn't have an agreement with one that Oregon that to deport by force the refugees he knows that even if they add that women they had less refugees asylum seeker living from Israel to the third country then to you of by the agreement with the UN he knows everything he doesn't care about that that's our problem we have you know I said I treated by the way and I said we have a Michigan a Prime Minister that's what we have what you know you need to know that your leader whatever is ideology whatever is is you know from where it comes what is values ease is consistent he knows what he's doing I mean like are lying to me like exactly so that's our main problem we don't have a stability democracy needs stability you need to know what your point Minister will do tomorrow morning and you need to feel as the best as you can that in his mind and his way of thinking he's doing the best for your country and not that's not reality today that's unfortunately not the reality Peter I just want to say something about the de su state solution and I hope never could listen you're right but I think it's important to recognize the two-state solution is a means to an end that end is a an Israel that can remain a homeland for the Jewish people and Palestinians who live with rights and dignity I think one of the dangers we face and this is certainly true in some kind of trumped peace plan is that essentially you know you basically say yeah Palestinians can have 50% of the West Bank basically we'll give them area a and B no capital in Jerusalem and we're gonna keep Israeli troops on the Jordan Valley and have nothing to do with Gaza and no recognition no even discussion about any responsibility or recognition for the right of return and if you want to call that a state go ahead call it an empire for all well you know race flat will be split that will be no but I know that Benjamin Netanyahu is basically flow to proposals for basically the Palestinians having glorified autonomy on 50 percent of the West Bank basically areas in a and B going back to his early political career in the 1990s and I think the the Trump administration given that it is heavily influenced by people like John Bolton who does not support a two-state solution at all and has no input from Palestinians whatsoever but basically has a bunch of Jewish former business partners and relatives of Donald Trump is likely I think my is likely I think to cotton possibly it's important to say that the two-state when people talk about the two-state solution we're talking about a viable Palestinian state that means that means that means it has to have a capital in Jerusalem because having a Palestinian state without a topple in Jerusalem is like creating a country in Westchester they can't get into Manhattan it means that it cannot it means that you cannot cannot cannot be virtually bisected by the settlement of arielle which stretches half way through the West Bank it means it cannot have Israeli troops permanently on 25% of the West Bank where which is Jordan and it means that it cannot pretend that the Palestinian refugee issue does not exist right [Applause] I forgot wrong I I hope I'm wrong but I feel wrong boy because you can ask after that tip believe me that she was she's going to be here of course and she made some negotiation with the Palestinian and most of the things that you did you said even don't demand by the Palestinians okay but I mean I mean that the fact that you spoke about 50% nobody spoke about 50% of the West that's been a who's playing for since 1990 about nobody said everyone know it's a of course Netanyahu this is nothing that can even pass in any situation but I don't want to now I'm not sticking them in the name of Netanyahu but I want to say something about about Gaza and about Hamas and this is something that important to say to all of us that we are strong believer in peace process in two-state solution and everything we need to be very clear about Hamas Hamas is one of the main obstacle for peace you should know that Hamas is a terrorist action that killed more than Palestinians and Israelis even now even now in the time that we are talking they killing Palestinians their ever for responsibility that the situation in Gaza and you know that Abu Mazen and the leadership in the in the pristine and authority are strongly influenced from Hamas and from the political fight that there between each other if we really believe in peace we need to be very clear about the fact you want to be pull it a politic organ a party Hamas want to be a party stop being at organization you cannot be a party and a terror organization I'm not choosing the Palestinian leadership I'm not but if you want to be a prime minister you cannot be a prime minister in the day and in the night to be a terrorist it's not working like that and if you love peace and if we believe in peace we need to be very clear about this point sorry and you know what you said something about Netanyahu I'm telling you Netanyahu 2009 he said when he wanted to be elected to Prime Minister prime first time he said I'm I'm going to be strong in a fraud Hamas is one of the weakness government's in a front of Hamas a very weak government they don't really know how to deal with Hamas as a terrorist em did a better job and I'm telling you again if we believe in peace and if we want to change the reality in the Middle East we need to speak with the moderate we do need to work with the moderate but we need to fight against the extremist instead we're talking with Hamas and male having agreement with Hamas and calling on us and talking with him I'm against talking with them right is this railey government has been has to help from us tremendously by discrediting those Palestinian leaders right look at look at what Salam Fayyad said when he left politics in an interview with Roger Cohen he basically said I made a bet on security cooperation with Israel on fighting corruption and on the two-state solution and I was made to look like a fool why is the Israeli government because they kept on building settlement growth settlements and moving people towards Hamas so you want to fight against Hamas I agree Hamas represents a set of ideals that I think everyone on this panel utterly disagrees with you have to make winners of those Palestinians who support non-violence we're probably not going to find the solution five seconds but it does speak to the fact that yes only wine you know it's it's not academic discussion we are putting a smile most of us you like to be an MK very I like it but do you have to stop unfortunately we are very much at time and I very much appreciate all of my group incredible panel which could go on for another two hours you're all welcome to stay with us Nancy Kauffman MK Hasan congresswoman Lee Peter Beinart mkl zine thank you for [Applause]

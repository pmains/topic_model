you chairman brown ranking member to me i appreciate your holding this hearing today as we look to rapidly recover from the effects of this pandemic and get the resources that we're providing most directly targeted to those in need i'd also like to say that i'm very optimistic at the fact that operation warp speed has got vaccines going into arms that we're seeing our economy recover i'm very pleased with the projections that main street is on the road to recovery and i want to acknowledge the important role that our community banks have played that our credit unions have played that our community development financial institutions minority depository institutions have played in helping bring our economy back and i want to acknowledge the role that the congress has played multiple times addressing this pandemic on a very bipartisan basis and hope that we can continue to do so as we move forward in a bipartisan way first i'd like to start with mr delos i'm from tennessee uh very interested in your hot chicken concept i'm curious what inspired that a trip to your fine state in fact uh we went uh i was thinking that might be the case my wife and i took a trip to nashville on a bit of a baby moon before our first kid was born and uh were inspired and had nothing like it in our market well uh i will have to say this coming from tennessee from from the nashville area nashville is going to remain the home of hot chicken the capital of hot chicken but i'm delighted to see it expand i also want to commend you for your hiring practices i think you're doing a great service i think it's very consistent with the civil the criminal justice reform that we saw under the past administration that was passed on an overwhelmingly bipartisan basis so i want to thank you for what you're doing in the leadership that that you're bringing to bear there uh and my very best wishes to you and i'm delighted to hear that the ppp uh has been a product that's helped you continue through this price to this crisis i'd like to turn next though to miss milano miss milan i want to thank you for your dedication to america's small business you have deep experience in this area and you know our small businesses really have been at the core they've been the engine of our economic growth for so long they're going to continue to be critical to our growth as we come out of this pandemic i really want to understand the impact of what we've been talking about here on the pandemic and specifically the timing of the programs that were involved you've had a lot of experience running this program and if you could take a look at the other programs that the biden administration is in the process of implementing since december of 2020 that came through our bipartisan relief packages including for example 12 billion dollars for cdfis and mdis there's 15 billion dollars for shuttered venue operations in your best estimate how long will it take us to get those programs set up and begin to get dollars incremental dollars into the accounts of those small businesses that need them sure thank you um so i think that those programs um and and treasury is in the process of standing those up right now as i understand it and i think that the the three billion for the city of five fund for loan funds and the um uh sorry the um 9 billion or 12 billion that was put for fdi's and cdfis in the emergency capital investment program have enormous potential to recapitalize these institutions and i think that treasury is getting ready to release rules and program guidelines for those and get those dollars out the door this year and i think that helps recapitalize those institutions to help serve underserved borrowers and their communities and i think that what we're being requested today um like ssbci sort of comes in after that and and complements that um by working with different types of uh financing entities in the small business ecosystem to support not just the lenders which those two programs support but also the businesses themselves um and to provide different types of financing like venture capital financing which was not part of those programs that were passed at the end of the year so i really do think they're complimentary you know you know i'm a business person for a long time and resource allocation is absolutely critical if you look at the ppp funding which we've been able to put billions of dollars into the economy on a very rapid basis the the package that was passed in december of 284 billion dollars as of sunday only half of that has been put to work there's 144 billion dollars that is still there waiting to be put to work in my sense i hope you'll agree is that our resources should be most focused on addressing the pandemic on those that have been impacted by the pandemic and addressing that ppl ppp lending program and getting those dollars into the economy before we look at other forms of long-term lending that could take you know months or longer to to get in place i mean i think that those programs pvp applications will expire march 31st and there will be a need we know beyond the end of next month for funding and so i think it can work together my hope is that we focus very heavily on targeting the ppp funds and getting this 144 billion out the door thank you mr chairman

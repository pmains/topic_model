thank you mr chairman well i'm glad to see several bills move through this committee today i i was disappointed that my bill the farm credit administration independent authority act which i introduced with my colleagues representatives jimmy panetta michelle fischbach abigail spanberger and angie craig i'm disappointed it wasn't included in this markup rural america's access to credit and a well-working farm credit system is key to our supply chains and i'm disappointed that this hasn't been made a priority in our markup today our bill would have mitigated a serious threat to the viability of the farm credit system by clarifying the farm credit administration as the independent regulator of the farm credit system stopping implementation of the cfpb's overreaching one size fits all proposed rule on small business lending data collection if we don't stop this rule from being implemented farm credit lenders and borrowers will be subject to excessive duplicative and unnecessary reporting requirements that at the end of the day will demand new costly i.t infrastructure additional staff and we'll ultimately expect lenders to guess the demographic information of a borrower in the name of fair lending if this is left unreported there are much better ways to promote access to credit and we should preserve the farm credit administration's authority in that regard especially given the good track record of the system's effectiveness for rural communities given the limited amount of floor time that the speaker has given toward bills of value or substance related to agriculture in rural america this is this is a missed opportunity mr chairman hope we can come to an agreement on this issue to ensure that at a time when inflation and ag input costs are skyrocketing with no end in sight that our constituents have continued access to an efficient farm credit system that promotes their access to credit thank you and i yield back the balance of my time thank

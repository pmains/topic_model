all right let's bring in senator rand paul of kentucky uh senator great to have you with us you know just uh starting on that note are you shocked at how red the entire country is when you look at that heat map and how widespread this is in the second wave you know i think that uh when you're looking at the incidents it's important to know that yes we have four times more cases of covid than we had in the spring but we have half as many deaths so the interesting thing is when you look at the mortality mortality's down to about 88 lower than it was in the spring so there's some good news here a lot of good things are happening we're doing better treating the virus but we're also doing a better job at uh you know i think there are there's evidence that uh there's rising immunity and people are doing a better job fighting this off and there's uh much more asymptomatic cases than there was in the spring so i i want to play something for you in terms of the the political side of this whole equation um because we did get this virus that was just announced uh in the days following the election and i just want to play dr fauci shortly before the election at the end of october and then what he had to say this morning very different tone from him in these two sound bites listen for yourself i think it will be easily by the end of 2021 and perhaps even into the next year before we start having some semblances of normality help is really on the way you know if you think of it metaphorically you know the cavalry is coming here vaccines are going to have a major positive impact we could just hang in there do the public health measures that we're talking about we're going to get this under control i mean that that's a pretty pretty diametrically opposed statement uh and in feel in every way from dr fauci senator you know i've always said that i want to believe that he is well-intentioned but i think he's biased in the sense that he believes in government solutions he believes that submission and lockdown are fine he's not too worried about individual liberties but he also tends to gloss over the science because we've had this debate back and forth about immunity and i've been saying all along that i think the children have some sort of pre-existing immunity the tests are now backing me up on this it was an article in science just in the last two weeks saying that kids have antibodies to coronavirus colds and that there's cross reactivity that seems to be protecting them but the other thing is is we have 11 million people in our country who have already had kovit we should tell them to celebrate we should tell them to throw away their masks go to restaurants live again because these people are now immune but dr fauci doesn't want to admit to any of that dr valencia is like oh what was me until the election occurs and now maybe he'll be changing his attitude but the bottom line is there's a great deal of optimism that we should have out there not just with the vaccine but with the immunity that kids may have pre-existing and with the immunity that 11 billion people got from having the disease yeah you know but they're not treated any differently you know nobody treats it like there's an antibody that that is actually valid dr paul i mean it's it's really interesting to me and there's even a suggestion that all of those folks should probably consider getting immunized as well yeah and i'm not against them ultimately being immunized i've had it and i may someday take the vaccine but i'm going to let the vulnerable people the people over 80 the people over 70 the people who have diseases um you know kids don't need to burst in line either the death rate for kids is less than the seasonal flu for this so kids can wait a long time or until there's plenty of vaccine let's vaccinate the vulnerable let's don't ignore that those of us who have it have immunity when they test to see whether the vaccine makes antibodies they use the people who've had the disease as the positive control what does it look like to somebody who gets natural immunity yeah yeah if there was no immunity there would be no vaccine uh theory at all um so you know the la in terms of the lockdown what you hear from uh this per this gentleman dr ulster home was going to be on joe biden's task force president-elect's task force he says you know maybe a six-week lockdown nationally would be a good idea what do you think you know it scares me to death because but i think it's consistent with their philosophy in the free society individuals make their decisions based on risk and they will make their choices on how they choose to whether they drive a car whether they go to a restaurant whether they wear a mask these would be individual decisions but in authoritarianism the central authority tells you what to do and when to do it so these are the same people who also believe in socialism a command and control economy where the government dictates all of your economic behaviors so it's not much of a stretch to believe that they would also dictate your personal behavior as well all right senator rand paul thank you very much good to have you here tonight sir

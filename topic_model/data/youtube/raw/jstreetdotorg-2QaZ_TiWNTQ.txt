so let's just pick up on that for a moment so does that does that mean that you agree with the current way that the Obama administration is handling the situation and if you don't what should they be doing yeah I've been mostly supportive of the Obama administration in the last couple of years after they gave up their foolish attempts to cause huge efforts to cause a huge diplomatic crisis because one apartment building is going up in a part of North Jerusalem that was in any way in any case going to be part of Israel under any conceivable set of borders that would have been agreed to I think the Obama administration is moved to the center and really is now behaving not very differently from the Clinton and Bush administration's in much of its Israel policy they also have toughened up a lot after a terrible failure to support the Green Revolution in 2009 that toughened up on Iran and the president has said which I agree with that you cannot contain or deter a nuclear Iran is the greatest threat to Israel he I believe has said that so I guess he would come down on my side of this the question you asked at the beginning so I'm happy to sit here and agree with President Obama to considerable degree at least as the policy has moved in the last two or three years with respect to to Israel in the Middle East can I just ask whether or not the emergency campaign for Israel is therefore going to commit to not run attack ads against President Obama for his policies towards Israel that was that was a devastating repose

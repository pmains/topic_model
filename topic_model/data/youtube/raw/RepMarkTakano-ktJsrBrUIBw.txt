mr. speaker yesterday I stood with my colleagues on the House floor in silence as we mourned for the victims and Brussels today as i watched leading politicians for pros discriminatory policies targeting the muslim community i cannot be silent 70 years ago my parents and grandparents were held prisoner and during World War two without trial and without other a reason other than their Japanese heritage and that moment no one was willing to speak up for them we cannot ignore the lessons of history the Muslim community is the most frequent victim of terrorism and our greatest ally in ridding the world of extremism responding to brussels by advocating for patrols of Muslim neighborhoods are suggesting that we torture our enemies is not only counterproductive it violates the moral code that separates us from our enemies it is my duty it is every American's duty to reject discrimination and uphold our values I yield back mr. speaker

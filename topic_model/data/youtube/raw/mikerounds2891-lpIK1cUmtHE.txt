senator rounds from south dakota is recognized thank you mr chairman chairman paul welcome again uh it seems as though for the last couple of times that we've had you in front of this committee inflation has been a primary item of discussion i want to follow up just as my colleagues have and i'd like to take it in a little bit different path perhaps because when it comes to breaking down the different causes of inflation clearly there is the supply side and the demand side the reality is that a large portion of the inflation stems from the higher energy prices which is part of the supply side issue when president biden took office january of 2021 through january of 2022 the price of unleaded gas has increased by 50 percent during that time period from 233 to about 330 per gallon now that was well before the russian invasion of ukraine higher prices are instead i believe a direct result of policy decisions made by the byte administration like prohibiting new oil and gas leases on public lands and waters and choking off future access through the keystone xl pipeline and increasing u.s dependence on foreign energy sources by actively calling on opec to produce more oil all of these seem to send a terrible message to the market about the future of investing in oil and gas of processes within the united states at the same time mr chairman your tools are designed as we've discussed in the past to impact not necessarily the supply side but the demand side of inflation so if you attempt to use your tools that are available at this time to address what i believe to be the policy induced side of inflation do you risk hurting the economy by using these these interest rate increases when in effect as you've indicated earlier here in this in this uh in this meeting that you really can't impact the price of gas or the price of food so i think that's right we we know that our tools can affect uh certain aspects of inflation and that would include certainly energy inflation and food inflation so nonetheless our our statutory goal is headline inflation but we also know that core inflation is actually a better indicator of of headline inflation than headline inflation itself is because food and energy tend to be quite volatile they tend to move up and move down and that's that's been the history so core enables us to look through that volatility and and so we focus very much on that as uh as a better representation of what underlying inflation of the economy is at any given time and i think it but in this particular case that core inflation if if we're not going to include some of those what i think earlier we thought would be transitory in nature portions of inflation they have proven not to be transitory in fact south dakotans are now paying 682 dollars more per month on goods and services than they were when president biden took office due to inflation the administration is claiming the federal reserve can fix our inflation problem but as you've just indicated you focus on core and your tools might very well work on core but not on those really heavy drivers to inflation that south dakotans are seeing like the rest of the country see mr chairman what i believe is going to happen here and i just share this clearly you are aware that you're going to be the person that takes the fall if inflation is not brought under control and this administration is going to point to you and to the federal reserve saying you have the tools to fix inflation and you're not doing your job when in essence the portion of inflation which americans are feeling today may not just be the core inflation that some of your tools do but the total cost of inflation that my citizens in south dakota feel to the tune of well 682 dollars more per month than living expenses and what they were when this administration took office so we're focused on the part of it that we can address and that is there's a job to do on demand here there are parts of the economy where demand exceeds supply and that's where we think our tools can help and and and that's what we're focused on very good

well excuse me congressional leaders will be at the White House at the top of the hour next next hour to be briefed on the situation in Syria House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer are among those expected to attend but with Democrats and some Republicans furious with the president's decision to abandon our Kurdish allies it is unclear how productive that meeting will be joining the Illinois Democratic senator Tammy Duckworth a member of the Armed Services Senate committee she's also an Iraq war veteran and a Purple Heart recipient senator thank you very much for being with us I had one of your colleagues in the house congressman Adam Kinzinger also a former veteran respond to the president today talking about Syria and the Kurds and I'd like you to as well as a veteran tell me what your response is when he says the Kurds aren't angels and they can play in the sand and leave this all to Russia well let me make it clear the Kurds have lost 11,000 fighters resisting Isis they're one of the key reasons why we were able to defeat Isis in the first place and they did it standing shoulder to shoulder with American troops so to abandon them is really the height of I don't even have words to say what it means that we have abandoned our allies to be slaughtered by the Turkish military and what's worse as president Trump has now essentially met lose tens of thousands of Isis fighters who were being held in these camps by the by the Kurds who've mouths course that they're under attack the Isis fighters have been let loose so president Trump not only has the slaughter of the Kurdish militia on his hands but also he's now responsible for releasing back into the the Middle East all of these Isis fighters who will be pose a real threat to American interests and American personnel he says that America has the advantage of being 7,000 miles away and he seemed to imply that that means that we're not at risk well America is also in Iraq right now in Iraq there is a camp with 30,000 Kurdish women and with Isis women and children do you think where do you think those 10,000 11,000 Isis spiders are headed there hooded for not just Syria but also into Iraq as well let me make it clear the president has now unleashed a string of events that is going to involve the United States military in future fights against Isis and if he doesn't then we are allowing Isis free reign back into the Middle East back against American interests American personnel American businesses that are doing business in the Middle East this is just the height of malpractice on by this president Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer are gonna be meeting with the president in the next hour what would you like them to say well I want them to make it clear to the president what he has done with this decision of his he has put American forces at risk he's put American interests at risk he has now destroyed any trust that any of our allies have with us he's also destroyed any type of intelligence assets we have in the region do you think of any of our assets that have been providing US intelligence and region will now talk to us to the United States intelligence community giving us information no because they know that they can't rely on us to back them up when times get tough and we were abandoned them the way that the president has just abandoned our Kurdish allies on impeachment where does the the Senate stand well you know I support the investigation by the house and I'm just going to let the house we move forward with the investigation there's a lot of work that still needs to be done here in the Senate that while we wait for that investigation to move on forward we have a lot of work that we need to focus on for the American people I'm working on a highway transportation bill for example we need infrastructure investments we need to put money into locks and dams on the Mississippi we need to help our farmers who are in crisis right now so let the investigation of the house move forward and in the meantime the Senate needs to do its job we have a whole bunch of bills and we should be passing here in the Senate that has already passed the house that Mitch McConnell won't let us vote on things like universal background checks for people who buy guns for example I'm gonna focus I'm doing the job here that the investigation moved forward and then we'll see what happens once the house has done its job well what is getting done in the Senate right now you just mentioned a number of legislation you're your co-sponsor of the family act with with Kirsten Kirsten Gillibrand which is paid paid parental leave paid family leave for anybody who needs it whether it's for a kid or an emergency what is happening are you guys able to get anything done is there any bipartisan legislation being worked on well I've managed to pass some bipartisan legislation I passed the the fam Act which is a related bill that I wrote that puts nursing rooms and expressing rooms for nursing mothers in all large and small and and medium-sized airports around the country have also passed legislation to support infrastructure development and also for our veteran owned businesses so we are getting some work done but some of the most critical things that we should be working on we're not being able to even vote on them they've passed the house if Mitch McConnell would allow us to vote on a like gun control legislation like funding for our farmers like ending the trade wars uh we could actually do it but unfortunately mr. McConnell is not allowing us to vote on those items can I ask you to make your case for the family act as as a mother as the first woman to have a baby while being a senator ever if not for a very long never write its ever ever yes babies for years but I'm the first senator to give birth in office tell me don't make your case make your case for the Act I've made my case for parental leave make yours yeah so the family act is really common sense and it costs very little money because what it does is it creates an insurance program so that the employee would put in approximately two dollars a week and the employer would put in two dollars a week to create a fund that when you need to take time off to take care of your loved ones whether it's from the birth of a child or a sick family member you can actually do that and get paid leave to do so and when I talk with employers and I said would you be willing to put in two bucks a week you know a little over $100 a year every employer I talked to said wow that makes sense I would do that frankly we need to support our families we need to support our working families because we need to retain them in the workplace you know the women have to choose between taking if their families are going to work they're gonna have to choose their families and that hurts our economy and we're the only developed nation in the entire free world that does not have paid family leave and I think that this is really a detrimental economic competitiveness let alone to support for working families who desperately need this legislation and when they can't choose their families financially they need to go back to work the family suffers so there's that as well Howser has her baby girl she's 18 months she's doing very well thank you she said her first full sentence the other day she said Abigail where are you and Abigail was her older sister so it was really cute love to hear that senator tammy duckworth senator thank you so much for joining us thanks for having me on and we'll be right back

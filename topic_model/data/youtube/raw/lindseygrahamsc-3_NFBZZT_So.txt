Senator Lindsey Graham has been known to work with President Obama on some issues but this week he laid down a clear marker give Congress access to the survivors of the attack on the US consulate in Benghazi or he will block all the president's future nominees senator Graham joins us now welcome back to Fox News Sunday thank you you have been trying for more than a year to talk with the Benghazi survivors yes sir how many of you talked with none a year later only one survivor in Benghazi has been interviewed by the Congress and that person was subpoenaed why don't want to talk to them I want to know from their mouths not anybody else no spokesman no British contractor Americans on the ground in Benghazi did you see a protest did you ever report a protest did you complain before the attack that al-qaeda was growing in strength in Libya did you make security requests did anybody try to help you enhance security okay so when you and other senators because you're not alone in this asked to talk to the survivors or to read the interviews of the FBI conducted with them within hours after the age factor yes what does the administration say they say there's this an ongoing criminal investigation which is stunning under that theory we would not be able to look at nine eleven and to Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was prosecuted he's still not even going to trial I'm not trying to solve a crime I'm trying to find out from the mouths of the people who are on the ground did you ever report to Washington or anyone that there was a protest because how could the president Jay Carney Susan Rice and all of them claimed that this was a protest created by a video if nobody on the ground who lived through the attack ever said there was a protest so two days after the attack did the survivors say to the FBI there was a protest if they did not how did this story of a protest art alright so now because you have not gotten satisfaction you've not gotten the interviews The Treasures of interviews were to talk to them you are now threatening to block yes every new presidential nominee which isn't in member of the Senate you can put a quote hold on them until you get us to these folks is that over the top I don't think it's over the top to find out what happened four Dead Americans I don't think it's over the top for the Congress to be able to challenge the narrative of any administration when an ambassador is killed I don't think it's over the top for us to be able to talk the survivors they were talked to by the accountability Review Board the State Department picked a team to look into what happened in Benghazi they interviewed these survivors to tell us as a member of Congress who has to explain to the families are there being straight and honest with you from the Obama administration that's not too over-the-top I shouldn't have to do this I shouldn't have to make these kind of threats they should provide in a responsible way those who live through Benghazi to be interviewed separate and apart from the Obama administration to find out exactly what happened before during and after and I am so sad to be to say to the families this is the anniversary of the election a year later the Congress really doesn't know anything about what happened in Benghazi from those who lived through it all right fine we are talking about someone like jay johnson who is the president's nominee to be the new Secretary of Homeland Security or as you can see Janet Yellen the new chair of the Federal Reserve big jobs question how long are you prepared to hold up their nominations and everyone else's people who are going to be doing and need to do important work for the country the only way this will work is if my Republican colleagues get behind me and say to my Democratic friends in the Senate and the administration we support Lindsey's request to be able to talk to the survivors independent of the administration to look at the evidence to find out exactly what happened in Benghazi before during and after how did the secretary defence know about a cable coming out of Benghazi in August from our ambassador to Washington State Department saying we can't defend this this place against a coordinated al Qaeda attack now Katie flags are flying everywhere how could the Secretary of Defense know that not secretary of state so here's the way this will work I'm hoping that they will relent and allow us to interview the survivors appropriate congressional committees well then I will ask my Republican colleagues and Democratic colleagues and up to the Obama administration don't let them get away with this can you imagine if this was george w bush and he told the congress after nine eleven you can't talk to anybody because there's a potential criminal investigation we're not going to investigate how 911 became the failure that it was okay 60 minutes ran a story last sunday in which they talked to the british supervisor of local Libyan security around the consulate before the attack here's a clip of that store because i was saying these guys are no good you need to need to get him out of here you also kept saying if this place is attacked these guys are not gonna scan and fight yeah I nice to say all the time Narnia in the end I got quite bored of hearing my own voice saying it but the Obama administration is now going after that guy saying that his report right after the attack to his employer he was a private security contractor directly contradicts what he told 60 minutes right I don't want to hear from any more British people about Benghazi I don't hear from Americans who were there but back to this contractor they claimed that an incident report that he apparently did not sign that he never went back to the compound and never went to the hospital as he claims in his book to find ambassador Stevens but what they're not telling you that he was interviewed by the FBI the next day and twice three or four days later and I want those FBI interviews hits what this administration is doing they're taking part of the file to leak it to try to impeach her critic and they're withholding information the FBI interviewed this gentleman in Wells and in Doha and he claims he told the FBI and the Department state everything that he told 60 minutes so now I want to know if he's lying I want to know that but give to me and the Congress the full information he provided to our government I want the FBI interviews we got a couple of minutes left I want to ask you about another question on another matter you plan to introduce a bill this week that would ban all abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy but even some other pro-life advocates have backed off this because they worry that it's not constitutional noting that the Supreme Court protects a woman right to abortion until a fetus is viable at 24 weeks you're talking 20 weeks yeah at 20 weeks you feel pain at 20 weeks if they do surgery on a 20-week fetus they provide anesthesia to the to the fetus because the fetus can build feel pain we're trying to make the following argument supreme court the state the government has a legitimate interest to protect the child at the 20 week period of development because they can feel pain that's what a rational humane society should do protect a child that can feel pain from an abortion unless there's the life of the mother rape or incest involved now some of your critics in South Carolina say hey look Graham is up for re-election in 2014 he's worried about a key party challenger and you have ticked off a lot of conservatives with votes on immigration reform to confirm liberal Supreme Court justices this is your way to get back in there good grace I've been a pro-life a member of Congress since day one I was the author of the unborn victims of violence actively past several years ago making it a crime to attack a woman and if she loses her baby you can be charged with two crimes not one crime against the mother and the unborn child my record on being a pro-life senator member of Congress is clear i'm proud to lead this charge this is the debate worthy of a great democracy when do you become you at 20 weeks of a pregnancy what is the proper role of the government in protecting that child senator Graham thank you thanks for coming in today it's

all of this is happening while the debate over so-called sanctuary cities rages on and joining us now to talk about this and a lot more is congresswoman Karen bass it's good to have you get to see you again thank you thank you for joining us this woman let's start right out with that particular subject of all what do you your thoughts on the care of that is this being handled correctly and some people raise the question why can't they just stay in Mexico well I think first of all some of the situations are so sad for people to really think about walking and traveling on a bus all the way from Central America to the border then life at home must be terrible but I think that we need to think about how we as the United States can help those countries in Central America you know many of the gangs that caused the violence in Central America those gangs started right here in Los Angeles when we deported the gang members we exported the problem so I think that we should help the countries so that people don't have to make that journey well it is legal for people to come to our border and ask for asylum so what we need to do is process each individual application but let me tell you something that really worries me is one of the practices of our immigration folks now is to separate parents from their children so and it's really activities go well let me tell you it's to be a deterrent so there's an example of a woman from the Congo who came through Mexico she asked for asylum they took her seven-year-old child away and sent the child to Chicago and put the child in some type of facility now there are over 700 children who have been separated from their parents sent all over the United States that to me is just egregious why the parents are detained while the parents are detained but the children wind up being detained and separated now one issue that I work on is foster care so I know the trauma of separating parents from children but the fact that our system would do that as a deterrent and as a punishment to people crossing the border it's just a complete abuse of that system well some people would say just because their mother's or Father's and have kids they should know the risk that they're taking when they come here right and so we should punish them by taking their children away that may I mean that the purpose of the child welfare system is if the child is abused or neglected not because I want to convince you or other people in your country not to come across it it was their problem with them settling in Mexico well there is a problem with what is going in Mexico the Mexican government has a lot of challenges and how they deal with it so that is another issue I mean we could certainly work with Mexico to to help their system and we are in fact doing that but the real problem is in Central America and that's where we need to provide the assistance listen Congressional Black Caucus does not have the because this you know President Trump is you know seeing himself right in the middle of this this situation rational black caucus doesn't have the best relationship with the president that would be true you guys don't really get along well I don't know I mean I think it will change if he changes his behavior but you know remember listen grissle Black Caucus give you the help well actually we did he asked to meet with us and our leadership and I was I'm a part of the leadership we went over and we did meet with him and in fact what we presented him with was an entire book of policies that the Congressional Black Caucus is interested in we know that he doesn't understand a lot about the african-american community and so we provided him with information so he would understand the issues then we provided him with specific legislative solutions we asked him to be in contact with members of his cabinet silence crickets never heard back from them again and then the way he attacks african-americans Latinos you know when he goes off on one of his rampages that doesn't do much to help relations well speaking of relations you know he's under fire right now with Muller and you sit on the Judiciary Committee yes if you know if you guys the Democrats win the house in November are we gonna spend much of 2019 on impeachment well you know III mean to be honest with you there's so many things that we're gonna need to do when we do take over and I'm convinced that the way this is going I'm not overconfident but I think we have a very good chance of taking over we have a lot to do we need to fix the health care we need to fix education one thing that his administration has done through the appointments of his cabinets that essentially go into those agencies and really dismantle and destroy them we know what's happening with the Environmental Protection Agency so there's a lot of issues for us to deal with impeachment of course will be one let's have let's see what happens but I do not believe in any way shape or form that when we take over in January it's going to be everything is going to focus on impeachment although the president has said he thinks that what would happen he has to say that to rally his base all right representative of course we could talk to you for hours if you want to learn more about the the latest events in Washington DC you can actually catch

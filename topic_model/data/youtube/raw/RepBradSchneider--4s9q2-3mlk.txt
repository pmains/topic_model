Mr. Speaker, On this day in 2012, we watched
together in horror as news broke of a shooting in Newtown, CT. Twenty innocent children and six brave educators
were gunned down at Sandy Hook Elementary School. In the five years since, this House has paused
40 times for moments of silence to recognize the victims of mass shootings. The names are now familiar: Emanuel AME, Pulse
Nightclub, Las Vegas, Sutherland Springs. Since Newtown, there have been more than 1,700
mass shooting events, nearly one per day. And across the country there have been nearly
170,000 gun deaths. Let me repeat that figure – 170,000 gun
deaths since Newtown. But in those five years, this House has taken
no significant action to improve our gun safety laws. We’re not debating universal background
checks or restricting assault weapons or even banning the bump stock used two months ago
in Las Vegas for the worst mass shooting in our history. I’ve met some of the parents of Newtown. We all grieve for them and their loss. But our moments of silence are not enough. The 26 who lost their lives deserve more. We must honor them with action. I urge this House to end the obstruction and
finally consider legislation that would improve the safety of our communities.

John Kennedy Republican senator from Louisiana joins us now Senator great to have you here thanks for being here is Ron DeSantis is he right to ramp up this fight well we we live in a system where both the federal government and the state government share power and on an issue like this quite frankly I think the decision should be made state by state by the state legislature or in in some cases the governor with authority from the state legislature uh I think the the in terms of the lockdown Sandra I don't I don't think we're going to go back to another lockdown um I just don't think the American people will stand for it number two on The Masks uh my attitude about masking or not wearing a mask it's a it's a sideshow it's a subordinate issue it's a distraction uh sometimes I mean my feeling is if you want to wear a mask wear a mask if you don't don't um the the the mask unless it's an n95 and worn properly uh there's benefit but it's only a marginal benefit to me the issue is the vaccine now I I don't believe any government should require anybody to take the vaccine it's up to the individual the Bill of Rights is there to protect uh or two is not there to control people it's there to control government but I believe in the vaccine I've taken two shots and as soon as a booster is available I will take the third shot the the virus came from China but the best vaccines came from America and they work what we need to deal with is the facts and I can tell you this that there is a briefing that is happening right now with the covid response team the CDC director wilinski is speaking right now but just a moment ago Jeff Zions the White House coronavirus response coordinator was speaking Senator and he said the they can now say that one third of the new cases are coming from Florida and Texas so to go back to the White House saying that they want a coordinated response to this virus and they hope that the governor of Florida jumps in do you believe the governors of these states are doing enough and sir I'll point out in your state the great state of Louisiana your sting is bottom of the list as far as vaccination rates is fit from the bottom 37 percent of your population is fully vaccinated so are these states doing enough to combat this virus well number one it's a very ferocious virus as we know number two I think the the governors of Florida and Alabama and Louisiana and and Texas they're all doing the best they can number three I think sure there are a lot of cases coming out of Texas and Florida there are a lot of people in Florida duh uh uh number number four I think one of the biggest problems we have Sandra you touched on it uh nobody knows who to believe anymore and I think if I Were King for a Day I'm not I don't aspire to be I would appoint one person in whom the American people have confidence here in Washington not a politician uh to to try to answer people's questions now fair or not I don't think that's Dr fauci I like Dr fauci I respect Dr fauci but uh fair not about half of Americans trust Dr fauci now like they they would trust Bill Cosby as the bartender that's just a fact I'm not saying that's a I'm happy that's the case uh maybe Dr wolinski is the answer maybe Dr Collins at NIH but we've got to have one person leadership matters that is for sure leadership matters and we're looking at the Texas governor Greg Abbott he said he will not reimpose mass mandates or shut down businesses again here he is in his own words Texas during the course of the pandemic say are important that said one thing that we've learned along the way is lockdowns are wrong during the course of a pandemic so it seems to be he's ruling that out Senator and I'll finish off with this you know I open from our brain room a daily covid report and it tells us where we are because everybody looks at different metrics new cases 43 increase week over week in the entire country the hospitalization rate which many people look to up 45 hospitalizations week over week in the United States deaths are up 40 percent week over week you see the polling people just a couple weeks ago thought things were getting a lot better not So Much Anymore people are worried about the direction in which we are going final thoughts to you sir on on where things stand In This Moment don't get distracted the issue is the vaccine we need to spend all of our efforts trying to convince folks that the costs of the vaccine are substantially less than the benefit we're doing okay in Louisiana in terms of improvement there we're up three or four percent in terms of vaccination rate but that's the only thing that's going to get us out of this let me say it again if you don't want to take the vaccine don't take it and some won't but we I believe in it I think it works if they told me to take the vaccine I had to take it by getting a shot in the eyeball I would I don't want to die I don't want to see my fellow Americans die and I believe the vaccine works and we need to make our case but government can't require people to do it I just don't think that's constitutional and that is where you stand on that Senator you always share your mind with us thanks for joining us

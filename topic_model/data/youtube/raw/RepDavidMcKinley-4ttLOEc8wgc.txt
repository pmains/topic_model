and thank you you're one of the few democrats that i think really grasp the impact of what this we're talking about here today because at church on sunday we had a prayer that asked god to enlighten all who inflict darkness on others ask god to enlighten all who inflict darkness on others so in essence to educate our political leaders that there are consequences to their policies mr chairman the democrats control the house and send the presidency you all can force a restructuring of fossil fuel economies all across america but i don't believe you fully understand the consequences of your action will result in higher utility bills and lost jobs look how many coal mines oil wells refineries coal-fired power plants are in cities like new york chicago or san francisco people working in these fossil fuels are not statistics but they're real people with families we've maintained they've maintained their way of life for over a century but now liberal democrats are using a political timeline to eliminate the use of fossil fuels in 10 years or less now i i've heard the promise of a just transition it just won't happen look at what's happened over history with the steel the electronics and the textile industries the government said all the same promises that betrayed the american people mr chairman there was an editorial in today's wall street journal it was their effort i think to educate its readers on the consequences of biden's energy agenda it begins with uh it's clear uh it beijing is clear that it will ignore any carbon emission commitments that impinge on china's economic growth it goes on to say chinese leaders don't mind the paris accord because they know it doesn't bind them to anything while western nations will harm their economies with new regulations and misallocated resources the chinese must be dumbfounded the article goes on the editorial says it must be dumbfounded the united states administration wants to kill this shale natural gas boom that has kept energy prices low and made the us less reliant on foreign oil and then it ends with quote no wonder beijing thinks america is in decline oh so much for china's commitment to climate change we we can't trust them on trade south china sea taiwan hong kong human rights intellectual property why should we think we can trust them on pollution so let me get this straight america we have higher utility bills lost jobs a less reliable grid and we're still going to experience extreme weather events all the while china continues to pollute so if i could go and turn to the the mayor in gillette mayor wouldn't it make more sense for us in america to perfect carbon capture so that we can continue to use our fossil fuels and maintain a stable economy in the coal fields and natural gas productions especially for example in wyoming well absolutely congressman mckinley and and thank you for the question uh that is what we have been advocating for for years now work with us we have the some of the cleanest coal in the country we already have perfected some uh you know we have started at least on working on cleaning the uh carbon out of the coal and and our research that we've done at our integrated test center which also has the x prize which awarded a multi-million dollar prize yesterday for using carbon and construction mayor if i could i've got i've got a couple more questions for you um one how would you recommend or what would you recommend how do we do this to educate our members of congress about the injustices that their policies will inflict on their fellow americans how do we educate them well we would we would invite people to come and uh visit us here where we can show them what we have been working on we've got the department of energy here we've got uh universities from across the nation here here working on our research work with us thank you thank you mayor you you yours the energy capital of america and and earlier you heard chairman pallone say that renewables will create more jobs than they're currently in the fossil fuels now i i i'm aware of the the number of jobs at the coal fire power plants and gas fire power plants but could you tell me out in gillette what's the size of the parking lot for employee parking lot outside a wind farm you know i'd have to be truthful and say i've never seen a parking lot mayor i don't think we have either so i think this is disingenuous for us to be thinking we're going to create long-term jobs by switching over i think we can find a mix that works out and so we keep our fossil fuels as part all of the above so i thank you and i yield back the balance of my time

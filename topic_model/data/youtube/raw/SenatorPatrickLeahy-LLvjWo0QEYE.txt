Coburn for his commitment to such issues too and I appreciate the both of them working together on this throughout the three decades I've been in the Senate I've worked to safeguard the privacy rights of all Americans ensuring that our federal privacy laws accomplish this goal but at the same time addressing the needs of both law enforcement and America's vital technology industry has been one of my highest priorities as chairman of the San Judiciary Committee that's why decided to establish this new privacy subcommittee and was delighted when senator Franken said he'd be 12 chair it it's also while I'm working update the Electronic Communications Privacy Act heck pot now the digital age can do it's wonderful wonderful things for all of us but at the same time American consumers and businesses face threats to privacy like no time before with the explosion of new technologies social networking site smartphones other mobile applications there are of course many new benefits to consumers throughout the new rest of their privacy like many Americans and certainly in Vermont where we cherish our privacy I'm deeply concerned about the recent reports at the apple iphone google android phone other mobile applications may be collecting storing and tracking user location data without the users consent i'm also concerned about reports that the sensitive location information may be maintained in an unencrypted format making the information Baltimore to cyber thieves and other criminals I an interview this morning I heard somebody speaking from the industry about how this can be a very valuable thing to them being able to sell information to various industries for advertising purposes on the amount of money they may make of that of course there are charging the consumer for the use of the phones and they'll didn't make money off from that I when I raised that point they said but they can make them aware of products that might be in the location they go I said it's great we all love to get a whole lot more unsolicited ads it's so it's it's more of a one-way street I think and I'm a recent survey commissioned by the privacy firm trustee found at thirty-eight percent of American smartphone users surveyed identified privacy is their number one concern with using mobile applications and they have good reason to be concerned they collection the use the storage of location other sensitive personal information has serious implications regarding the privacy rights and personal safety of American consumers hearing provides a good opportunity for us to talk about this and examine these pressing privacy issues and to learn more about it and please the representatives for the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission are here to discuss the administration's view in the privacy implications i'm also pleased the representatives from google and apple will address the privacy implications of their smart phones their tablets other mobile applications and I walk through the bipartisan support in the committee for examining is important consumer privacy issues I look forward to productive discussion again senator senator franken son a cobra and I thank you both rode in this this year

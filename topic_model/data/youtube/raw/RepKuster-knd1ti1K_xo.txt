i want to speak up here in support of this bill the special investigator act will provide additional resources and a dedicated office for oversight of packers and stockyard violations the packers in stockyards asked with passed in 1929 21 to ensure that the large packing companies at this time were not partaking in anti-competitive practices 100 years later and we have some of the exact same concerns arising again it's critical that the laws in existence be enforced and that this bill is one step in the right direction to ensure that that happens and with that i'll yield to ms spamberger the balance of my time

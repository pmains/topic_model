mr speaker last night president trump delivered a speech that was long on campaign things but short on specifics it seems the president is more interested in political theater than leadership and it showed he was very he was very vague on every topic he discussed from health care to trade to tax reform the campaign is over but it's clear president trump hasn't moved on where is where is his interest in governing and in leading this nation i don't see it just the day before in his speech he discovered that health care is unbelievably complex every day since the inauguration president trump has shown that he is ill-prepared ill-tempered and ill-informed and he does not understand what governing is about his speech did not change that it is time for president trump to stop talking about bringing this country together and actually make an effort to do so he needs to engage congress including the congressional black caucus he needs to move from platitudes to plans and he also needs to act on the priority of the american people and i mean are

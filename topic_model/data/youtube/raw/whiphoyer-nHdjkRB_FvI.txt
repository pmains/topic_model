during negotiations that were televised live for nearly an hour lawmakers will meet again today to try to hash out that permanent solution for dreamers so joining us now is the man in that video House Minority Whip congressman Steny Hoyer he has been a key lawmaker involved in the negotiations and you saw him there next to President Trump good morning congressman good morning it was really fascinating to watch that what was it like inside the room there was a little surreal it was the first time I participated in meeting like that ever and I've been meeting with many of his predecessors but this was like meeting it televised or what made it so different having it televised all of us expected after five minutes the press to be asked as is normally the practice okay you've got your your spray you've got the pictures of the meeting and now you're gonna leave and we're going to get down to business but that was not the plan apparently right so that moment that we just played did you feel it seemed like you felt the need to have to explain comprehensive immigration reform to the president well what I was indicating that we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform but the positive part of the meeting was first of all that the president agreed that we needed to take care of the dreamers that they need to be protected and they needed to be protected in a way that he has suggested and that is passing legislation to do just that which is what he said when he overturned the doctor ruling of the Obama administration is it your understanding that the upshot of that meeting was that you're gonna get a clean bill for the dreamers or what what came out of that meeting what's the solution what came out of that meeting was suggestion by the majority of the house mr. McCarthy a number of items that I wanted to discuss obviously when you have a negotiation each party each side has items that they want to discuss and obviously that's going to be appropriate so we'll do that but we had a meeting yesterday with mr. McCarthy mr. dirt Senator Durbin senator Cornyn and myself to try to get a process which we can discuss the issues that both sides want to discuss we believe central to the any action that we take is the protection of the dreamers making sure that they stay here in in this country the only country that they really know and a policy that is supported by the overwhelming majority the American public and I would suggest apparently supported he was articulating you know that his support of that with Dianne Feinstein Charl senator Grassley said the same thing but at the end of the meeting essentially the president said is there anybody here in the room and there were 24 members 17 senators 7 House members anybody in this room who disagrees with protecting the dreamers now he said daca but the dreamers and no one indicated any opposition to that so I think there's a consensus I think there's an overwhelming majority of the house I think there's majority the Senate who all wants a bill gets the floor which protects dreamers yeah I will vote for it so well that's what we're discussing I'm glad that you now have some clarity on it because I have to say there were some moments during the meeting that your facial expression belies that clarity I know you don't have a monitor right now to see it but we're playing a montage of your facial expressions throughout the meeting which at times seemed bemused I would say what was going through your head I thought was accurate I think that's an accurate interpretation I was being used because majority leader McCarthy jumped in on a number of occasions which I think you had shown as well to try to clarify what the president had responded to because when senator Feinstein in particular and Senator Grassley indicated they were protecting dreamers let's do that first and then let's move on to comprehensive immigration reform the president agreed with senator Feinstein and then the majority leader moved in and said well know what we really mean is and he expanded the president's answer so I was be mused at that but this this is complicated it's this president is different than most in my opinion in terms of what he says and and his flexibility they're following up what he's so but this is a very very serious matter it needs to be resolved the eighty-six percent of the American people think that there is no good policy sending these young people back to a country they don't know a place that they haven't grown up in they're Americans in every sense of the word and their extraordinary those of us who have met dreamers are just so impressed with their commitment to this country and their commitment to positive value-added actions for our country in their communities and so as you stand there today do you understand if a wall is connected to the protection for dreamers must the wall be built in order for the dreamers to stay what I understand is the president is concerned about security at the border we're concerned about the security of the border I think there's an overwhelming opinion that we need to maintain security at the border how you get there will have to be discussed the president talks about a wall we talk about other items that we think will be much more effective and that will have a much greater consensus we think frankly the building of the wall it's cost is not justified either by its efficiency or effectiveness and therefore but that that will be you think the president is open to rejecting to ultimately working his way around to not having a physical wall look I think the president has talked on a wall through his campaign and continues to talk about a wall and he's going to continue to talk about a wall we'll have to see but what I took from the meeting was a consensus not on that but a consensus on the fact that the dreamers had to be protected okay and the president was prepared to sign a bill to do just that now what other aspects will be part of the discussions I think you saw that in the meetings covered as you say uniquely in terms of those discussions but I am working very hard with leader Pelosi leader Schumer Senator Durbin and leader McCarthy to get us to an objective ASAP as soon as possible congressman Steny Hoyer thank you very much for sharing your impressions we'll be very interested to see what happens today thanks a lot Chris all right a Louisiana teacher who spoke her mind at a school board meeting ends up in handcuffs the reason is why

it's okay we can turn back to that if you don't mind terribly since senator Warner's here and some of our providers are coming in would that be all right Alan I'll turn the server to have Connors then you think most of you probably know how he's a former county supervisor here in Savannah cami and vice president for CIT a to introduce senator Warner you guys can sit up ladies and gentlemen what are you on casualties you guys it's my distinct pleasure to introduce our soon-to-be senior senator in Washington Senator Mark Warner I don't need to recite to you his biography you all are very familiar with Senator Warner's biography but there are qualities that define Senator Warner that cut across all of these experiences that have made our state a better state in which to live and he's working on doing things for our nation that's going to tackle deficit problems and also jump-starting the economy through this startup back when I think of sort of Mark Warner I think of an innovator I think of an entrepreneur and the businessman I think of most importantly these these days i think is an inclusive pragmatic problem solver in his early days an entrepreneur and investor he created nextel and you all offered me with nextel it basically revolutionized that industry and is was a great great investment I thank you very much it was helping me by my first home I should have probably kept the winnings and invested in apple or something like that but I invested in my home so thank you very much for creating that company and that industry as governor as you well know he brought his business experience to the office and came up with strategic plans to better position the agencies and the government for the long term one of the milestones of his tenure as governor was reaching across the party reaching across the aisle and bringing both Democrats and Republicans together to solve a real structural fiscal problem in the state and because of his work is left state and much better in a much better position going forward today and a lot of the benefits that we're seeing today in our economy in our state are due to in no small part to the work of Senator Mark Warner in the Senate he's brought these qualities who has worked there he's worked reaching across part of the party aisles to bring together senator saxby chambliss and also senator Moran of Kansas to work out pragmatic solutions to solve our serious deficit problems and also to jumpstart the economy with the startup back we all talk about the innovation economy and how we all walk the innovation county weather unit real from the Fredericksburg area tysons corner or abingdon virginia we all want what is in it included in the innovation economy we all trying to figure out how to get there and if there's one thing Mark Warner has taught us is the division has given us a path to get there but he also knows that in if you have the vision you have the strategic tool to get there you also need to invest in the basics things like education and broadband and that's why we're here today that's why you brought us here today we get back down to the basics to make sure we have these things in place before we can take take our county's take our jurisdictions take our state to the next level of the innovation economy and with that I give to you Senator Mark Warner thank you have to thank you for that Club that introduction and for your friendship over the years and your comments I do you know I like that intervention but I do have to tell you one of the transitions in my old job he would have introduced me the way I really love being introduced you and now i present to you His Excellency the governor of the Commonwealth and instead now I'm introduced as the junior senator in an institution that ninety percent of americans think is dysfunctional so it's you know kind of a wild transition um let me um thank all of the telecom providers who are here this is not quite the Dirty Dozen but it's you know it said a lustrous group and I want to thank villano and also michael stefan from the SEC and our us who were here on the first panel and nita who helped I guess led the first panel did you get a lot of questions answered did they bring a checkbook um mean because obviously today I think back many of you were together what did we do it charlottesville where would we do the first first one Charlottesville when the stimulus had just passed and we were first trying to look at how we could make sure Virginia got its its share and and I was reviewing the documents and you know Virginia did fairly well in terms of dollars from both the ntia and mari Wes now that there were some areas where we didn't do quite so well and I have continued to hear from those communities how we make sure that we kind of still get back in the game on making sure we've got some public support for for these broadband services because I really do think you know broadband is not going to guarantee your community's economic success but the absence of broadband pretty much means that you're not even going to be on the map in terms of being looked at for future job growth and you know as we think about where we stand right now and I don't know if anybody went through these stats beforehand kneeler 46 million Americans without any accent real access to broadband and probably another 50 million on top of that who have a rates of speed of access that would be a broadband only on the 20th century mindset but 46 million Americans close to eighteen percent it disproportionately in a rural communities I think it's was at forty six percent of rural communities don't have any access to broadband we see that in many parts of Virginia and one of the things that is so troubling to me is that you know I think the SCC is moving us forward and I commend their efforts and chairman Genachowski efforts to try to think about freeing up more spectrum and I actually think that they're there Universal Service Fund reforms are good i know that's problematic if you are a traditional carrier in certain communities and we can kind of get at that but in a minute here but actually if you some of the folks here might be concerned about that but I do think moving in the right direction towards more mobility more towards more broadband all terribly important unfortunately America is now fallen at 24 in the world in terms of amount of broadband or way down the list in terms of speed and we've got to do better again the couple points other points I want to make is it you know as excited or disappointed as many of us may have been about the stimulus opportunities and the monies that ntia and our us were able to distribute I'm not sure in a realistic way you're going to see a lot more after we finish those final amounts I want to be realistic with 16 trillion dollar debt that we're looking at four and half billion dollars a day app was kind to make those comments about my working together to try to get a group to get a reasonable fiscal compromise I'm at it but it's not exactly like we've got that done yet and the challenge means that consequently the Congress in the last year has cut about a trillion dollars out of our government spending at a federal government spending which you know we need to make some of those cuts the unfortunate thing for for the people who serve at the local government elected level or community development or other related services all of those cuts so far have come out of the part of the federal government spending which is called domestic discretionary what does that mean in non washington-speak that means the federal government only spends 16 cents of every dollar that we spend on things like education infrastructure which broadband falls into law enforcement energy research and development all of those categories and that is the area that is born about ninety percent of all the cuts so far and my biggest concern with some of the folks budget plans out there is that for example the plan that the House passed they would take the so-called Ryan budget concern people raised about it on health care actually some of those things around entitlements I think need to be part of the debate but the Ryan budget and this is relevant to those of us who care about at least public support for broadband the Ryan budget approach would take the sixteen percent of what the federal government spends on domestic discretionary and cut that the less than five percent which to my mind is is an enormous challenge because there's no country in the world that's going to compete on them in a global marketplace that spends less than five percent of its national government spending on you know educating its workforce educating a junkie born its workforce you know building out infrastructure whether it's road rail broadband what have you and continuing to invest in the intellectual capital research and development that's going to really grow jobs so it does force us back I know you didn't think you're going to get my normal commercial but it does force us back into the fact that you know we need to demand of me and others in Washington that you know we kind of get out of our partisan foxholes and are willing to Democrats take on entitlement reform Republicans take on tap two former generate additional revenues because right now federal spending zat twenty-five percent of our gdp all-time high revenues or fifteen percent 75-year low the only time we've had budget balance and not one of deficit in the last 75 years and there's been a couple times under both Democrats and Republicans it's been when spending and revenues been roughly at twenty percent so any politician that comes along and says we can do this problem only on one side of the I want sheet or not is a least in my mind as somebody who's a obsessed with these numbers and not fully telling you the truth so that brings us back around and I know I'm just the filler in between the two panels here ya know hey my conference I get to come by at least and I want to again thank everybody from Mary Washington for lighting issues there's this great facility you know broadband is a big piece of that because we cannot simply if we're going to get this problem fixed we cannot simply tax or cut our way out of the problem we also have to grow the economy and that's really where broadband communications 21st century infrastructure comes to the table and I'm again grateful for you folks who served on the first panel I think happy you're going to regulate the second panel aren't you but before we do that and realizing we've got about four minutes and many you have I've had a chance to visit with over the years but you know I'm here from Washington I didn't bring a checkbook so anybody wants to go ahead and ask the question comment or just go ahead and vent some frustration you know this is a good time anybody got a comment a question they want to make before we move to a broadband or otherwise related you're part of that year the ten percent is a totally satisfied with everything going on in Washington come on I knew that I knew that would get folks out please many of the audience into the first panel even though the speakers were well prepared rerespected with this trying to do is that there seemed to be some regulatory definitional issue that if they're not addressed basically takes us out of playing at all one has to do with the definition of community are not eligible programs for grant program because the Rajesh emission really and it's a really vitally important lee matthews county for example is losing population under nine thousand but we have dsl on select area and because of that yeah I great so what was the response one of the things I was posing how much I looked at the numbers has it most of the money at least out of the initial stimulus seven half billion dollars been deployed yes no David Bernie left yes yes it's green hat billion for us a great right so the three dak million when I was only three billion on flashlight for pointing so what do we do about this David do we need a legislative fix on this do we need a a you know I write letter from a senator Ross don't I put everybody in kind of a black hole and children well are there how much how much of that of that 70 x7r million bucks laughter that 4.2 this is also just you could when you go after a subset of your community net dsl under our program and the speed definition will go up to the vsl won't qualify as kind of pushing me out of it but wouldn't this and again I appreciate you being here on answering folks question but this has got to be a problem in a wide not just Virginia but a wide swath right for the noob recognize he leaves some already because I mean it seems a shame that if we're missing the window for what remaining little moniteau is left hopefully this is the ongoing regular homework there's the farm bills custom tip okay all right well I'm glad to hear that someone here this straight out so let's care some more yes please most of the water centers ebony if you did have one let's just if you did have one where the rest of the community Mike ranch there's only 14 billion dollars parked on the clock doing roots one of the things it sounds to me like kind of up the creek on the 14-man bucks the 14 bucks chopped around the whole country but let's make sure on these regs that we're all working together to have an organized set of comments and what make sure we can water learning way in and watching here in here but we've up with salinity one of the things we're dealing with this that we have population over the amount of really defined anyway we have a constitution density in a private area the logical homeowner association in Monticello obviously they have better access and better opportunity than the folks in the rule area and I think loud is probably doing that having some issues with way they're set up and I know Caroline cuz im using on the board there they're facing from the same challenges so a redefinition of community is definitely needed but a little bit broader I think so that we can actually address the real problems out there in our rural community not just not just the county as a whole in me and you all along with your cottage we're not here make sure we kind of speak with one voice room notice or series an agreed upon common definitions of common issues here with I think we just found the power numbers in each individual jurisdiction one off best place for know you're anxious I have a concern like where how everything came down that it's leaving a lot of entrepreneurs innovators who saying why do I want to do something but the repercussions really bad think something needs to be fake so somebody that goes and you really understand the regulation yeah I mean it's I do think the idea of a large-scale reseller using that's that spectrum or similar types that makes a lot of sense I do have to also acknowledge though you know that made mention the fact on on on next hill which by the way I sold earlier than hat probably did because I saw the one pretty quick to go in public long before of merge with sprint but you know as we were accumulating that spectrum we weren't sure we weren't get all the waivers we need it because that was the old SMS RS spectrum and we were able them migrated but I do think that the light squared if we're really trying to push innovation the lights get weird Fiasco doesn't help anything it scares that out of the investing community you know and candidly I think the FCC moved aggressively Honor this is this night y'all probably this may be like the only group that would actually know what I'm cotati what we're talking about it and they kind of jerked back some of it and it's gotten politicized you know a lot of it had to do with the GPS guys really went done very aggressive I was that for and we've got a we got to push me one of the things that this shows part of our challenge and again this is more on the mobile side but I've had a bill with a Republican colleague from Mississippi for know exactly what the Susan with them Olympia Snowe and just trying to get us a spectrum inventory we don't even know you talked about how South Korea and all these other countries are way ahead of us because we don't even know who's using all of our spectrum sixty-five percent of our spectrum is controlled by the government in one level or another almost all federal government and we don't know how much of that is being underutilized we got to push on that but the light squared example it's a problem anybody got it last word yes ma'am Loudoun counties politics makes Richmond in Washington with rational when I say that aqua medical you know you know doesn't matter which science in charge what what and I I am I was very current on this stuff in a circuit 2000-2001 to be about 10 years behind which puts me about 10 years ahead most of my Senate colleagues but you know one of the things that I would I would just make this final comment then I'll get out of here I'm going to mess up your timing is that I think there will be ongoing appropriations out of the farm bill and elsewhere but the idea that there's going to be some new big pot of money I just yeah I don't see it and so how we think about a more aggressive partnering with our telecom providers and I think the old days of those of you from kind of the governmental side where you can say come on in and by the way we want to also charge you a zillion dollars for a site or right away or other stuff you know if you don't have the coverage you need at this point wired or wireless you know we're really going to have to find ways to very aggressively partner with the private sector carriers and and you know the long-term value and this is going to be hard the long-term value special you've got a county next door that happens to have a revenue source coming from citing and you're going to then be saying well know the price to come to your county is they want visit bargain basement prices or or you know as kind of an in-kind I think it's a hard choice to make but I think you end of the day and I may just have been too biased as a guy that used to fund some of these guys but I think the end of the day the value of getting broadband into your community is going to probably be more valuable than the individual revenue stream you might see from you know getting a good sighting lease or something so so we wouldn't you know we want to continue to look for with you know our us with the FCC with NTIA you know in anybody else we can access federal dollars but I recall and I don't want to I know there were some of our colleagues in Southwest Virginia who turned back some money and few years about I'm not sure that your kind of those days are going to come back so you know I hope we going to we can find a thoughtful group of providers here who will give us some some good ideas I am more than willing we're more than willing to coordinate or collaborate with any real on making sure that we get targeted infinity of 1 i'm really glad you raised that with me in the room but I didn't and behind on that level of detail at this point but will help push this and if we could have kind of a Virginia centric effort on this on these definitions that will be helpful so with that thanks everybody and you know you guys get to keep talking about broadband and innovation and growth and you know I got to go back to the Senate we can still call him his Excellency Mark Warner thank you want to recognize Marty Wilder back there to the Chief of Staff President work early here at the universe and thank you martin for being here real quickly cuz i know you all have all the questions you're anxious to get to i wanted to just introduce the panel real quick and let them introduce themselves not in any order here because I've got I'm looking at the agenda but if you could just briefly introduce yourselves your company and maybe give us a success story recent success story of how you work in a public-private partnership that would be of interest to us I wanted to with us today as tad Nerissa of mid atlantic broadband cooperative you just raise your hand and Ronde ferguson of CenturyLink you Heather burn and gold at fibre-to-the-home council thank you Frank jack has US cellular get married a German loomis networks welcome Daniel meanin of ntelos wireless Don McNeil XO communications Greg a jar of sprint nextel William new board of Virginia systems bounty Owen mgw communications and I think that is it welcome if we could just start with to my right and go all the way down just two minutes about you and your company and maybe a recent success story and then we'll take Kass some questions thank you pointing 20,000 share first application of question fortunate worst application is not a food for myself this amber Benson thank you afternoon I'm my name is Bill we speak quite cute faces in the audience we success story were small independent we operate nine states mid-atlantic we schedule a us a couple of years rebuilding most of these systems without we don't have a definite park success is that our areas which are common in real Peninsula northern actors we serve failure with state and use a entrepreneurial small company does so here are the Virginia where the other thing I my name is Don your ceiling r party wisdom partner we've been able to build a wireless system we been able to come up with some other ideas there's also national thank you all on my name is Greg hajar the director of network engineering sprint Xcal began with text tally Boston in 1995 moved to the DC area about two thousand and as will work with nextel as the sentiment to their very aggressive and innovative company we had the ability to be flexible work with different companies corporations having to provide services and solutions fit their needs after the merger you know sprint in next he'll basically ran two networks yo the nextel network and a sprint 3g network and as the ODMs he has mentioned the news this is wimax 4g became available and he wanted to immediately grab on to that and provide again new innovative service but in order to manage Oh three networks between 2007 and 2010 it was about a 56 billion dollar investment just to upgrade the BVD all these acronyms 3g 4g and literally between 2010 in 2011 usage and demand generation was so high that we set up on a new program called network vigil another six to eight dollar investment because the networks that every carrier operated on including sprint and everyone died a lot of legacy equipment ten years eight years a war sometimes in the ground we just could not service the needs of our 50 x users what everyone call it was not enough so in order to get whether it in the big cities are on the fringe in the rural areas we head for the plan in place so that pan that would repeal is called effect or division which is essentially to put in place one single Network so every spring cell site right now currently is undergoing a halt facelift when it comes out of that face of it's going to have the ability to have broader coverage higher speeds better solutions even though it's still using 3g 4g at 1x all of those services will be better well first thing is that will help increase our service on the edges where a lot of you folks may have service and at the same time not just better coverage and service but we have the ability to do something that no one else to do which is spectrum sheriff which is flexibility which the lights great deal was built up and that again was to help reach areas that starting by putting a pole in the ground you have to take a long long time expensive so I think that gentleman for grating I doubt but that was something that spring had started it was again a deal where lights grid would bring the equipment and the spectrum here be able to provide that national footprint and have that dual terrestrial and satellite 4G service basically around the country and we have begun to hire people that were just LightSquared people so it was getting the job that was doing a lot of good things I guess that this morning's or his detailed downtown and yet but there was a lot of negotiation that this didn't occur sort of put that to be the light gray box but you mentioned the business plan was solid technology was great we're going to work well the sum of the part of the work out so with that being said we still have that opportunity with the sprint network and this tablet vision through similar deal we have wholesale relationship but we are also lose roaming as part of our ability to help reach other areas of the accounting the states with those roaming agreements we can provide a flexible solutions that may be able to help provide advanced technology to some carries thank you my name is Frank jealous i am currently the director of sales for US cellular here in their mid atlantic market we are a chicago-based organization currently serving about 159 markets state admitted landing market makes up West Virginia Virginia North Carolina a little bit of Mayor a little bit of Pennsylvania and currently we have 3g services deployed and in all those areas i speak and across the organization here currently set at twenty-five percent pulling a 4g and here in the mist over fifty percent of wealth in Virginia we have roughly eleven company-owned I and retail locations 32 authorized agent locations we have a regional business office and Roanoke Virginia a engineering office in berk Virginia a switch in Lynchburg Virginia and Pilate a switch and Roanoke Virginia as I said the current network is 3g and in February of this year we announced that we will be bringing 4G to a total 15 we're over fifty percent of areas of the market service I on I've been with us I 12 / 11 years and actually worked with a lot of folks just like you in room I come from the sales side of it so not only putting the solutions together with the right devices but also having the network the stand behind it is critical anything I can understand that we have a total Android devices we will be launching with here to try and support many of the different services that your your family's water the success story side of it I like to talk about since 2009 since 2009 US cellular's utilized the USF funding to build 11 wireless voice and internet sites and rural towns across Virginia the majority of which have populations less than 5,000 without USF for wireless it would have been impossible to support the infrastructure investment indeed sparsely populated in rural areas we will be able to roll out LTE in Virginia with the existing USF funding but role communities like basset population 1388 or voting population 1598 area could be deprived of the new wireless sites in high-speed wireless broadband further widening that digital divide between the role of bounds and the rest of America as is funding dries up we'd like to thank the senator for his efforts in Senate Texas program Thank You Frankie sorry for butchering your name it's hi I'm a tad day or so with NBC as many feel may have heard of our project for probably a lot different than most of the providers up here because most of these guys are all of our customers if they go through and members were you thank you for working with NBC we were created in 2004 to solve a problem in southern Virginia our footprint extends if you look at a map to sprawl on religion the Roanoke South that's basically the southern cooking equivoca since 2004 we filled out about 1,500 miles of fiber optic cable backbone network through various grants from the Virginia tobacco Commissioner government we actually 13 e top grants explain why we probably have drinking problems that other stress in our office almost delicate really the exciting part of what we do is we are strictly a wholesale provider all that means is we don't serve any residential customers we don't serve schools hospitals businesses anyone directly our business is working with the carriers to really help to expand that covers a broad band in the water back in 2004 it was a hope and a prayer we said we got a business plan think it'll work it sounds really let's hope that work so back to commission for a lot of money into it and we're pleased to announce that it is more than a sustainable project we're finding that today if you look at the 20 counties and four cities that we serve we're able to connect one hundred percent of our safety 12 schools providing hundred megabit connectivity or private sector who's reaching those schools and many times at less cost than what the incumbent provider is paying or charging for t1 line so it's been a huge change in our environment to be able to do that if you look at all the community anchors and the business parks and things that we've served that's a great success story but the problem that many of you also see is how do you how do you get the residential how do you get those areas of the county don't have a business part that maybe you're not near an elementary or high school how do you fix that so we have done three programs that we're working on to kind of address that at last model component first as we've done 5050 matching grants CenturyLink has been probably one of the largest providers that have applied for that program grant funds are provided by the Tobacco Commission just to give you some rough numbers we've probably invested three and a half four million dollars over the last five years that has been matched one hundred percent by the private sector providers the CenturyLink we have some wireless ISPs and regional providers that are participated in that long story short probably have about 16,000 homes and businesses that now have access to broadband but they did not have access before that's not a fiber that's dsl or wireless internet things of that so that's been a really good program to help that secondly is we have done a pilot project using our own funds but the company out of India called en el networks they have a unique Wi-Fi system that's designed to work in rural areas and we talked about rural Virginia this is rural India so not only is it very rule they don't even have power but they're able to utilize these new networks and new technologies of solar panels small powers and efficient radio systems to deliver broadband in just the remotest parts of the country we are deploying that in Halifax County through one of our partners it's the first test project or the u.s. of this technology in the US and we're hoping that that's going to show some benefits that we will be able to kind of roll that out to others as they look to expand that lastly we have contracted with the company to do some pilot projects for TV white space spectrum and some of you may have heard of that it's a new spectrum available on sun license but allowing people to use the old TV UHF i said that right frequency deliver broadband service we just signed the contract with a company spectrum bridge and a company called carlson wireless to go out and test that we have hold our members in the southern virginia foot who would be interested we have six companies deploying six base stations and sixty radios and we're going to see if this stuff works and the total price tag for that was about seventy six thousand dollars we're going to see I think this may be one of the early adoptions of TV white space to see if it's a valuable technology to at least get something better than dial-up not as good as dsl at something to help our rural areas of a very effective possible so that's what we're all about and be glad to talk about that in the community thank you can I am Mary McDermott from lumos networks and we spent off from and tell us on November first we have a 5800 mile fiber network and I brought maps for everybody I'm one of my purse though yeah and I'm going to do five projects in three minutes and I practices that times like I can do it that I practice standing active to here I go all right reviving fibre-to-the-premises in rural Allegheny County four thousand households 230 businesses on 36 community entities it's mountainous terrain winding roads and a population density of about five homes per square mile prepared to 70 in waynesboro with a 50-percent be top brand of 8 million dollars it's going to take blue mouse over 10 years to break even on the fifty percent that we put in so even when you know what you're doing and again your capital fifty percent off its Noddy and this project would not have been possible without the leadership and vision of David Keppinger from the Allegheny Highlands economic development 13 years ago Lynchburg Virginia traded us a dark fiber network for telecommunication services the speed on that network at the time of 56 kilobits today actually today Lumos is upgrading that network to 100 gigabits with connectivity to the national lambda rail customers like center health and liberty university have multi gigabit ethernet connections on it might get in lynchburg understands the link between economic development and broadband but say to a lot of other people say to you what he and his team no that makes them successful is how to work as partners to use broadband to attract business and jobs to their city last month Smithsonian magazine ranked Staunton Virginia number 8 on its list of the 20 best small towns in America from their Shakespeare Theatre 25 historic districts to the best-looking parking garage in the country Stanton invest for the long term in July I was the Loomis representative at a city council meeting there where they approved the purchase by the city of an IR you and indefeasible right of use in a fiber network that crisscrosses all of Stanton and connects every school library fire station courthouse city building even the traffic lights and as the Stanton CIO Curt Plowman handed me a purchase order for 1.2 million dollars I thought it should be in sales I mean this feels great but actually the city attorney and I spent months negotiating it but thank goodness our teams had a great deal of faith in us and they went ahead and built the network while we were working on the I are you okay here we go jamar alright in February the virginia community college system selected limos to provide broadband 19 community colleges 27 sites linked over and keith metro ethernet fiber background community colleges all of you know particularly in the rural areas are so vital to us they they make higher education accessible and affordable and they provide training that Virginia workforce and Virginia employers like I need to be competitive on the back of every Lumos business card it says our technology comes with people and those people have relied for years on Daphne Lancaster and Blue Ridge community colleges to help us get the skill to me so we're thrilled to provide broadband facilities so that 19 colleges have new opportunities to share and collaborate and if any of them are in your area you know think about linking into the finally this is from from our neighbors next door in West Virginia I am a mountaineer in 2007 the FCC awarded the West Virginia a health alliance 8 million dollar grant under the Rural Health Network program today the Alliance has a statewide network infrastructure that connects 300 rural sites to the teaching hospitals at West Virginia you and Marshall and the urban hospitals and places like the Charleston Area Medical Center and when when they announced the grant senator Rockefeller came to that not Senator Warner and he said just imagine our rural health care centers will be hospitals without walls each of them with access to the best health care professionals in our state so we are proud to be a provider the hub set to the hub sites for that network and the connectivity for about seventy percent of the participants so my point in talking about five different things is jun 18 so calm and it's going to go but there's a lot of ways to get there and rugby and deployment is worth it but thanks for mention i would love to answer questions and please take a minute thank you Mary I am Don McNeil chief marketing officer at XO communications XO Communications is a national broadband provider we've been in business since 1996 we were really born out of the deregulation of telecom now we're pretty proud of the fact that we've been all around this long it's been a very tough and competitive market but for those who follow that space but over the last several years we've been able to grow our revenue to one and a half billion dollars we're headquartered at turn into Virginia we have thirty four hundred employees serving 76 markets across the United States and five hundred of our employees are right here and right there in herndon our approach to this has always been in a lot of ways there's some similarities it's difficult it's difficult to provide connectivity the approach we've taken is one marked by innovation and early on we're always recognized that we think you know you've got the assets we've got difficult to continue to raise money over the last ten years and for the foreseeable future so we've always taken an approach of trying to make do with what we've got as we just said it's it's really not one size fits all because i think for each and every market each and every community there are different needs there's different densities and the approach we've taken is to address using we use wireless use microwave with mentioned we use copper we use fiber and through partnerships early on with our hardware vendors much as tatted indicated there's a lot of innovation going out there so for example I think we've mentioned with microwave we're to the point now where we're serving customers using microwave with one gigabit connections we're also using fiber optic cable and you can say hey fibers the Holy Grail well no it's not because once you dig up the ground once it's really hard to dig it up again it's really hard to pull more so over the years recognizing that even the fact that we had in some cases you know a terabit of capacity over fiber the size of your hair that wasn't good enough and and we're happy to say that through our innovation into our partnership with technology vendors we're to the point now where that same fiber the size of your hair and now support eight terabits of capacity so that's it so that's a lot of zeros but the point to it the point to it is is I think you know some degree if I were in your shoes I think there's there's lots of opportunity to look at the technology look at the partnership I go back to for example copper many people thought copper was dead but we're to the point now through another partnership with the technology vendor we're serving now addressable market has gone from being extremely small to now millions of buildings millions of business customers where we can serve with up to 20 megs of capacity now as 20 megs flashy maybe not but it certainly is for a small business who's trying to get by moving from a t1 or in some cases dsl to now getting 20 bags and the beauty of it is we're doing it with installed copper and we're getting up to three megs prepare the fact that we've been doing this now for three or four years is enticed our hardware vendors to continue to invest in chips so now we're to the point where that same pair of fiber again there's some limitations like everything that would like but you know it's foreseeable that they can get a 20 megs of capacity over a pair of copper and the beauty of it it's everywhere it sits in the ground and it's readily accessible so you know that's an example of some of the partnerships but I really think that the marked of the innovation and continue to engage collaborations be I think much like you know many of you here in the room there are somebody else going through it in other parts of the country I was on a call with you know one of our large customers from the Apple Google Google is it very much engaged and interested in partnering with some of the community I think they engage with got a bit but you know there's an example there where a building infrastructure in a cooperative manner to not only serve data centers because everybody's building data centers and you might think there's a ton of them everywhere we're sitting right in the backyard of the largest data centers in the world Ashburn Virginia but that's too small to more people are building them they're looking for places where power is cheap there's a good economic climate in environment and fibers ready and the great thing about as opposed to years past where you know fiber may not be there the large data centers the large data center customers are willing to figure out a way to bring the fiber there with them and you know to the extent that certainly everybody can't have a data center but to the extent that it does feed the area I mean one of the things that we did with tad several years ago is in addition of providing that capillary network in Southwest Virginia we were also able to provide him some long fiber so that his IP customers his data customers could have access to ashburn in essence we brought the market to Southwest Virginia as opposed to having a fiber network that really didn't go so uh thank you very hi I'm Heather Goldman president of IRA the home council which is a nonprofit industry association his members managed build and operate ftth networks our network operator members come from all parts of the telecom arena primarily independent telephone companies co-ops see lacks a municipality we are agnostic as to who is building the network our sole purpose is to ensure that more communities have a future-proof option today I'm here on behalf of our member companies EBU optimist Phoebe you Optimus is the nonprofit division you can do and provides Triple Play services voice video and data to approximately ninety five hundred customers in 125 square mile area that includes Bristol abingdon in washington county over state-of-the-art fiber to home network I don't know I'm sure everybody here knows where Bristol it's a city that's totally divided state street is the state line between bristol and tennessee and its claim to fame before put in as FTTH network was as the birthplace of Country Music and home to mask our venue known as the fat the world's fastest half-mile track at the 20th century with closing area was seriously impacted as are many of you with the decline in tobacco and coal there was no future for its young people the City Council felt it had to do something radical to stop it like many world communities city owned and operates and thermo electric utility and in 2001 city decided to build its first the first government-owned FTTH network in the country and it was all designed to enhance the economic viability of the region and to improve the quality of life for its citizens since then it expanded this network working with its neighboring counties and nonprofits such as London wesco and to be do the Cumberland Plateau area of course is here I hope I'm not learn that up and it's bringing much-needed economic development to its area so we talked about success story as many of you know in 2007 CGI moved the major software development center there Northrop Grumman through a major data center there such as Thomas 5 was there they were ready to go and that's in the Russell County two other industrial parks have been constructed and over 200 businesses amount custom jobs that these entities are bringing or sixty percent higher than the average rank have seen lags in the impact is an instantaneous it's taken to the three year the fiber being deployed and in place to begin to see results estimates put job creation do the fiber deployment throughout the area somewhere between 1500 and 2000 high level and quality jobs and businesses in the Bristol area have seen sales were during a recent 12 months they expecting another 3 million dollars in sales revenue they think there's a potential for to get up to nineteen dollars a year and operational efficiencies using fiber which they think will soon exceed three million dollars a year they have achieved financial self-sufficiency of the 2009 revenues of leaving an option or 60 million and the market penetration sixty percent most of their customers have saved considerable money region as a whole is estimated to save over ten million dollars over what they would have paid had they had we do not put in Holmes's they have done this using internal company financing US Department of Commerce economic development assistance and engineered Tobacco Commission great thank you heather and thank you all once again for your presentations and for being here today if in second time we'll get right to the questions who's first off yes sir these myths whatever just some improv actor and the community group to enhance the business model that today says they're not going to continue a place so you're all that so we got a few people so what incentives can the local governments a regional governments do to entice prey yeah Heather get in there huh who's got all in I don't know how many of you are familiar with the community toolkit that is online it's a resource for you it's on the Virginia broadband wire ww-why are Virginia job but one of the things you need to do and if you haven't read through lolz agreement of Kansas City okay that is on a major area but if you go through that even as a small community I have members that have less than 3,000 customers so there are fiber to the home solutions that can be economic been made I have people that are serving 13 County areas and roll so what you need to do is go through the Virginia toolkit in fact my association is building one on a nationwide basis we have top of it and aggravate your assets and when you man and figure out how to take a compelling package story it's been the service provider so that you can show them how they can break that's a great lease thank you thank you I just had one thing yes um we've got a lot of wireless is a members try to find areas of how to get communities done there is a small town in and eating eddington Virginia just south of Lynchburg evington thank you we be the group there the community really wanted broadband it just couldn't get the attention of any of the providers so what they ended up doing is posting in the coffee shops firehouse anywhere they could get folks a petition say if Rob bein were available would you as a resident be willing to purchase that service and they ended up getting about 120 people signing up for that was not a commitment just saying hey I'm willing to do that they talked to a couple of days videos and eventually got one of those to look at that and built out a wireless network to serve that community because they have the customers the revenue to there and they made that made that successful because at the end of the day really the private sector needs to know can I make a return on my investment and it's very hard for them to go out and just prospect and spend time and money doing that community has the ability to do that that may be one way to thank any other questions sir is hearing that scenario knock on wood possible someone's her label the class survey dentistry at that point we're going to have to allow vendors i'm in DC resentful able carries areas why we manage our strategy I would tell what they're our Bibles that Colonel Merrick I do think early about making us immediately but there's also a meeting the other side to H also there's community element it also really exciting development also well I just need I just want to know better understand what else as recognize your dreams kind of data providers what else writing brings stimulate those ideas of those options anyone I I take a couple of things one is i would encourage people to get with some of the places that have successfully done some of this and learn because it is really important to all of us that we have a chance please you know the break even or to make a little money on what we're doing and i also would say start with kind of the economic development angle and getting fiber into your educational institutions you're in a main street etc and then finally you know our biggest customers right now our fastest-growing customers right now at loomis are the wireless providers because they're putting in 4G and all of us and it's it really is going to give us some ability to to to have a variety ways to bring real broadband to communities so you know i would also keep those in mind as we go up because all of these guys they're they're great customers rush because it's only wireless to the to the cell tower and then they need landline yea high capacity to get it going so so those are my thoughts and then senator Warner also said you know please try to be business friendly and that doesn't mean you let us providers walk all over you get things like Poland henchman agreements and access to conduit some of that you know its franchise that that's important too to make it you know easy to get in there and thank you anyone else park is v ml or vaco they have I know that the community toolbox heather was updated several years ago and CIT is going through a map refresh now is there anywhere on your website what are you hearing from your pissed at you when your members part of the competition nationwide shows i right motorcycle are done worse like across Nebraska and Oklahoma things like that we're covered up compared to those places that are quits else certainly a compact advantage however if your region two thousand fighting for deployment to the rural areas then you know you're still doesn't matter that you're not in Oklahoma you still don't have it and you still makes it make it hard for people for citizens to stay there for the job so that's the kind of netbook versa thank you John look like if you have an opportunity go to a low fearing they doing some zoning that's always a hurdle towards wireless development so we might have agreement have worked something out with the landlord or there's an opportunity say Loudoun County school buses 900 450m we can track GPS everything's great extend our servers we get you know community saying don't put that power up its going to NZ and kill us and we had an opportunity where a school bus slid off the road and a nice form kit for what we could call six hours guess what they approved sites like the next day because it took something of that magnitude and it's just gets to that so you know from a local level that can always help to be known as these people want to but this kind of tournament in place i was i bought my first house in concord massachusetts it anything about attitude of concord and old all the town the Minutemen all that stuff up there so it's a nice place but they're very here from the outside like no way built here but literally in their bylaws they had how many cell sites what level of service amid 95 dbm these are all engineering chemical they basically said if you can show us that you don't reach this level of coverage this area little further side as opposed to allowing us to trample down and put 50,000 slides in there they wanted to make sure that they have a balance between how all these other things including all that but at the same time good service too so there is I think I would just add that gun away I came from South Jersey so every every site there look like a pine tree down in the southern portion of jersey that's what it looks like but I would also add that our build schedule for specifically let's talk about US cellular we have one third of the counties here in Virginia that we can offer self self I tender offer coverage in our build schedule is three years out from that attempting to get leasing and those sorts of things and knowing the pulse of your community and where your growth is going to happen and partnering with us early so that we can get the infrastructure how the head of it is critical to be able to bring that Wireless way to the oven folk of your communities because naturally the traits are changing and all that I too am a mountaineer and for those that the water now it changes it changed almost yearly is powe traffic patterns and such are I know there's a lot of communities like that here in this county do so I would say you can engage us early to figure out how we can be a partner that would help the most he has partnered with some of the panel and as they have started to develop way to help them manage the deployment of a fabric department with standing and partnered with Dale acts of argument independence as we help them manage their then we looked at pictures of water tower hospital and we've been a believe that simply been able to bring fibre broadband connect rotation other question from the audience is going to ask a couple that come out of our first panel if not so one of them was we've had a lot of conversations here about kind of partially covered communities so whether it's within the simplest block or you in a more granular level and this is probably more appropriate for the fixed and network folks do you have any advice in terms of health communities where there's a planning side or if people are kind of looking at grant opportunities and other funding streams down the road or there are things that people could do six months out or you're out or is there other advice that you might give any of our communities sure Mary I was fascinated by the discussion of the definition community under this under this program because when we got our our our US Grant in Allegheny County of Covington and Clifton Forge you guys have probably been it that was considered too urban for for for the the grant and so we get the doughnut with the whole being you know there and we're doing that on our own time and the deployment that we're doing the fiber to the home and the rest of allegheny county is outside of that and I think unless we can get definitions where you can do that it's just not going to be realistic to think because you've got it in town that the folks on the edges don't need it or something that's crazy so I think we all need don't work on that on the on the provider side also there's a lot of discussion about the connect America fund and obviously we had Michael Stefan with us earlier and to what extent are you all starting to kind of think about money that will be available either from the FCC kind of on the fraud man side or through David and other folks at or us that are those conversations happening either you need to be like to is there any insider for the money that you got we were trying to push them as you can imagine since you heard senator Warner to have a more aggressive definition then rolled we we will live to fight another day I think on some of those numbers that but it's an interesting theme that we're hearing from all the providers does anyone else have any kind of as you're thinking about these streams of money either on the wireless side or the wired side me ever comments are there other ways in which she think our communities could partner with you aside from the regulatory piece I mean obviously there's tower citing and there are you know easements and access that are there and actually specifically because we get this question sometimes if i'm a rural county whether I'm unserved or underserved I'm thinking about applying for some of these federal funds so maybe I'm you know maybe I'm looking at a grant fund or maybe I want to set up a partnership and do you think that folks should come to you first and kind of you know talk to you and to some of your competitors or how what what's a good way for kind of engaging between localities and companies or on the flip side as you all are looking to deploy within your maps are you then reaching out to our communities or Harry primary and and I would say this is for doing grant step or even just doing your economic development planning you know when I've been in telecommunications about 30 years in our network that used to be our poster guarded secret well now we're finding putting our fiber network but you know that in town fiber network maps on our website our sales people excited when you are were talking to somebody who's thinking about moving into your community room in a business know where those fiber facilities are because you know if you if you locate people locate within you know a half mile of that or whatever that it you know doing that spur out to a new business or whatever is is it's nothing compared if you put people in the wrong place so you know you should know where those facilities are in your area important our community to say will provide these number house with forging service responders in the turn will give you access to their house in the start I think those conversations are happening in different different pieces of us side with organization on the initial way that leach with US cellular is going to be a porgy handset that it's going to come with a modem and then we'll also have tablets all of this is going to be a hot spot also like the small credit card-sized all that's going to be available by the end of this year what happens after that you know really is is wide open because once the speed is there then whatever specific application you would need for your your how the community is up for debate at that point the one thing I would say though is that a lot of folks don't understand that the technology at this point is still kind of talking only to itself and so when communities or talents look at the pulling some level the wireless environment I need to take into consideration what their to point because you guys have been driving down the road before and seeing a tire and your phone just doesn't work and the same thing could potentially happen so I would evaluate all that and make sure that specifically we're doing some stuff with colleges here in Virginia and also up in West Virginia avis and hospitals where they're at building their own systems allowing the carriers to deploy on top of their systems in a bad environment so those may be many considerations also separate sure some of those discussions are happening right now to at the the commission of ntia the Commission has a interoperability for that supposed to set standards for that the new public safety network that congress authorized earlier this year and then NTIA is going to have governance or which i think they're supposed to name people this week actually to that board and then that entity is going to make decisions about their going to work with the states to make the planning decisions about where towers will be built and then part of it has been this network capacity issue about how you share those resources and I'll supercenter Warner we would love to see partnerships there because we see it as a way to help pay for that network it's actually very expensive to build right right no that's what we can leverage it and do some other things with it i mean i think you know we'd love to have that conversation the board ility prior to the foundation which is coming up and that was one of the major topics will allow interoperability to public safety network and the ability of the public to use same technology or use the assets with their own version so Craig has been very involved in all these associations as an example fair tax comes with an hour p out a year ago but exactly what you said we want you to build all these sites provide all of our public safety entities with you know special 700 which is with D block 700 megahertz service and then once you get the powers there do whatever you want dolls and we with that what the technology we have everything we did data that you at straight would be able to take the public safety traffic put it in its own shoot if you will so it cannot be touched using that same asset and even using 700 if it was available effective left a typical old and the Queen's allow that traffic to be commercialized and then you kind of can fold that into the rest of us / assets you know in Virginia and again what you come down to is a device should be a device that has the brain and technology have multiple chipsets and we can do that but the challenge that as you conspirators change was every county across America putting out an hour feed the interoperability so that was what this first interoperability boy is like get the national network out set some parameters allow some opt out options for states and communities who say look we really think we could manage it on ourselves but we'll take the lexical hilarious the the road is being paved to a lot of that kind of service said and you know our guys he was asked how are you doing this network how you doing this thing you could put out a network a lot of different vendors to build it and yet provide interoperability and provide service there's definitely not a lot of policy and politics around that network for the last year and a half certainly are there any other questions I wanna be respectful of your time since you all have given us more than two hours today great well i'm nita again for Senator Warner my colleagues Kelly and Caitlin are in the room too if we can answer questions or if you'd like contact information or anything I'd like to very much thank hat before graciously serving as our real moderator and taking care of this panel and to all the providers we really appreciate y'all coming out I know it's a lot of detailed questions here and then last but not least I like to thank David villano who stayed the whole time and because our us as you can see by that list of programs that they work on I mean they really are stretched in a million different directions and they've been incredibly helpful to us so if you've got an issue in the community where you're partnering with them certainly let us know David hears from most probably more than he wants to but they've been really helpful and if we can facilitator or get you more information and make something happen more quickly we'd love to do that so I'm good to meet you all and hope you enjoy the rest of the week thanks I'm gonna give it back like hell I will okay good I figured

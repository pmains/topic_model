reaction now from south carolina republican congresswoman nancy mace congresswoman it's always great to see you back on the show wonderful to see you today you've been saying that businesses are the ones that are suffering because of the government incentivizing unemployment it seems like it's winding down right now but it's still a problem and it's still something that we're going to be watching um potentially until labor day right and until those benefits actually run out i mean what are the odds if you're why would you go work hard for 40 hours a week when you can just stay home and make that much what you were making in your wage or your salary or more in some cases in south carolina many folks on unemployment were actually making more than they were when they were at work so why would you go back to work and when governor mcmaster south carolina was the second state in the country right behind montana to announce that we would forego the federal unemployment benefits the extra 300 a week at the end of this month in the first week after that the week of june 6 our unemployment claims went down by i believe just over 50 percent for that week and so you're seeing states that are going to forego that the unemployment claims are going down and the opportunities to work are increasing it's a great opportunity for folks who are ready to get back to work in blake berman's report just there we had a sound by from brian diese and he talked about these payments as being a lifeline critical to certain americans who who needed them i'm not going to say and do a blanket generalization and say that everybody needed them or everybody didn't right the truth is probably somewhere in between but was there a way that the administration could have balanced this a little bit better especially when it knew again and signed the legislation in march that the coronavirus situation with vaccines coming out and being rolled out in a timely fashion it was going to improve rather quickly could they have managed this better i think it could have been done sooner and we see state like south carolina there's 89 000 jobs available on the market today and we've got approximately 116 000 people in unemployment right now and so if you want a job you can have a job and one of the things that's really been been stopping businesses from growing those that are struggling is the fact they cannot get people to work and so when we forego that extra federal unemployment check there's still state unemployment benefits but we could have done it too by looking at how much they were making before and maybe making it two-thirds or three-quarters of their salary i think there's a lot of different ways that this could be handled or the federal unemployment could have ended sooner but one of the reasons we are i think stagnant in some of our growth in some sectors is because people just don't want to go back to work and one more question before i move on just just sticking on this point is is you know the administration was talking about 15 an hour as a federal minimum wage raising it that was something that went away because there was too much opposition but as a result of what we're seeing with respect to the recovery and the pandemic and these payments you're seeing the wages have to go up to get people back to work this is almost an unintended consequence or perhaps intended as a result of what we've seen if the federal government only knew the consequences of supply and demand in a free market you've seen you've seen fast food franchises like mcdonald's pay people fifty dollars cash just show up just show up to an interview not even take the job we saw papa john's in atlanta offering two thousand dollar signing bonuses and so if you have an opportunity to get a job today before all this federal unemployment this is the time to negotiate a better wage a better salary better benefits for you and your family this is great opportunity right now and when there's that kind of demand for jobs wages will go up naturally as a product of the market right meanwhile i do want to switch gears while we have you and talk about infrastructure talks they're continuing on capitol hill some of the progressive lawmakers out there simply want to abandon bipartisanship right all together as they push for this nearly six trillion dollars in spending and there are some concerns that you know look if we pump so much money into the economy we're going to increase this inflation problem jerome powell already saying um you know that's an issue it's an issue and the fed is going to have to react but listen to this my colleague senator sanders you said at one point with regard to the six trillion dollar package the list goes on and on and and that's the problem i mean that it's not about infrastructure it's kind of a six trillion dollar grab bag of progressive priorities the cost is rising through the roof i mean you can't buy a home uh the cost of home prices and and remember a home is core part of the american dream so what does that mean you basically get priced out of owning part of the american dream everything is going up this is a problem we have to control the spending it is a problem congresswoman and i can tell you specifically here in new york city we were so beaten down by the pandemic we're trying to reopen get back on our feet but you can feel the inflation you can feel the price rises they're palpable what that says to me is that people are not going to be able to afford to come back as quickly as perhaps as they were planning and i really wonder about the future of this city and then i look at it as a microcosm of things that are happening across the country as well because of this spending no absolutely and inflation is taxation and you saw the feds last year they printed four trillion dollars they're they're on par to print another four trillion dollars adding to this and washington wants to do the infrastructure and any spending through budget reconciliation which is one-sided when we did the coveted relief package at that 1.9 trillion not a single republican amendment passed and in the infrastructure package alone we're talking art we're talking sculptures we're talking landscaping things that absolutely have nothing to do with filling a pothole in this country and when i go to the grocery store today i'm shopping on the exterior i'll meet fruit and vegetables because the cost of groceries have gone up 21 the cost of lumber to build a house up 381 percent which means to build a house today over last year it's 30 percent more expensive today than it was a year ago and after colonial pipeline we all saw guys gas prices go up my gas prices have stayed up they haven't gone back down well that's the problem right you see these price rises whether it's at the pump whether it's at a restaurant whether it's the grocery store and and i always when i used to report on energy i would say the prices go up real fast and then they're much slower to come back down um and that's not just with gas you know i think about a restaurant that's raised prices 30 what are they going to magically overnight say oh you know what we're going to decrease our prices 30 now not at all since they've seen some people can't afford it and that's the only way they can keep their doors open is by raising prices and it's going to be astronomical in the future it's untenable for the long term for the american people i don't think we've seen the worst of it yet you bring up a great point congresswoman thank you so much for your time today wonderful to see you thank you

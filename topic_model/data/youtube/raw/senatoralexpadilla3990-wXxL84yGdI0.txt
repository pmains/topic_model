A SENATOR: MR. PRESIDENT. THE PRESIDING OFFICER: THE SENATOR FROM CALIFORNIA. MR. PADILLA: THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. MR. PRESIDENT, THE FIRST THING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT PICKING RADISHES IS THAT IT IS HARD WORK YOU HAVE TO WORK LITERALLY ON YOUR KNEES, AND YOU PICK EACH RADISH OUT OF THE GROUND BY HAND. NO MACHINES, NO TOOLS. I LEARNED HOW TO PICK RADISHES AND PARSLEY ABOUT THREE WEEKS AGO WHEN I RECEIVED AN INVITATION FROM THE UNITED FARM WORKERS AND THE U.F.W. FOUNDATION TO SPEND A DAY WORKING ALONGSIDE THEM IN CALIFORNIA. I SAID COUNTLESS TIMES THAT DAY IN AND DAY OUT FARM WORKERS SHOW UP TO SOME OF THE HARDEST JOBS IN AMERICA. AND I'VE ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT FARM WORKERS ARE ESSENTIAL, BUT NOT UNTIL THAT DAY DID I APPRECIATE THE PHYSICAL DEMANDS OF LONG HOURS ON ONE'S KNEES UNDER THE SUN. MR. PRESIDENT, MANY OF THE WORKERS PICKING RADISHES ARE OLDER THAN I AM AND HAVE WORKED IN THE FIELDS FOR DECADES. THEY HAVE LABORED THROUGH HEAT WAVES, THROUGH STORMS, WILDFIRE SMOKE, AND MORE. THEY HAVE LABORED THROUGH A GLOBAL HEALTH PANDEMIC. AND THEY ARE THE BACKBONE OF OUR ECONOMY, HELPING KEEP FOOD ON OUR TABLES. AND YET, THE MAJORITY OF FARM WORKERS DON'T HAVE LEGAL STATUS TO LIVE AND WORK IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THAT INCLUDES THOSE WHO I WORKED ALONGSIDE PICKING RADISHES. PEOPLE LIKE EFRIN, WHO HAS WORKED ON AMERICAN FARMS MORE THAN 40 YEARS. AND PATRICIA, WHO HAS RAISED HER CHILDREN HERE. NOW SEVERAL OF THEM TOLD ME THAT ONE OF THE HARDEST PARTS OF BEING UNDOCUMENTED WAS BEING CUT OFF FROM THEIR FAMILIES IN MEXICO OR OTHER COUNTRIES. BEING DENIED THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THEIR MOTHER OR THEIR FATHER ONE LAST TIME BEFORE PASSING AWAY, OR TO ATTEND THEIR FUNERAL TO PAY THEIR LAST RESPECTS. IMAGINE THAT HEARTBREAKING CHOICE. NEVER SEEING YOUR PARENTS AGAIN BECAUSE DOING SO MEANS RISKING NOT BEING ABLE TO SEE YOUR CHILDREN EVER AGAIN. THAT IS THE FATE THAT WE ARE FORCING ON COUNTLESS UNDOCUMENTED FARM WORKERS WHO FILL OUR GROCERY STORES WITH FRUIT AND VEGETABLES. THIS IS THE CHOICE THAT WE EXACERBATE EVERY TIME WE PUSH IMMIGRATION REFORM OFF ANOTHER MONTH, ANOTHER YEAR, ANOTHER SESSION OF CONGRESS. AND THIS IS WHY WE MUST PASS LEGISLATION THAT CREATES A PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP FOR FARM WORKERS. MR. PRESIDENT, DID YOU KNOW THAT WHEN YOU PICK RADISHES, YOU GET PAID BY THE NUMBER OF CRATES THAT YOU FILL? ON THE DAY THAT I WORKED THE FIELDS, IT COMES AS NO SURPRISE THAT I PICKED AT A SLOWER RATE THAN THE HIGHLY SKILLED AND EXPERIENCED FARM WORKERS WHO DEPEND ON SPEED FOR THEIR LIVELIHOOD. LAWS ACROSS THE COUNTRY LEAVE FARM WORKERS IN A POSITION OF UNCERTAINTY THAT FEW OTHER WORKERS HAVE TO FACE. IF YOU'RE A FARM WORKER AND YOU MISS A DAY OF WORK, THERE IS NO PAID SICK LEAVE. IF YOU'RE A FARM WORKER AND YOU'RE INJURED ON THE JOB, YOU CAN'T GET DISABILITY INSURANCE. AND LIVING AND WORKING WHILE UNDOCUMENTED MEANS WORRYING CONSTANTLY ABOUT YOUR STATUS. SO WHEN THE SENATE SAYS IMMIGRATION REFORM CAN WAIT, WE ARE NOT SEEING THE PEOPLE WHOSE LIVES ARE AT STAKE. YOU -- ARMANDO ISABELLA. MR. PRESIDENT, AS THEY PICK RADISHES, THESE WORKERS ARE NOT TAKING JOBS FROM AMERICAN CITIZENS. I REPEAT, THEY ARE NOT TAKING THE JOBS OF AMERICAN CITIZENS. IN FACT, THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE. WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FARM WORKERS TO MEET THE DEMAND. NOT JUST FOR RADISHES, BUT FOR COUNTLESS OTHER CROPS. AS DIFFERENT PRODUCE COMES INTO SEASON, GROWERS NEED SKILLED LABOR ON TIGHT TIMELINES. CORPORATE LEADERS, SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS, AND ECONOMISTS AGREE WE NEED MORE IMMIGRANTS WITH MORE PROTECTIONS, AND THE STAKES FOR OUR ECONOMY ARE HIGH. RIGHT NOW AMERICAN FAMILIES ARE PAYING HIGHER PRICES NOT JUST AT THE GAS PUMP, BUT AT THE GROCERY STORE. OUR LABOR SHORTAGE IS CONTRIBUTING TO HIGHER INFLATION. OVER $1 TRILLION OF AMERICA'S G.D.P. IS LINKED TO AGRICULTURE. ALL ACROSS THE NATION WE RELY ON IMMIGRANT FARM HE WORKERS. IN NORTH CAROLINA, AGRICULTURE IS THE TOP INDUSTRY, AIDED BY TENS OF THOUSANDS OF UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS GROWING SOYBEAN, CORN, AND PEANUTS. IN IDAHO, AGRICULTURE ACCOUNTS FOR 17% OF ECONOMIC OUTPUT, INCLUDING A BOOMING DAIRY INDUSTRY. AROUND 90% OF IDAHO'S DAIRY WORKERS ARE FOREIGN-BORN, AND THE VAST MAJORITY UNDOCUMENTED. IN TEXAS, AGRICULTURE IS WORTH MORE THAN $20 BILLION EACH YEAR, MORE THAN 100,000 IMMIGRANT WORKERS, MOSTLY UNDOCUMENTED, ARE EMPLOYED ON TEXAS' RANCHES, FARMS, AND FIELDS. I CAN GO ON AND ON, BUT I THINK THE POINT IS CLEAR. THIS IS TRULY A NATIONAL ISSUE. THE MAJORITY OF ALL FARM WORKERS LACK LEGAL STATUS, AND GROWERS SAY THAT MORE HELP IS NEEDED. CONGRESS CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE. WE CAN DO SO BY PASSING THE LAWS THAT FARM WORKERS NEED AND DESERVE. OUR COUNTRY CANNOT AFFORD TO WAIT. THAT'S WHY AS MY FIRST BILL I INTRODUCED THE CITIZENSHIP FOR ESSENTIAL WORKERS ACT WHEN I JOINED THE SENATE LAST YEAR. TALK ABOUT WORKERS WHO KEEP US HEALTHY AND SAFE AND FED, THE WORKERS WHO WE AS A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAVE DEEMED ESSENTIAL, THEY DESERVE DIGNITY. THEY DESERVE RESPECT. AND THEY HAVE EARNED A PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP. TODAY I'M ALSO PROUD TO INTRODUCE THE FAIRNESS FOR FARM WORKERS ACT. NOW THIS BILL WILL SUPPORT FAIR PAY FOR AGRICULTURAL WORKERS UNDER THE FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT. MR. PRESIDENT, IN ONE DAY I HAD JUST A SMALL DOSE OF THE PHYSICALLY DEMANDING LIFE OF FARM WORKERS. STILL THERE'S SO MUCH MORE THAT I COULD TELL YOU ABOUT THE KIND, FUNNY, GENEROUS INDIVIDUALS THAT I WORKED ALONGSIDE THAT DAY. AS WE SHARED A LUNCH OF HOME MADE TORTILLAS, BEANS, CHILI, THEY TOLD ME ABOUT THEIR HOMETOWNS THAT THEY MISS, THEIR FAVORITE MUSIC, AND THEIR DREAMS FOR THEIR CHILDREN. AND THEY HAD ONE MORE MESSAGE THAT THEY ASKED ME TO DELIVER, THEY IMPLORED ME TO DELIVER TO ALL OF YOU, AND THAT IS THAT YOU SHOULD COME TOO. I WAS THE FIRST UNITED STATES SENATOR TO ACCEPT AN INVITATION TO WORK IN THE FIELDS. LAST WEEK MY FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE, SENATOR BOOKER, BECAME THE SECOND. I URGE YOU, EACH AND EVERY MEMBER OF THE THE SENATE TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY, TAKE A DAY TO WORK ALONGSIDE THE HEROES WHO FEED AMERICA. AND THEN COME BACK HERE, AS I HAVE, HUMBLED AND INSPIRED TO DO OUR JOB. LET'S COME TOGETHER BEHIND A SOLUTION SO FARM WORKERS CAN FINALLY LIVE AND WORK WITH DIGNITY AND SECURITY. THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT

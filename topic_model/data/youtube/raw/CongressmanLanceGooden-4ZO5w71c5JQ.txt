thank you very much William all right Lance good is here a Republican of Texas serves on the House Financial Services Committee more to the point as a Texas congressman is right in the neck of the woods that we're talking about congressman thanks for taking the time thanks for having me um a lot of details we don't know concerns now that this group might have in fact been a target and that these three SUVs in which they were traveling that were far apart they weren't traveling together or could be easily mistaken for example as a another cartel what do you make of all this what have you learned well first of all violence at the border is no surprise but of this magnitude just seems especially sickening and these are American lives that were lost what's alarming to me is the lack of the national outrage normally this would be the number one story in America I would think nine American lives brutally murdered in a heinous fashion but this country is talking about impeachment and election results last night in Kentucky Virginia wherever but let me get your sense though that it might have been you know not an accidental type of thing and that the proof of that was that you know one of the mothers around three women were killed then six children actually came out of the car frantically waving our arms stop stop stop she was gunned down so it looks like they knew full well who they were targeting yeah and you know they I believe lived in that area for viewers who haven't really followed this there is a history of migration of Mormon communities in the northern part of Mexico which I didn't know before this week and I this was an early Iran advocates of polygamy and even though they didn't practice it in this particular compound for lack of a better term but it just raises a lot of questions here so for Americans in that neck of the woods whether they're part of this group broader groups they're caught up in this now that's right and you know this isn't a place people go on vacation but these are American lives and it's it's alarming I could I could go the political route and say this is yet another case for a border wall and for various security measures but they were there on the other side what this boils down to ISM is Mexico has been unable to secure their nation they've been losing battles to the cartels president Trump offered yesterday to help them in any way that they wanted I believe he meant that and the Mexican president turned him down it seems like businesses usually is out of control you know I think of it like an early version of Colombia before you know Uribe came on to sort of crack down on the cartels and the guerrillas and all of that very different I grant you but that violence is everywhere crime in in Mexico City itself has gone up more than 300% violent crime that that is at all-time highs in five of Mexico's top cities these type of incidents well rare for Americans are commonplace what is going on you know in before women and children you would assume we're to always be off-limits but now this seems to be more Isis style for lack of a better term anything goes with these cartels which is why I feel like it seems foolish for the Mexican government to turn down help whether it's from the US which they seem for pride purposes don't want to do but then a good trigger more of a wave of those trying to get out of there right right it's it's alarming but they have been unable to solve it and they need help I don't know if they'll accept it but to think that this should just be accepted as it's crazy to me but they've not apprehended anyone connected to this a couple of suspicions I can't imagine anyone being surprised if this tragedy goes unsolved it's it's Mexico all right congressman thank you very much for taking the time in the meantime

and now I have the pleasure in the privilege to introduce someone who whose passion for this issue has even taken it to the halls of the United States Congress congressman Bruce Westerman is from here in garland county as children attended fountain lake i think that's right did I get that right okay I think he's got a brother that some of you may know that's also an administrator there and a few months ago I got a phone call and really kicked off the opportunity here because I've been involved with field hearings in the past when I was in the Senate and you know some issues in agriculture and that sort of thing in the first District where congressman Crawford invited me to be participating and as we were working on this and I think congressman Westerman certainly with his passion and wanted to bring attention to this we started talking about how could we do something and partner with how could they partner with a de and so later on today you're going to have the opportunity to to actually have an interaction with the congressman but today I want him to come and I want him to provide you some insight as to to why he has a passion for this issue why this is important to bring to national attention and how someone who is a in many ways I just really feel a kindred spirit because we're both engineers we both attended the University of Arkansas we both have a passion for children and we are both in positions that in college would never would have dreamed that as we were studying engineering that would have brought us to the positions that we are in now to try to provide leadership and support for the children of Arkansas so please join me in welcoming congressman Bruce Westerman a little girl a little girl born into generational poverty a little girl that was a single child of a single mom I know what you're already thinking the cards are stacked against her it's going to be tough for her but you don't even know half the story yet you see after this little girl's first grade year she lost her mom she was poor she was illiterate and she was dyslexic but fortunately she had people in her life who cared about her she had a stranger that cared about her and a stranger that knew what dyslexia was she had someone that invested in her life that helped her to overcome dyslexia or actually helped her to get on a path to overcoming dyslexia because she's still struggling today to overcome it if you fast-forward this little girls now in a different place she's got more confidence than she's ever had she's a cheerleader at her school but she struggles every day and she will continue to struggle to overcome dyslexia a little boy a little boy growing up in Texas in the 1980s about my age it's seven years old he was diagnosed with dyslexia but fortunately he got the treatment that he needed for four years he was able to have instruction on how to read and overcome dyslexia he moved to Arkansas he graduated from high school he went to the universe Steve Arkansas graduated with a degree in business and now he owns his own oil company into Queen if you come to my event tonight you'll get to hear personally from Reed Lynch who still at 40-something years old is overcoming dyslexia every day these are good stories but unfortunately there are a lot of stories that don't end that will here in our great state their children who have struggled with dyslexia who never will learn how to read and you can know that you know what that means for their future I want to welcome you to hot springs I want to welcome you to the dyslexia forum this is my hometown you're in the fourth District of Arkansas Senator Elliott is born and raised in the fourth District of Arkansas and I want to say thank you to a etn for taking an interest in this something that's extremely important to the future education of our children here in this great state commissioner key and I served in the legislature together and we first discussed having this joint event several months ago I'm so thankful for his leadership and for all of his staff and my staff and in particular Victoria bail on my staff for all of her hard work and planning our part of the event stand up big for you y'all give her hand please like many of you I'm very excited to be here today when we first passed the dyslexia law in Arkansas there was one lady that was the go-to person on the legislation and this has been her passion for quite some time please help me say thank you thank you thank you to Joyce Elliott for her unyielding work on addressing dyslexia and her love for the students of Arkansas stand up again joy this really is a work of passion and compassion for Arkansas children with dyslexia who just need the proper interventions and instructions to succeed and reach their fullest potential when your motives are pure and you're working to help alleviate the negative effects of dyslexia you're working to make someone else's life better and you're working to improve all of education in our state when you're involved with helping others who are dyslexic you've picked the challenging and rewarding endeavor you realize the dedication and effort you must expend every day yet you're up for the challenge because you know your real measure success is through the achievements and advancements of those for whom you labor and the last thing you want is for your students to fail it's in your gut you know the stakes are high when you talk about your students whose educational foundations rely on your ability to teach them to read when your motives are pure and you're driven by selfless love your actions show that failure is really not an option at all I know so much about you because I'm married to one of you my journey as an advocate to combat dyslexia began before I was ever in the state legislature when I served on a school board and begin analyzing data on the number of children in my district and across the state who are not proficient in reading at the 3rd grade level I didn't understand dyslexia the end I did not know that 16 to one-fifth of us school children suffer from dyslexia and that it is the most common learning disability affecting more than ninety percent of all individuals who are identified as learning disabled it was around this time that my wife Sharon began working on her master's special education degree and began in earnest study of dyslexia and it's research-based interventions by the time I arrived at the state legislature I was not only aware of dyslexia but I knew that for the future of our children and the well-being of our state something had to change in the way we address literacy the programs we had many of which are still in place today we're doing worse than not working they were filling a percentage of our children there is much work to do and when we're talking about the relatively short time of three to four years we have to shift readers from the mode of learning to read to actually reading to learn time is of the essence every year we wait to address this issue that dyslexia takes away from proficiency and literacy we move another fifteen to twenty percent of our students into a very disadvantaged educational position in the state legislature I was thrilled to work across the aisle with Senator Elliott on such an important issue as dyslexia and it's been a pleasure to work with Democrats and Republicans in Congress to combat the disorder the dyslexia law in Arkansas was just the beginning in bringing awareness to dyslexia and having a way to test and identify children with dyslexia identifying if a child is dyslexic is only the first step in helping the child to overcome dyslexia I'm saddened that the dyslexia law actually faced some pushback and some resentment from some in education and I'm concerned that too many tweaks and adjustments to the law were weakened it instead of strength in unity fall adults squabble and turf wars are fought our children and grandchildren with dyslexia will pay the price dyslexia is real it has been scientifically researched and its interventions have been lab and classroom tested this lexia can only win today when an education system for LLL to correct the problem we have to make an honest assessment of our schools individually and collectively are we defeating dyslexia or is dyslexia robbing our kids of the education they could otherwise obtain are we using a reading program that works for the kids or one that we're clinging to like a sinking ship if you can't answer that question subjectively analyze the data from trusted assessments like the knave if ninety percent plus of your students are not reading at or above grade level then the data just answered the question for you in her book overcoming dyslexia dr. Sally Shaywitz and her husband Bennett who arguably the world's leading experts on dyslexia and who will be my special guest for a book discussion this afternoon at two thirty and this evening for a 40 month successful interventions at 6pm the Shea whatz is research that the Yale School of Medicine is highlighted in her book using functional MRI technology they have been able to map brain functions in readers with and without dyslexia through their research they can actually watch the brain read it's fascinating research they not only can watch the brain read they can watch the reaction of a dyslexic spring when it is being taught to read using research-based interventions if you've ever doubted the authenticity of dyslexia or wondered if the top of interventions make a difference please attend our sessions get your free copy of overcoming dyslexia and analyze the research before jumping to ill-informed conclusions there is much work to be done across the country to address dyslexia when I arrived in Congress last year and begin serving on the Committee on Science Space and Technology I was happy to learn that my committee chairman Lamar Smith of Texas was already working on dyslexia and have formed the Congressional dyslexia caucus which i promptly joined especially since my wife was asking me every time i spoke with her if i had joined the congressional dyslexia caucus yet also became a co-sponsor of chairman smith's bill the research excellence and advancement for dyslexia or redact not only was i honored to be able to champion this bill through our committee but i was able to speak on the floor of the US House of Representatives in support of the bill which I'm glad to say went on the past the Senate and to be signed into law by the president the redact is another small but necessary step in the right direction to combat dyslexia the redact does not increase overall federal spending but prioritizes spending requiring the National Science Foundation to devote at least two and a half million dollars annually to dyslexic research which would focus on best practices in the following areas early identification of children and students with dyslexia professional development about dyslexia for teachers and administrators and curricula development and evidence-based educational tools for children with dyslexia I hope to continue doing my part in Washington DC and here in Arkansas to show the compassion for our children with dyslexia by fighting for their future it's a noble cause that will require much and quality effort from all of us to win it's a battle that we can look forward to winning because the only way we win is when our kids win and when our kids are winning at reading and education our communities when our economy wins and the United States of America wins thank you for joining me here today for these exciting events but thank you all thank you most of all for joining the fight to help all of our Arkansas kids with dyslexia to overcome dyslexia so they can not only learn to read but they can read to learn god bless you god bless the eight state of Arkansas and may God always and continually bless the United States of America

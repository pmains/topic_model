SENATOR FROM COLORADO. MR. BENNET: THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. RISE TONIGHT TO SUPPORT JUDGE KETANJI BROWN JACKSON'S NOMINATION TO SERVE AS AN ASSOCIATE JUSTICE ON THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. JUDGE JACKSON COMES TO THIS FLOOR WITH IMPECCABLE CREDENTIALS. SHE GRADUATED FROM HARVARD MAGNA CUM LAUDE, SHE GRADUATED WITH HONORS FROM HARVARD LAW SCHOOL, WHERE SHE EDITED THE "HARVARD LAW REVIEW." AFTER GRADUATION, JUDGE JACKSON WORKED AT TOP FIRMS IN PRIVATE PRACTICE AND SECURED THREE PRESTIGIOUS CLERKSHIPS, INCLUDING ONE FOR JUSTICE BREYER ON THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES. LATER, SHE SERVED AS A PUBLIC DEFENDER, REPRESENTING PEOPLE WHO COULDN'T AFFORD A LAWYER. I CAN'T THINK OF BETTER EVIDENCE OF HER COMMITMENT TO EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER THE LAW, WHERE EVERYONE, REGARDLESS OF THEIR MEANS, HAS THE RIGHT TO FAIR REPRESENTATION. JUDGE JACKSON IS CLEARLY QUALIFIED FOR THIS POSITION. THERE'S NOBODY WHO DOUBTS THAT. MY COLLEAGUES KNOW IT BECAUSE THE SENATE HAS CONFIRMED HER THREE TIMES, WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT, FIRST TO SERVE AS VICE CHAIR OF THE U.S. SENTENCING COMMISSION, SECOND FOR THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, AND LAST FOR THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE D.C. CIRCUIT. TAKEN TOGETHER, JUDGE JACKSON COMES TO THIS FLOOR WITH THE BEST LEGAL TRAINING AMERICA CAN OFFER. A DECADE OF EXPERIENCE ON THE FEDERAL BENCH, AND A CONSISTENT RECORD OF BIPARTISAN SUPPORT HERE ON THIS FLOOR. I HAVE THE -- I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH JUDGE JACKSON TWO WEEKS AGO AFTER SHE HAD BEEN ROLLED AROUND IN THE BARREL, IS ONE WAY OF SAYING IT, DURING THIS CONFIRMATION HEARING THAT PEOPLE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY WATCHED, AND IN OUR CONVERSATION, AFTER SHE HAD BEEN THROUGH ALL OF THAT TURMOIL, SHE TOLD ME ABOUT HOW HER PARENTS HAD ATTENDED SEGREGATED SCHOOLS IN MIAMI BEFORE WORKING AS PUBLIC SCHOOLTEACHERS HERE IN WASHINGTON, D.C. HER DAD WENT ON TO BE A LAWYER, A LAWYER FOR THE MIAMI SCHOOL DISTRICT, SOMETHING I APPRECIATE, HAVING BEEN A SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS. UNLIKE HER PARENTS, JUDGE JACKSON GREW UP IN AMERICA AFTER THE CIVIL RIGHTS LAWS OF THE 1960S,ED A SHE REMEMBERED HOW HARD HER -- AND SHE REMEMBERED HOW HARD HER PARENTS WORKED EVERY SINGLE DAY TO GIVE HER OPPORTUNITIES THEY NEVER EVEN DREAMED OF FOR THEMSELVES, AND SHE SEIZED THOSE OPPORTUNITIES. SHE EARNED TOP GRADES. SHE WAS ELECTED STUDENT BODY PRESIDENT. WITH ENSHE TOLD HER -- WHEN SHE TOLD HER GUIDANCE COUNSELOR SHE WANTED TO APPLY TO HARVARD, THE COUNSELOR WARNED SHE SHOULDN'T SET HER SIGHTS SO HIGH. IF FORTUNATELY FOR AMERICA, SHE SET HER SIGHTS HIGH. SHE SET HER SIGHTS WHERE THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN SET. SHE FOLLOWED THE HIGH EXAMPLE OF HER PARENTS, WORKING HARD AND IMPRESSING EVERYONE ALONG THE WAY, FRIENDS, COLLEAGUES, MENTORS, WHO ARE VIRTUALLY BEATING DOWN THE DOORS OF THIS CAPITOL TO TELL US WHAT A THOUGHTFUL, FAIR-MINDED AND PRINCIPLED JUSTICE SHE WOULD BE. THAT HASN'T STOPPED SOME COLLEAGUES FROM DISTORTING HER RECORD, TRYING TO SAY TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT SHE'S SOFT ON CRIME. THAT, MR. PRESIDENT. , WOULD COME AS NEWS, I THINK, TO THE FRATERNAL ORDER OF POLICE, WHO HAVE ENDORSED HER CANDIDACY FOR THE COURT. IT WOULD COME AS NEWS TO THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CHIEFS OF POLICE, BOTH HAVE ENDORSED HER NOMINATION. THEY SEE WHAT'S OBVIOUS TO ANYONE WHO FAIRLY REVIEWS HER RECORD, WHICH IS THAT JUDGE JACKSON HAS SPENT HER ENTIRE CAREER DEVOTED TO THE RULE OF LAW. A BROTHER AND TWO UNCLES SERVED AS POLICE OFFICERS. SO LAW ENFORCEMENT ISN'T SOME ACADEMIC ABSTRACTION FOR HER. IT'S LITERALLY HER FAMILY. THE PRESIDING OFFICER KNOWS SOMETHING ABOUT THAT, I THINK, IN HIS FAMILY HISTORY AS WELL. IN OUR MEETING, I ASKED JUDGE JACKSON WHAT MAKES A GOOD JUDGE. WE HAD A LONG TALK ABOUT THAT. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THEY SAID WAS COMMUNICATION, BECAUSE JUDGES HAVE TO EXPLAIN THEIR REASONING IN EVERY DECISION, WHICH IS A LOT MORE THAN I CAN SAY FOR THE UNITED STATES SENATE. SHE ALSO SAID THAT IT'S THE UNIQUE ROLE OF A JUDGE TO IDENTIFY AND TO EXTRACT THEIR BIAS BEFORE EVERY CASE. AND IF YOU LOOK AT HER MORE THAN 570 WRITTEN DECISIONS, IT'S CLEAR HOW SERIOUSLY SHE TAKES THAT RESPONSIBILITY. I WAS JUST ON THE PHONE WITH SOME PEOPLE FROM COLORADO BEFORE I CAME OVER HERE, MR. PRESIDENT, AND I SAID TO THEM, I TOLD THEM I WAS COMING OUT HERE TO GIVE THIS SPEECH, AND I SAID TO THEM -- THESE ARE OLD, OLD FRIENDS OF MINE -- THAT I CAN'T REMEMBER A TIME WHEN I SAT DOWN WITH SOMEBODY AND HAD A 30-MINUTE CONVERSATION WHERE I CAME AWAY MORE IMPRESSED THAN I WAS BY JUDGE JACKSON. I FOUND HER TO BE BOTH BRILLIANT AND COMPLETELY DOWN TO EARTH, WHICH IS I THINK A PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT COMBINATION FOR A JUDGE AT ANY LEVEL, AT ANY LEVEL, TO HAVE BOTH THE INTELLECT TO GRAPPLE WITH THE NUANCES OF LAW AND THE EXPERIENCE TO APPRECIATE HOW IT AFFECTS REAL PEOPLE. THERE WASN'T -- IT WASN'T THAT LONG AGO, MR. PRESIDENT, THAT JUDGE JACKSON WOULD HAVE RECEIVED OVER 90 VOTES ON THIS FLOOR, JUST LIKE HER MENTOR, JUSTICE BREYER, DID, JUST LIKE QUALIFIED JUDGES DID WHEN I WAS IN LAW SCHOOL MYSELF. THE SENATE CONFIRMED JUSTICE BREYER 96-3, JUST LIKE WE CONFIRMED JUSTICE SCALIA 98-0, JUSTICE SANDRA DAY O'CONNOR GOT 91-0. SOMEBODY WAS OUT THAT DAY. I GUARANTEE YOU, THEY WOULD HAVE VOTED FOR HER IF THEY HAD BEEN HERE. EACH TIME THAT HAPPENED, MR. PRESIDENT, THE SENATE REINFORCED THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY. IT SET ASIDE OUR PARTISAN POLITICS AND STOOD UP, I THINK, FOR INTEGRITY AND FOR THE RULE OF LAW. AND I'M SAD, I AM SAD TONIGHT THAT JUDGE JACKSON WON'T GET 99 VOTES TOMORROW, EVEN THOUGH SHE DESERVED IT -- DESERVES IT. THAT'S NOT A REFLECTION ON HER. AS I SAID, IF THIS WERE AN EARLIER DAY IN THE SENATE, SHE'D GET 99 VOTES. SHE WOULD GET 99 VOTES IN A DIFFERENT ERA. IT'S A REFLECTION OF HOW WE AS SENATORS, AND I AMONG THEM, HAVE SHREDDED OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITY TO ADVISE AND CONSENT. AND IT'S MY HOPE, MR. PRESIDENT, BY THE TIME -- I WAS GOING TO SAY MY CHILDREN ARE ADULTS. THEY ALMOST ARE ADULTS. THEY ARE ADULTS. BUT BY THE TIME THEY'RE STANDINE RUNNING THE COUNTRY WITH EVERYBODY ELSE WHO'S THEIR GENERATION, THAT WE WILL HAVE FIGURED OUT A WAY TO RETURN THE SENATE TO A PLACE WHERE WE TAKE OUR RESPONSIBILITY, OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITY, TO ADVISE AND CONSENT SERIOUSLY, AND WE FIND A WAY TO MAKE IT ONCE AGAIN A BIPARTISAN EFFORT IN THIS PLACE, WE FIND A WAY TO STITCH OURSELVES BACK TOGETHER AGAIN. AND I'M PREPARED TO WORK WITH ANYBODY ON THE FLOOR TO TRY TO DO THAT. BUT IN THE MEANTIME, THIS IS REALLY, IN MY VIEW, A MOMENT TO CELEBRATE. IT IS A MEMENT TO CELEBRATE -- A MOMENT TO CELEBRATE. IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS MY PHONES HAVE BEEN FLOODED FROM COLORADANS TELLING ME WHAT AN EXTRAORDINARY JUSTICE JUDGE JACKSON WILL MAKE. SHE IS AN INSPIRATION TO MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF AMERICANS. IN THE PAST FEW WEEKS, I COULDN'T HELP IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD MEAN TO THE STUDENTS I USED TO WORK FOR IN THE DENVER PUBLIC SCHOOLS TO SEE JUDGE JACKSON ON THE COURT, THE SAME COURT THAT ONCE RULED IN DRED SCOTT VERSUS SANFORD THAT HER ANCESTORS WERE LITTLE MORE THAN PROPERTY, THE SEGREGATED SCHOOLS THAT HER PARENTS WERE FORCED TO ATTEND, AND THE SEGREGATED HOTELS AND BUSES THEY ENDURED EVERY SINGLE DAY, DAY AFTER DAY AND IT REMINDS US OF THE CHANGES THAT ARE PSIBLE IN AMERICA. OUR COUNTRY ISN'T PERFECT. FAR FROM IT. OUR HISTORY HAS BEEN A BATTLE BETWEEN THE HIGHEST IDEALS EXPRESSED IN OUR CONSTITUTION AND OUR WORST IMPULSES AS HUMAN BEINGS. AND IF YOU LOOK AT OUR HISTORY, IF YOU REALLY LOOK AT OUR HISTORY, THE PATH FROM CASES LIKE DRED DRED SCOTT AND PLESSY TO BROWN WAS CLEARED BY AMERICANS WHO REFUSED TO GIVE UP ON OUR HIGHEST IDEALS. WHO INSISTED, AS DR. KING ONCE SAID TO MAKE REAL THE PROMISE OF OUR DEMOCRACY. THIS WEEK IS A VICTORY FOR OUR HIGHEST IDEALS AND FOR THE PROMISE OF AMERICAN DEMOCRACY. THAT AS JUDGE JACKSON SAID A NATION THAT WENT FROM HAVING HER PARENTS LIVE UNDER JIM CROW TO HAVING HER NOMINATED TO THE HIGHEST COURT IN THE LAND. SHE WILL JOIN THE RANKS OF THURGOOD MARSHALL AND RUTH BADER GINSBURG, THOSE WHO HAVE DECIDED BETWEEN THE WRITTEN CONSTITUTION AND REALITY. I HOPE SHE WILL JOIN JUDGES LIKE JUSTICE HARLAN WHO OPPOSED DECISIONS THAT OUTLAWED THE MINIMUM WAGE OR JUSTICES ROBERTS OR MURPHY, WHO REFUSED TO CONDONE THE INTERNMENT OF JAPAN AMERICANS IN COLORADO AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY. ALL OF THOSE JUDGES STOOD NOT FOR AN IDEOLOGY BUT FOR THE AMERICAN VALUES ETCHED IN OUR CONSTITUTION, FREEDOM, EQUALITY, DEMOCRACY, AND THE RULE OF LAW. I AM CONFIDENT THAT JUDGE JACKSON WILL STAND FOR THOSE VALUES FAIRLY, IMPARTIALLY AND WITHOUT PREJUDICE AND TOMORROW I WILL ENTHUSIASTICALLY VOTE FOR HER CONFIRMATION. I SUGGEST THAT EVERYBODY IN THIS CHAMBER WOULD HAVE A GOOD REASON TO VOTE FOR HER CONFIRMATION AND I HOPE THEY'LL CONSIDER IT. AND WITH

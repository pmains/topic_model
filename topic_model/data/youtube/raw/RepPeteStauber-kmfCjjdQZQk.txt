Thank You mr. chairman as I said this issue literally hits home for me as the entire Superior National Forest is located within Minnesota's eighth District I want to begin with a quote from the Honorable Jim Oberstar a lifetime Union man who fought tirelessly for northern Minnesota in a 1978 letter to President Carter mr. Oberstar wrote and I quote I urge you not to trade off lifestyles livelihoods and legitimate desires of the people of northeastern Minnesota for equitable treatment in favor of the vague and ill-defined interests of other perhaps more glamorous constituencies far removed from the BWC a therefore I am disappointed that members of my own delegation introduced a bill that directly affects the livelihoods of my constituents without providing me or my office any consultation whatsoever the committee the communities on the Iron Range are in desperate need of economic revitalization there needs to be quality jobs for folks to stick around after high school withdrawing part of the Superior National Forest from precious metals mining activity insults our way of life and disregards communities in the Northland like the Obama administration's attempt you seek to subvert existing processes and eliminate natural resource development and job creation in my district as you are aware the state of Minnesota is conducting its own separate environment environmental impact statement for the twin metals project here is a timeline of decision-making laid out by Governor Walz Department of Natural Resources and we have the timeline up okay the twin metals project has already signed a project labor agreement with the Iron Range building at trades promising high wage labor protected jobs your bill would nullify this pla making it clearer you believe my constituents are not worthy of high wage labor protected jobs as a co-sponsor of the green New Deal you must know of the need for cobalt and the slide as you can see 88% of the United States cobalt reserves are in Minnesota instead of using our labor protected workforce in northern Minnesota your bill would increase our reliance on child mines in the Congo children mining in the Congo to quote another member of our delegation Minnesota's senior senator Amy Klobuchar in an email to President Obama's Secretary of Agriculture when discussing the Obama era anti mining mineral withdrawal you're attempting to enshrine in statute and this is our senator in quotation marks senator Klobuchar said this it should have been handled through the normal process it wasn't I am NOT for or against this project but I just wanted a fair process based on science that told us the truth senator Klobuchar agreed this was wrong on your website you list save the Boundary Waters as a group in support of this anti mining legislation a few years ago a prominent member of that group referred to my constituents in The New York Times as and I quote resentful that other people have come here and been successful while they were sitting around waiting for a big mining company they want somebody to just give them a job so they can all drink beer with their buddies and go four-wheeling and snowmobiling with their buddies not have time to think about anything except punching a clock so representative McCollum we have former representative Oberstar governor Walz Department of Natural Resources and senator Klobuchar all agreeing that we need mining and a fair process for permitting by introducing this legislation you are making the implication that they are uninformed are you making the implication that they don't care about the environment now yield back

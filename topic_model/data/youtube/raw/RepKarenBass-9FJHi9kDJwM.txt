a gentlelady from California mrs. bass is recognized to strike the last word thank you madam chair and I do strike the last word and let me first and foremost say that I support the jackson-lee amendments in 2018 there were nine migrant deaths that occurred during encountering Customs and Border Patrol including seven-year-old Jaclyn who died of dehydration in shock an eight-year-old Felipe who died from the flu while in Si CBP custody in the first half of 2019 there were ten deaths including a two-year-old who died from pneumonia and 16 year old Carlos who died from the flu HR 30 to 39 raises the bar on humanitarian standards at our southern border as I have mentioned in previous hearings I have been to refugee camps in South Sudan in Uganda and parents and family members are never separated from their children but well unfortunately we don't have to look beyond our own front door to know what's the right thing to do you wouldn't stand for poor treatment of your children grandchildren or family members your children and grandchildren need your loving arms to protect them from harm to look out for their health and to ensure they have what they need to grow into happy healthy adults your children need you migrant children need their parents and family members too migrant children need to feel the familial heartbeat smells and voices that assure them that they are going to be okay but we already know from our own experiences migrant children are fleeing with their families escaping interpersonal and state violent violence migrant children need protection from harm they need the people who know how and have the resources to soothe and care for them your children and grandchildren need pediatric health assessments and appropriate medical attention so do migrant children your child's pediatrician needs the equipment and medication for assessment triage and treatment so do the health providers for migrant children you wouldn't leave your child sitting in soiled diapers and you wouldn't change your child on a filthy surface migrant children deserve the same care for their hygiene and health you make sure your children and grandchildren have nutritious food that allows them to be energetic happy and healthy you wouldn't allow your children or grandchildren safety trician health and hygiene needs to go unmet because you know that you you know that that can lead to illness and deaths like the deaths of at least seven children who died after being detained at the border we must dig the bar out of the ground for the humane and dignified treatment of migrants and raise it up to minimum international standards someone's loved ones life is at stake I now yield my time to representative Jackson Lee

but he doesn't have to I don't see that in the War Powers Act I didn't see it the last time in Syria I didn't see it when Obama went into Libya you know we talked about Clinton going it's is it time for you guys to step up take your duty and say no no don't do this until we debate we have to debate absolutely it absolutely is and I like Adam Kinzinger a lot and you're right he served the country he's wrong about the War Powers Act there should be no ambiguity about this read the War Powers Act it gives the president the authority to respond militarily and then report back to Congress in a matter of weeks when the country or its interests are attacked this is not the case in Syria now that doesn't mean that I or other members of Congress wouldn't support a robust response right we have the use of chemical weapons we have a leader who is now a war criminal supported by the Iranians and the Russians that demands a strong and risky response you know if the West won't stand up when a leader uses gas multiple times against his own people we live in a very dangerous world now Chris what's important here is the War Powers Act as clear as can be but members of Congress weasel out of their constitutional responsibilities you know why because if I vote to approve an aggressive action against Syria and it goes wrong and boy could it go wrong we saw that in Libya we saw it in Iraq elsewhere I am held accountable that's why we get paid as members of Congress and a refusal to say yea or nay to presidential action is a terrible abnegation of our constitutional duty well let's see who that how this goes and who stands up life is choices you guys are down there to make them congressmen thank you for joining us thank you Chris

Kansas is known for its abundance of farmland that is used to grow our crops far and wide producing the food we eat across the country and across the world it is home to the most beautiful Flint Hills that stretch 157 miles long where I grew up working fishing and hunting to some of the most sunny set/sets you'll ever see your witness our universities are leading the charge on research and innovation and our manufacturing industry is booming producing anything from airplanes to wind turbines farm implements to pharmaceuticals but my absolute favorite part about the state I call home are the Pete as we travel thousands of miles around Kansas this past week I enjoyed some time pheasant hunting countryside with my family and my dogs choco and razor it's been a lot of time reflecting all the great things that the wheat State has to offer it's the sense of community people's willingness to help and support each other and our strong values always putting faith and family first that makes me so proud to call Kansas home where I am from we support each other we uplift each other and we are resilient through the tough times I'm so honored to represent so many wonderful people as we celebrate the sunflower state we remember our motto ad astra per aspera to the stars through difficulties [Music] you

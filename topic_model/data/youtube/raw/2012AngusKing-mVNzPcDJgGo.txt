but I do feel that angus king is an exceptional leader he's a person with a lot of common sense he's willing to listen and he's very very smile these ads were very misleading you know I feel that under his watch the state he was one of the great governors and we've had many great governors but angus king was certainly one of them at one of those conferences Angus said if you have something to tell me you're going to have to tell me I'm not a mind reader and so I started writing him little letters i called them field reports and lo and behold he read every single one of them and became really personally interested in my little business because that's just the kind of guy he is he believes in the value of every single job during that time I had the privilege to work with Governor King and we built a 1.2 billion dollar facility to manufacture semiconductors and is now known as texas instruments this facility is still going strong and now employs more than 500 people I believe that governor King supported this project to the highest degree and without his commitment and support this facility would not be located in Maine people ask why main semiconductors are very competitive industry most semiconductor factories now are located in California Asia Arizona and Texas the governor was easy to work with he came down to the site to check progress quite often and by doing that he showed his support he asked your questions about what your problems are things like the better program is a huge help for us we call him mr. export because that's one of the things that he really has pushed he has a passion for me and if you've ever heard him speak or ever had five minutes talking with him you know that he loves his he loves to see things happening here if he could take that enthusiasm and help the entire country with it I think he could do great things the US Chamber ad completely misses the mark with respect to anguses character and commitment to the people of Maine and this is track record of effective leadership in public office and perhaps most importantly anguses core values in his philosophy of public service I just see Angus as a rare leader who can be highly effective representing main on a competitive and hard to navigate national state my experience with him as governor was that he was hands-on he as other speakers here said this morning he asked how he could help you this was his vision of government and he surrounded himself with great talent this is not always an easy thing to do in state government but Angus attracts great talent and he instilled in those people that their mission and state governments mission and any government bodies mission is to serve their constituents and find ways to grow the economy grow jobs and how business progressed towards the future governor King visited us shortly after his inauguration as governor the first time and asked what he could do to help business so I told him and to my big surprise he immediately went to work at it brought together both parties of the house we had meetings at our side we got the results that Paul mentioned and we got those because of the competence of angus King of his caring of his tenacity and his preservation to see it through it takes good business sense on leadership and certainly a knack for setting the right priorities to move Maine's economy forward and just gets it he really gets it and his action surrounding transportation investment are really make the case you'd have to be a civil engineer to know that commerce requires investing in a transportation system I tend to vote for whom I think the best candidate is I vote republican and I vote Democrat in this case I think we have a rare opportunity for an experienced leader in a lot of issues including transportation so I definitely has my support

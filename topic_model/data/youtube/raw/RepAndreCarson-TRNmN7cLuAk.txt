congressman andre carson joins me now welcome sir thank you for having me thank you for being here um you are muslim an indiana native you serve on the house intelligence committee you also worked in the indiana department of homeland security and the anti-terrorism unit when homeland secretary when homeland secretary jay johnson says mayor giuliani's comments don't help what does he mean i absolutely agree uh mayor giuliani is is a very intelligent man he's a smart man he has a great career in terms of anti-crime efforts look many of us have made comments that we've had to walk back throughout our careers but i don't think his comments help mainly because i think it feeds into this xenophobic and islamophobic uh environment that we're living in and the president has proven himself over and over to not only proud american but arguably one of the greatest presidents that this country has produced now having said that i think that the president has a global vision and that is evidenced by his efforts to reach out to the muslim community and other communities in terms of bringing people together to push back on extremism going back to rudy giuliani for just a second do you think he should apologize well i think i think so i think i i think mr giuliani is uh as a smart man and he understands uh political posturing he understands the the the effectiveness of rhetoric and so uh who knows what his what his motives are but it is clear to me that his comments add to an already hostile environment and i think it exacerbates existing fears and hostilities that are evident right now in this environment because there are people who say you know he's not running for president he can say whatever he wants to say and it's not harmful do you disagree agree with that well i i i think his comments are are harmful and and hurtful and and they don't add value to what we're talking about i mean mayor giuliani was at the helm of of of the mayoral a seat during 9 11 and i think that he he of all people should should know that adding fuel to the fire in an environment where our government relies heavily on muslims who work for our intelligence agencies muslims who work in our law enforcement communities to help with information and to help push back on crime and he knows that because he has worked with these communities outside of some of the comments and outside of some of his political political stratagem throughout the years he knows better so many of your colleagues say that that president obama should use the phrase islamic extremism you serve on the house intelligence committee what's it like working with colleagues who who think that the president is absolutely wrong well i think uh i work with brilliant colleagues on both sides of the aisle from adam's shift to devin nunes to even peter king who he and i share a great relationship with the surprise of many people we all have different approaches and different methodologies to ultimately get to the same place and that's making the world a better a better place a more peaceful place and making our country safer i think there's too much of an emphasis being placed on the president's usage of certain phraseology the greater point is that these folks do not represent islam nor do they represent muslims and for the president to very wisely walk around trying to validate a group that so desperately seeks validation and seeks attention i think is the right as the right step congressman andre carson of indiana thank you so much for joining me i appreciate it thank you what an honor thank you i want to dig a little

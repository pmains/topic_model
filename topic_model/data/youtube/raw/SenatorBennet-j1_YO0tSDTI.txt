[Music] joining me now is someone who will be in the audience for president zolensky's address to congress it's colorado democratic senator michael bennett he's a member of the senate intelligence committee so he he comes this interview with more knowledge than perhaps he's allowed to share senator bennett let me start with the expectations you know what valencia's going to come ask for there's going to be an emotional aspect to it uh look he addressed you guys before and suddenly it got more people motivated to do more immediately russia off the swift system things like that uh do you expect a fervor to increase after hearing from zielinski tomorrow to do more than perhaps the biden administration is ready to do uh chuck thank you very much i think the words you used earlier for now are important words this is a conflict that unfortunately is probably not going to be over soon uh it's it's a conflict that minute by minute by minute the commander-in-chief and the rest of us who have a role to play here are going to have to make decisions about how we aid the ukrainian people in the most profound way at a moment when they're at in desperate need and at the same time don't uh enter into world war three with russia or at least don't enter into it inadvertently or prematurely so i expect to hear president zielinski tomorrow call for more sanctions to call for a no-fly zone we've heard him do that today with the canadian parliament he was very moving the other day on zoom with us on a saturday where he started the meeting by saying you know we're fighting here let me tell you what this is about we're fighting here to live our lives the way you live your life and he ended it by saying the world should live in peace the world should should be as liberal as possible by which he meant you know as plural as possible freedom of speech freedom to assemble the right to self-determination and that's what's at stake here is democracy in the free world and we've got to make sure we do everything we can for the ukrainian people but we've got to be aware that we don't want to inadvertently start world war three well this is what puts this conflict though in a different you know take saudi arabia and yemen and the houthis when we say that's a regional conflict i think a lot of people yes okay we see that that's a that's a regional proxy war between the iranians and the saudis we have interest there but and it's a pretty easy line to draw do you you talk about this conflict not in those in a regional term that this is putin may be trying to play this off as a hey this is our region this has nothing to do with you but don't you view this as as putin's war against the west this is putin's war against the west the the president zielinski called him a butcher on our on on the call we had with him and that is an apt description of what he's doing i mean chuck you know my mom and her parents were living in warsaw they were the last time there was a war in europe in the 1930s and the 1940s i had dinner with her the other night she survived and they came to the united states after the war was over she said i can't believe i've lived long enough to see another another war in europe but of course just as it did then this war is about the entire world this world war is about whether humanity is going to live in freedom and democracy or or living in subservient in a in a totalitarian state this war is about whether in the 21st century you know it's okay for one country to invade another and to to to to attack and to kill the people uh in another country just because they seek uh their own self-determination so the stakes could not be higher and we have to be extremely extremely committed to to making sure that we are that that we are defending the ukrainian people in a way that is most productive to them and uh and making sure that we that when this is all over uh that this is a world that's defined by democracy not by totalitarianism hey senator i want to play something that the republican senate republican leader mitch mcconnell said earlier today uh it was it may be somewhat partisan but it's there's a version of this argument i've heard on both sides of the aisle take a listen last week president biden publicly split from our ally poland and scrapped a plan to get airplanes to ukraine because our administration feared it might you guessed it provoke putin predictably putin has not pulled his punches as a thank you to president biden for pulling his punches american strength is not the provocation american weakness is we need to help get air defense systems to ukraine without wasting another second so look and the reason i said look that was a pretty part of that on one hand that was pretty partisan hit on the other hand i've heard plenty of of subtle critiques from democrats saying you can't let putin decide the rules of engagement here all the time and it looks as if we have i don't think you should let putin decide the rules of engagement ever but but giving of you know going to the floor and giving a speech without any regard to whether or not you know you could set off world war iii not that mcconnell's doing it because everybody knows those are just words is serious and and he is not the commander-in-chief he doesn't have the responsibility you mentioned earlier on the intelligence committee you know i can't talk about some of the things that we talk about there we have talked about things about you know what what would be viewed as escalatory what would not be viewed as desolatory what would it mean for uh putin to uh to to use to have a false flag around chemical weapons and what that would look like in terms of what the response so i far from having putin uh uh make our decisions for us we should have resolved we should we should make decisions based on what we think are in the best interest of the ukrainian people and of of of the united states of america's national security and our allies and we should not take any tool off the table no military tool off the table no diplomatic tool off the table you know around this place now you know i'm sure these signs of weaknesses some of these things are signs of strength too being able to engage your allies in a meaningful way to the russian economy that's a sign of strength and there were people a week ago who said it wasn't enough everyone becomes an expert here you know when something like this happens and that's it's like because somebody read one book on afghanistan like the old you know that old article in the onion was about so i think yeah i i believe we should be pushing as hard as we can push we shouldn't take anything off the table and every single one of us that has a position of responsibility here needs to keep an eye on what it would look like to have two superpowers with nuclear weapons engaged in world war three and uh that is not an excuse not to act is the excuse it's an excuse to act smart it's an excuse to act with courage and it's and it's a reason for us to to to be so inspired by what the ukrainian people are doing because i guarantee you this none of this would be happening if ukrainian people weren't doing what they're doing and it's amazing they have been the backbone of the west that is for sure senator michael bennett is democrat of colorado really appreciate you coming on

madam sorry I want to begin this morning by really by thanking you I want to thank Senator Kerry not just for your hard work and that of our staffs but really for your extraordinary commitment to bring climate change legislation before the Senate I'd also want to thank you a madam chair for including several of my own priorities including clean team nuclear energy and recycling in this bill and for working with us on a clean coal language I believe that climate change may well be the foremost challenge of our generation when the 10 hottest years on record occur within the last 20 years we have a problem when the american lung association reports that nearly half of all americans are breathing unhealthy air we have a problem and when eighty-five percent of the mountaintop glaciers on Mount Kilimanjaro have melted and rising sea levels threaten the coast of Delaware and more than a dozen other states we have a problem how we decide to address the climate problem how we choose to clean up our air and reduce our dependence on foreign energy will impact generations to come fortunately I believe we can address climate change while bringing jobs and prosperity back to this country Albert Einstein once said an adversity lies opportunity it still does fortunately the Germans mark puts this country on a path toward a low-carbon economy while allowing us to harness the greatest source of power we have in this country and that is American ingenuity although the legislation before us is similar to the house but let me just mention three areas in which our Chairman has improved upon that legislation first the mark includes language from the clean tea bill that Senator Specter and I introduced in March legislation that's now been sponsored by senators Lautenberg Cardin Merkley and Gillibrand I thank each of you how language provides cities and states with funding to promote reductions in transportation emissions through public transit smart growth than more the mark provides three percent allowances for clean transportation projects that's a significant down payment but we can do better and I hope that we will I will offer an amendment to slightly increase transportation allowances I believe it is critical for us throughout a CLE address in this bill the major role the transportation emissions play given the fact that nearly thirty percent of carbon dioxide emissions in the u.s. come from the cars trucks and vans that we drive second thanks in no small part to the efforts of a number of people in this room this mark provides better incentives for the early deployment of clean coal technology while keeping environmental protections firmly in place a result of a compromise between state Cole state senators and non call state senators our coal language sends a clear message that consensus can be achieved to pass strong clean energy legislation that takes regional differences into account and third I want to applaud the chair for putting a nuclear title in her film our country needs nuclear power to meet our clean air and climate goals but building a new nuclear power plant as we all know is not cheap by capping carbon though we will incentivize investments in all clean energy including their clear and this block also funds the training the next generation of nuclear workers I believe that we need to do more to run nuclear energy but this bill still represents a necessary for stepping for that we're grateful for all the good provisions in this bill however we still need to do a better job to protect our children from soot from smog and from mercury emissions and I've arently hope that we will to that end senator Klobuchar will join me an offering an amendment that significantly reduces sulfur dioxide emissions nitrogen oxide emissions and mercury emissions from fossil fuel coal plants our amendment will save 200,000 lives over the next 15 years it will also save 1.5 billion dollars in health care costs let me say those again 200,000 lives saved 1.5 trillion dollars in costs passage of this amendment will guarantee reductions in these pollutants provide business certainty and protect public health at the same time in my state we call that a win win situation and it won't be just for Delaware but it could be for all states especially states like Maryland states like New Jersey New York Connecticut Vermont New Hampshire Massachusetts Rhode Island in Maine all of whom live like we do at the end of America's tailpipe and pay a terrible price for it every single day let me conclude with this I believe that we all share a number of common goals on this committee we want to create jobs we want to make America more energy independent we want to protect our children from pollution that shortens their lives and threatens their health I believe that if we work together I hope that we will we can make a good bill even better and create a clean energy revolution that will help to feed our economic recovery and get America moving in the right direction once again thank you madam

Mr chairman and welcome panel my first question is for Mr Powell and miss sqa did I get it right I'm so sorry okay well I'm from Wyoming and as you know Wyoming in the west face unique challenges that can impact the availability of broadband services and probably create additional costs you know sometimes our equipment is in remote areas when it needs to be repaired hard to get maintenance to that kind of equipment in some of our areas and that can cause additional costs or service goes down so what cost disproportionately impact Rural and tribal areas when it comes to deploying Broadband Services what are you seeing out there um for the tribal areas you're absolutely correct with the um the G the the rugged nature um if you look at the state of New Mexico um on Highway 40 goes into Arizona in about 60 maybe even maybe 90 miles from that border it's lava so constructing in that requires Advanced Equipment that's more expensive and um I think that's probably one of the biggest elements that you know we battle when we put in our when when we design our projects the permitting is also a challenge I will say though that you know with the recent Federal efforts with the permitting Council there's more of a mechanism to coordinate the federal agency permits and that's going to be a huge Time Savings which also can have cost components as well but we look forward to working with these new initiatives that have made Broadband projects eligible for this product project or for their permitting councils process and are optimistic that we can reach our delivery goals for our tribal Broadband connectivity project whose time frame had to be extended by four or two was allowed to be extended up to four years as opposed to the initial Nova which has a one-year project now for our project cost there we're going to look at some administrative costs that were unexpected for that longer time frame and that has a lot to do with the supply chain issues wherein I just ordered you know a couple million feet of fiber with a two-year delivery date is permitting more difficult on in Indian country it is we also have the Bureau of Indian Affairs that we need to work with so that can be that is another process that we just have to factor in so when we look at you know reforms and coordinations the Bia did sign and mou to work um and uh on these on these projects but it's time and education also within the agencies you might have that conversation at the federal level and we've heard some of the witnesses speak to that but then once the management down to the people processing and receiving paperwork until they're trained and they're meeting their time frames we're going to continue to see barriers is is bi is it necessary to have the Ia involved in this is this an area where Bia could be um more of an impediment than a help uh yeah yes and no I think that Bia does play an important role here um they not all tribes are the same you know we're Sovereign Nations some of us have more resources and more internal capabilities and capacity and for those tribes that can move forward a lighter touch with the Bia is absolutely um fair and does the Bia adapt itself to the differences among tribes and their self-governance capabilities yes they do they they try to do that um what the Bia also has a role though I think for the lease resource tribes for instance with Spectrum acquisition this is something where tribes have not had access to Sovereign rights over what could be considered a natural resource like water so now as we move forward into the telecommunication space and we're trying to negotiate in the secondary markets perhaps there's a band of spectrum that we would like to utilize and we know that it's not being utilized by the license holder there was an order to the effect to allow tribes the opportunity to utilize that underused Spectrum but where does a tribe begin especially if it's a low resource tribe how how do we engage in those processes we're not going to be able to without additional structures of support and Bia has the opportunity to grow and help us with that process okay well I hope you'll reach out to the committee because because you're knowledgeable in this area and let us know if there are areas where we should require a lighter touch of the Bia with regard to regulation and layers of bureaucracy in this area that might prevent a company from accessing uh a Broadband project in Indian Country Mr Powell's same question for you maybe maybe a little less focused on tribal lands yeah I think States like yours are the most challenging uh number one for geography these are complex terrains to wire and connect and those are unique challenges permitting as you mentioned poll access as we've discussed all our significant problems are running into those communities uh the availability of skilled labor uh to work often in remote regions is challenging as well and then I think an area we haven't talked enough about across the whole country is this uh continuing backup in the supply chain which is really becoming quite problematic I think for all of us Mr spalter quick question about developing a location fabric it what are some of the difficulties you faced we've covered some of them here today are they are any Wheat we haven't discussed uh that the committee should be aware of and then for the entire panel um how can the FCC best ensure that the Broadband Maps which will be used to allocate bead funding are accurate so think again with my thanks to the panel uh recognizing the unfortunate history of previous Broadband Maps U.S Telecom endeavored to undertake pilot program to actually evolve and and Deploy on on a pilot basis uh location Fabrics both in Missouri and Virginia we found that we can do so if we were aggressively seeking the types of data that need to contribute to more refined mapping processes including not only open source data sets but also proprietary data sets geocoding and and and and and and other um sophisticated uh data analyzes that can actually inform the maps we presented those uh those pilots and the underlying location fabric to the FCC and are very glad that they've adopted that as a framework for the existing Maps we uh absolutely have an opportunity by we hope uh in the short time so that we can deploy dollars by the end of June soon to have a refined accurate and deeply granular set of maps because of things like the location coating of the location Fabrics geocoding mechanisms that allow each structure to be identified in serviceable communities so we will more accurately know where Broadband is but more importantly where it isn't and so we're confident and and I would even say optimistic that the maps will actually be able to iterate to a place where we can have confidence in them as long as we continue collectively not only as industry but with our Community Partners and the states to work towards ensuring that the challenge process can move nimbly quickly and effectively thank you and would anyone else care to weigh in on my broader question yes ma'am um thank you I think speaking to the goal of utilizing the map to close the digital divide um speaks to not just the accuracy of what's on the map itself right now but how we use the map and how we design it as a tool you know I think that we have different um for instance I'm speaking from education you know our schools and those anchor institutions how are they being categorized on the map how are other anchor institutions for health centers for instance how are they being characterized on the map because the map isn't just for Baseline data but it's also a planning tool so the more Dynamic it is the more um the anchor institutions are included then we can design different Broadband strategies that include the different sectors and I think that that's going to re that's what's going to help us realize America's Broadband needs can I add that most communities are not conducting the kind of challenging process education process that Kimball is so if we had more communities able to conduct that process not only are they fixing the map they're learning about Broadband while they're there oh yeah great panel thank you so much Mr chairman

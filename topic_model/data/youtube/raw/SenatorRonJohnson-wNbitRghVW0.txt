joining us now from Wisconsin Republican Senator Ron Johnson chair of the Homeland Security Committee senator let me start with the most recent news both the US and Russia have not just announced that they are pulling out of compliance with the medium-range missile treaty president Trump has been saying that the the Russians have been violating that treaty for some period of time the question is though that with no new talks scheduled to try to update the treaty and with the long-range ballistic missile treaty running out in two years are we headed for a new arms race well good morning Chris and of course the the most salient point here is that Russia has been violating this tree for at least six years testing and now we bleed deploying these intermediate-range nuclear missiles and what's so dangerous about these is you know they if something flies out of those batteries it's only a couple minutes before it hits the targets probably in the European theater and so we have very little warning and all kinds of miscalculations could occur so it's unfortunate that Vladimir Putin has taken this path and that he's been violating this treaty but there's really no tree in existence when one party is violating and not even admitting to violating it as well so this is something that's just natural our NATO and European allies completely back the president's move here hopefully in this six-month period before you know between the announcement and the final ending of the treaty Russia will come to her senses and verifiable verifiably dismantled these batteries let me turn to another subject this week most Republican senators broke with President Trump on his announcement of a quick withdrawal of some or all US troops from all US Jews from Syria about half from Afghanistan here's Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell a Republican who introduced the measure opposing a fast withdrawal from those theaters Isis and al-qaeda have yet to be defeated at American national security interests require continued commitment to our missions there senator you're one of 43 Republicans in the Senate who voted for the McConnell amendment opposing the president's announced policy you say that we can't and using your phrase bug out of Syria and to do so would be quote very unwise policy well Chris I can't tell you how many times they came my shows like this after President Obama decided to bug out of Iraq precipitously and so that Isis was able to rise from the thoroughly defeated ashes of al Qaeda in Iraq and I don't want to be making the same statement six months from now that we bugged out of Syria unwisely and that Isis Isis's re-emerged from the defeated Isis harasses of Isis in Syria we met a bipartisan group of ascenders met with the co-chair of the Syrian Democratic coalition Essam men and you know she had a very compelling case to make they've got about 60,000 fighters they represent about 4 million Syrians about two and a half million Kurds and about a million half Christians and they want democracy they want peace and she made a very strong case that just having American military people present now not even involved in the fighting but as advisors doesn't he goes a great deal toward providing this peace and stability for that part of Syria and I think it just be tragic if we bugged out left the Kurds who by and large have done the fighting and defeated the the Isis Caliphate the territory of Caliphate Isis if we just abandon them to the mercies and let's the I mean I use that term loosely of Russia and Iran and possibly Turkey it would just be unconscionable so so again I think Republicans Sanders was saying very strong signals to the president we don't want to see that happen I hope you is listening so if he should be listening when there were 43 of the 50 through Republican senators voted against his policy which raises the question how serious the split is there between Senate Republicans and the president on the trunk foreign policy well as it relates to pulling out of Syria there's this pretty serious split hopefully the president because when he came to set a lunch he was talking about you know we're still going to defeat Isis and their air bases from Iraq that we can still continue these missions so you know I'm not on the ground there I don't know all the military assets but it's a very bad sign and secretary mattis resigns that Brett McGurk our envoy there for the defeat of Isis also resigns because they simply can't carry out this policy these are people that are intimately knowledgeable of the conditions on the ground of our allies there and they simply couldn't in good conscience stay in office that's pretty bad sign I hope the president is listening to those people as well well talking about people who are knowledgeable on the ground we saw a remarkable split this week between the president and his own Intel Chiefs on a number of world hotspots while the president since the summit with Kim jong-un has said that North Korea is no longer a nuclear threat here was the testimony this week by the Director of National Intelligence Dan Coates we currently assess that North Korea will seek to retain its WMD capabilities and is unlikely to completely give up its nuclear weapons and production capabilities because its leaders ultimately view nuclear weapons as critical to regime survival and here are the president and director coats on the threat from Isis we've really stepped it up and we have one against Isis we've beaten them and we've beaten them badly Isis in two is intent on resurging and still commands thousands of fighters in Iraq and Syria they also disagreed the president and in this case CIA director Gina Haskell over whether or not Iran is violating the Iran nuclear deal what do you make of the president and his own intelligence chiefs at such odds well let me also say that Mossad Ned was was also a pretty firm in her assurances that Isis has sleeper cells existing they are not thoroughly defeated yet now the Caliphate the territorial Caliphate is gone but you still go sleeper cells listen I come from the private sector spent 30 years in manufacturing and in public life and I realize I have the modesty to understand that there's an awful lot there's an you know so much tradition in history and complexity to some of these foreign policy issues you have to rely on people who have been working these issues for four decades and it's just imperative you actually listen to for example the CIA chief the the Director of National Intelligence these people have the real knowledge and you have to listen to them well that wasn't it the president's first reaction actually none of his reactions his first reaction was to bash the Intel chase let me put up a couple of his tweets the intelligence people seemed to be extremely passive and naive perhaps intelligence should go back to school and then after meeting with his chiefs the next day the president said does they said that they were totally misquoted and they totally it was taken out of context so what I do is I'd suggest that you call them they said it was fake news is that healthy I mean as the head of the Homeland Security Committee on the foreign relation can be does that concern you when the president says there is agreement between him and his Intel chiefs on all these key issues when clearly from listening to their testimony there is an agreement well you know else just like one instance the what the intelligence chiefs were talking about Iran they were saying currently and technically Iran is in compliance but I think the president's absolutely right of the this type of danger that Iran represents now under the region print the world I mean there there there continue to plot terrorist attacks into Europe that they obviously are full menteng that the conflict in Yemen and you know they are certainly not helpful in Syria they're a real threat to Israel and to world peace and stability so technically they may be in compliance with the agreement currently they may not be pursuing nuclear weapons but you know that they're still full Manning terror there's still the largest state-sponsored terror in the world and so I again I think maybe that the difference was blown way out of proportion I got about a minute left I want to go to one other hospitals a lot on the international plate right now and that's Venezuela the president this week announced some dramatic escalations in our campaign against the Nour duro regime he's now backing as a number of other countries are the opposition president from the National Assembly and he's also imposed some tough new economic sanctions on Venezuela how far do you think this country should be prepared to go in trying to topple the Maduro regime and would that extend in your judgment to the use of military force alright any of the administration's really done an animal job admirable job when it comes to their reaction to what's happening on the ground is the National Assembly probably the closest thing to an open democratic form in in Venezuela that voted for you know that their Assembly President Juan Guido to basically run me now and when you see the protests of the street in support of mr. Guido we are just reacting to the conditions on the ground and we are supporting the Venezuelan people in trying to shed the gist of deprivation zuv Maduro when we listen to the hit squads going into I think this race has done a good job and where are you on the use of military force briefly well we certainly have to protect American personnel there and I think that's exactly what we've done moving troops into Colombia I really do think that the people Venezuela will take care of the situation and will just take you will use economic sanctions to support them and I think it's appropriate that we do support the pathway new troops because there was this statement 1,500 troops in Colombia in fact have we done so sir well that's I'm just basically off news reports that would be a prudent action I might you know from my standpoint I hope we have done that senator Johnson thank you thanks for your time it's always good to talk with you sir have a good day up next we'll ask our

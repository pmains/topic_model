good morning my name is lee zeldin a congressman from the 1st congressional district of new york congress is most important role is to keep Americans safe secure and free we are too often reminded that while we frequently hear and read about terrorist attacks abroad we have a very real ongoing homeland security threat within our own voters in the wake of the Orlando terrorist attack and the rise of terrorism across the world is important now more than ever that our nation in the free world define and eliminate the threat posed by Islamic terror groups this week the house will take action on a counterterrorism package to help protect our country and citizens included in this package is my language from my proposal to protect America Act HR 4237 which would prevent terrorists from purchasing firearms or explosives while protecting the due process rights of Americans I have not met one member of Congress in favor of terrorists being able to purchase firearms the real debate is whether and how to ensure due process for Americans my proposal was Senator Cornyn in no way shape or form infringes upon the rights of law-abiding gun owners what it does is ensure that terrorists do not have the ability to legally purchase firearms it isn't that really the goal here two weeks ago House Democrats waged a disruptive and destructive sit-in to shut down Congress because they supposedly wanted to pass legislation that prevents terrorists from being able to purchase firearms now they can with this proposal coming to the house floor but Democrats are opposing it for no good reason it's because they only want the political fight and because they don't want to confront the three inconvenient truths I'm about to address regardless of whether you are a liberal Democrat or a conservative Republican my proposal with Senator Cornyn should be supported by all it would require only the most partisan bad intentions of my Democratic colleagues not to be praising and supporting this legislation just think about it it would also be the height of hypocrisy and ironing now to push this measure with their full energy this bill wasn't written by the NRA this proposal was drafted by members of Congress who understand how to prevent terrorists from purchasing firearms while protecting the due process rights of Americans there are three very important truths that my Democratic colleagues shouldn't find so inconvenient first the Orlando shooter was an Islamic terrorist pledging allegiance to Isis yelling Allahu Akbar and to the rifle a handgun used in your land o shooting didn't just March itself into the night club that night and discharged itself I'll get to the third and giving it truth in a moment but first I want to point out that in reality there's a whole lot more going on here beyond a gun control debate in attempts by members of Congress to narrow this issue so glaringly is alienating the rest of our country who understand the bigger picture we also must unite to ID the threat of radical Islam because you cannot eliminate a threat that you're not willing to identify and what makes matters worse is that it is clear that even if the president ID'd a threat he has no idea how to eliminate it and that unfortunately is the third Inconvenient Truth Congress has a duty to prioritize national security over party politics which is why Democrats should join House Republicans in passing this important proposal to prevent terrorists from purchasing firearms and to keep Americans safe it is their duty

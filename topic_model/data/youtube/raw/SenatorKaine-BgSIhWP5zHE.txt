joining us now Democratic senator from Virginia Tim Kaine along with CNBC's a man jabbers gentlemen good to have you on board this morning senator good times well I don't know about that am I going to be called I don't know about that yeah we it's been a unnecessary pain and especially felt in Virginia with you know our contractors and our federal workers I furloughed 37 of my 42 staff they're all coming back today I told you guys in the break that when they moved out mices moved in to our office so now I was weaned absolutely i think the floors chase the mice back out of the office so but ultimately it's been damaging all around damaging to the economy to people to our reputation if there's two good things that could come out of it one we're finally getting a budget conference I'm on the Budget Committee so along with my colleague mark warner from Virginia will be conferees and we've got maybe low expectations but high stakes to try to find a budget deal and second hopefully we've learned the lesson Joe you've been talking about it since the start of this shutting down the government is bad trying to default on the debt or even threatening it as bad hopefully people will take that lesson away from aim and assess the damage for us well look it looks like we took about 24 billion dollars out of the economy and just the increase in short-term interest rates over the past week or so has added about a hundred million dollars to the deficit according to an analysis I saw yesterday and I think what American politicians don't fully understand is that since world war two we've built this global financial infrastructure that puts the United States at the center of the grid we are the world's reserve currency we have extremely low borrowing rates for our enormous deficit we put all that at risk when we do these kinds of things and we're chipping away at US economic dominance around the world it's a very dangerous thing to have happen and and I don't think American politicians fully understand that because they've grown up in a world where that is the case and they can't even imagine it going way if it went away it'd be very bad soon as you're talking about the the politics of this young we have to look at your home state ken cuccinelli very conservative guy by all standards actually during this government shutdown came out against the government Chuck a big absolutely a big big big surprise but it shows which way the winds were blowing well it's toxic and I think you're going to see in these these elections two and a half weeks out that the shutdown is going to major effect on the statewide races and even even house legislative races in Virginia are going to get affected because of the shutdown janitor I think you said it well earlier that this is a low expectation high stakes game with my budget conference so I wonder going into this if all parties seem to be saying it's going to be very hard to come to an agreement how do you get there how is this time different how is this the opportunity to break the gridlock and the governance by crisis that has gripped Washington for so long this is kind of like the education of the freshman senator when I got in the Senate had done a budget in four years I got put on the Budget Committee we worked we did a budget great let's go to a conference committee it's March 23rd we couldn't start a conference and now we're finally able to hurt it so the expectations are low but we failed every other way you know the sequester was a gimmick I think that was a fail gimmick the super committee was a gimmick that was a failure ecr's bad to do government by these short-term continuing resolutions let's get back to the normal way of doing budgets it was set out in a budget act 274 we haven't done a budget that way for five years it's going to take compromise there needs to be some sort of like I guess something in place that prevents the government by crisis well absolute that's a very good point Megan I would a dovetail on on the Senators point with a question on that is this the new norm it we're going to be back in this room in 60 days yeah and we're going to go to the same melodrama how do the markets how do business owners out there actually plan anything how do they look down the road and go hey you know we can go ahead and expand we can invest we can they don't I mean look you've got a very crippled American polluters CNBC they're trying to figure out what date to set the countdown clock to again and look I mean the political system is damaged the economy is damaged we've got the Fed you know putting huge amounts of artificial support into the economy the political system limping along it's just not a good recipe manan SP is cut annualized US growth by a full percentage point right three percent to 2% it's a disaster epic it's a disaster and i think it's just going to only increase the political tensions in this country because a lot of what's going on here is economic eggs from you just can't find a job they understand their families are hurting they're hurting they see their investments are suffering that's going to cause more political anxiety and fractious pneus in the future and the question is how can you possibly come to a deal in a world where everybody's getting more and more worried about their own lifestyle their own future well Congress has been a chain on the economy but we got a deal yesterday because the Democratic leader and the Republican leader in the Senate worked together you got a divided Congress he's going to be bipartisan there's gonna have to be compromised yeah senator Tim Kaine thank you and CNBC asteroids are on you sell getting rid of the ramps yeah up now praying for America

Mr President senator from South Dakota Mr President as we all heard in just a few days our colleague my neighbor from Nebraska Senator Ben sass is retiring from Congress become president of the University of Florida and I have to say that his leaving is a loss for the Senate not least because the average educational attainment here will drop precipitously when he leaves Ben has four four graduate degrees three master's degrees and a doctorate and I have to say thank you to all his many staff who are represented both here and in the gallery to his family to Melissa and Corey and Alex and Breck for the sacrifices that you all have made so that he could serve here and um and be such an inspiration I think to so many of us who've had the opportunity to serve with him and to see not only his great intellect but his passion and his ability to get things done for the people of Nebraska and for the people of our country but I will say that when I hire people I typically hire people on my staff or at least I try to who are smarter than I am and in my case that's not hard um in his case that's probably a little more challenging so your staff is uh got to be the the Mensa caucus around here but it is no surprise that he became a college President of Midland University at age 37 making him one of the youngest College presidents in the nation but seriously Mr President the Senate will be a poor place without Ben sass he's an incredibly smart as I said he combines that with being incredibly principled he lives by his principles he's always willing to do the hard things the right things even when they aren't popular during his time in the Senate he's been notable for speaking out against oppressive authoritarian regimes for standing up for the right to life of the most vulnerable and innocent Americans unborn babies for his interest in the future of work for his commitment to building up our American community and so much more he's a big picture thinker who oftentimes gets up at the early hours in the morning 4 30 in the morning and just starts brainstorming on a big piece of paper it's a quality that will serve him well as a university president and I can think a few individuals more suited to Leading University Florida is lucky to have him and I know how deeply committed he will be to the university although I have to warn them that if he Corn Huskers ever approach been about the position of offensive coordinator he may be out of there quickly but no I don't think that'll happen but Mr President it's been a pleasure to serve with uh with Senator Sasse in addition to being a tremendously smart and thoughtful guy he's a very witty guy who always makes me laugh and I think many of his colleagues here laugh as well he and I have a lot in common being from neighboring states I'm going to miss him as a neighbor as a leader as a colleague and as a friend Mr President there's a lot to admire about Ben sass But ultimately what I respect the most is that he is a man of strong faith and I know that wherever life takes him his faith will continue to be his Rock Ben congratulations on your appointment at the University of Florida I look forward to seeing all that your vision will accomplish at the University and I pray that God will richly bless you and Melissa and Corey and Alex and brick in the years ahead Mr President I yield the floor

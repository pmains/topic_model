great uh chairman cause thanks for um recognizing me uh thanks for the time and thank you for having this hearing and and all the panelists and the the testimony you submitted everything really really appreciated um also thank you to ranking member johnson um i agreed with the the comments he made during his um question period and quit and appreciated the the back and forth and the conversation he had with you ms stackhouse lawson i represent the first district of kansas um we call it the big first it's the largest beef producing district in the country but by dollar amount have a lot of feed yards uh packing plants cow calf operations i grew up on a preconditioning feed yard which is what our family has has always done so as a handful of questions um first for you ms brackett i agree with you in your testimony um and the usda research that you cited explaining that cattle are not truly significant contributors to long-term global warming the cattle producers actually help reduce other sorts of emissions through various practices but you know the story that we often hear in the media pays quite the opposite image in your opinion where is the disconnect and how do we change the public discourse how do we kind of reshape the public's image of production agriculture uh and these issues thank you representative i appreciate that question i think this disconnect has happened slowly over several years as people have left rural areas and moved to more urban and suburban areas there's there's a loss of historical knowledge about what goes on in farms and ranches and and really truly how cattle are actually raised so that leaves consumers in this country um not having a strong foundation when they may hear misperceptions in the news they're letting we're letting other people drive our narrative in this arena so and in regards to solving this problem um considering the society that we're in and the distrust that we seem to be facing i think the solution lies with having credible third parties talking about what the cattle industry does and what our sustainability story really is i see those third-party experts if you will they could be chefs well-known chefs they could be respected journalists scientists but we need um we need other people out there talking about what we're doing and to to back that up a little farther the science i can't underscore enough the importance of congressional support for more scientific research in sustainability arena that then those third-party folks could hopefully go out and and share with the consumers in this country yeah i agree anyone else want to add to that how do we reshape the image of production agriculture around these issues thank you this is rosie yeah rosie uh kim that is so right on uh we need to educate we need to tell our story and we need the research that documents all the benefits of how animal grazing is uh is helping save our planet and i would say i'd go so far as to say is without regenerative ag practices and animal grazing you can look to no future because if you look at some of the research and science that people are talking about we need to take action and agriculture is the answer to the yeah i think that's problem i think agriculture is the answer and uh in my view the bad news is the distance from farm to fork's never been wider uh the good news is with this device i can communicate to the entire world in a millisecond right so how do we do a better job of telling the story uh in in a positive light um and i agree with i appreciate the thought about needing the science and the third-party validators to cite the science um one last question i know i only have a minute um and that'd be for you mr meyer uh you mentioned that the most successful sustainable tools are created by those implementing them and impacted by them i couldn't agree more can you have any examples of your experience with successful industry-led initiatives uh and and why do you think they were successful so at the u.s roundtable for sustainable poultry and eggs we've just completed um our building of the framework and that was completed this past december and so we're in the process of building an online tool for all of our members to be able to use and input that data once we do that we'll be able to baseline our sustainability across the u.s poultry and egg sectors so we base it on three pillars poultry planet and people trying to be holistic and encompassing all aspects every node of the supply chain in that there's over a hundred metrics that we have listed there and we've also also built our framework in such a way that it allows even those who are just beginning the sustainability journey to be able to use this tool in a manner that will help them be better in the sustainability in the future right so a small producer may not have a lot of resources to put against sustainability initiatives or even know how to tackle starting that process we built our tool or building our tool in a manner that will allow them to to ramp into the sustainability journey and we've also built it in a way that large organizations like mcdonald's can um with some resources to put against sustainability can also use this tool and and have their data incorporated in that so we have an end-to-end view of the sustainability view for the u.s poultry and egg industries great great thank you i see my times inspired thank you chairman i appreciate the time

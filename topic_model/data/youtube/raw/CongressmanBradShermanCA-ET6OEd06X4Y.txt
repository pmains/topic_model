Eyewitness News reporter Alex Michaelson is live in Washington DC ineligible for congressman who is attending the inauguration what are they expecting or what are they hoping I guess to hear yeah that's right about a half hour ago we were joined by Republican congresswoman Mimi Walters now we're joined by Democratic congressman brad Sherman of sherman oaks unless of the San Fernando Valley congressman good to see you a lot of your Democratic colleagues especially from Southern California decided not to attend the inauguration why did you decide to go well I'll be there along with President Obama President Clinton President Carter and of course Hillary Clinton Bernie Sanders and I'll be there with the with a heavy heart I mean none of us are celebrating but I think we've got to show respect for the process and the way to do that is to do it when the process gives us the wrong answer it's easy to support the process when it gives you the right answer we have a flawed process it has an electric college it has a number of other things like unlimited money and citizens united in all that but it is our process is given us this result and I think that our focus now needs to be to use the legal process to investigate what happened with Russia and also part of the process is the governmental process and a few years ago when Democrats had big majorities they passed Obamacare now Republicans are trying to repeal it and replace it aren't saying what they will replace it with but they have majorities now what's the strategy for fighting back especially when they have the majority the strategy is to March as we're doing on Saturday come on KABC and talk about what it means for the country if you repeal Obamacare the Affordable Care Act we as 32 million people lose their coverage what happens if David Price's is nominee for Health Secretary succeeds in his effort to privatize Medicare it means seniors don't get help unless they're help the voucher system works fine unless you have a medical problem and what does it mean when you have a candidate and now soon to be president who's talked about mass deportations and millions of people that are part of the fabric of our life in Los Angeles you've got to expose that you've got to fight against a lot of big fights ahead and you will be at the center of all of them congressman thanks so much for being with us we appreciate it congressman brad Sherman so for Democrats this is a tough time and start of something tough and for Republicans you see a lot of excitement very different moves here in Washington reporting live from Washington easy Alex Michaelson ABC 7 Eyewitness News thank you so much Alec

hi I'm congresswoman Russia fudge today is Martin Luther King Day a day to celebrate the life legacy and accomplishments of a man dedicated to social justice and public service dr. King was an inspirational leader not just because of his great works but more because of the hardships and obstacles that were a part of his daily life dr. King dreamed of a better more diverse America he dedicated his life's work to this ideal no matter what he faced dr. King never gave up he knew in the end and I quote we will remember not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends we cannot be silent about the infant mortality crisis in our nation the black infant mortality rate in Ohio is a travesty in 2014 14 point 3 out of every 1,000 black babies died in ohio the national average in the same year was only eleven point two per thousand even worse Ohio's black infants are dying at a rate two times higher than their white counterparts in this country in the greatest nation in the world and in the state with some of the best health care in the world no parent should have to bury their child due to infant mortality we must do better for all of ohio family's the conversations you have today will help springboard a state and nationwide dialogue about this issue I applaud you for your efforts I pledge to work with Senator Brown state representative Sykes mayor hourigan the Summit County Office of Public Health and the entire community to eradicate infant mortality in our state but it will take dedication from everyone to ensure our babies get a healthy start at life to quote dr. King the ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy these are indeed challenging times tackling infant mortality is difficult but not impossible together we can do what must be done for all of Ohio's children best wishes on a wonderful event thank you

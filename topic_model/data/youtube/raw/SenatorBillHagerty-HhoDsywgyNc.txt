we welcome back to the program senator bill hagerty he's with the great state of tennessee you know i'm i i talk to all of i talk to governors and senators from all over the country i'm the biggest idiot in the entire country because i'm up here paying these high taxes in new york which are about to get higher and what what's your state income tax down in tennessee senator sean it's going to pain you to hear this uh oh no i've been income tax what's that there's no personal income tax there's no personal income tax so say it hannity you can say it senator you have my full permission to tell the truth i am an idiot what am i doing in the in the rotten weather when i could be on music row on a regular basis listening to my favorite country music i am a dope i'm an idiot why i'm so stupid we've got to welcome we've got the welcome carpet out for you here sean you'd love it here you need to visit more often i look forward to to being your host when you can come here next you know i do go down there quite a bit i'm a big supporter i don't know if you know michael w smith's charity rocket town yes yeah so i've been down there for a number of events and i try to help michael out as much as i can uh he's a great guy music there's nothing like music grow am i tell me if i'm wrong here isn't it the coolest place on earth it's great that's why i've kept my private office for years sean uh it's just got a great vibe to it it's it's the heart of the culture here in tennessee we've got a great music culture that extends from johnson city up in the northeast all the way through to memphis you know the one suggestion i do have and i've made this mistake in my life i'm friends with john rich don't ever go out on the town and party with john rich because you're not going to come home in good shape i can promise you and it doesn't matter no i'm only going to have one i'm only going to have two that's it i can't this guy has these magical powers the next thing you know you're you're taking shots of redneck riviera of whiskey which i hate anyway i'm not a big whiskey guy and uh but just it's a great town john has been been right in the heart of trying to get our town reopened you know he's he's got a great presence down on lower broadway uh the entertainment part of our city is is an exceptional asset and it was shut down during the pandemic and and john has a lot of hard work in getting it back democratic mayor of nashville correct me if i'm wrong didn't he lie about uh the numbers related to covid i think there have been a lot of accusations about trying to keep everybody massed up and shut down uh that that seems to be a goal of a lot of the democrat leaders not only in our cities but in our states and the result has been absolutely terrible from an economic perspective it's been terrible from a psychological perspective too sean and then you have the democrats come back and reward those states of the shutdown by creating a formula that gives them more stimulus money if they happen to have made bad economic decisions shut their state down and have higher unemployment than the rest no it's it's unbelievable and if you just be honest with us and which kind of gets to the the question about biden by the way i i would love john rich to run for mayor of nashville but i mean he probably would win um let me ask you about the what you just heard joe biden say versus where he stands today and then ask you as a follow-up i want to know do you think the republicans are going to stay united all 50 of you and not allow chuck schumer and company to to take it to abuse their power and make the biggest power grab in the history of the country well i i think that the recording you played shows exactly what we got during this election it was a huge bait and switch you know we were told repeatedly repeatedly by the biden campaign he wants to respect our institutions this quote returned to normalcy and then what do they turn around and do exactly what he said they want to pack the supreme court we warned about this they want to go from nine justices to 13. they want to add four more justices that would give them a seven to six majority activist versus constitutionalist on the bench they want to do away with the filibuster biden said of course he wouldn't be for that but that's exactly what they're talking about doing now they'll stop at nothing and they wanted to away with free fair elections just look at their so-called hr one senate one bill it is an abomination and you know they accused president trump of coming to washington and destroying our institutions he did exactly the opposite he didn't come to washington to blow our institutions up he came to return those institutions to the people that's exactly what he tried to do and then the democrats come in and they have no respect for institutions whatsoever just was witnessed by what you just ran through let me ask you on some international issues we have biden's u.n ambassador a woman named linda thomas greenfield i don't know how well you know her scene this week you know running down the u.s as a quote white supremacist nation while addressing foreign diplomats it's very reminiscent to me of the apology tour of obama it is shawn and i tell you one of the greatest honors in my lifetime was to represent our nation overseas as the us ambassador to japan in japan as you know third largest economy in the world after the united states and china we have more us military stations than any place else in the world it's a huge strategic relationship with us it's a very tough neighborhood as you know you've got north korea russia and china right there but it's also a very important economic relationship as well and it was always my greatest honor to represent the greatest nation in the world as you say are we perfect no but we can fight to make a more perfect union and we have a legislative branch an executive branch that should be working toward that every single day in a judicial press that we need to hold intact that will help continue to propel again the greatest nation in the world forward and to have our united nations ambassador speak in that manner i think is entirely inappropriate it's you know and i will say this is barry farber late one of the great pioneers of talk radio used to always say that there's never been a country in the history of mankind that has accumulated more power than the united states and abused it less and i add there's never been a a country in the history of mankind that has accumulated more power abused it less and used it to advance the human condition than this country i mean the the it's going to be american medical researchers and scientists ultimately that saved the world you know from covet and the coronavirus and this worldwide pandemic that we've had uh we're not courting our developments we're sharing our developments as we always do that's the type of people we are we're not perfect but we are good people agreed and i think president trump set the example that all americans appreciate by putting operation warp speed in place setting aside the bureaucratic barriers let's be the best we can be in america here let's find let's innovate let's create something that's going to solve a massive global problem and he delivered he's getting no credit for it now in fact other people are taking credit for it as you well know but it's going to be an impact felt around the world dealing with a problem caused for the rest of the world by china i mean it is pretty unbelievable now the new york times and the media the democrats the intel committee etc in the house adam schiff um who was a congenital liar but that's my own opinion but you see that the the mob and the media they're trying to make up stories to use against donald trump they did it during the campaign and finally now the biden administration had to walk back uh one of their quote big bombshell campaign season revelations last year that the russian government had put bounties on the heads of u.s troops in afghanistan now we're finding out yeah very low confidence in the story that team biden and the media was pushing at the time and that was a big deal i remember that those accusations were were extremely inflammatory they weren't supported by intelligence you know if they were sean that president trump would have stepped up immediately to deal with it the fact that he didn't understand the fact again that he respects our institutions unlike the democrats and uh he certainly abided by the intelligence and the flow of intelligence in a way that meant we acted in a more responsible and appropriate manner than the rhetoric that was coming from the democrats at the time yeah i mean and that was a big lie let me ask you this i'm a little worried about what's happening with the russians in ukraine i'm worried about the territorial ambitions of china with hong kong taiwan and you notice that they're building all these new islands out there in the pacific uh which is a little scary and and that could become a huge destabilizing force not just in the region but a military launch area i understand they're actually building certain areas just for military maneuverings and uh then you have the muellers in iran joe biden has already said oh yeah we're going back to the other deal getting nothing in exchange for it as usual and pressuring south korea to give them seven billion dollars why would we ever force another country to give the iranian muellers that chant death to america death to israel seven billion dollars why would we do that it's just an appeasement strategy sean they want the headline you know it's amazing to me that john kerry has now been sent over to china to negotiate with them on climate uh he's the one that got us into the iran deal uh a terrible account you've articulated it very well now is what was he talking about yesterday or the day earlier this week we're going to talk about talking about coming to the table this is diplomatic double speak at its best and what he's doing is again i think evidence in his iran deal he's going over to deal with china and talk chinese don't appreciate talk they appreciate strength power and action they have been the ones that have not abided by this paris climate accord in fact their emissions have gone up since they signed it and here he is trying to quote talk with them about what they might do to come back in again the same negotiating strategy that put us into the jpoa with iran now we've got that person leading us in china i am very concerned in russia i share your concerns with that too sean you know as soon as the byte administration stepped back uh the the earlier indication that they're going to send our naval forces uh into the region of ukraine and and the ports they're now all being blocked by the russians they say they're going to keep them blocked for six months that's putting a huge amount of stress economic stress on the ukraine at a time when i think russia is really acting in a belligerent fashion we should be supporting our allies not backing away from them well i think that's that's all true and the worst part about on all of this is the fact that now we're moving away from energy independence which we've now developed for the first time in what 75 years and and now you know the keystone xl pipeline has been canceled high paying career jobs have been lost in the middle of a pandemic and you know the basically nonchalantly they're telling union members union jobs some of these guys were making 100 150 200 grand a year uh yeah we just want you to get another union job well where's that other union job senator because i don't see it i tell you sean you've hit the nail on the head in terms of the strategic implications of canceling the keystone xl pipeline and halting you know new drilling leases on federal lands they're removing one of the greatest accomplishments of the trump administration which was achieving energy independence and we used to say we were not just exporting energy we were exporting freedom and to put us in a position where we weren't dependent on other nations that did not have our best interests at heart was exactly where we needed to be from a national security standpoint our economic security and our national security are completely aligned the biden administration is weakening us there and what happens with that oil from canada now that it's not going to go through the keystone xl pipeline it's going to be sent to china they're going to get discounted oil be put in a better competitive position just as we're raising the cost of energy here in america and when he talks about all those jobs i think there are 11 000 jobs that are lost with the keystone xl pipeline construction those jobs are going to go to green industry let me tell you sean the solar turbines and i'm sorry the solar panels and the wind turbines they're made in china that's right great increase yeah oh good that's that's great news you're full of great news senator um anyway uh i hope you have a great weekend is music road now finally back open or no it it's it's it's pretty much back open now sean we've got great weather here uh it's a good time you know cherry blossoms are blooming it there in washington you've got prime minister suga from japan meeting with president biden today that's an important relationship i think it underscores the importance the fact that it's the first face-to-face meeting that biden has had with a foreign leader is with japan again given the strategic importance importance of that relationship in a tough neighborhood as we discussed there are reasons to be optimistic because i think that relationship is going to continue to flourish and strengthen but we've got to be open-eyed and you do a great job of informing all your listeners and viewers uh of the concerns and the challenges that we face and i'm honored to represent tennessee to fight those challenges i'm glad you're in the fight we need you marcia blackburn also your colleague has done a great job from tennis for the for the people of tennessee as kenny chesney says i'm a tennessean right so anyway appreciate you being with us uh thank you senator uh senator bill hagerty tennessee

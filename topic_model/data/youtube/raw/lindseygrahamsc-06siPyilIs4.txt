if the iranians get a nuclear weapon sunni arab states this is a shia persian country sunni arab states have been fighting these guys for a thousand years they're going to want a nuclear weapon too do you agree with that the saudis are going to get one egypt will try to get one turkey would try to get one what country's in the middle dismiss israel so you have a scenario scenario building this summer that could lead to a nuclear arms race in the mideast the last place in the world you want nuclear weapons is the mideast why people over there are crazy so if you want to stop it now do something that would change the narrative we're weak and our friends can't count on us and our enemies are in bold i don't have all the answers in syria but i know doing nothing is going to lead to what i just said and doing something that is weak is just as bad as doing nothing i'm trying to find the middle ground if israel believes the iranians are close to a nuclear weapon do you believe they will attack yes i believe that if we get syria wrong within six months and you can quote me on this there will be a war between iran and israel over their nuclear program the jewish state has a saying what is it never again they mean it the israeli air force has far less capability than we do even though they're one of the finest air forces in the world the iranians know that if we took them on to stop their nuclear programs we would win and they would lose they believe they can withstand an israeli attack and march forth the ayatollahs are crazy they're not stupid if they got a nuclear weapon they believe they would be safe from western involvement just like north korea the day that these ayatollahs get nuclear technology i believe they would share it with terrorists do you believe that and my fear is that it won't come to america on the top of a missile it will come in the belly of a ship in charleston or near a car and that we will have nuclear technology coming to america supplied by iran that you can't contain a nuclear-armed iran you have to prevent it i wish we lived in better times i wish people in the world were more stable i wish war would go away but you can't defend yourself based on wishing and hoping in 1920s and 30s the world just really ignored hitler the rest is history how do i know they want to kill us all because they're saying they do it's not a mystery just ask them so i want a reasoned response on syria that allows syrians to do the fighting not us i want to make sure the iranians understand we're serious about stopping their nuclear program and yes i want to protect our friends in the middle east because we need friends you can't kill all these terrorists you need people helping

thank you madam chair secretary DeVos thank you for being here today I will have three questions that I'll go through fairly quickly the first is on the Perkins loan program as you are aware Congress has decided not to extend this campus-based loan program despite widespread support from members of this committee in the majority of the house for a bipartisan bill that I introduced with representative Poe can I've been hearing a lot of concerns from campuses in my district about the lack of clarity of the process for winding down this program specifically colleges are concerned over how the federal share of the revolving fund will be determined and equally important at what point in this process our schools going to be required to surrender those funds could you speak to the process of winding down the Perkins loan program thanks congresswoman we touched on this briefly and I have gotten more information about the fact that in in the wind down our team is working closely with the institutions to ensure that they have clarity around the process and that students know what their alternatives are at the conclusion of this program to be clear those in the program as it exists will see their way through to the completion of the program and that there will be other alternatives and opportunities for students and for the institutions involved currently that we are working with them to ensure they have that clarity great and I just want to continue to encourage the Department to make this process as easy as possible for our higher ed institutions to make up for the loss of this program my second question is I want a reference in your opening statement you discussed the need to offer students in failing schools the option to receive a better education and that zip codes and family wealth should not determine a student's opportunity I represent one of the largest districts on the East Coast and one of the most rural districts we do not have charter schools like our neighbors in New York City and I actually represent very very few communities that even have a private or parochial school so there are challenges that we face the public public school system is an incredibly important community center and basis for our educational system on Friday I visited Argyle Central School Argyle is a small community in Washington County and they hop and I had the opportunity to meet with an amazing art teacher who has headed up the school systems art program for 40 years and I want to hear what your ideas are about rural innovation how can we take our best and brightest teachers and ensure that schools in a rural district like mine have access to those increased electives have access to additional AP courses so I'd love to hear your ideas on rural innovation thanks for that question I think sometimes when we think about rural areas we we think of choice in terms of added infrastructure and I like to encourage those from rural area areas and engaged in them to really think more broadly about how different choices can be introduced and I think about students perhaps in this Argyll School who may want to pursue an AP course that simply doesn't have enough students to warrant a teacher or it's just impossible to offer we know that there's probably a very capable and highly qualified instructor that could teach that course to that student remotely or virtually and perhaps there's a small cadre of students within that school that learn differently than the other students perhaps there could be a sort of a little sub charter school that actually collocates within the school to meet the needs of those students who learn differently and while still maintaining the community feel of that particular building I think we I think we just have to be open to thinking more broadly and creatively about how different students needs and desires for study can be met and do it within the context of what works for a community yes I appreciate that I do think looking at exceptional teachers like Ric flurry for example the art teacher that I was discussing making his expertise available to other public school systems in my region that would be a way to strengthen education and that's just example there are lots of other examples of amazing teachers my third question is related to actually the other side of my district from where Argyle is I represent Fort Drum home to the 10th Mountain Division the most deployed unit in the US Army so we have thousands of military families in the north country and those military families are served by the Indian River and Carthage school districts and our community is very reliant upon impact aid which is important for those military families and when I meet with those families they frequently talk about how they think it's a strength of our community that the public school system they're integrated with non military families can you talk about the importance of impact aid I am concerned about some of the proposals that would upset this unique ecosystem that we have in the north country in New York so I'd love to hear about why impact aid is important to support and what the department's plans are when it comes to this program and this funding well thanks for that question impact aid does it does have a great import for those communities that have a lot of military connected families and this administration remains committed to ensuring that those those funds and that support is there for those families at the same time we know that there are many military families who today say that they are making decisions to continue in active service and active duty based on whether they're going to be able to be living in a place that they feel confident of and comfortable of the school options education options for their children so I think we have to think again more broadly about how can we ensure that we meet the needs of those families and give military connected families more choices in their children's education and at the same time respect the communities that these bases are located in and again have both and provide options for the families that really need and want it and ensure that the schools that in the communities that are currently serving others well continue thank you I will continue to support impact a under its current model it's important to fully fund the program it works in my district I think we're an example of why it's so important so thank you for answering those questions today and I yield back

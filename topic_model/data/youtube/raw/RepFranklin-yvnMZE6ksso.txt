a number of my previous questions have been asked so i've got one that may be a little unfair for you but i just i want to ask it anyway just because it's something that i'm curious about as we get all these posture hearings but uh a lot of talk in uh both written and oral testimony about the threat of china we all know that that's not just what we're hearing here today it's come from all the other services as well but i notice in the written testimony and as as we've seen in all the other services the talk of climate change i'm curious um secretary roth have is there money allocated within this current year budget for climate change programs or anything that the department of the air force or the space command have any purview over there is money in our budget uh for example uh we budgeted 68 million dollars for essentially insta improve our installation uh resilience uh taking a look for example at power sources and water sources and see if there's some targeted investments we can make to improve our resilience in that area we also have is part of that 68 million dollars we'll look at where our cyber security vulnerabilities are on basis and we'll also look to see where we can make some improvements in our emergency management procedures and you know when something does happen uh you know what are some improved procedures and processes we can put in place so that's the only money i'm aware of that's explicitly targeted uh for climate change installation resilience i would i would also say you know in in terms of our operational requirements operational resilience is very important to us as well and particularly aircraft engines in the total dod enterprise we the air force use about two-thirds of the fuels that's spent by the by the entire dod enterprise largely driven obviously by our airplanes and so to the extent that we can invest in new technologies as we re-engine for example the b-52 or as we look to the next generation aircraft if we can reduce the fuel consumption by by some significant percentage that'd be an enormous readiness improvement because it would reduce our logistics footprint as we try to do agile basing and moving people around as well so we're also have some targeted investments act actually predate some of this to look in terms of can we reduce our fuel usage and reduce our logistics footprint as well all right thank you i am it's just a concern to me that our commander chief says that the number one threat to united states national security is climate change and yet i'm not hearing that coming from the services i'm just glad to know that even though the top line budget isn't what most of the services would like that you're not specifically feeling the haircut on that with climate change initiatives but thank you and i yield back venture thank you mr franklin

I am joined now by US congressman brad Sherman he is a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and former chairman of the Subcommittee on terrorism great to have you here congressman thank you so much for making the time you know I want to first talk about the anti-isis policy here in the United States and I know that you have been calling for a more robust and tie Isis policy so what do you saying needs to change well in our bombing campaign we're getting more robust this convoy we hit today three or four months ago we wouldn't have hit it and the thinking was even if you're carrying Isis supplies you're carrying Isis oil for export uh you might be a civilian driver well you know during world war two we hit every train and occupied France the we could that we could hit uh why would this not have happened three or four months ago because we had a policy of zero civilian casualties and even the people working for Isis if they were truck drivers will maybe they're civilians it's hard to distinguish what is and is not a civilian about is obviously change what is the policy uh there is no clear policy that's been enough but it appears to be you hit the strategic target just as we did in World War two and you try to avoid civilian casualties this isn't a Donald Trump thing where you say go deliberately go after civilians who are related to Isis fighters you try to avoid but if you see a strategic target you hit the strategic target defeating Isis is really going to have to be a multi-pronged approach right you can't just defeat them on the battlefield you also mentioned online propaganda but also what we're seeing is every time that you know Isis has losses on the battlefield the reality is that we see them export their terror outside their territories so that's the new reality so what what can be done to defeat Isis on those fronts that we just talked about not just the battlefield well first we've got to take down their webpages their Twitter accounts etc gradually we've been able to do that twitter is now cooperating far more than they did a year ago and so they're going to one on discussions rather than a broadcasting approach or then what we need to do is we have to have a message that reflects an understanding of Islam you can't argue Islam if you don't know Islam and there's no one at the State Department we've got tens of millions of dollars being spent on getting our message out but our message is being written by people who don't know Islam we haven't hired a single person because they've memorized the Quran great to have this conversation with you congressman brad Sherman thank you for your time thank you

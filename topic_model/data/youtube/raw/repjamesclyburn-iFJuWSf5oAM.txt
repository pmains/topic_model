and congressman james Clyburn is accusing detractors of using racially charged dog whistles to undermine his bid for House Majority Whip a position that he held from 2007 to 2011 in an interview with McClatchy clabber and said quote I don't know where it's all coming from but someone came to me over the weekend and told me that when I was with before I was a figurehead clobberin also alleges he was called token he's the only black member of the leadership team in Congress they're here to sort all of it out for us who better than congressman james Clyburn Democrat of South Carolina assistant Democratic leader and Jake Sherman is well coauthor of course of political playbook congressman let me start with you and in this idea again from miss Pelosi that she's got the votes in this reporting that Marcia fudge of Ohio your friend says she's been overwhelmed by support who is it Marcia fudge or Nancy Pelosi that's the next Speaker of the House well Craig thank you so much for having me I think you know that I've been supporting Nancy Pelosi throughout this campaign I've supported her throughout her leadership bid and I continue to support her Marcia fudge is a very good friend and I like so many LG on the hill there saw her ruminating that last night about this spoke with her at mint this morning and she's still ruminating and so there's no announcement she's not a candidate she knows that I'm supporting Nancy Pelosi and she tells me this morning she continues to support me very vigorously to be the whip in the next Congress and so I think they will see how all this plays out in his leadership races you have these kinds of things to pop up throughout the process nothing takeout to suspect you have some more before we get to a vote I want to go back to that McClatchy article because because your contingent here that some of your Democratic your colleagues are using dog whistles and and words like token what do you make of that I mean do you think there's actually something there do you think that that just might just be rumor no I don't think it's rumor at all how do you think that those words were used because it's not the first time you know when I ran for whip before I heard some of that people are saying to me that an african-american did not have the capacity to the raise the kind of money that you need to raise in that capacity I proved them all wrong then in this cycle and we heard some of the same stuff my goal about the jiseop the d-triple-c was to raise 1.5 million dollars for d-triple-c i raised over seven million dollars Madhu's were six hundred thousand dollars a year my paint seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars in dues and I gave directly to other candidates and fellow colleagues 1.1 million dollars directly from my bank account in today--is so this whole notion that I'm some kind of pool or some kind of a token there's a bunch of poppycock you expect those things by preparan Lee to be used in these campaigns and I expect to hear dog whistles he can't pass I never expect to hear it coming from friends and supporters of my colleagues and to be clear these are Democrats were talking about - right we're not talking about folks on the other side of the aisle well what I heard over the weekend and there was Saturday when I got a phone call from a colleague Saturday saying that that was being repeated by a fellow Democrat where that person got it from I don't know another person I don't think was here when I was Majority Whip before and properly repeating something somebody told them but you know as we sit down south where you and I are from I'll let my work speak for me amen to that I bring in Jake Sherman here for a second congressman don't go anywhere Jake I want to call our viewers and listeners on Sirius satellite radio I want to call their attention to this new CNN poll it shows that Democratic voters are almost evenly split over whether Pelosi should be Speaker 44% say Pelosi is the best choice 46 percent saying they would prefer a different Democrat here's the thing Jake Sherman in the upper chamber Chuck Schumer loses a seat or two and no one's calling for Chuck Schumer's head Democrats pick up you know 35 seats and all of a sudden you've got a significant number of people saying Nancy Pelosi maybe shouldn't be the speaker why is that it's a good question I mean Republicans have spent hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars over the last decade or so beating up on Nancy Pelosi and campaigns around the country I was on the road for almost all of October and every single place I went Nancy Pelosi was a campaign issue that Republicans had introduced into the race and if you talked to Nancy Pelosi supporters and I'm sure mr. Clyburn would agree with this that some of the animus toward Pelosi is because Republicans are forcing Democrats to answer whether they support her now whether you're Republican antsy closest or not the the Nancy Pelosi Jim Clyburn and Steny Hoyer leadership team from 2010 to 2012 passed massive pieces of legislation into law whether you like them or not you have to recognize that the health care bill the wall street dodd-frank bill and and they passed a climate bill that died in the Senate but I mean these were big pieces of legislation that took a lot of muscling to get through Congress so there's no question that they are an efficient team I think what a lot of Democrats that I've been talking to over the last couple days what they want to hear is what does it mean that Nancy Pelosi will be a transitional figure what could could she put a little bit more meat on those bones she has said it that that's something that she has offered up what does she mean by that and how long is that transition because no matter what you think of Pelosi or anybody in the leadership there definitely is a sense that there for that they want to transition to a younger generation so I think everybody including mr. Clyburn would agree that younger generation has not been groomed because they've been not and they've not been in the leadership circle yet and there's a lot that you learn once that you once you're in the leadership then you don't really know in the rank and file Jake let's put your question to the congressman there's this idea congressman Clyburn that miss Pelosi going to be a transitional leader what does that mean how do you understand that well nASA has said that and so hastinapura and so have I in fact I may have been the first one to use the term transitional because I believe in that I come out of the reason of the country where it's pretty difficult to practice progressive politics but we've survived it and I believe very strongly that in a combination of capacity the and wisdom in order to get us to where we need to be and I think that's what transition means the young people coming in have the capacity and we should start giving them the practical experiences that is needed to develop the wisdom and the know-how to move forward and if I'm elected a Democratic whip I will be immediately Dillon a stable of deputy whips with young people who will learn how to count votes who will learn how to interact with fellow members both on outside and across the aisle you know to be effective legislators and effective officers and leadership positions going forward so that's what transition means to me to immediately put in place a process by which this can begin to occur

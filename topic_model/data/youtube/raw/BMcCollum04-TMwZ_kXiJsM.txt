Thank You mr. speaker I think the ranking member and I think the chair is follows the authors of this piece of legislation mr. Chabot and mr. Crowley for their work on on this important issue last month I visited Burma and Bangladesh on a congressional fact-finding mission our visit to refugee camps our conversations with survivors made it clear that the persecution that rahaga people in Burma's Rakhine State is a severe humanitarian crisis and demands robust American leadership this resolution is a important first step in demonstrating that Congress will not tolerate human rights abuses against the rangas our delegation saw however there is a path forward the Burmese government and the military must fully implement the recommendations of the former un secretary-general Kofi Annan's Advisory Commission Burma must work with Bangladesh and the UN must fully work to return voluntarily there were hunger refugees with a guarantee of a safe return and a fair process to allow their Hingis to apply first and secure citizenship that must be established and finally there must be an independent investigation to ensure accountability for the atrocities and the abuses that have taken place mr. speaker I saw people suffering in both Burma and in Bangladesh and the suffering must come to an end they are crying out for action and the United States and the international community must help them secure justice in this bill this vote today is just the beginning I encourage people to support this and I yield the time back

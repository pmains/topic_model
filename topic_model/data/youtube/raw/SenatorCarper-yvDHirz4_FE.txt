SENATE IS. MR. CARPER: I ASK THAT THE QUORUM CALL BE VITIATED. THE PRESIDING OFFICER: WITHOUT OBJECTION. MR. CARPER: I RISE IN HONOR OF GREG WILLIAMS TO SERVE IN THE DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE, WE BELIEVE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT DISTRICT COURTS IN OUR NATION. WHAT MAKES IT AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE AMERICAN ECONOMY AND WHAT MAKES GREG WILLIAMS AN EXCEPTIONAL NOMINEE TO SERVE, IN THE WORDS OF THE AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION, THEY DEEM HIM WELL QUALIFIED FOR TO BE FEDERAL JUDGE. I WANT TO SHARE SOME BACKGROUND IN THE PROCESS THAT WE USE IN DELAWARE, MR. PRESIDENT, FOR MAKING RECOMMENDIZATIONS TO THE FEDERAL BENCH TO THE PRESIDENT. A FEW YEARS AGO MY FRIEND, MY WINGMAN, SENATOR CHRIS COONS, HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE WHITE HOUSE FOR TWO VACANCIES ON THE SAME COURT. THERE WAS AT THE TIME A PRESIDENT OF A DIFFERENT PARTY AND THE MAJORITY HERE WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE, NOT ON THIS SIDE AT THAT TIME. OUR PROCESS WAS SIMPLE THEN. IT WAS STRAIGHTFORWARD. BARRED HEAVILY FROM THE PROCESS I USED WHILE SERVING AS GOVERNOR OF DELAWARE FOR EIGHT YEARS. THROUGHOUT THE EIGHT YEARS WHEN I WAS PRIVILEGED TO SERVE AS GOVERNOR, WE RELIED ON A JUDICIAL NOMINATING COMMISSION AND CHARGED THEM WITH A SIMPLE TASK. BASICALLY THIS WAS IT. FIND THE MOST QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS REGARDLESS OF POLITICAL PARTY, MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE GOVERNOR FOR APPOINTMENTS TO DELAWARE'S MANY IMPORTANT STATE COURTS, INCLUDING OUR STATE COURT AND COURT OF CHANCERY. WE USED A SIMILAR PROCESS FOR FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT VACANCIES. THIS PROCESS SERVED DELAWARE WELL DURING THE EIGHT YEARS AND I BELIEVE THAT THE PROCESS THAT SENATOR COONS AND I USE NOW SERVES OUR NATION WELL, TOO, REGARDLESS OF WHICH POLITICAL PARTY CONTROLS THE WHITE HOUSE OR THE SENATE. IT HAS YIELDED YET ANOTHER EXTRAORDINARY NOMINEE. THAT NOMINEE IS GREG WILLIAMS, A PARTNER AT FOX ROTHSCHILD, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE GATHER STATE BAR ASSOCIATION AND PRESIDENT BIDEN NOMINATED TO SERVE AS THE NEXT JUDGE ON THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR DELAWARE. GREG IS MORE THAN A LAWYER, MUCH MORE. HE'S A FATHER, A HUSBAND, A SON, AND A BROTHER. IN FACT, HE IS THE YOUNGEST BROTHER IN HIS FAMILY OF FIVE WITH FOUR OLDER SISTERS AND I KNOW THEY HELP TO KEEP HIM ON THE STRAIGHT AND NARROW MUCH LIKE MY OLDEST SISTER DID WITH ME. GREG HAS BEEN MARRIED TO HIS HIGH SCHOOL SWEETHEART TRINA FOR 27 YEARS. TOGETHER THEY'VE RAISED TWO CHILDREN IN DELAWARE THAT ANY ONE OF US WOULD BE PROUD TO CALL OUR OWN. VILLANOVA LAW GRADUATE, HE HAS WORKED FOR FOX ROTHSCHILD FOR THE PAST 28 YEARS. THROUGH COMMITMENT TO EXCELLENCE, IN 2003, GREGG BECAME THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN ATTORNEY TO HAVE BEEN HIRED AS AN ASSOCIATE AND THEN BEING NAMED AS A PARTNER AT FOX ROTHCHILD. GREG LEARNED THAT IN PART AS A MEMBER OF THE U.S. ARMY RESERVE WHERE HE SERVED FROM 1986 TO 1994, PART OF THOSE YEARS WHEN I WAS HIS COMMANDER IN CHIEF, AS GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE. AFTER LAW SCHOOL, GREG EMBARKED ON A SUCCESSFUL LEGAL CAREER THAT THAT IS EARN THE HIM THE RESPECT AND ADMIRATION OF DELAWARE'S LEGAL COMMUNITY. GREG HAS PARTICULAR EXPERTISE IN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND BUSINESS LITIGATION, WHICH MAKE HIM PARTICULARLY WELL-SUITED FOR THE DELAWARE DISTRICT COURT. MORE THAN HIS PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS, THOUGH, GREG IS THE PERSONIFICATION OF THE GOLDEN RULE, WHICH CALLS ON US TO TREAT ONE ANOTHER THE WAY WE WANT TO BE TREATED. AS A RESULT, HE'S ALSO THE PERSONIFICATION OF JUDICIAL TEMPERAMENT IN THAT COURTROOM AND ANY COURTROOM FOR THAT MATTER. LIKE SENATOR COONS AND ME AND MANY OF OUR COLLEAGUES, GREG IS A PERSON OF DEEP FAITH. HE UNDERSTANDS PERSONALLY THE WORDS GOLDEN RULE AND WHAT THEY MEAN. AND IF CONFIRMED, I BELIEVE HE'LL USE THAT RULE TO GUIDE HIM ON THE BENCH. MR. PRESIDENT, LET ME CLOSE BY SAYING THIS. WE'VE ALL PROBABLY HEARD A SAYING THAT'S OFTEN USED IN TERMS OF RELATIONSHIP TO AND UNDERSIZED BOXER, SOMEONE WHO PUNCHES ABOVE THEIR WEIGHT. THE DELAWARE COURT HANDLES AN ARRAY RELATED TO INTELLECTUAL LAW AND BANKRUPTCY LAW AND OTHER SPECIALIZED BUSINESS CASES THAT ARE CRITICAL TO THE FUNCTIONING OF OUR NATIONAL ECONOMY. LIKE OUR SMALL STATE, THIS COURT PUNCHES ABOVE ITS WEIGHT. OUR NOMINEE GREG WILLIAMS HAS A STRONG WORKthIC THAT IS NECESSARY FOR THIS -- ETHIC THAT IS NECESSARY FOR THIS COURT TO FUNCTION AS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT DISTRICT COURTS IN OUR LAND. I CONSIDER IT A PRIVILEGE TO GIVE HIM MY STRONGEST POSSIBLE ENDORSEMENT. I ENCOURAGE MY COLLEAGUES TO JOIN SENATOR COONS AND ME TODAY IN SUPPORTING HIS NOMINATION ON THE SENATE FLOOR. AND WITH THAT, I DON'T SEE -- I DON'T KNOW THAT OUR COLLEAGUE -- HERE COMES SENATOR COONS. HE IS A HERE TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THIS NOMINEE AS WELL S I'M JUST SAY THIS. WE HAVE JUDICIAL NOMINEES COME BEFORE US OFTEN IN THIS BODY. IN SOME CASES, THE FOLKS WHO ARE FROM THE STATE WHERE THAT NOMINEE HAILS, THEY KNOW THEM, HAVE AT LEAST A PASSING KNOWLEDGE OF THEM RIGHT NOW, HAVE MAYBE MET THEM. WE'VE KNOWN GREG WILLIAMS FOR ALMOST A QUARTER OF A CENTURY S HE IS NOT JUST ONE OF THE FINEST LAWYERS IN OUR STATE, HE IS ONE OF THE FINEST HUMAN BEINGS IN OUR STATE. IT IS AN HONOR FOR ME TO JOIN SENATOR COONS IN PUTTING HIS NAME -- SUGGESTING HIS NAME TO THE PRESIDENT. I'M GRATEFUL TO THE PRESIDENT FOR ACTUALLY SUBMITTING THAT NAME TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE FOR OUR CONSIDERATION. AND WITH THAT, MR. PRESIDENT, I'M GOING TO YIELD THE FLOOR -- I SEE NOW SENATOR CASSIDY IS HERE. I DON'T KNOW IF HE ALSO THE OPPORTUNITY -- NO, HE'S GOING TO WAIT FOR A WHILE. I'M GOING TO JUST STOP RIGHT HERE. SENATOR COONS STOPPED JUST BRIEFLY. I THINK HE'LL BE RIGHT BACK ON THE FLOOR AND HOPEFULLY HE'LL BE ABLE TO PICK UP WHERE I LEFT OFF. I'LL DO THE HANDOFF TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM DELAWARE.

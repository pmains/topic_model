is an honor to be joining you here tonight for this important time on the House floor and I come here to appeal to all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle Republicans and Democrats to reject the anti-israel and anti-semitic hatred that we are starting to see infiltrating American politics and even the halls of Congress it is important that we all come together that we work together not in power not embrace associate with individuals and rhetoric and policy that promotes this anti-israel and anti-semitic hatred but that we reject it it was just a couple weeks ago that this chamber came together nearly unanimously to reject white supremacy what is taking so long for House Democratic leadership to schedule a votes on House Resolution 72 that I introduced with congressman bud congresswoman Stefanik congressman Walker is a co-sponsor and others as well why can't we come together as forcefully and urgently to reject that anti-semitism and an anti-israel hatred we have House Democrats who have associated with taking pictures with embraced Louis Farrakhan he said quote so when they talk about Farrah Kane called me a hater you do what they do call me an anti-semite stop it I'm anti termite Louis Farrakhan said that last year he also said Satanic Jews have infected the whole world with poison and deceits this is offensive to me as someone who's Jewish but I'm talking to colleagues who aren't Jewish and they're offended as well by Farrah Kane and also the fact that there are members of this chamber who associate with this person 1984 Farrah can said about Adolf Hitler quote he was a very great man activist Tameka Mallory called Louis Farrakhan quote the greatest of all time her fellow organizer Linda Sarsour said quote only Jews are ones that condone violence against Arabs and are cool with mosques being attacked I have no problem standing here in a well this chamber and we're injecting it I don't know what is taking so long for House Democratic leadership to schedule a vote on House Resolution 72 so that they can join us in condemning it as well there's a freshman representative from Michigan representing Rasheeda Talib who supports the boycott divestment and sanctions movement she invited Abbas Hamidah to attend her swearing-in events this month Abbas said in 2016 quote Israel does not have a right to exist the terrorist entity is illegal and has no basis to exist other than a delusional Isis like ideology also stated this month that person said I quote I'm willing to go back to my country Palestine if the Zionist terrorists go back to Poland deal let's get that ball rolling ASAP get off Twitter and let's make that happen this same representative said of those who support Israel quote they forgot what country they represent well as someone who has been in the United States Army for over 15 years have deployed into combat in defense of this country a former Army paratrooper with the 82nd Airborne Division I never once in my life have forgotten what country I represent and it's kind of ironic that someone who on the victory night rape wraps themselves in the Palestinian flag he's trying to lecture us especially for supporting our nation's greatest ally in Israel the boycott divestment and sanctions movement is one that is founded by someone named Omar Bugatti who said quote we are witnessing the rapid demise of Zionism and nothing can be done to save it for Zionism is intent on killing itself I for one support euthanasia and he also said quote many of the methods of collective and individual punishment meted out to Palestinian civilians at the hands of young racist often sadistic and ever impervious Israeli soldiers are reminiscent of common Nazi practices against the Jews so when you are embracing BDS know that this is what the founder of BDS says this goes beyond anti Israeli hatred is anti-semitic hatred and what is taking so long this chamber that had nope I'm rushing to this well nearly unanimously rejecting white supremacy meanwhile has a problem rejecting this meanwhile our students in the name of the BDS movement on college campuses all across this entire country are being subjected to blatant anti-semitism for example at New York University the student government passed a resolution supporting BDS the Bronfman Center for Jewish life was temporarily closed in response to threatening Twitter posts by student who expressed quote a desire for Zionists to die other college campuses include a University of Michigan professor refused to write a letter of recommendation for a qualified student to study abroad solely because she was seeking a study abroad in Israel a students for justice in Palestine co-founder and University of California Berkeley professor spoke at a national conference and shared anti-semitic meme of an Orthodox Jewish person in this presentation at Warren Wilson College and invited speaker said quote Jews are doing the same thing to the Palestinians as the Nazis did to the Jews the examples go on whether it was Charlottesville where the leadership said Jews must die that he wanted all Jews to die or whether it was the the shooting that took place in Pittsburgh we are motivated my colleagues and I to this chamber to stand against anti-israel anti-semitic hatred everyone in this chamber should join us I went through kindergarten through 12th grade college law school four years of active duty and I never once experienced anti-semitism it has no business infiltrating American politics it has no business infiltrating the campuses of United States universities and colleges and it has no business infiltrating the halls of Congress I encourage an immediate vote on House Resolution 72 and I yield back to the gentleman

now pennsylvania congresswoman madeline dean a democratic member of the house judiciary and financial services committees and she is also the co-author of under our roof a son's battle for recovery a mother's battle for her son for which we had a wonderful conversation a while back anyway welcome my friend let's get to these new reports about uh what we were just hearing from monica alba really getting some swift backlash here in fact your democratic colleague ted lew says this is an attack a direct attack on the first amendment by the trump justice department and former white house counsel john dean says it is way beyond nixon at his worst you want to weigh on this what's your reaction well first of all alex very good to be with you this mother's day weekend happy mother's day to you and all the mothers out there it is extraordinarily troubling but probably not surprising that the trump white house uh actually seized the personal phone calls the professional phone calls the phone records of the washington post reporters for three and a half months think of that and this was done under attorney general barr's auspices of course the attorney general had nothing to say about that but what this administration and this department of justice is doing is shining a bright light on uh what i think is very mischievous behavior of the trump administration's department of justice well and here's another big doj related story i want to talk with you about we have federal judge amy berman jackson who ruled that former a.g bill barr was disingenuous about the process behind his decision to issue a memo clearing trump on obstruction of justice charges and she ordered the doj to release a memo that barr claimed had informed that decision a memo that he said contained advice from top doj officials so judge berman jackson writing in part the review of the document reveals that the attorney general was not then engaged in making a decision about whether the president should be charged with obstruction of justice the fact that he would not be prosecuted was a given so the question has to be asked was justice served of course not uh but thank goodness for this judge's report and this judge's opinion uh calling uh attorney general barr disingenuous in a very blistering opinion and saying that the memo should be released you saw also in the month of march another judge federal judge reggie walton said that mr barr lacked credibility and candor we've been saying that all along you remember just two days after the mueller report was released to the attorney general at that time he came out with a strange uh incoherent frankly press conference saying there was nothing to see here and then delivered to uh the heads of both judiciary's committee uh both house and senate a four-page letter saying the same thing misinforming the american public i said at that time he had sanitized simplified and and uh really misled the american public with that four-page letter and then it took i think 28 days for him to release a redacted mueller report the judges are both right mr barr has no credibility he had no credibility then and we will get to the truth of the matter but in the meantime what has been done to the folks of doj and to the american public in terms of disinformation is powerfully dangerous and sadly those seeds we're seeing come to fruition even today so clearly this is serious can anything be done now about it certainly and i look forward to attorney general merrick garland uh doing exactly what they are doing being transparent uh under the rule of law not as a department that represents a president or a person but as a department that represents the rule of law for all america so yes we will get to the truth of it sadly it takes a lot of time when you have a lot of complicit elected officials who like to continue to spread big lies but we will get to the bottom of it thankfully we have a new administration that actually prizes the rule of law let's take a look now to uh january 6 of course the capital attack there nbc news is reporting that the fbi is still after the quote worst of the worst in the new uh in the riot rather even his new arrest a steady pace are lawmakers concerned congresswoman that the worst of the worst are still out there is this at all personal for any of you i certainly worry for all of our safety and until every single one uh who was uh in any way responsible for the attack by americans on americans on a joint session of congress uh i won't be at ease we have to seek justice for those insurrectionists who came and attacked our capital attacked maimed wounded and killed capitol police this is something that is incredibly serious that's why i support the independent commission i don't understand frankly alex why every single lawmaker whether they were in that capital or not regardless of party wouldn't say of course we have to understand what happened here so that it never happens again we have to bring them all to justice so if a january 6 commission is formed will house minority leader kevin mccarthy is he going to have to testify about his call with donald trump on that day january 6th i would hope so and i would think he should welcome it again it's information for the american public for for the record for this greater safety of uh individual people staff but actually it's about our democracy all of this has torn at the fabric of our democracy it is a precious thing it's something we have to lift up and protect mr mccarthy should want to testify exactly what conversations and communications he had with the president what was the president's state of mind it's pretty obvious from the reporting and from my own work on the impeachment investigation and trial that mr mccarthy was in communication with the president who was more concerned with the big lie than he was with the safety of his vice president or any of us including mr mccarthy pennsylvania congresswoman madeline dean i appreciate your candor i always do thank you so much so you probably figured all those trump-related conspiracy theories would have died down by now but if you saw what happened at a trump supporting gathering in florida

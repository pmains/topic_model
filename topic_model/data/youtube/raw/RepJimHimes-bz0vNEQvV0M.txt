but Mr Speaker and let me thank begin by thanking the chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Chairman newness and ranking membership of the Intelligence Committee for their good bipartisan work on a bill that i think is long overdue the good work on this bill mr. speaker goes back to the fact that the Patriot Act a piece of legislation crafted in haste and in fear after the tragic events of 911 in my opinion pushed the boundaries too far on the government's ability to surveil and gather information on people including American citizens the USA Freedom Act which I stand today to support goes a very long way to report restoring an appropriate balance between the imperative of national security and the civil liberties which we hold so dear this bill makes important reforms to the FISA Court but importantly it prohibits I'll say again prohibits the bulk collection under Section 215 under the pen register authorities and under National Security Letter statutes the bulk collection of data on American citizens Americans will now rest easy knowing that their calls or other records will not be where housed by the government no matter how careful that government is in the procedures it uses to access those files mr. speaker whatever the legal interpretations most recently definitively ruled upon by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals whatever the legal interpretations there is something about the idea of a government keeping extensive records on its free citizens which damages our intuitive sense of freedom and liberty so whatever the law and whatever the legal interpretations I do believe that those have been settled what we do here today which is to say that the government of the United States will not keep detailed call or other bulk records on its free citizens I believe is an important step forward for this country urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of the US

hi welcome everyone thank you for joining us on Friday Friday before Memorial Day weekend as always I hope everyone watching us is safe and well that you and your loved ones are doing okay during this very difficult time I'm very pleased to have you join us today and to be joined by two two friends I'll introduce in a moment that happy to have a conversation today about the impacts of the Cobra pandemic especially an area of mental health we've talked a lot about how the pandemic is straining our healthcare system we've taken a number of actions to address shortages of personal protective equipment you may have seen articles in the paper today of how pervasive that is and how much the state's been spending on it on ventilators the desperately needed medical equipment and other supplies that are making it difficult to address and get through this but the demo and emic is also having a dramatic effect on our already overstrain mental health system this month May is actually its mental health awareness month and it's appropriate for us to have this conversation at any time in the context of mental awareness time month and something to think about all year but especially in the midst of this crisis so I'm very pleased and honored to be joined by two people working on the front lines of this crisis dr. Mary Rollers Roberson is the founder and director of the Northern Illinois recovery community organization or Newark oh and Vicki tayo Tello is director of philanthropy and to constipate behavioral health services so welcome thanks thanks for joining us I'll turn to them in just a moment here but I wanted to share a little bit about the problem problems we're seeing and some of the actions that Congress is taking we know that during any crisis but especially one as broad as this the negative news the economic stress can create severe oftentimes but certainly worse than mental health issues for many individuals in our community the stress is pervasive and people who are already struggling with dealing with their own set of issues could be facing obviously even greater obstacles in particular distress on the recovery community people who are working to get back on their feet and pull things together so the Potomac pandemic poses challenges to people seeking mental health care people relying on on family friends and professionals and so they're looking for new ways finding new new vehicles such as telemedicine in Congress some of the actions we've taken as you know we passed three bills in March culminating in the cares Act a 1.2 trillion package took trained our package dealing with law this is where the big issues was mental health in that we provided additional funding for Samsa the substance abuse and mental health services administration this was money for mental support during the challenging time to perform support both treatment of mental health and substance abuse and offer increased outreach this was reinforced that was sign of paths signed by the president is now law it was reinforced in the bill passed last Friday a week ago the heroes Act in the house additional resources because we know we need to continue to invest to make sure that people have the care that they need I'm hopeful that at some point the Senate will choose to pick this up and move it forward but we will continue to push forward on that in addition last year I introduced the opioid workforce Act this is a bill that would create 1,000 additional residency slots for mental health and addiction medicine students trying to reinforce and build out our capacity to deal with what is in many ways a epidemic of its own right I'll continue to support efforts like this and another effort that is critically important that we need to work to push forward is the idea of mental health parity that we should be treating mental health as what it is it is a health care issue no different than asthma or diabetes and we need to make sure that it is getting the same support as any other health care issue so a lot more needs to be done we'll continue to work on that I am fortunate to have many in our community as partners helping us identify what look forward none none more important than the people joining us today so I want to turn it over to them for a quick introduction I'll start with dr. Mary Roberson as I mentioned she was the founder of mirko northern illinois recovery community organizations dr. Robison thanks so much for joining us Thank You congressman it's definitely a pleasure and an honor to be here as you know nurko is a 501c3 nonprofit with the mission to promote recovery support services here in Lake County we're providing those services for individuals impacted by substance use disorder and mental health I have been counseling and educating individuals and families in our community for the majority of my career here in Lake County and I just counted the honor and a privilege to be here to join in this conversation regarding mental health and impact of cop√°n 19 thank you thank you and next vicki Dillo is the director of philanthropy ana casa it's the casa behavioral health services organization destroy more clearly throughout all of Lake County welcome thanks for joining us Vicki thank you so much for having me yes I work with the Casa behavioral health services so we have been providing behavioral health predominantly substance abuse services and now mental health and also some social services throughout nine sites in Lake County we provide a continuum of care that includes education prevention early intervention treatment and recovery and we provide a variety of services that range from individual to proves to Family Services treating 12 and above for direct and of course we have a Family Advocacy Center services in North Chicago which treats families in the community anyone with the child zero to 18 and we also work with DCFS involved families as well through our wraparound services program and in addition to that we have a whole host of other collaborations and diversion projects and as well as after Mary's Co collaborations to look at specific subpopulations that are experiencing co-occurring substance abuse and mental health disorders great thank you and welcome to home working my phone rings but my wife will answer so I apologize for any interruptions let me also remind people and ask them some preliminary questions that I'm sure people have questions who are watching if you do have a question you can leave a question in the Facebook comments and we'll try to answer as many as we can but my first question for both of you is within the community both mental health people dealing with mental health issues and substance abuse issues people who are recovering what do you see is the key issues that folks are facing and some of the key challenges that they're working overcome okay I guess I'll start yeah some of the things that nurko has been seeing not only since our inception but also through my long career here in Lake County is that people are you know faced with a lot of isolation with the coab in nineteen there's an increased symptoms of anxiety we also see that people are you know concern about overusing their medication I mean that was an issue prior to Coby 19 but it's definitely you know I'm going issue right now but the other issue that we're seeing is people are increasing their alcohol and other drug use which also contributes to a lot of relapse so there's a lot of concerns about the isolation with shelter in place and not being able to connect with the normal social support for those in recovery we we are often you know address with what could I do to maintain my recovery and one of the things that nurko has been doing with our advisor is being there you know virtually and think the best sort so those are some of the things that we are seeing Vicky how about with you so I echo all of what was just said as well as we are seeing complications with of course encoded with food housing mortgage assistance employment of course this is leading into additional issues with insurance coverage or changes or a lack thereof and so this is also complicating the access to care and quality care as well as moving everything technologically there are some people that simply don't have access and for individuals in recovery it's extremely important because when they're isolated and they're distancing all of that it is great for covin 19 but it is extremely triggering and so we're very concerned about overdoses use reuse new use and fatalities the other thing for us that we can't see directly over videoconferencing but we know is there and will most likely increase is the impact that it's having on our families families are experiencing trauma abuse domestic violence this can lead again to increase mental health concerns that are untreated and also increase use of substances and in that because it's difference that you mentioned you know it's hard to see you don't have the same ability to connect with the people you're working with what adaptions has the consummate in providing services working with individuals and families during the pandemic so we have been extremely fortunate some people may say not as fortunate because it's essential that security but we have been able to remain open throughout the entire pandemic all of our services have completely converted to telehealth format so we offer both video and phone conferencing because we know again that some people simply just don't have the access our only programs that are not continuing our in-school after-school prevention and other things that our school-based related and we see a major importance as far as converting that telehealth I mean in looking at some Everage numbers we serve about 5,000 5,500 people a year on an average that's about 430 people a month in two months we served 1,000 to in ten people and that's an average of about 600 a month so we know that people need the services and they've been accessing them which is great but we also know that the longer that this keeps going it's going to be harder and harder to engage them and the stigma that's already present is going to increase and it's going to get much worse I want to come back to that but first where I want to get a sense of how some your organization working on adaptive yeah you know I'm glad you asked that because everything that vicki is talking about and I applaud on the Casa for all the work that they're doing is it's on the treatment end of things one of the things that a recovery community organization is focused on is the recovery support services and we are very fortunate here in Lake County to have the only recovery community organization with nurko so that the adaptation that we've been making in our Elko big vicki is we are using the zoom platform to provide all recovery support meetings and what that basically means is individuals that's in recoveries including their family members can zoom in or are something different our recovery meeting and we have been really really fortunate because we have collaborated with the restorative justice with the Lake County Probation to provide that opportunities for vets and me we have partnered with our organization in Highland Park and in order to address that particular community - with virtual recovery support and that's been a big adaptation for us in addition to that our congressman we offer telephonic counseling with myself although we have a very small team right now I have a host of advisors that's been really on target with helping to get these things done so zoom platform telephonic one-on-one counseling with myself or in recovery support I'm very fortunate to be a person in long-term recovery myself for the past 27 years so I'm able to offer those services to the community fantastic and they kept coming back to you you mentioned in the past two months you've seen more than a 50% increase in demand for your services and you know with more people at home across the nation people are talking about the increase in domestic violence child abuse other things like that how can we best work to mediate alleviate addressed and help people in such situations so again just for us you know especially with our wraparound program that works with DCFS involved families we are conducting you know our telehealth visits but it's not the same as putting your eyes on a home on a family on a child and you may also have new families now they're experiencing you stressors I can say personally e-learning is one of the largest stressors ever when you have a young child and so that especially in homes that have multiple children may be smaller living space those are all exacerbating circumstances and so it's really important to support these families provide them with education about relationships and communication and you know attachment with their kids working with their kids and understanding expectations but also validating the fact that they are stressed and they're scared because they're losing jobs they're losing insurance some of them are losing snap and other benefits they don't know how they're going to feed their kids forget eLearning for the time being and so it's really important to not wait for them but to really check in on them I know not everybody has that ability but I know that's what we're doing here you know course that's part of our service delivery and we offer still in Spanish and English our parent education groups to support them and give them a place to you know talk to each other work with each other again via zoom but it's also really important to inform them of the services so not just us and not just Norco but 2-1-1 and everything else because domestic violence is on a rise child abuse it is on a rise and the more difficult piece about child abuse is always neglect it's harder to spot it's harder to and now with decreased food decreased employment I think there's going to be a rise on that when everybody comes back together so there will be a domino when all of this is over in fact let me ask Steve you put up on the screen the contact and then I'll remind people well that's up if we can put that up that if you do have a question please put it in the comments we'll come back and answer that but if you want to contact either of our organizations today nurko northern illinois recovery community organization dr. Mary Robertson or mikasa behavioral health services today we're joined by Vicky hello but here's the number and website and thank you dr. Roberson let me turn back to you because you know we're all this together everyone's being affected by the pandemic and you know as we mentioned it's stress on everybody but for some people who are dealing with stress or depression or mental health issues or trying to recover and hold things together hard in normal times it's particularly hard now what can friends and family do to support someone who's on the path of recovery but experienced experiencing the additional stress or obstacles from the pandemic congressman that's a very good question because that's some of the things that come up on our our recovery support meeting is my family is really you know watching me is super hard these days they think that I'm going to return to substitute so one of the things that we tell family members the things that they can do as well as friends it's to validate the concerns of the person that's in recovery and the other thing that we tell people to do is to encourage those and recoveries to stay connected to their recovery support system as you know with the stay in place all the 12-step meetings all other types of recovery multiple pathways have been closed down so that's always been an avenue for people to have that interaction so now they're sheltered in place don't have that availability having to do things on you know virtual platforms and as Becky says some people are not that adept at it or don't have the SS so we tell families and friends to always just encourage them to stay connected to their recovery support and then also if there is a concern about relapse to have them to talk through that you reach out to either their counselor their sponsor or their mentor so that they don't actually turn to act abusive substances we also encourage people to recognize that cravings and urges are going to come up especially during this stressful time and just because a person have a craving or urge to use a substance doesn't necessarily mean that they have to pick it up we always tell people if you don't pick it up it won't get in so we encourage families and friends to have that language to have that you know upfront conversation with those in recovery great thank you you know it reminds me when I sign off on some of these chats whether it's on Facebook or zoom or other platforms some of our emails that we send out now I'll say stay home stay safe but I often say sit stay strong yeah no it's it's it's a easy thing to say but for a lot of people the idea of staying strong kind of conveys I have to do this by myself I have to I have to get through this after power through this and especially I know this from personal experience people who are dealing with mental health challenges are reluctant to reach out and ask for that help and sometimes the idea the strength comes from is like saying hey I just need to talk to someone or I need some assistance and that getting over that hump and getting the next day and through the week and through this crisis can as for both of you touch on on how we can help people feel confident and comfortable reaching out to your organizations or friends family whatever dr. dobersen yeah again one of the things that an Urkel is very very pleased to be is the part of a national advocacy organization called faces and voices so recovery so with that is putting exactly that a face and a voice to recovery and that allows people to see people like myself or people like maybe someone in your family might be in recovery we have to bust that stigma because a lot of times we don't want to admit you know that that the person is in recovery so being able to you know let a person know that hey I've seen those same struggles or I have a recovery advocate or recovery coach that is available for you to kind of talk through these things it's important again to reduce the stigma we call promoting recovery versus reducing stigma because stigmas always bring to mind that there's something bad about it you know so we talk about when we're nurko and our national advocacy organization faces and voices of recovery is to promote that recovery does work and by promoting that recovery does work by showing a face like myself or face like another individual who is in long-term recovery it allows people that come forward and talk about those struggles hey I'm having a Earths to use well you really don't have to because you know one of the things that we keep saying is again recovery as possible and that treatment treatment does work and recovery as possible and we have those services for individuals and families thank you maybe you know from your experiences I want to share so I again echo everything that dr. Roberson is saying and just a quick plug I also have to say that thankfully two collaborations such as neuro and other things we are able to spur their support our clients and our individuals and our families because without that collaboration it's it's not possible especially with the increased amount of need but yeah stigma has a very negative connotation it doesn't mean we don't use it here but we are always thinking about it one way that we tried to address that was by creating what we call our hugs line handling uncertainty with guidance and support it's very similar to you know call for calm and things of that nature and our intent was not to duplicate services or try to gain anything it is our free bilingual emotional help recovery support line because we know that people are concerned about labeling themselves and putting themselves in a box do I have a substance problem do I have a mental health concern so we put this out to the community saying it's free you don't have to be labeled you don't have to know if you fit a box or not you might just need to talk to somebody or maybe you just need to know where our food pantry is the idea is just to get them on the phone talking to someone Spanish or English they call and they speak with our counselors obviously during her business hours not crisis line and more often than not we're able to connect them internally to some of her services that they didn't know that they needed and it's been a positive for them sometimes they don't need something with us and that's okay too and we will refer them to the appropriate source and so we have really tried to push that especially important for people who are losing their insurance benefits and coverage and also with the undocumented community you know they face their own challenges there's you know political fear they're afraid to go out they're already not receiving benefits aside from stimulus and other things they have higher rates of being affected by Kovan so what does that mean and they're not always thinking about their substance abuse or mental health needs so that was a way for us to try to encourage that participation and involvement and again like dr. Roberson said just letting them know we're here it works we're still going to be here we're not going to turn you away so please call us absolutely I'm just touched real quickly talking about undocumented I know that we have a testing site in a key unit a some things around the county around the state but there's a drive through testing site more Kegan in there they had been asking immigration status questions originally we actually required with FEMA but why that was happening what was going on and I'm pleased to say they are no longer asking that question they never should have asked been asking that question in the first place it's important for everybody to get get tested and I think that's critical the other thing I'll say just is I'm listening I'm thinking and you see the video the uplifting videos someone who's recovered from Kovac walking out of the hospital everybody cheering them and and there's no stigma to having gotten sick but their celebration of having worked and fought and in some of these cases lifers yeah to defeat the virus and leave and what I'd like to imagine we can do is celebrate the people who are working on recovering the exact same way ensure their recovery without this thing but that's really I think what we need to strive for because there should be no stigma mental health addiction it is a disease as I said before like asthma diabetes cancer we want you to win and that's what I think the idea of reaching out and reaching for help but thank you also mentioned this pandemic in particular is hitting our poor communities our minority communities harder in many different ways it's not just a matter of as the economy shut down people losing their jobs you know people who are struggling financially before this crisis living in tight quarters may not have access to the same broadband as we have here as we're talking and and we've seen the numbers the fact that Hispanic community is is more likely to get infected with code we just number of reasons partly because they're out having to work the african-american community so we're seeing that across the board and so my questions again for both of you are there things that your organization's are doing to try to help reach these communities in particular and then personally are there ideas or thoughts you have that ways we can help uplift these communities as well know they can start with you okay so again we had our hugs line we tried to push that pretty strong we went through out you know Waukegan North Chicago that area put up fliers in places that are still open grocery stores and any workplaces that would let us come and hang something up less of those in the grocery source but also religious entities also just talking with our participating providers in Lake County who have been great using social media that doesn't reach everybody all the time but it is one way and just getting that message out and we do a lot of work with those particular populations in our Family Advocacy Center and our staff overall has been great and committed to all of our individuals and families but there in particular they're really kind of going above and beyond sometimes I know a recent story we had is that people really were in need of food they were undocumented didn't know where to get it how to get it they were fearful we had a staff that basically had a car Caravan and drove them around and said I'm with mikasa I represent them they need X Y Z amount of food and she was able to get I think seven or eight families on that particular day and that's now kind of become a regular so really just trying to get as many touch points as we can with those populations Mary yeah thank you one of the things that Newark o when we founded it was we wanted to make sure that we had a very diverse staff of advisors and board members and right now we covered the spectrum from african-americans and Latinos to Europeans and I'm very excited about that and one of the things that we have been doing is having that robust conversation about the racial divide and the health disparity that's been you know highlighted in our communities and by having a robust discussion not only with the advisors and the board but also the individuals that seeking our services one story I could tell I have a Latino male that I'm working with you know he's very concerned about Kobe 19 and and he's involved in the trash formerly County program and he's very concerned about his learning ability with the e-learning and and his family and things of that sort so in providing recovery support services for him I often encourage him to talk to other Latino males who in recovery or other individuals and in poor communities that may be able to help him so one of the things that we realize is that the more we are diverse in our efforts the more communities of colors are able to come and seek our services I've been pretty fortunate congressman in that I have been in this social service arena in Lake County for the past 25 years and I'm well-versed you know with the service providers as a matter of fact Mikasa is my parent organization as far as being a retiree from there so being able to connect those resources for the community of colors that's experiencing that and lastly I would like to say with the collaboration with the Lake County opiate initiative we've been talking a lot about impacting communities of colors with the way-out program and I am highly involved in that discussion so we are here to be in the room we are here to be at the table so that our voices could be heard for those communities that's being impacted thank you no thank you and we're all in this together and we need to recognize that it's important we've had conversations in fact next week the ways and commit Ways and Means Committee which I'm a members having a hearing there will be our first virtual hearing in this pandemic so it's relatively big news and I'm very pleased that what we chose to make our first topic of a hearing is exactly this the disparate effects it's having on different communities and what we can do to try to support while while the impacts may be different and part of that is things that existed before this pandemic which we have to address as we work in getting through this and we'll work on planning applying resources we need to put them where we need them irrespective of anything else we've got to lift everybody up and we will continue to try to do that so I think that's that's really important and you know speaking as this is going on I know that for many people who have either lost their job they might be furloughed and working fewer hours or if they're working they may be concerned they're going to lose their job all of those things bring with it different types of stress and anxieties and again no matter what situation you and you feel that but if you are dealing with a mental health issue or addiction issue it can be exacerbated what kind of things can we do to help people with those issues what what are you hearing from your people you're working with dr. Robertson yes well the main thing that I'm hearing is I am so glad that you guys are still there that's the main thing that I'm hearing is you know that people are really happy that the services are still being provided they may not be better at providing an inpatient in person but they are still so very very grateful for the services that's being provided will continue to help with virtual platforms will continue to help with individuals on on the phone and when things kind of let up we begin to see individuals according to the plan for that for the state so that's it thank you let me take you to different direction because you mentioned this before you know people who are doing home school now remote learning you know folks who uh trying to do their own job look for job cook dinner all those things and then teach math that maybe they don't remember from in my case it would be a long long time ago teaching teaching science ER or new subjects I get things that cause stress but also stress within the family what do we need to know about that and again like what might we be able to do to help in these situations um I think again you know a lot of our individuals and families have said something similar to doctor over said that they're just grateful that we are still here for them I think providing resources is an excellent thing to do but I think people are also that inundated with school resources and health tips and this and that really the primary way to communicate right now is electronic communication or via the phone and so I think going back to something a little bit more basic which I think it's harder for higher-ups and policymakers always understand is that validation and and listening and understanding that there's a human being on the other end sometimes is more supportive or helps them build a natural support there's that old saying it takes a village some people don't have the village some people's entire family represents a village that they need to raise and they don't have those supports or because of Kovac they don't have the supports so again I think really just listening and processing and going through that instead I'm always just throwing a bunch of call here do this do that it's very overwhelming for people to have to reach out and make all these connections so on our end case management and advocacy is extremely important contacting these individuals letting them know what's out there for them what's available and I will just have to say a small plug for two on one its new it's fresh but for anything that you can't do it's there it's in a hundred and fifty plus languages refer your people call for your people people can call all day all night you know some people don't want to call an emergency situation or they really just don't know how to help their kids through e-learning and it might not be just about math it might be a larger issue and there are many other resources but 2-1-1 just happens to be in top of my head so people don't have to think about well which one do I need to call they will do the hard work for you yeah and let me share an addition to two one one you'll see on the screen there's a number of resources you can text either Tok Tok lar hav lar two five five to zero to zero to get support from a counselor in your local area Lake County Health Department has a crisis line eight four seven three seven seven eight zero eight eight the Illinois domestic violence help point is 877 to MDB eight seven seven eight six three six three three eight say a safe place here in our he's also offering an emergency hotline their numbers 1-800-621-3362 64 and finding the national suicide hotline one eight hundred two seven three eight two five five and that reminds me one of the things that was in the heroes act is effort to create a three digit national suicide hotline nine eight eight and I'm hopeful that that's something we can push through so thank you for sharing that and as we begin to wrap up let me again turn to my panelists Vicki I tell you and dr. Mary Roberson thank you so much for being part here anything last comments you want to share making us I'll start with you and anything people need to know um I think just kind of a closing reminder is again what everybody's been saying is that we are in this together so if you're noticing something about yourself or your family or your friends or other people that you haven't seen or anything over zoom or whatever other video communication that you're having now is the time to be open and hopefully honest about it and just support one another in any way shape or form again especially for us you know those in the recovery community those our most fragile are undocumented individuals things of that nature so just be there for one another and we are here call us thank you dr. Roberson so again eppley what Vicki said we are here particularly the recovery community we are pretty fortunate here in Lake County there is a robust recovery community and nurko has their finger on the pulse of that so please feel free to contact us we are here I mean it may sound cliche us all the time but we are in this together and one of the things that we know in the recovery community is that there's therapeutic value and one person assist in the other so we encourage you to do not let eagle easing God out stand in the way of you contacting someone to help you in your recovery thank you I like that thank you guys and again thank you for joining us this has been a wonderful opportunity to talk about an issue that's important to our community I've been very fortunate to over the course of this to be able to have a number of these conversations two weeks ago we had my colleague Loren Underwood a representative of the 14th district and then most recently we did something with representations from the Latino Hispanic communities I hope we can continue these conversations as has been said multiple times we're in this together we are one community we are stronger when we are together I think when I say be strong it means be strong together and help each other reach out and look after after each other I hope we can get to that point where we are clapping and celebrating to people in recovery who are stepping forward standing strong and I hope people who are struggling know that they're not alone we're here for you whether it's Ana Casa or Newark oh thanks for what you guys are doing day in and day out and again to everybody wherever you are wishing you good health a very nice holiday weekend in this holiday weekend let's keep in mind all those who made the ultimate sacrifice and defense of our nation on this Memorial Day and all those who are in uniform here in the I states and around the world serving us many of them far places far away on ship or on bases protecting us but at this time many people in uniform who are working within our communities helping us to deal with this crisis we like denigrated to call them and to all of the heroes who are fighting at this time our health care workers people in nursing homes people who are keeping our stores stocked our police firefighters everyone in this is a hero and it just reinforces re emphasizes the fact that we are one community one nation and we will get through this together so thanks to everyone and thanks to my guests have a wonderful weekend we'll talk to you soon

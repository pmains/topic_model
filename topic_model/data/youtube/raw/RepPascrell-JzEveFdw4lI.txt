rise today with the sad news that former congressman Robert rogue passed away today at the age of 90 a native of Passaic County New Jersey Bob served in the Army during the Second World War he was elected to represent the eighth District in 1969 some of our longer tenured colleagues will remember Bob for his noted ability to reach across the aisle during his time of Congress he rose to the chairmanship of the Committee on Science Space and Technology he also chaired the committee on public works in transportation from 91 until his retirement in 93 a true public servant he wasn't in it for power when he became chairman of Public Works he lasted only one term in part because he exhausted himself riding the greatest highway bill in history the country however that highway bill through it he achieved changes the transportation policy to focus on connecting different modes his favorite term was intermodal transportation redefining how we invest in our infrastructure with this emphasis on safety and planning it's ironic that today this day we're going to vote on a transportation bill the day he went to his maker bob is truly a legend in our area he left big shoes to fill for all of us successors in Congress myself included the building i'm in in paterson new jersey was named after in the robert a row federal building a fitting tribute to a great america my family loved him we offer condolences to his entire family and all 35 nieces and nephews thank you back

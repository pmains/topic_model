well god bless Texas you know brochures started out by throwing out Oppo research and mentioning my time at Harvard and I gotta tell you my dad referred to my time at Harvard his missionary work but you know yesterday John and Roger and I we were all in Washington DC so it is great to be back in America and what a great day of celebration this is a day of celebrating the incredible perseverance of Texas I remember just seven months ago when this community was hit by devastating floods I was here the day after the floods I remember standing right there and looking out at what used to be a bridge that was completely swept away as if by the hand to God I remember saying all the families that suffered loss but I got to tell you one of the incredible things one of the real blessings of representing the state of Texas is that you get to see Texans on the other side of disaster you get to see Texans on the other side of terrible tragedies and what is consistent over and over and over again whether it's hurricane Harvey or the flooding here is that in times of trouble Texans come together the day after the flooding I remember sin men and women just with your sleeves up rolled up starting to clean up I remember seeing the girls basketball team out here just help and clean up the mess that is the character and true grit of the people of Texas that's the character and true grit of the people of Llano County and Burnett County now after the flooding it was announced that we were going to rebuild the bridge and people were laying out projections that it was going to take a year to rebuild the bridge where anyone making those projections doesn't know a whole lot about Texas because this bridge was started and completed in just seven months RM 2900 I gotta say we got to do something about that name I'm gonna suggest a new name for the bridge which is the perseverance bridge because when the entire bridge had been washed away the people of Texas knew we would rebuild that a momentary challenge can't hold the people of Texas down and this is a celebration of that spirit that spirit that ties us together that fighting indomitable spirit that makes us Texas and I am proud to stand with the men and women of the hill country celebrating the perseverance of this community as we move forward together [Applause]

hi I'm Ben Sasse Republican nominee for US Senate in Nebraska the events in Gaza over the last few weeks are horrifying the pictures coming out on a nightly basis are obviously tragic and the loss of human life pains Nebraskans but listening to our people it is also obvious that our folks are aching at the moral absurdity of how the national media repeatedly covers the story most news outlets report on this terrible battle between Israel and Hamas as though there is some sort of moral equivalency between the two when there is simply no comparison Israel is a free people that believes in the rule of law a firm's religious liberty protects the rights of minorities and obviously has not just a right to exist but a moral obligation to defend her people Hamas on the other hand is a bloodthirsty terrorist organization bent on the total annihilation of Israel this is the truth and it is too rarely stated in a full-throated way the documents that explain why Hamas exists make it clear again and again and again that its organizational purpose is about ending Israel's existence Israel is committed to democracy and freedom Hamas uses women and children as human shields they're cowards but they're also sadly very adept at getting the European and American media to pretend that the civilian deaths in Gaza are somehow because of Israel when in fact almost all of the civilian deaths are the direct result of Hamas intentionally locating its missile launch sites behind innocent human shields in hospitals and in schools think about that there's something else happening here that has not been covered enough but should be deeply troubling to all freedom-loving and all anti-terrorist Americans and it is this our administration in refusing to be unequivocally pro-israel in this fight between freedom and tear tourism has delivered the terrace one of their largest victories in the seven decade history of Israel the FAA decided to prohibit US airlines from landing in israel after the terrorists were able to cause a delay in service at the Tel Aviv Airport here's why that's so scary as anyone who has ever been to Israel knows that Airport is Israel single main link to the outside world people and goods typically cannot get into or out of Israel over the land because of the perennial violence hence if Hamas can shut that Airport down then it's possible for them to begin to believe that they could isolate and ultimately starve Israel this will recruit more jihadist across the region into their fight this cannot be allowed to continue the people in our state understand what our leadership in Washington too rarely does and it's this the short-term peace agreements brokered by the often morally in different international community never last and that's for one simple reason Hamas always breaks them every time Hamas attacks Israel they are making a calculated gamble that the international community will never really let Israel do what it takes to destroy the terrorist organization and to defend itself and so Hamas plays out the same cycle attack Israel then wait for Israel to counter-attack knowing that the international media will inevitably cry foul and demand that Israel stop the violence as though Israel is somehow the aggressor then Hamas just goes back underground and starts replenishing and plotting new acts of terror America has not had a coherent foreign policy that the world understands for quite some time now worse we have mistreated Israel on multiple occasions acting like we believe that Hamas and Israel somehow bear equal shares of blame for the unrest and the violence in the region this is part of a larger pattern of failing to be a strong leader on the international stage emphatically opposed to jihadi terrorism as a result our enemies decreasingly fear us and our friends decreasing ly trust us it's time for this mad us to end not only does Israel have the right to defend herself her government and its leaders have a moral obligation to do so they must defend their citizens if the international community truly wants to help end the violence in Gaza then they need to get out of the way Israel choosing to destroy the leadership of Hamas is every bit within our rights as your senator I will be a strong voice for our relationship with with Israel and I will work hard to hold every administration whether democrat or republican accountable to backing our closest ally in the Middle East I'm Ben Sasse and thank you for watching

Thank You mr. chairman and thank you for being here I add a couple questions for the for the panel what I want to get a better understanding of the what the barriers are to Iran actually developing a nuclear weapon is it knowledge about how to do it is it a resource issue is the capability issue and in the event that a deal is actually reached is there something that the p5 plus one can do to ensure that we keep those barriers up and you don't see an erosion of those barriers well I guess what I would say is as I as I mentioned there are three elements to a nuclear weapons program you've got the fuel fabrication where there is no great challenge before Iran on that side except just doing it they could produce highly-enriched uranium to weapons-grade with the technology they have now and with the knowledge they have now as far as I know the danger would be detection the danger would be if they chose to do that what reaction would that prompt from Israel are from the united states in terms of a military response on the weaponization research side it's difficult to say but what I've seen from the IAEA what I've sort of seen in news reports leads me to suggest that they have done a lot of weaponization research and perhaps at least on theoretical basis that's they've gone far along on that on the missiles on the question of delivery vehicle which is the third leg I think they're it are what I've seen is a lot spottier it's not clear to me that they have that they're close yet to an ICBM to being able to deliver a missile against against a faraway foe or being able to put a nuclear warhead onto onto even a shorter range missile and again that's one of the reasons I'm concerned that an interim agreement that I'm sorry a comprehensive agreement might allow them to continue that work and to perfect that leg of the program even while it pauses some of the other areas where it's further along but on that question I would say that what what you would really need to get is a update from the Defense Department about exactly where do they stand on that particular leg anything either if you want to add her um the other thing I want to get an understanding of you know it seems to me that one of the greatest dangers when a nation develops becomes a nuclear nation is their ability to transfer that knowledge to non-state actors or two or to non-nuclear nations you know as part of this conversation is there anything that can be done to limit Iran's ability to transfer whatever knowledge they have to non-nuclear States or to non-state actors I think returning to understanding these possible military dimensions to the program is also key to that because it would allow the IAEA to understand who was involved in these programs and what they're doing what they continue to do even today and therefore could provide the basis for both the IAEA and perhaps even other nations to to keep watch to make sure that those contacts are diminished I think there's some good news here that every country that's developed a nuclear weapon with the exception of mr. AQ Khan in Pakistan has had two imperatives on its plate one is to make sure no other country or organization ever gets another nuclear weapon and putting nuclear weapons in the hands of terrorists particularly when should those be exploded there are pretty good tell tales as to where that particular weapon came from is a very dangerous enterprise and so the deterrence goes to the fabricator in some ways and that's something that at least we have some hope there the second thing they always have a problem with when they get a nuclear weapon is what they're going to use it for but we don't want to see that and here I think it's extremely important that the major effort now being made is to prevent them from getting a weapon and if that that should fail through not getting an agreement which i think is a very important part of this then we do face as I said earlier in my testimony the question of whether we have a wart or an Iranian nuclear weapon I think that those two outcomes with the failure of a negotiated effort or the failure of a combination of sanctions a negotiated effort are things we ought to keep crystal clear in our mind if I could just add to that congressman I would say that i think i would be more concerned than ambassador Pickering on this score because we have seen Iran share technology with its non-state proxies like Hezbollah on the missile front in a way that has really destabilized the region most of the technology that Hezbollah has that it has actually deployed in the field in combat as far as i know it's obtained from iran based on earlier iranian advances and i think it's actually more common than ambassador Pickering suggested that nuclear States do end up sharing nuclear technology with others thank you Thank You mr. Chairman I yield back

which mrs. Wagner mr. chairman I'd like to thank you very much and the ranking member for including HR 1632 the Southeast Asia strategy act in today's markup I'd also like to thank congressman Castro with whom I founded and co-chair the asean caucus for working with me on this legislation and for his great support of us asean relations this bill will deepen us engagement with our Southeast Asian partners by requiring the Secretary of State in consultation with other agencies as appropriate to develop and communicate a coherent regional strategy that addresses all aspects of the relationship from trade and humanitarian goals to diplomatic and security arrangements ASEAN member states are vital to the prosperity of the United States economy generating hundreds of thousands of American jobs and investing more in our economy than China and India combined in 2015 the United States and ASEAN elevated the relationship into a strategic partnership to enhance cooperation across the economic political security and people-to-people pillars of this relationship Southeast Asian countries seek assurance that the United States is a reliable partner as they try to maintain economic independence from China and defend their territorial claims in the South China Sea while ASEAN countries have expressed support for the Trump administration's free and open Indo Pacific strategy which promotes cooperation with India Japan and Australia to contain China some worry that the focus on the peripheral waters of Asia will leave Southeast Asian states to fend off China without substantial support the u.s. withdrawal from the trans-pacific partnership further stoat concerns that the United States is no longer as committed to enhancing our trade relation I've had many opportunities to meet with ASEAN officials and foreign ministers one message that I hear repeatedly is that the United States must demonstrate strength and leadership in the region Congress should listen closely to our partners who are demanding stronger leadership and not just because China would be sure to fill any vacuum in power ASEAN is clearly a powerhouse and a critical region to engage in in and of itself the u.s. should be proactively crafting and implementing in Southeast Asia strategy this bill would require the administration to do just that I thank the chairman for his attention to u.s. engagement in the region and I urge my colleagues to support HR 1632 the Southeast Asia strategy Act I thank you and I yield back mr. chairman

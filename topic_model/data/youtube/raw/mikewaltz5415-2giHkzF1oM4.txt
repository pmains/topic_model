florida congressman michael waltz is a member of the house armed services committee and former green beret commander and he joins us now congressman if true what do nato and the u.s need to do in response well this is part of the russian doctrine and it's certainly part of putin's doctrine to escalate to weapons of mass destruction it would not surprise me if this is true and particularly because the russian general that just took over command of operations in ukraine was also the general in charge in syria where both the syrians and russians repeatedly use chemical weapons will remember president trump infamously or famously whichever you want to use sending cruise missiles in to take those capabilities out uh president biden should have been setting red lines uh from the beginning with the use of weapons of mass destruction i believe that red line should have been that would be the line for nato to become directly involved we cannot allow chemical weapons or god forbid tactical nuclear weapons uh to be the next wrong and escalation ladder that we allow putin to go to yeah congressman switching to another issue here a big one in this country a former westchester county executive says the biden administration has resumed its secret migrant flights into his community take a listen to this now the flights have resumed and they're deplaning right now so this is going to continue they're importing people from other countries flying them into the interior and just dispersing them and then turning them into voters like new york city where they will be allowed to vote with 30-day residency so the big question is what does it mean for these communities and if this is happening now what what is it going to look like when title 42 is revoked in may let's just put these numbers in perspective uh carly we we're approaching four million refugees flowing out of ukraine well in the united states we're on on track to have two million per year flow into the united states so the administration doesn't have any choice but to try to disperse them in secret uh all over the country and that's why so many of us in congress are pounding the table saying this isn't a border problem this is a national crisis uh and uh what does this mean for our social services what does this mean uh uh for our communities having to absorb this many people this is just absolutely completely unacceptable that the body administration is not only allowing this to happen is facilitating it to happen and i'll tell you what when we take uh over the house in god help us nine months uh this is gonna stop finally congressman you just released a new kids book children's book called dawn of the brave and proceeds from the sale gonna benefit ukrainian refugees what can you tell us about the book well it's one of a series it's a subscription actually so the kids get one per month my book uh is the ninth in the series and it is about teamwork it's about coming together to defend your country serve a cause higher than yourself uh and uh and defend freedom island against the invading pirate wolves uh uh we're just so excited about it you know we need to take our kids education back with what we've seen in virginia with governor younkin what we're seeing with disney and florida covet exposed the garbage that's being taught to our kids well what are we going to do about it how are we going to get good conservative content into our kids and this series this subscription teaches faith teaches family teaches traditional values and again in the case of my book dawn of the brave teaches teamwork and service you can only get it on bravebooks.com you cannot get it on amazon and as you said fifteen dollars of every subscriptions go into samaritan's first

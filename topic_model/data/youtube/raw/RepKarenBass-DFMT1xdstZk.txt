and economists joining me right now is Democratic congresswoman Karen bass of California and Phil rocker is Whitehouse bureau chief at the Washington Post and MSNBC political analyst first a news Phil thank you for joining us tonight you guys know what's going on he went Ashley and the rest have been sniffing out trouble for a long time now whose how many more heads it seems like Trump's openly put a calling in hunting season he said on the driveway a couple days ago yeah I'm almost where I want to get in other words more heads to go yeah so Chris I was just talking to a few senior White House officials this afternoon about this and there's a feeling that there will definitely be more departures and changes to come in part because the president is more than a year into this job he has a very clear sense of who he thinks is doing a good job in the cabinet and the senior staff who's doing a bad job who he gets along with who he doesn't get along with and one official said look think of it as a thinning out of the inner circle he's gonna try to rely on people that he has good relationships with a good rapport who he feels like get him and understand him and so that's why you're seeing a move like replacing Rex Tillerson with Mike Pompeo at the State Department someone the president has a real comfort level with you know I'm just thinking back to our best presence I mean the ones that succeeded politically you can argue left right all night but Roosevelt had Harry Hopkins Reagan had Jim Baker they relied on certain people and Mike Deaver they relied on certain people all the time because they need a constantly area that somebody says well wait a min you didn't think of this mr. president or you don't know what this is gonna lead to or the consequence here we haven't considered you need somebody to second-guess you're not challenged you all the time but be a bigger brain for you does Trump think his brain his well-advertised IQ it's enough to answer all the big questions make all the big decisions without help does nobody thinks he can do I think he does he feels like he knows how to do this job now and in those first few months he was learning he was managed by people like Madison Tillerson and and John Kelly who's now the chief of staff the sort of generals around him and he now feels like look he can make these decisions on his own and I think he's also going to look to get rid of people who are creating distractions that create bad headlines and bad political optics for him and the first place to look would be the VA the Veterans Affairs Department where secretary Shulkin he seems to be under a lot of a lot of heat right now and may be out soon you know I just think of all the presence I admired and Reagan I do in certain ways but like Kennedy I really admired he had like Ted Sorensen around he got intellectual blood-bank people need people I don't would you how you operate but I think Congress needs somebody to check some what do you think of that idea is that a good idea what am I gonna write in select meetings at a smart move or not or who you know this guy doesn't think he needs advice from anybody well but the problem is is that if you add to that the fact that he doesn't read he doesn't want to have be thick briefing memos he doesn't want information he comes into the job with very little knowledge and so he has experts around him like Madison McMaster and he doesn't want to listen to them so who is he going to have at his side basically his friends his donors people that were in the construction his kids it is like the Romanovs I've said a million times anyway Tillerson and Cohn now doing a growing list of top-level aides staffers and cabinet members who had resigned or been fired in what amounts to a mass exodus from this administration which is only 14 months I look at that list according to an analysis by a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution Trump's first-year turnover rate was 34 percent in 2017 that's higher than all recent presidencies and more than double the Reagan there the record during the Reagan administration there in his first year so it's not an ideological problem here it's just a problem right what are the people when you get your head rolled by tweet you know fill and you're in Africa and the only thing that stops you from being fired while you're there according to post today is that there's a John Kelly said give the guy a break don't lop his head off when he's in foreign territory and but warned him I'm gonna do when he gets home so three hours after he something in other words Trump's inclination was to fire the guy while he's overseas on assignment why would he want to do that well I think it's more that he just decided at that moment he had had it with Tillerson he wanted to fire him he wanted to make the change and once he decided to make that change he wanted to announce it he's someone who likes to break his own news on Twitter and had to be convinced he needed to wait for the circus to finish his mission you know what it looks however it looks but he look I mean he waited he waited until until Tillerson was back in the US for about three hours and then announced it but you deal with him on jetlag get him while he's weak and groggy and then stick it to him about is that we have to think about what this looks like to the rest of the world so already we know what the president said about the entire continent of Africa this is a Secretary of State's first trip to the in felicitous term will be remembered for decades exactly and so to me full attention should have been given to this trip so now what do you think the African heads of state well if I were in Kenya in Nigeria Ethiopia expecting a grand trip by the top foreign foreign minister of the United States the most important country in the world and probably the most important state visit we're having and he gets fired on our watch exactly which says you don't look very you don't consider very much to us but you know what I have ambassadors in my office all the time who come in and say what is going on in the United States well you know when I say I tell them basically that foreign policy is a bipartisan issue you have to come to Congress because you can't really count on the administration I can't tell them what the administration's position is yeah well I don't think the Secretary of State could either and exactly who as congresswoman Karen bass it's great to have you over here and Phil Truckee you guys are doing it you're doing it anyway

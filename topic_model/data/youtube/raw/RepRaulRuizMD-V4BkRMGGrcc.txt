this morning president Trump is tweeting some advice for his colleagues in the Senate if the GOP health care plan falls through here's what the president says if Republican centers are unable to pass what they are working on now they should immediately replace repeal and then replace at a later date joining me now is Democratic congressman Raul Ruiz of California he's also an ER physician thank you for being here good morning it's good to be here so congressman with your hat as a lawmaker but also with your hat as in your physician you're a doctor what would that mean if there were an immediate I feel without a replace you know as you said I'm an emergency medicine physician and when my patients come to the emergency department they are they care about two things they ask one doc am I going to be okay and two am I going to be able to afford this I also know that there are no patients that I've ever treated that are happy that they are uninsured when they see me in the emergency department so what Trump care means both the Senate and the House bill there are 22 or 23 million more people without health insurance it means that those that are 50 years old and older are going to pay astronomical costs for their care and it also means that your coverage is going to have a lot of pores a lot of kinks you're not going to be able to get the emergency care coverage maternity care the mental health care and essential benefits and all these are very concerning because after all there are human people oftentimes during these partisan ideological fights people forget that there are real people behind these discussions and right now these human faces are not smiling okay I don't think that you know I would hope that lawmakers are not forgetting the human faces behind this and you do have Senator Rand Paul who as you know has been very opposed to the Senate GOP legislation who tweeted this morning that he agrees with the President on this strategy you called the Senate GOP health care bill deadly you said that this week so would you prefer it in essence and would you or that they do hold off would you prefer I know you don't want to see a repeal with no replace but would you prefer a repeal with no replace to a repeal with replacing it with the Senate GOP health care bill as it stands now no this is what I prefer and this is what we need to really demand from the Trump administration and the Republicans they need to stop creating uncertainty in the health insurance markets they need to stop right now what I asked you what I asked you is would you prefer what the president is suggesting here a full repeal no I don't I don't I don't prefer that the president repeal the Obamacare I do not prefer that they wait so then later replace it because what they were going to replace it with is going to be more detrimental with so they should not repeal they should mend it and not end it and what I mean by that is that they should stop creating uncertainty stop threatening not to pay the cost-sharing subsidies implementing the health rate medication risk pools or programs that they have stopped putting in place which will decrease premiums and stabilize the market let me get your take on your party overall before we go as you know your party has not been on a roll when it comes to winning elections lost presidency Democrats lost the four special elections recently Bernie Sanders came out earlier this month and said it's the Democratic Party that lost this election not the Donald Trump wanted so he says the Democratic Party lost it do you think your party needs a reboot needs a different strategy heading into the midterms absolutely I think we need a revival we need to really understand and listen to the American people we need to have connection I when I ran I told the local Democrats that I am NOT running for the Democratic Party I am not even running against the Republican Party I'm running for the people in my district and that's what we need to come back to the essence of who we are which is to stand up for the American people and really fight for them and their and their concerns in the workplace there's concerns in the classroom they're concerns at home they're concerns in the physicians offices and this is what we need to stand for because in this debate with healthcare there are Republican patients there are Democratic patients there are Republican and Democratic seniors who are going to lose their their potential nursing home care and that's what we need a fight for congressman thank you very much as you say your words revival is what you think your party needs right now thank you very much

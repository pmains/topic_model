i wanted to let you know that i've reentered the race for congress here in the first district and i intend to participate in the republican primary on august 12th my decision was based upon concern from gop activists and leaders across the first district six weeks or twenty percent of the general election has already passed since the albert league convention so what changed to prompt this decision nothing and that's the point the endorsed candidate failed to live up to his promises to run a full-time aggressive campaign against tim walz and outwork the incumbent defeating an incumbent congressman is never easy it requires a hundred percent of a challenger's time and energy simply stated a part-time candidate cannot defeat a full-time congressman there's an urgency to the hagerdorn campaign because we believe this is the last best chance to defeat liberal obamacare democrats like tim walls and take the steps necessary to restore america's greatness my candidacy offers voters the chance to vote for a republican with the experience the skill the mindset and the commitment to make this race a referendum on tim walls's failed liberal record and offer the voters a clear contrast on the national issues in the end that's the only pathway for us in november i look forward to returning to the campaign trail going 18 hours a day promoting my conservative solutions across southern minnesota and most importantly meeting the people i ask for your support and your vote thank you

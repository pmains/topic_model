thank you mr chairman this will be to all three and i'll start with general general brown general brown um just you all's evaluation from a professional level what you can share with us today in the whole ukraine uh russia uh or let's say putin war on ukraine and the air the air war that's going on there and the perception of a lack of of defense or lack of a force coming from ukraine or the support of nato or us people criticized why don't we do this why don't we get more involved uh air cover why don't we do a uh a uh complete uh support of of air retaliation can you speak on that general brown just in generalities i know from detail you can't get into it but if you evaluate the ukraine what russia has done how we've been able to defend why ukraine's not flying the planes they already have but they're asking for more and they want air cover or basically they want no-fly zone yeah i can't speak to exactly why uh the ukraine's uh ukrainians are not uh flying i know they do are doing some flying um but what i will tell you senator is they do have aircraft they're not i mean they're not utilizing all their aircraft that they already have access to is that correct um that that is someone correct but what here's what i will tell you senator um you know air security cannot be uh assumed and one of the things that the ukraines have been able to do based on their air defense capabilities actually threaten uh the russian air air power and so from that aspect it's a combination of not only what you're able to do with airplanes in the air but it's what you're able to do with your air defenses and that's something i think as you you look at i would say the ukrainians have been fairly successful in using the air defenses that's what the missiles are you talking about the missiles missile defense things of that sort some of some of the missile defense some of the capabilities they already had um indigenous into the ukrainian armed forces uh have had some capability and made it more challenging for the russians from an air power perspective i'm just saying i haven't heard any attacks coming from their air from the ukraine air force if you will and the planes they already had i've heard this come mostly from basically air missiles or drones and things of that sort secretary if you had any information you could share on an open in an open meeting like this i don't think i have anything we can share on an open forum we might have some information we could give you in a classified setting we're going to that next general raymond do you have any observation you want to share people people are interested they ask me all the time and i want to let them know that we're supporting every way possible ukraine i think it's clear that the character wars changed as i said my opening statement i think this war shows the value of space being able to provide information and i think one of the things that uh it also showed the value of commercial capabilities uh in commercial space specifically on being able to share intelligence more broadly being able to shape the gray zone operation so it's been really important john raymond this will be for you also uh you know you have one of the smallest uniform service within department of defense and i know you're actively getting the best of the best i would just ask where you stand on the space national guard if that is a way there's a lot of talented people all over this country i know in west virginia national guard they're what they're ready to go how do you how are you looking at that yes sir today we operate with about 800 and not about 839 guardsmen we've been operating with them for 25 years they're really important to us they're limited in states on where they're located they're located in eight states and a new unit that's standing up in guam and so those capabilities that are there and the people that are there are very important to us and we can't do a job with that are they integrated into the space part that you're they are currently they're in the uh air national guard and they support us in the space force like they did when we were when we were in the air force that that has continued and they continue you are actively involved in evaluating their capabilities of where you might have the strongest support absolutely yes sir secretary yeah i just add that those people are important to the space force we want to keep them uh the exact mechanism by which we do that and you know how they're titled and structured i think we're open to discuss the concern the administration had i think was that we would create a lot of overhead costs associated with a new organization uh there were concerns that cbo had i think about establishing a headquarters and so on i don't think that's necessary i think we can find a way to keep those people doing what they're doing they're very valuable part they're a significant fraction of the space force they're about 10 of the force right now so we want to keep them around they're important to us they're valuable uh we just need to find the right mechanism to do it we're very proud of the western national guard and they do an unbelievable job and so much talents coming from different arenas that i think can be very very supportive thank you all for your service thank you

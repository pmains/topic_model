all right last night we showed you a hot mic moment revealing the real dr fauci totally incorrect well we look forward to reviewing it senator marshall dr fauci has answered you to his public information and he's happy to give it to you if you were to ask senator moran jesus christ so did fauci apologize for insulting a sitting member of congress well of course not instead he just doubled down he was implying that maybe i was making investments sort of like uh ahead of the game here and he made the statement that we can't get your financial statement it was stunning to me that a united states senator doesn't realize that my financial statement is public knowledge it was just like where where have you been joining me now is the lawmaker fauci insulted kansas senator roger marshall who is also an md senator uh you were in fact on to something is that why you believe that he reacted the way he did are fauci's financial disclosures complete in your mind well lori lord good evening you know dr fauci does protest too much right why is he so defensive about all this he's lied to the american public again he's lied to congress again we cannot access his records my office cannot still still cannot get them you can't get them nobody can get them yet the nih uh somehow was hiding them from us so he lied to the american public but i just have to appreciate you talking about hillary clinton and deplorables don't you feel like a deplorable when dr fauci talks down to you when he tells you look if you don't want to wear a mask you're a deplorable if you don't want a vaccine you're a deplorable if you don't agree with me you're a deplorable that's dr fauci we caught him in another lie yesterday so it's implicit in his comments that oh the science dictates that we do x and then months or maybe even a year later we find that the science supposed science is collapsing on itself as it is with cloth masks and vaccines and transmission when he appears on capitol hill as he did this week again do you sense an arrogant man do you sense a humble man what's your just reaction to his overall appearance yeah i think overbearing uh very narcissistic very full of himself that truly he believes that he is the science and that nobody can disagree with him i feel so bad for dr walinski going on making her rule saying you can go back to work after five days and then dr fauci hops on tv and says oh but you need a test first when i suggested yesterday that look 59 of americans don't trust you dr fauci every time you go on television a person that's declined the vaccine so far just digs their heels even more that he's hurting the team he was having no part of that and instead what's the first thing he does he goes back and jumps on tv he's so in love with this tv camera that he can't do what's best for the health of this nation well it was amazing because yesterday was supposed to be biden's big push for voting rights and yet fouchy stepped all over it so he stepped on biden and kind of messed up biden's whole mojo if you can call mojo with what he said yesterday but he he just always has to be the center of attention but unsurprisingly the media circled the wagon senator around fauci and again went on to attack you watch dr marshall knows better they all know better the gop chooses to demonize and stigmatize the top or essentially the country's top public health official it is designed to deceive and it does push us to a more dangerous place where hard partisans stop trusting our public officials so senator it's your fault that the american people increasingly do not trust the public health apparatus with what we've learned about the vaccines and omicron and so forth you know of course it has to be anybody's fault but dr fauci several times we asked uh the folks on the panel whose responsibility is this that 800 000 americans have died more people died in america in 2021 than 2020 despite having the vaccine vaccine mandates mass mandates lots of testing it's not working but very limited therapeutics whose responsibility is this but i will say thank you to all the press who did come to our rescue and point out the lies that dr fauci told again yesterday he lied about being able to get his records he lied again about viral gain of function thanks to project veritas we were able to point out one more time when the department of defense had declined a research study on viral gain of function and but dr fauci approved it so we we got him on the run again well it would be nice if he was as vigorous in his criticism toward the communist party of china as he is toward you but he always seems to leap to china's defense senator it's good to see you tonight thank you

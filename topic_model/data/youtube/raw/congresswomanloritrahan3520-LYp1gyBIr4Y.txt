congresswoman laurie trahan and i want to thank you for tuning in to our black history month facebook live discussion uh i'm thrilled to take some time to reflect on the importance of celebrating not only black history but also black joy and i couldn't think of a better guest to have that conversation with than the one and only thaddeus miles he's the founder of black joy of the black joy project and he's the director of community services at mass housing uh so often in our schools students are taught black history through only one lens uh portraying the hardships uh the hate and the violence that generations of black americans have had to persevere through and overcome to reach where we are as a nation today and while it's absolutely essential we know the painful parts of america's history especially the horrific treatment of black americans what's often overlooked is what thaddeus and so many others in our community have eloquently referred to as black joy the positivity camaraderie and achievements that have empowered so many across our commonwealth and our country to demand a more just and a more equitable america starting long before the civil rights movement and continuing on today through the black lives matter movement you know this past summer when george floyd was brutally killed at the hands of law enforcement many americans were forced to confront the truth that racism and inequality exists in our country you know no longer could anyone avert their own eyes to what black and brown americans have known all too well that discrimination and injustice are rooted in our communities and it's long past time for all americans to catch up and do our part to bring about a more perfect union earlier this week my colleagues and i reintroduced the george floyd justice and policing act which aims to overhaul policing and communities across the country by ending uh police brutality required increase in transparency and making sure that officers are not only held accountable accountable for their own conduct but also empowered to hold their colleagues to account for their actions as well uh this bill is historic and necessary but it's not the singular solution to injustice in our country not even close passing the bill is a critical step in the right direction but our agenda goes far beyond law enforcement you know we've got to work to ensure every american has access to the coven vaccine for starters but good schools clean air drinking clean air and drinking water uh quality health care essential workforce training affordable housing and an inclusive economy and dignified criminal justice system but we're working to change the pattern that always seems to end in inaction especially in the halls of congress you know committees in the house are hard at work looking at racial inequality in other areas of light from our education system to the housing market and we must confront structural racism in every facet of our lives and we all must be prepared to listen and to learn and to take these teachings with us to ensure this moment is a catalyst for change you're having president biden and vice president harris in the white house gives us a great opportunity to enact many of the reforms that we hope to see but this is just the beginning of our movement a movement that is focused on justice and this morning focused on joy uh which is why i could not be more excited to be here virtually of course with thatya smiles uh thaddeus is an author an internationally recognized award-winning photographer he is currently the director of community services at mass housing where he is responsible for three impact areas housing stability knowledge and capacity building and strengthening families and communities across our commonwealth for his first 20 years at mass housing thaddeus was responsible for designing and implementing crime prevention strategies affecting multi-family housing developments throughout the commonwealth by creating strategies that directly engage residents in addressing quality of life issues sustainable cities and confront confronting the complexities of social justice issues thaddeus garnered insights and strategies from his international work at harvard law school and community urban planning programs at mit these experience reinforced his steadfast commitment to ensuring that the most underserved in our communities have genuine opportunities for success and achievement as i mentioned earlier thaddeus is also founder of the black joy project and the founder of hoodfit he's also currently the co-chair of my brother's keeper boston and chair of becoming a man in boston he was recently awarded the gk 100 2018 boston's 100 most influential people of color and the visionary award from the timothy smith foundation embracing the legacy by the robert f kennedy action corps the director's community award by the director of the fbi thaddeus is also a veteran of the united states air force and a devoted father and grandfather and i'm so grateful to be able to call him a friend he makes me feel like an underachiever thaddeus i don't know if that's even possible that is an unbelievable bio wow welcome welcome thank you thank you for having me on madam congresswoman it's great to see you and uh and i hope soon where uh you know we'll be able to see each other in person but i know we don't have a ton of time today i want to get right to it and i'm going to kick us off just with a short question uh and that is that is what does black history mean to you yeah i don't know if that's a short question i can talk about that for the hour that we have or 30 minutes that we have but black history first i'd say that black history month moments happen every day but it's invisible to many to me black history validates that our greatness is older than our oppression that our strength is greater than our struggle it proves daily that we belong everywhere and that black excellence black creativity black innovation black resilience black joy that we're talking about is our fist of power yeah oh that's terrific you know as both an artist and an activist how would you characterize the relationship between your art and your activism and you know if you could just speak to how one contributes to the other well well when i think about it i don't separate them right you know it's sort of like we don't really talk as much about intersectionality right of all the different components of an individual and how they overlap and how they influence what we do so but when i think about art art gives people an opportunity to experience the moment of tension that you can continue to explore different outcomes right when you see one of my photos you can talk about it more often art gives me hope and courage art brings the creative lands and gives and gives voice to difficult conversations and i started to think back to the black arts movement back in the 70s uh with the sounds of nia simone the young gifted and black as well as the poetry of nikki giovanni in the books of james baldwin you know i think about how how the art movement fueled funk music right which led to hip-hop and how photography and documentary documentaries have changed the hearts and souls and minds of many for the good and some for the bad right when we think about what's happening now when we think about the civil rights all of that came through people actually seeing it right it's something about seeing it versus hearing about it that makes a real difference yeah absolutely and you know it does it you don't none of these things in um exist in a in a silo right it's all uh it's all connected and uh it's influenced our music as you just said and you know must you must have been so proud seeing amanda gorman use her uh her poetry and her ability uh to be to convey such an important message on the uh on inauguration day uh with the force and the grace of her words it was just unbelievable yeah i mean i think the good thing for me about it was i was there right i was in washington if you if you remember i know no very few people went but i was in washington and uh you know i did a whole photography series on the three days before the day before the day of and the day after and i saw people weeping and you know it brought tears to my eye at the same time oh it was it was uh so emotional i mean i i brought my oldest son uh and he you know we we cried we laughed we held each other i mean it was just a range of of emotions uh but nothing was more poignant than uh than that poem uh which i the delivery was as powerful as the as the words um so black history month celebrates the cultural artistic and societal contributions of black americans in our country uh it's a time to center awareness on the immense impact of black americans on the arts and sciences technology and across across our uh across all of our society this month we've seen an incredible outpouring on social media celebrating this idea of black joy uh framing these contributions in a more positive light so i wonder if you could just sort of describe what does this mean to you talk a little bit about your project of bringing black joy to our community so before i jump into the project i just want to say what it what it means a little bit differently uh i'll tell you a quick story so in the past i've been on 20 conversations about black history uh last week last saturday i was on with uh engineering school uh with uh uh that talk about black history and to have that conversation it was the first i was just on with 600 kids and it was their first black history month celebration at their high school so to me it was interesting but i showed 11 engineers uh or black engineers that are history making individuals to this prestigious school and nobody on the call the few hundred knew any of them yeah i was like if anybody can tell me five of them i give you a thousand dollars nobody could tell me one and so one was uh the person that helped prevent the handheld computer another one was around apollo apollo 13. another one created the laser surgery to remove cataracts from the from the eyes so you know it's pretty interesting when you start to think about it and so for me black joy my contribution to the collective narrative of the power and influence of black traditions in the world it's a testimony and strength of the strength and resilience of our people most importantly for me it's a love letter to black people to see you in all your glory and your splendor the project itself gives us the opportunity to celebrate black achievements all year long because i think black history should be all year long and it is american history i know people have some some uh some some feelings about that but you know until we can get to that you know where all people know as an example i'm at this prestigious school about engineering and nobody knows any of these black engineers that that's the field that they want to major in yeah i mean but it's also being able to tell those particular stories uh that i just told but it's also about giving voice the you know my black project you know black joy project is to remind us to feed our seed of resilience daily is to create space to experience and explore black joy from bear from various points of entry by angelo said we need joy like we need air and i believe that right and so for me pushing that every day and every moment that i can allows people to be able to breathe and allows us to remember that our resilience it grows through our joy yeah yeah and you know we've we've talked about this before but uh i think by highlighting uh the positivity black joy those moments that you know sometimes we take for granted but it so much exemplifies who we are whether it's with our children whether it's with us our grandparents in our community i mean that is what makes us all relatable to each other that is when you see we have i mean so much more in common than we have indifference and i think that is such a beautiful way to to talk about uh the celebration of diversity in our community is through uh what we you know what we have in common and celebrating the joy the joys of everyday life which i have to tell you i think i think you know facebook and some of our social media channels were you know were in the beginning in the early days like that's people share they should share their easy life moments and now you know so much has happened in our in our discourse and our political discourse that's you know it's just dividing us when really uh what we need to focus on is what uh what binds us what connects us no i i absolutely agree you know i think one of the things i was i was on the panel uh with ayanna presley congresswoman last night we were talking about the black joy and how it also humanizes us right uh to others that may not see us as humans at times and that's how a black boy is 12 gets shot right holding a toy gun uh because a lot of these younger kids that are 12 and 13 black boys are actually seen and perceived to be black men and so being able to like i love showing pictures of my grandson uh my son you know me out there being being silly uh because you know that's what i want people to also to be able to see of me right so there's this thing of you know you know i'm six for 300 pounds and i can be intimidated but the reality is if something's happening i'm going to be the person to step in front of it right for you if you have uh uh the some something dramatic happen in your life i'm going to be the person that you can come to and if you just need to cry and be not saying anything i'm gonna allow you to cry on my shoulder me just not speak right but that's the power of really being able to connect and i don't even really have to know you to allow you to be able to be vulnerable and i'm that guy that's vulnerable but i'm also that guy that you know when i'm watching a movie i cry a lot right you know sad movies oh no and you have you've demonstrated that that spirit uh you know over your whole life i mean it's uh it's pretty incredible um and uh and well so i'm just so thrilled that you know we're having uh this conversation and so bringing it bringing it back uh to this month which we are going to make year long uh uh what policies do you see as uh most essential to ushering in uh you know a more equitable a more inclusive uh society what would you like to see on your watch so i think one thing is so for me i saw the agree with like most people don't know and don't think about it canada also celebrates black history month through february the whole month of february and their theme is the future is now the united kingdom celebrates black history month but they celebrate it in october right so there's some different things and so you know when we think about it the future is today and so there's uh when i started to think about policies and i started to think about crises and i started to think about these pandemics that we're dealing with because we're dealing with like 15 to 20 pandemics in reality that that are compounding and compounding stress and anxiety which in turn turns to trauma which is the result of some of the depression and the other medical stuff that we see happening today but when i think about i think about the housing crisis right when i think about the lack of affordable housing and the policies that keep family there that keeps families there when they are there when it's about moving from that generation to generation which leads me to start thinking about wealth building and i think about in massachusetts right now during the covet the prices of homes or increased by 20 so you know when they started to think about equity and i started to think about home ownership but the banks that still don't make loans based on zip code and based on race even though it's illegal they found different ways to sort of deal with that and you saw a lot of that during the covet relief bill that you're all you know that you're working with when i think about businesses i think about boston having five years 2.1 billion dollars in contracts in the last five years and only nine million dollars of that went to black businesses that's less than a penny right that's point four percent and when i started to think about health care i started to think about the the many under-resourced communities around the country that have life expectancies in the 50s while white communities that are less than two miles away from them from them have life expectancies in the 80s right that's a 30-year difference and it's people think that it's boston but it's all over the country right and there's many ramifications from that and there are many causes and i also think about like what we're currently in when i think about here in massachusetts almost 600 000 whites have received the vaccines in less than 80 000 blacks you know and it's not because they don't want it right so so for me there's housing there's health care there's education there's police reform are the best places to start i don't want to give them police reform because we'll be talking about that for like you know the next two hours and you won't be able to go back and vote on what you need to vote on so uh but those are my critical components you know i i couldn't agree more i often say to folks if you're not down here in washington working on health care and housing i don't know what the heck you came down here for right those are the two critical pieces that really set a family up right there's not much you can do when you're when you can't afford your health care or your life saving uh prescription drugs uh and you know and if you don't have a roof over your head you can't support your loved ones and it just it has this ripple effect of course you know on everything else whether you can get or keep a job you know what your economic opportunity is whether you can put food on your table i mean it is unbelievable to me um that we are as far behind as we are uh you know living in the united states of america on those two critical issues and i think you are going to see a lot of work done this year this moment i mean when we say build back better i mean those are words that are got is now a guiding principle right it's not we're going back to normal right we're not go like we've got this opportunity to wring out these lessons that have been uh you know the sun has shown a light on them all this past year and to to rebuild correctly um so i think it's a it's it's really important um to kind of be reminded that even as we're rolling out this vaccine that we're doing it equitably we're accelerating the hell out of it uh and you know we're making sure that everything that we do is through you know a more equitable and a more just lens yeah because i think for me i didn't really understand some of this until my mom retired and then she went on medicare medicaid i'm not even sure which one it was and she called me crying and said she went to give her medicine and said she had a four thousand dollar donut hole i'm like what the hell is a donut and you know luckily for her she has three privileged kids that do pretty well and we cover that um interesting piece to learn uh for somebody that worked 30 years uh and now needs something that she's got to put up the first you know four thousand dollars before she could even get any reduction and she wasn't making that much right right right um well i know i do they just called the vote i've kind of got my eye on uh on that screen but i do you know you mentioned but well black history month it helps us reflect on how far we've come but it also really puts a spotlight on the immense amount of work uh ahead to address systemic racism racial inequality uh and you said it's you know needn't be a month uh so what advice do you have for people who are looking to sustain the movement for justice what are the best some of the best ways that uh you know folks in our community can help especially as we look uh to continue this movement um you know beyond this beyond this month of celebration yeah so i think the first thing before i even you know i love the first part of your question about how far we've come that's that's challenging for me because i think about today marks nine years since the murder of trevon martin yeah right and so when we think about this is about how far we've come uh i'm challenged around that because i know we've done certain things but i still feel like you know just three months ago four months ago it was it was george floor there was you know beyond the tail it was so on and so forth and it seems that the cameras and the better the camera phones get uh the more the more work that we have to expose but i would say in two lenses i say for black people i would say have compassion for yourself as you move forward in your purpose i mean make sure that you're doing some self-care to take care of yourself mentally physically spiritually because those are important for you to stay in the fight right we need you to stay in the fight and for others as there's a couple of things let's say one would be the move from pity to compassion a lot of people get those mixed up how you're acting you know there's pity there's sympathy there's empathy and then it's compassion and passion compassion means that you've looked at it you've studied it you've engaged in it and now you want to relieve that person's suffering and so you're going to act from a point that's more reasonable and rational and then i would say really focus on this thing of being an anti-racist right to be able to move from the fear zone to the learned zone to the growth zone and people don't know what that is i don't have enough time to explain it but if you look at it you know the fear learn and grow around being an anti-racist educate yourself on a particular movement and dive in right dive in because you know you're compassionate about it don't just dive in because it's a good instagram moment or it's another moment don't just march because you know you want to get something on ig or create your own historical moment to say that you were there you mean work on your own habits and beliefs a lot of times we're looking at everybody else but we don't spend the time looking at that's me you hey me what am i projecting what am i branding take the time to look at that take action in your community right it's not always about you know i we i live in lowell your your office is right here in my building hey it's a it's an amazing opportunity take action in your community volunteer your time right so figure out you know we all have time you are busy i'm busy but we also volunteer a lot right so you know people can't tell me anything when i see you ayanna and others out here volunteering and i know you're back and forth to washington every other day now you can't tell me you don't you can't find the time to do that i think the last thing is really and i always feel it's important organizations need funding to sustain themselves so find something that you care about and if you can donate donate and the reality is is i i sort of think about it and it doesn't matter if it's a dollar or a hundred thousand dollars every dollar counts every penny counts in order for an organization that's doing something that's doing that's creating impact in the community and helping serve people uh and putting people first uh to me deserves an opportunity to be sustained and to continue to grow and that happens through funding yeah that that is so uh important and i think sometimes people hesitate maybe to come off the sidelines because you know maybe they haven't given or they don't consider them they think of like uh philanthropic giving or donating is for other folks they don't realize that like when you're talking grassroots when you're talking movement every bit helps and you know just it pulls you in right whether it's giving a dollar or five dollars or ten dollars or you know just working in your community i mean there is so much happening right now in the world and it can feel daunting always you know realized or always was you sort of taught like just do what you can right to get out and start in the community that you live in and that multiplies and is what we need from it plus it's just so empowering i mean sometimes when you feel daunted you feel as though you don't have the power to impact change but you actually do and so much of it happens right in our community it's where i get so much of my inspiration and frankly my motivation uh uh to come here and and do this work um well you know you didn't you didn't disappoint thaddeus excuse me you always come with some profound words and just some real pragmatic uh next steps for people which is which is a gift um and i i hate to say that that's all the time we have for today i can't thank you enough uh for taking the time out of your incredibly busy schedule uh to take and participate in this important discussion with me uh it means the world to me and i know everyone tuning in i greatly appreciates hearing from you um i also want to thank everyone oh go ahead so before we close i know you have to close out i know you got to vote but i just want to say thank you for the work that you're doing and lol thank you for the work that you're doing in this country thank you for being authentic about everything it is that you do and thank you for keeping that beautiful smile out in front of folks so that they can appreciate the aspects of joy that happens each and every day in each person's life that they continue that you continue to give them the feed that seed of resilience through joy thank you for this opportunity to have a conversation i truly appreciate you and look forward to voting for you in the next election well thank you i wasn't even expecting that wonderful endorsement uh but you know you taught us all a lot just about the simple pleasures and the you know uplifting uh aspects of everyday light and sort of focusing on that joy you know i'm an optimist i think you know we have much better days ahead i think that you know when we're all in this together uh rather than us against them and you know just falling into these divides or these tribes that you know we're just going to be better off and so uh thank you thank you for participating in this discussion thank you for everything that you do uh and i hope to see you in person some point soon it feels incredible to me that we do share a building and i haven't seen you uh in way too long but you take care of yourself and everybody out there please we're not out of this uh we're not out of this pandemic yet i know that there's a light at the end of this tunnel that we are racing toward but i you know i'm a mom so i have to say it keep wearing that mask keep socially distancing washing your hands you know just we've gotten uh we've gotten this far together and um we want to get through this uh so take care thaddeus thanks again and i will see you soon

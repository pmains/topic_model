joining us now Florida congresswoman from house energy and former president Trump's treasury secretary for public affairs Monica Crowley thank you so much for joining us tonight congresswoman what was what is your reaction to Edward's report oh man you know it's just like the state of confusion that we had a few nights ago he's making again false claims trying to pin the blame on Republicans while simultaneously ignoring the fact that on 1975 he called four cuts to Social Security and Medicare and then doubled down in the 90s on the floor of the Senate saying that they should Sunset those programs including veterans benefits now today we know that his his proposal includes cutting Medicare Advantage of which 48 percent of Medicare users they prefer that plan so it's all about deflection for the White House and I I tell you people back home they're not buying this so just like today he's at the University of Tampa he should have been delivering a speech at The Villages but I tell you the folks at The Villages they wouldn't have let him off the hook like the students at University of Tampa so what the Congress are just saying in Monica Crowley let's listen to we've got the sound of then Senator Biden saying everything of what the congressman was just talking about watch this I'm up for reelection this year and I'm going to remind everybody what I did at home which is going to cost me politically I when I argued if we should freeze federal spending I meant social security as well I meant Medicare Medicaid I meant veterans man I met every single solitary thing in the government and I not only tried it once I tried it twice I tried it a third time and I tried it the fourth time somebody has to tell me in here how we're going to do this hard work without dealing with any of those sacred cows I have introduced on four occasions four occasions entire plans to balance budget I tried with Senator Grassley back in the 80s to freeze all government spending including Social Security including everything Paul Ryan was correct when he did the tax code what's the first thing he decided we had to go after Social Security and Medicare now we need to do something about social security Medicare Monica that last sound bite was from 2018 what do you think yeah you know what this is what you get when you have someone who's been in office for a half a century those past positions and statements will always come back to haunt you and look Joe Biden was part of a different Democratic party back then now it's more of a revolutionary Socialist Party and he's he is where all of the energy and activism are on that radical left um look Joe Biden goes where the the political winds will blow him but what we've seen over the last couple of years is that you know it's absolutely necessary his original position was correct you do need to re-examine these programs and um and Shore them up to make sure that we don't have a total collapse of them you know all of these Democrats really Embrace these entitlement programs and they are guaranteed to the American people but not permanently and unless and until we have real reform those programs won't be there for future Generations we've been having this conversation according to Joe Biden for decades now and nothing has been done and if we don't act and act soon to preserve them they're not going to exist at all you know it's I feel like breaking out the Dippity Doo and the Noxzema I mean that's about as long as we've been having these conversations about reforming these entitlement programs I mean but even you know even Bernie Sanders called out Joe Biden on this in 2020 but then the president still continues to rip into Republicans but shamelessly ignores his own track record here congresswoman yeah you know think about this I'm 34 years old and do I really expect that Social Security is going to be there when I am of retirement age no not at the rate that we're going certainly there has to be something Fair it's not fair to for workers who paid into it for all these years and that's unreal and it's so misleading how the Democrats are handling this conversation they're not speaking the truth to the American people as Monica was just pointing out congresswoman that's true 100 and Leadership starts with one owning the problem not pointing fingers and deflecting blame so if there's uh someone looking for leadership on this issue you shouldn't be looking to Joe Biden that much is clear but we look at the 71 percent mandatory spending that our federal budget really is you know 71 is mandatory your Social Security Medicare we're not cutting it but how about we start going after the 20 to 25 percent waste Fraud and Abuse that was within there so we consistently or how about you know we just blew money out the back door for pandemic relief now we've got record like nearly 200 billion in just jobless benefits alone for pandemic relief that was blown out the back door and they have the nerve to say we're going to get more tens of thousands more IRS agents to go after taxpayers they have the nerve to say we're going to raise taxes and the president has a nerve to try to dismiss his bad polls in a rare sit-down interview with Judy Woodruff he's been touting polls that go positive on him for his big government spending plans for year years let's watch this when you look at the polls CBS polls 64 of Americans think the economy is in bad shape there's an NBC poll 71 percent think the country's on the wrong track why the disconnect because the no the polls don't matter anymore you got to make what 40 50 calls and on a cell phone to get someone to answer a poll a postal Manor America post matter to him when he was talking about the American Rescue plan or the inflation reduction act or the blowout and climate spending so you know with comments like that Monica is it any any Wonder ratings for the president's State of the Union fell 29 it was the least watched nobody watched at least watching 30 years voters are tuning out they do not trust this President even even a majority of Democrats don't want him to run against this ABC and the Associated Press polls yeah I mean his personal polls and political polls have both cratered there were some recent NBC News poll that showed upwards of three quarters of the American people find him dishonest divisive incompetent and lacking the physical and mental capabilities to actually do this job now if his poll numbers were going in the other direction of course he'd be touting those polls that's just politics but what we have seen is our lived experience on the ground is pretty horrific in this by an economy between inflation can't even afford eggs twenty dollars for a dozen eggs now gas prices supply chain crisis it is an economic catastrophe across the board this Administration yeah absolutely and this Administration can spin all day long which is what he did the other night at the State of the Union Address but the American people know better because they're living it every day yeah and that is why there is no enthusiasm for this man to run for president again we've got tax hikes they're talking about inflation from government spending interest rates going up that's inflation congresswoman kamik and Monica Crowley thanks for joining us tonight

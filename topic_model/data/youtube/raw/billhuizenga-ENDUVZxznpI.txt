thanks madam chair and uh this would have a little nicer 10 minutes ago when i was supposed to go but i'm going to go back to mr griffin um and uh the capital market subcommittee ranking member i think was filibustering himself and i just wanted to make sure mr griffin you had uh that opportunity to feel comfortable with the explanation of of that best x execution and what uh what was attempted apparently uh to try to be asked congressman i i hope so i think it's important to emphasize that we have vigorously advocated for execution quality to be one of the dominant decision-making factors in the routine order flow of the united states this has saved retail investors billions of dollars over the year in contrast to the executions that they would receive through other execution strategies okay with respect to payment for order flow we simply play by the rules the road payment for order flow has been expressly approved by the sec it is a customary practice within the industry if they choose to change the rules of the road we need to drive on the left side versus the right side that's fine with us i do believe that payment for order flow has been an important source of innovation in the industry as the ceo robin has testified they drove the industry towards zero dollar commissions this has been a big win for american investors we get to uh uh uh sculpt uh from uh from cato institute um and and i know that there was a greenwich associates uh had a study and others are out there do you concur that this has been good for consumers in the most part i think that there's still ongoing studies but i do think that the payment for order flow and the price improvements have largely been good for improvements for customers and i agree with mr griffin that this has helped drive innovation in the industry i think disclosure can always be better and i think people should understand that their broker still needs to make money even if they're providing a zero commission trading service yeah okay all right um i've got about three minutes left um i was going to start actually with this and ask each one of you why you thought you were here today uh but i'm gonna dispense with that because it's gonna take too much time and i'll provide the answer political theater for the most part uh that's that's what this hearing is today i mean we're on the business channels right now and on c-span i think if you see a few of my colleagues playing to the cameras but we need to have some of these fundamental and important questions answered at the end of the day and one of the assertions that you've heard already today is that that investing is quote casino gambling it's using monopoly funny money uh and uh you know i i guess i want to know is retail individual retail participation in the marketplace gambling casino gambling or using funny money mr gill why don't we just start with you very quickly uh i don't hear him uh so uh mr huffman let's move to you no i believe that investing is investing okay uh mr griffin i believe the vast vast majority of repo retail participation are people saving to meet their dreams all right mr tanev congressman thank you as i mentioned in my opening statement robin hood customers have essentially made over 35 billion dollars in unrealized and realized gains very quickly all of their assets it's it's it's a thing for them correct absolutely it's investing and it's building health go back to mister yes of course i i do i believe it's an opportunity for investors to participate in the market just as institutionals participate okay so actually the business channels had a good question from one of the reddit readers which is so you recommended uh gamestop uh before would you buy their stock now at roughly 45 it started at 48 earlier today you were talking about buying it and being happy uh when it hit cross 20. so are you buying that stock today well let me just say that investing can be risky and my particular approach to investing is rather aggressive and may not be suitable for anyone else but for me personally yes so yes or no are you buying the stock and for me personally yes i do find it's an attractive investment at this price point quick question uh did you invest in game stock uh uh because you were not aware of the uh of payment for order flow that's one of the accusations brought in people into this because they don't know that sorry could you repeat that question did you buy gamestock uh because you were not aware of the payment for order flow my investment in gamestop was based on the fundamentals okay i think that that answers it i believe my time has expired

well thank you so much allison and let me just thank everybody from the 37th congressional district thank you so much for jumping on this call you know i will still tell you i'm glad to do these calls but i sure miss our in-person town halls and i certainly hope we can at least do one or two more before the end of the year but this is a very very special day uh one for me it's very special because of one of my favorite most respected congress members has joined us jamie raskin and i'll introduce him in a minute but i will tell you being in dc last week just seemed monumental and i'm sure congressman raskin felt the same way you know one to have the supreme court kind of looming over us knowing that they were going to come up with this horrific decision but keeping our fingers crossed that maybe they would see the light especially given all of the protests that happened after the draft leaked hoping that they would see that that's not what the american people want and then to have the decision on guns happening at the exact same time when we were working on legislation to do the very opposite and you know we're very fortunate in california in la we do have tough very tough gun laws but until we bring guns under control nationwide we'll still have problems here because we know that guns come in from other places and so it was a monumental a week and so i asked my colleague jamie raskin if he would come on and speak to you you know i serve on the judiciary committee and i i joke with jamie and i told him i said jamie if you were to be my law professor for three years i'd go to law school because i just have to tell you that when he speaks in that committee everybody stops and listens because not only is he going to say something that's very important but he's also going to teach us u.s history and teach us about the constitution at the same time and i'm so proud of him to be on the january 6 committee and to have been one of the impeachment managers and he gets assignments like that because that's the way all of us in congress view him so i asked him if he would come and if he would talk about the supreme court and and representative raskin i i would really appreciate it if you would do your your professor professorial um uh you know the way you go about talking about history and maybe you could talk a little bit about where the supreme court is now i'm beginning to call it the republican supreme court because it seems as though they've gone way off into right field but maybe you could set a bigger context with where the supreme court is and the decisions that came down but also unfortunately what we can probably expect in the future so let me just welcome you to los angeles one of these days we'll get you here in person and just thank you so much it's three hours later so you know for representative raskin it's nine o'clock at night and i really appreciate you giving us the time represent basket well it would be fine for me to do it at midnight for you congresswoman bassa anything for you and for the good people of the 37th district of california who sent you uh to washington to represent them and to really represent the whole country in terms of the fantastic values and priorities you bring to congress so i'm happy to do it uh i don't blame you for calling it the uh the republican coordinator you said i would just call it the trump court because it's three justices who are put on each in a rather strange way um gorsuch and amy coney barrett and then my constituents whose well whose name i prefer not to utter but you know who he is those three uh have been the hard right swing pivot kavanagh uh gorsuch and amy coney berry um and you know they at this point chief justice roberts who we used to think of as kind of the conservative anchor of the court now is kind of left adrift because the five hard right conservatives on the court don't even need him and we saw that in the abortion case where he wanted to uphold stringent anti-abortion uh legislation without uh overturning roe versus wade and abolishing the constitutional right to privacy as it applies to abortion he thought they should move somewhat more slowly but they just threw caution to the wind and said roe versus wade was wrong planned parenthood versus casey was wrong these decisions uh are not based on anything the word abortion is not in the constitution which for them settles it uh although the word marriage is not in the constitution either and yet we do have a fundamental right to marry and the word travels not in the constitution but we have a fundamental right to travel although that's going to be tested sorely over the coming months and years as the anti-choice states try to make it a crime for people either to leave the state for the purposes of accessing uh abortion or helping people leave the state in order to access abortion so we're moving into uh very tough times uh with respect to the fundamental rights of the people when you ask sort of about where do where does the court stand today in terms of history and you know when people ask me that my answer is always surprising to them because i'm basically of the belief that the court is returning to its historical baseline you know the the supreme court still has a halo from you know a two or three decade period around the warring court where it did hand down decisions like brown versus board and roe versus wade and miranda versus arizona and the white primary line of cases smith versus all right terry versus adams cases striking down some of the worst forms of disenfranchisement but that really was a momentary deviation in the entire history of the supreme court i mean if you think about it from the beginning of the republic what did the supreme court ever do for enslaved people for the first century of our existence and the answer is absolutely nothing other than to constitutionalize the whole system of slavery in the dred scott decision and find that an enslaved person who made it into free territory could not even get into federal court under the diversity jurisdiction clause because an african-american a descendant of slaves could never be a citizen within the meaning of the constitution said chief justice tani alas of the great state of maryland and he said the constitution was a white man's compact and that was the original intent in the original meaning of the constitution this was probably the first great appearance of originalism in uh in our jurisprudence and then even after the civil war with the addition of the reconstruction amendments the 13th abolishing slavery the 14th giving us equal production due process the 15th forbidding race discrimination and voting even with all of that the supreme court in 1896 upheld the whole system of jim crow apartheid in plessy versus ferguson um and that is what lasted all the way up until brown versus board and these few decades of the supreme court standing with the rights of the people but you know the i think that that liberal people have fallen out of love with the supreme court as it has returned in the burger court the rehnquist court and now the roberts court back to that historic baseline of being a profoundly conservative and reactionary institution and we saw it this week in of course the abortion decision hobbes and we saw it in the gun decision that you referenced about concealed carry and we saw it today again in an absurd decision really bulldozing the establishment clause upholding the right of a school employee a football coach to conduct religious prayers at the 50-yard line while he's at work on work time inviting students to participate on the ground that that's his free exercise of religion when the school said hey we'll give you your own room your own space and locker room you can go pray you can go off and do your own thing but you can't uh lead the students in prayer which is something the supreme court has been holding for decades now um so we're in a full-blown reactionary assault on the constitutional freedoms that the warren court tried to enunciate and and representative raskin um one question actually i could throw a few questions to you but one question is does this can this automatically lead to taking away other rights and where can we get like a list of all of the rights that were done under the war in court so we'll know what we should start organizing about now so well if we start with the constitutional right to privacy you can pretty much follow justice clarence thomas's opinion in the case because he lays out a road map roe vs wade was based on a series of privacy uh right to privacy decisions um griswold versus connecticut back in 1965 had struck down a ban on access to contraception in connecticut even for married people and the supreme court said no there is a constitutional right to privacy both in the due process clause due process liberty but also through the accumulation of the other rights that exist in the bill of rights including the right against unreasonable searches and seizures and the fourth amendment the privilege against self-incrimination and the fifth amendment the right against cruel and unusual punishment um justice douglas basically said that there has to be a constitutional right to privacy in the constitution and the ninth amendment says that the enumeration of particular rights shall not be construed to disparage or deny the other rights retained by the people and of course that's exactly the project that this court you know is involved in so the right to contraception the right against sterilization skinner versus oklahoma i mean if you think about it if you have no right to privacy such that the government can tell you you can't have an abortion the government can also compel you to have an abortion or compel you to be sterilized as of course it did to tens of thousands of women in the last century a lot of them in virginia but in a whole bunch of states people were sterilized against their will and when it was finally struck down it was based on the idea of a right of privacy and integrity in your own reproductive and procreative decisions so that's gone and then of course the um the rights of marriage are also flowing out of this right to privacy most recently in the obergefell decision which struck down bans on gay people getting married and the court there you know stated that gay people have as much of a right to make intimate decisions about their sexuality about how they're going to order their lives as anybody else um so all of that could fall as the dominoes get pushed backwards which is precisely what justice thomas is asking for he you know people have been observing that he didn't talk about loving versus virginia which also is arguably implicated by this because it is the right to marry you know against attempts by the state to block marriage based on race and so he might say oh well that violates equal production well not on the test that he developed uh in any of these cases because if you go back to the 14th amendment 1868 there were certainly bans on interracial marriage in states throughout the country and in fact the argument that was made by virginia in loving versus virginia was that there was no race discrimination at all because black people couldn't marry white people and white people couldn't marry black people and so nobody's discriminated against and uh the court accepted you know the the court some of the judges accepted that argument and without the idea of a fundamental right to choose your own partner and order your own uh romantic and reproductive life none of it does make any sense you could fall for sophistry like that of course it is an expression of white supremacy but it results in this massive violation of people being able to marry the person they want to um representative raskin i want to ask you there's a few questions here for you if you don't mind i think i'm gonna send them to you know rattle off a few um so one is uh what are your thoughts on expanding the court to 13 justices and also what could be done about clarence about justice thomas and the other justices that lie during their uh confirmation here um and i think that oh uh delaware is one of the states where abortion is still legal how can we protect those who come to our state it's the same with california by the way when you were talking about sterilization that was a big problem in california too and uh primarily targeting uh african-american and latina uh women yeah well first about expanding the court um the the number of justices is not fixed in the constitution it's always been up to congress it's changed um when i looked at this i can't remember if it's nine or ten times i think it's nine different times uh the numbers have been changed of course it's a controversial uh thing to do as franklin roosevelt found out with his um court packing scheme but it didn't achieve the desired political effect as um you know the the court ended up um finally backing off of its invalidation of all the new deal legislation um but it is a controversial thing to do i think it should be a little less controversial today given that um you know the whole purpose of life tenure was to make sure the justices would be independent of political pressure and coercion but of course these justices are you know just political robots for the uh republican party um and the other thing is that you know when life tenure was established the average age and that the average life expectancy in the country was around you know 67 or 70 years old i mean today you know people living in 90 90 500 someone could be on the supreme court for 50 years or so you know and so i think there's there's a lot a lot more rationale for real reform of that system today um and i think it's something that it's worth us talking about i don't have any illusions that we're going to be able to make that happen as long as the senate is in its current configuration with the 50 50 split in the filibuster hanging over everything like the guillotine you know um so the only reason that i'm not like way out there on this right now is just i don't see it going anywhere and uh the right wing has found it a useful thing to to rally against the truth is that they've been the experts at court packing and uh you know it was mitch mcconnell who said no we're not going to have president obama's pick merrick garland even considered any hearing before the senate judiciary committee that's the hour counterpart over in the senate we're not even going to give him a hearing because ten and a half months is too close to an election and we want the people to decide and then when uh ruth bader ginsburg's seat opened up just um you know a couple months before the election they hustled to get um amy coney barrett you know who's like a character from the handmaid's tale um they get her hearing just you know a couple months before and then she's voted on four weeks before the election when when voting had already begun in a whole bunch of states there was already voting going on so it was you know an absolutely maddening uh hypocritical double standard and i consider that seat a stolen supreme court seat where they denied merrick garland who the whole country knows now as attorney general an opportunity to get an up or down but we're talking about the chief of the dc circuit court of appeals you know so there's all kinds of questions about the legitimacy of this court both its decisions which are absurd but also how it came to be structured in the way that it is so i i'm open to that you know what can we do now in other words what can we do with bro is there a possibility that that decision can be overturned well um david they've interpreted the constitution in a binding way of course we have the power under section 5 of the 14th amendment the extent the supreme court doesn't try to chop away at it but we do have the power under section 5 the 14th amendment to enforce and protect the rights of the people so you know karen we passed the women's health protection act it was back in march i think when we passed it we tried to codify roe vs wade and guarantee uh the right of choice and even make it civilly actionable if your government tried your state government tries to take that right away from you um but uh we passed it in the house and it's gone nowhere uh in the senate so theoretically we could reestablish a woman's right to choose by federal law by the same token they can do what they want to do which is to ban abortion nationwide and vice president pence who i i confess i have lionized a little bit because of his doing his job and adhering to his oath on january 6 he has nonetheless come out for um a federal criminal ban on abortion in every state so that you know california and maryland will not even be free choice states that women can gravitate to if you know they need to seek medical attention um for an unwanted or dangerous pregnancy or you know pregnancy caused by rape or incest or what have you so um you know that's where we are i mean the country is you know as divided as we've been we are now going to be that much more divided between free choice states and basically theocratic states where you know somebody's imposing uh you know a theological straitjacket on other people's health care decisions the other part of the question uh that that you asked me congresswoman bass was about well what about these people who went into senators offices and lie you know what about you know what about going in where kavanaugh uh kind of hate the other name but anyway and then and then they say well yes i do um roe versus wade is settled precedent i believe in starry decisis and so on uh unfortunately i mean uh you know i don't know that there's much that can be done about that i mean even just leaving aside um you know the proposition that most of these conservative judges are going to be people who lie about it and people know that but they will say well i didn't lie i just said it was settled precedent which is which it was until we overturned it and i believe in starry decisis but i don't believe in it as they wrote in the majority decision in hops i don't believe in it categorically and absolutely i just believe in it as a presumption so that there will be ways for them to wiggle and worm their way out of it um but there's no doubt that they you know tried to pull the wool over people's eyes on the other hand i gotta say for some of these senators who are acting shocked shocked that they would do this i think they allowed themselves to have the wall pulled over their eyes because it's not as if we weren't the women's caucus in the house as if the pro-choice movement wasn't screaming from the rooftops these people are going to overturn roe versus wait i mean that's the whole purpose of the republican national committee platform for the last several decades right up until 2020 when they didn't even pass a platform because their platform is whatever donald trump tells them you know and and you know uh representative raskin i get tired of listening to susan collins being shocked she's shocked all the time you know when she's trying to make decisions well i know that um we have a poll question that we want to ask people and then i want to switch and have you talk about january 6th because we're getting lots of questions about january 6. one person did ask me though california has set aside money for people from other states to come here and the question was is that taxpayers money yes that's taxpayers money um but can we ask the poll question now whether people agree with the decisions of the supreme court yes absolutely so very simply everyone we have great audience on if you agree with the supreme court overturning um roe v wade is this the one you want to do for sure congresswoman oh sure yeah okay okay press one for yes and two for no so again if you agree with the supreme court overturning roe v wade press one for yes i agree press two for no you disagree so again one last time i'll read through that just in case i confused everyone do you agree with the supreme court overturning roe v wade press one for yes and two for no everyone can continue to weigh in on that while i turn it back to you congresswoman so congressman everybody is just so proud of the job that you and and our chairman have been doing on the january 6 committee and i don't know if you're able to tell us but if there's a little hint hint about this emergency hearing that's called tomorrow but i think one of the biggest questions that people are asking in the queue is what is going to happen is garland going to prosecute what is going to happen well on that question the first thing i must confess dear karen is that merrick garland is my constituent so i tend not to like to beat up on my constituents in public um so i i don't want to anything i say to be interpreted as pressure on you but look uh they brought more than 850 prosecutions against people for everything from assaulting a federal officer to trespass in a federal building to interference with the federal proceeding all the way up to uh seditious conspiracy which means conspiracy to overthrow uh or put down or destroy the government of the united states so um i don't think they're being shy it is true they are working their way up the way you do in an organized crime prosecution um you start with the smaller fish and you get them to tell you about the people at the level above them and so on until you work you were you know work your way to the top um but look what what are the criteria in the doj in the doj um charging um principles well you look to obviously you look to see if there's probable cause that a crime has been committed i think that our hearings have shown probable cause about a number of crimes uh being committed all the way to the top including conspiracy to deprive the public of an honest election including conspiracy to interfere with federal proceeding but once you determine there's probably cause that's not enough you have to look at the gravity of the offense you've got to look at whether there's important deterrent value in doing it and you have to look at the culpability or the intentionality with which the potential defendant acted and i think if you look at each one of those things um all of them argue for indictment but i don't want to go much further than that because i mean i know people are impatient and i know people want to see justice to me it's a beautiful thing to see people want you know hungering for justice in an individual case like that um but you know our goal in the committee is not just individual criminal accountability that's the department of justice's real jurisdiction ours is collective accountability for preserving our democracy and fortifying democratic institutions against clues against insurrections against political violence and against people trying to perpetrate frauds on the election and that to me is really more important where than where donald trump spends the remaining years of his life and uh you know i i care a lot more about our democracy and the future of um you know what america is going to look like for our children and grandchildren than i do about him but having said that i want justice too and uh you know i'm i'm willing to wait for it because i think that they will do the right thing so here's two questions for you um i noticed that the january six committee hearings are still being dismissed as partisan and i'm wondering if it's being considered to have a member of the capitol police list every injury that was suffered since that clearly wasn't partisan how does one well i just did the question was how do you submit that idea for to a committee member and that's exactly well we did well one question the committee is um bringing in new evidence um and so one question is um let's see are you going to are you going to be questioning uh clarence thomas's wife regarding her role in playing a part in trying to overthrow our government and what does that do with him being able to stay on the supreme court all right well let's start with number one first of all consider that idea submitted because i love that idea it's an idea uh actually that i was pushing from the beginning we need to have the names of all of the officers uh who were injured or wounded or took their own lives in you know in response to these events and we should have a complete listing of all of the broken ribs broken vertebrae's broken arms traumatic brain injuries concussions lost fingers heart attacks strokes so thank you to whoever put that that person is a a small d democrat after my own heart and please consider that something that i'm working on too so um so that's question number one question number two um about jenny thomas well um jenny thomas has expressed her interest in speaking to the committee um and i for one is a member of the committee i'm very interested in talking to her i think all of us are we're interested in speaking to all material witnesses who have evidence relevant to what happened both in terms of the inside political coup you know the shakedown against election officials state legislatures the department of justice the counterfeit electors plot as well as the violent insurrection which ended up merging in uh the final hours with the political coup so we're interested in anybody who's got information she clearly is somebody who was uh involved with various actors um here and so we want to hear from her um you know the the problem on the supreme court is that um you know as congressman bass will will tell you there is no binding ethics rules against the supreme court justices themselves they are literally the judge in their own case which is what madison defined as anephema to a system of the rule of law i mean he basically said the cardinal principle in our rule of law is that nobody can be a judge in their own cause by which he meant their own case um and yet that's exactly how it works on the supreme court you know if you say oh well i don't have a conflict then that's it that's not how it works for judges in any other part of the federal system so uh congressman bass and i have been pushing for the adoption of a real uh ethics code on the supreme court and you know i mean justice thomas voted in the minority eight to one in the case of donald trump versus thompson versus our committee everybody else voted that um that all of the materials needed to be turned over from the archives to us and that trump you know could not uh block that by asserting executive privilege and thomas was the only one uh to dissent and you know it's possible within those materials there are communications from his own wife but if he thinks that there's no conflict of interest in that then there's no conflict of interest because they've got no system so we got to deal with that problem and you know as for what it means for him on the court likely it doesn't mean much unless you know far more egregious and outrageous things come out in which case there's only one potential remedy which is uh impeachment but then you know again you're back into the house senate system which of course i became so familiar with during the presidential impeachment i mean you need a majority in the house to impeach but you need two thirds in the senate in order to convict and we we did have a 57-43 majority but that wasn't enough to convict trump he beat the constitutional spread by by 10 votes um reskin if there was an impeachment of a a judge would it be just like each of the president yeah with them in the same fashion yeah they're all they're all done in the exact same way and um yeah and when was the last time a judge was impeached well you know that there have been that that's actually not that infrequent i mean um there are district judges that have been impeached recently there's a famous case called nixon versus united states and it's not that nixon it's not the california nixon it's uh walter nixon who is a judge from north carolina but that was the case which actually established that the procedures adopted by the house and the senate are a political question which means the supreme court will not review and scrutinize the procedures adopted in the impeachment process that's up to the you know the coordinate branch of government the legislative branch to determine those rules oh what about the um the pr prosecution or rather i should say the investigation of trump in georgia and in new york both of those attorney generals i mean it is possible that they prosecute him correct well um the country got to see the extremely damning evidence against donald trump coming out of georgia where you know he said all i'm looking for is 11 780 votes which was donald trump not trying to stop election fraud it was donald trump trying to commit election fraud and getting caught red-handed because secretary of state brad rothenberger who's a loyal lifelong republican who contributed to the trump campaign was so outraged by all of the intimidation that he decided to tape the conversation and that's where you know donald trump was clearly found trying to solicit um the secretary of state's involvement in what is a criminal conspiracy to fabricate votes so you know while he's out there saying he's trying to stop election fraud which more than 60 courts determined did not exist anywhere in the land he was actually trying to commit election abroad thank you um you know we we talked a lot about roe but not so much about uh the gun legislation and maybe you could talk about what the court did versus what we did well there was a challenge to new york's concealed carry law which required people to show that they had some special purpose for wanting to carry a concealed weapon and you can imagine why a city is densely compact because new york would want to make sure that people have a special reason that can be publicly articulated before they're carrying a gun with them on the subway or the bus or the streets or whatever but the court struck it down implicating the laws of a whole bunch of states including maryland where we also have a similar process where you have to show a special reason um in order to get uh concealed carry either you know you're being threatened by someone and you're in fear of your safety or it's part of your job as a you know a security guard or whatever it might be but now all of that is struck down the court says that this comes within the second amendment right and there's not a sufficiently compelling reason that the state could use uh to overcome it so there is so much that's problematic with the constitutional reasoning and the methodology in this uh decision um you know it's very clear that states have had laws like this for a long time and if you had any kind of real appreciation for original intent in history you would have to find that the states were doing the right thing but the court just says well no actually that practice collides with the text of the second amendment now the tax of the second amendment of course has been disputed um well certainly since the heller decision but for the longest time it was accepted that the individual's right to carry to bear arms was connected to service in the militia the public militia or what today we would call the national guard and the language of it is a well-regulated militia being necessary to the survival of a free state comma the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed well in heller versus district columbia the liberals said you have a right to to bear arms constitutionally with respect to militia service the court rejects that and says that the so-called presentatory cause clause a well-regulated militia is not actually linked to the operative clause the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed so justice scalia just detached the two which is the strangest grammar in the world um and um but but even there i got to say there was a 5-4 decision even if you accept what the conservative said still justice scalia is saying in that decision that the individual's right to keep and bear arms is conditioned on reasonable regulation by the state in the interest of public safety and public security like every other right i mean the free speech right in the first amendment is subject to reasonable time place manner restrictions you've got a right to protest across from the white house um in farragut park but not at two o'clock in the morning with the loudest speaker system in the world because the people inside the white house have a right to sleep so every right has got to be cabined by the um acceptance of neighboring rights and you know competing social interests and scalia was very clear about that and he said you know none of this should be seen to cast doubt on background checks on rejection of the right to carry guns into sensitive public places government buildings and schools or denial of the right to carry arms to people who are convicted felons or otherwise proven dangerous and so on and the you know you know our colleagues karen they just read that out of the second amendment so anything that we want to do they say it violates the second amendment and we're and they say you want to repeal the second amendment and i just say no we don't want to repeal the second amendment we just want you to read the second amendment and read the court's decisions about it and you know we there is a reasonable gun safety regulation um you know codicil to the idea of people having a right to to weapons for self-defense and for hunting and recreation well you know the problem with what you just said is that the key word was read and um i don't think we have expectations of some of our colleagues to actually do that which is quite sad um one person is asking and by the way i want you to know that you have some fans of your book unthinkable there's a book club in westwood where they're reading your book and uh and then they want to know about it so one question is how can it be left up to states to decide on abortion but not left up to states to decide on the right to carry guns in public um can't the state because in california of course you can't carry a weapon in public i thought that the state still had some control well right you are i mean i think that that irony has not been lost on millions of people who can't believe that the whole rhetoric of uh over overturning roe versus wade is let's let the states decide they're the ones who know their interests best and the values of the people best and so on but when it comes to guns no we need the absolute straight jacket of nra orthodoxy handed down by you know justice alito and justice thomas and these guys and their you know all the state's rights rhetoric goes out the window it's completely expedient um so but i mean that's that's i think a very powerful insight hello to my friends in westwood thank you for reading my book unthinkable and send me a note when it's all over if you would and let me know what you guys thought about it and if you guys send that to my office i will make sure representative raskin uh gets it um you know i will say that in in california and in los angeles specifically we do have red flag laws uh and red flag laws mean if you uh if there's somebody that you're concerned about either being a danger to themselves or other people that that their right to have a gun can be taken away from them but um the problem in la is that nobody uses it i mean i think there were like 25 requests so one of the things that we need to do is to make sure that people in la are aware of that and i don't know if there's anything else you want to comment about what we passed versus what the president just signed versus what uh the court did and if there's any contradiction in that well my main frustration is just that the most obvious things are not happening um and i'm not talking about radical things in any way i mean what we have in the you know the the uh the brady act the idea of a background check but we've got these gaping loopholes in the background check i mean if you go to a gun store they're gonna run a background check on you to make sure you're not you're not a criminal and you're uh you know you're not disqualified because of insanity and you're not a fugitive and you're you know a whole bunch of things but if you go on the internet to buy one you don't have to have that if you go to a gun show there's no background check so that doesn't make any sense that's not that's not a real law that's like swiss cheese you know and so when we say a universal violent criminal background check all we're saying is close the loopholes more than 90 percent of the american people accept that everybody should have a background check before they're purchasing a firearm so you know uh so that that's one thing that we had in that the senate did not do because the nra draws a hard line on that and you know our friends in the republican party are just captive to that nra dogma um you know we also wanted to ban the high-capacity magazines you don't need high-capacity magazines either to defend yourself uh or to go hunting i mean hunters look down on somebody who would bring a high capacity magazine in fact in fact both in federal law and state law it's it's against the law to have high capacity magazines when you're out duck hunting or whatever but it's not against law if you want to go pick up an ar-15 in order to go into a school and start shooting it up and you know what we just saw what happened um in uvalde was an 18 year old who gets an ar-15 on his 18th birthday and then goes in and assassinates all of those children and we saw the same thing in buffalo an 18 year old got jacked up on racist great white replacement theory and went into the black community and found the supermarket and just started killing people um and so that you know our colleagues across the aisle basically are telling us that um these are necessary human sacrifices to the second amendment there's nothing that can be done under the second amendment to stop that and i you know i just don't accept that the second amendment means that we have to allow weapons of war to be carried in the streets much less sold to 18 year olds you know i tell you it was just so devastating to me to hear about the damage the physical damage that an ar-15 does it just broke my heart the idea that the parents had to have dna in order for their kids to be um you know identified you know um representative raskin a whole another area that the supreme court took up which you know as we fought so hard for police reform and we were able to get it done in the house but not in the senate but the decision around miranda um you know what what does that do a question that someone has written in is uh how should citizens respond to police officers who don't read them their miranda rights what course of action should citizens take if this happens and the supreme court also made a decision i don't think this was connected to miranda but where you can't or maybe it was where you can't sue um they uh restricted additional restrictions on how you can sue officers well yes indeed um yeah uh well that's one of the things we've tried to deal with in in your legislation uh where you know we're reforming all of these judge-made immunity doctrines that let police departments and officers off the hook if they've engaged in a certain kind of brutality or injustice that's never happened before um and then they say well you know this is a novel thing there's no way anybody could have known um which is just an extraordinary you know made-up doctrine um so you know we've got we've got a lot of work to do on that and there are um you know police departments that uh you know that need reform and i i like very much the stuff that we put into the the george floyd act um to try to reform uh a lot of these practices but um you know as as you know the point is not in any way to abolish the police on the contrary i mean the police i know saved a lot of lives on january 6 and there were a lot of african-american and hispanic officers who were out there that day like my constituent officer dunn or officer cannell who saved our lives battling uh in under medieval conditions white supremacists and white nationalists and proud boys and oath keepers who came with the express object of overthrowing the government and killing uh political leadership and even hanging mike pence and if they were going to hang mike pence i tremble to think what they would have done to congresswoman karen bass or to me if they've gotten our hands on us so you know to my mind police officers are public servants just like teachers and firefighters and members of city councils and members of congress and so on and i know that there are certain departments just like there's certain other kinds of offices in different parts of the country that have been infected by racism but we got to deal with that at the same time that we make the proper investment in training um and education and support for our officers and that's just the way i feel about it well absolutely you know back to uh ro what about a woman who has an ectopic pregnancy um what what what happens then well this is one of the extraordinary things i mean i i thought that where they would end up would be well we're against the vast majority of abortions which is women making their own decisions but we will allow exceptions for uh health of the mother for rape for incest they decided to go the other way they because basically they they arrived at the conclusion that if we allow exceptions for rape health of the mother and so on well then health of the mother opens up to psychological or emotional health of the mother and uh you know women could lie about whether or not they were they were raped and so they just decided to go all the way and say that we're gonna ban it i mean it's handmaid's tale stuff uh and uh that's where the extreme anti-choice movement is and they've cast their lot with those people i mean forget all the rhetoric about we're just gonna let the people of the states decide i mean within 24 hours of the decision they already started calling for a national ban on abortion criminalizing it everywhere not just in you know texas and mississippi and arkansas but all over the country uh and of course that that is the logic of their position i mean if you think what is was a constitutional right last week is murder now then of course it's murder all over the country so i've got a resolution which i'm introducing tomorrow to uphold the constitutional right to travel which also is not explicitly mentioned in the constitution but it's been considered part of the constitution for more than a century so that women are allowed to leave a particular state to go to another state for the purposes of receiving medical care that is lawful in the destination state and uh you know we need to start fighting real hard on that principle that any state that tries to keep women from traveling or criminalizing people who enable their travel those states are interfering with people's exercise of their civil rights under section 1983 and are violating people's civil rights but this is going to become i think real quickly a very big terrain of conflict and you know i think about an etopic pregnancy or tubular pregnancy as it's called if you don't end that immediately it can burst and the woman will die because there's no way a pregnancy in a woman's fallopian tubes can be viable at all and so i i can just ima i can't imagine as a former medical professional i can't imagine that a doctor would actually sit there and allow a tubular pregnancy to explode but then on the other hand you know there's women in central america for example in other countries that get arrested when they have miscarriage because who's to say that you didn't cause the miscarriage it's just you know the 21st century in your 2022 and it's just shocking to see how far uh backwards we could go and you know uh jamie what's to say that's separate but equal won't come back i mean you know who's to say that the businessman shouldn't say who comes in the restaurant and where that person should sit they should be free to have their their business conducted any way that they want well there you go well first on the topic pregnancy i mean you're totally right the questioner's uh totally right about that there are lots of women who miscarry and then take what is an abortion drug at the direction of their doctor in order to you know clear their bodies um completely of the miscarriage well that that would be made illegal just like with the ectopic pregnancy i mean you know which is why we've said from the beginning the question is who is going to decide these issues is it women with their partners and families and their physicians and other medical personnel or is it politicians you know do you want the state legislators or the congressman you want marjorie taylor green and laurent beauberg and matt gates and jim jordan making these decisions about you know uh ectopic pregnancies and uh what to do um with you know extraordinary deformities and all these kinds of things and all i can say is i know a lot of women in my life and i know a lot of politicians and i trust the women more than i trust the politicians including the female politicians but you know on your point about uh you know separate but equal and where we're headed on all that stuff they want to turn the clock back on everything you're totally right i mean the next thing is really going to be to go back to try to attack the new deal regulatory agencies i mean this was steve bannon's original target when he said we're going to destroy the regulatory state so we're going to destroy you know the epa the clean air act the clean water act we don't want any regulation we don't want the fda we don't want any of that stuff they're gonna it'll be like back to the lochner period and then you're right if they won't put the the race discrimination that they inscribe into law in such explicit uh in naked terms but they will put it precisely as you suggested in terms of freedom i mean and that's what you know that's where they're going with for example you don't you know if your hotel or motel or wedding business doesn't want to serve gay people of course you don't have to that violates your freedom to associate with who you want to your religious scruples well if that applies to um same-sex couples why doesn't that apply to inter-faith couples or interracial couples uh and then we're right back to you know what was being thought about in the 1960s because you know the argument being made by robert bork around the civil rights act was um you can't force a motel or restaurant owner in the south who doesn't want to serve black people to serve black people that violates his right not to associate with the people he doesn't want to associate with whereas the civil rights movement said and the supreme court upheld it under the warren court that no this is about the regulation of commerce and whether everyone is going to be able to be free to travel among the states uh without white supremacy and violent white supremacy getting in the way and that was you know what was so critical about the civil rights act followed very quickly you know by the voting rights act in 65 but i think we are headed exactly back in that direction and we have a deeply reactionary jurisprudence setting in well let me just say uh we are at the end of our hour and i'm just so appreciative of you taking the time i want everybody on the call to know in terms of the poll question that we asked 94 percent of people do not agree with the decision that the supreme court made six percent uh do so i think it's probably pretty representative of the constituents of the 37th district you know i appreciate you so much for taking the time i know it's 10 o'clock now and i know that all of the constituents who are on this call understand why representative raskin is such a well respected and loved member of the house of representatives and even though these are my last few months in the house i will absolutely miss my friend and his brilliance and his teaching so i might have to call you up from time to time and get a history lesson representative thank you so much i'm always here for you and uh thank you for your splendid service to the people of california all right see you soon jamie all of that bye

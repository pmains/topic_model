Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor James “Jim”
Carney for his selfless service to residents of the Tenth District as a firefighter in
our communities for more than two decades. Jim sadly passed away last month after a heroic
three-and-a-half-year battle with cancer. Jim was a native of the Tenth District: born
in Waukegan, growing up in Wadsworth, and attending Warren Township High School. After studying at Columbia Southern University,
Jim returned home to serve as on-call member of the Newport Township Fire Protection District
in Wadsworth and receive his paramedic license. Later in 2000, he joined the Lincolnshire-Riverwoods
Fire Protection District, and eventually earned the rank of lieutenant. Jim was both respected and beloved by his
fellow firefighters. They remember him for his calm under pressure
and for the welcome he extended to new members of their department. “Jim was the kindest person you could ever
meet, and he showed everyone respect,” recalled his close friend and colleague Steve Shetsky
to the Lincolnshire Review. Jim’s memory is one of willingness to put
his own life in danger to save those of his neighbors, and our communities are incredibly
grateful for his service. I offer my most sincere condolences to Jim’s
wife Janelle; children, Peyton and Brett; and many friends, family, and colleagues who
mourn his loss.

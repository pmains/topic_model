I want to thank you for working with me on an amendment to HR 50 40 which is the Export Control reform Act I think the bill is excellent I think the amendment makes it better this amendment will ensure the Department of Commerce which licensed the exports of dual-use items explicitly gathers information and takes into consideration whether a major export of controlled equipment or technology will have a negative impact on the production of items that are needed for our own national security here in the United States so much of Export Control as we look at a particular weapon system and say should that country be trusted with that weapon system but what is just as important is that we control the export of manufacturing equipment and technology we export far less than any other major country as a percentage of our GDP when an American firm sends technology and the ability to produce critical items outside the United States we could call that as one small export but it has a negative impact on our national security industrial base and our high-tech workforce even when we're exporting this material to an ally any what we're doing is putting making that ally the country that will do the manufacturing using our technology well that may not be good for jobs in our economy but this is not a pair of shoes this is not a television set this is when we export jobs an industrial base in the military sector in the dual use sector we undermine our ability to produce what our military needs should the case arise having a robust toy making industry might be good for the United States having a robust industry in the area of weapons systems is critical for our national security not only that but by transferring this technology and industrial capacity we create a circumstance where some other country will determine whether the produce of that industry whether the weapon systems that are manufactured with dual use items that are manufactured will be exported to this or that additional country right now when weapon systems and dual-use items are exported it comes to not only administration of this country but often comes to this committee but if one of our if we export the manufacturing capacity the government of Italy or the government of Japan is not going to be submitting reports to the United States Congress giving us 60 or 90 days to approve or disapprove of arms or dual capacity materiel export so I think that it is important that we look at the industrial base as part of our national security infrastructure I want to take this moment also to voice my support for the other bills that are before us I particularly want to associate with myself with the comments of Ms Frankel from Florida and her excellent work on the women's and entrepreneurship and economic empowerment act and associate myself with mr. Castro from Texas's comments on the importance of global electronics change Act and commend him for his work on that again mr. chairman thank you for working with me on the this amendment including in the unblock package and I heard support of the motion thank you I think mr. Sherman puts his finger on the heart of the matter here because the the question is no longer can it be the export of individual systems on dual use it has to be the export of the know-how and your point about making certain we have re-export controls so that if we transfer to an Li they cannot transfer is equally applicable to the question of making certain that the know-how itself is not transferred in all the ways we tried to do that in this in this measure and as we move forward I just wanted to thank mr. chairman for his contributions to this overhaul it's been a long time coming and I think our efforts here are to identify every one of these examples from past mistakes and figure out how we close those loopholes especially giving the new given the new technologies that are coming we go now do any other members seek recognition hearing no further requests for recognition the question occurs on the items considered on block all those in favor say aye all those opposed no in the opinion of the chair the eyes have it and the measure is considered unblocked or agreed to and and without objection the measures considered unblocked are ordered favorably reported as amended and staff is directed to make any technical and conforming changes and the chair is authorized to seek house consideration under suspension of the rules and that concludes our business for today and I want to thank ranking member angle and all of our committee members for their contributions and their assistance with this markup today the committee stands adjourned [Music] you [Music]

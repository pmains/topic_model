as you said my name is jeremiah and i serve as a senior policy analyst at americans for prosperity at afp we seek to empower millions of activists across the country to deal with some of the most critical issues we are facing in our local communities while we are doing that we support bottom-up solutions that emphasize freedom individual responsibility and the unique potential of every individual we are here today to support the state's reform act because it just does just that it embodies those principles and we know that states in recent years have really taken an experimental approach and leaned into their role as the laboratories of democracy by implementing new types of cannabis policy and we believe that it is time for the federal government to get out of the way our failed one-size-fits-all approach to cannabis is not working and so we need states to be able to do what is best for their citizens arbitrary and unenforcement of federal law is not a permanent solution and we need a permanent solution to this policy issue and this could not come at a more opportune time cities across the country are facing unexpected increases in violent crime rather than our country continuing to spend trillions of dollars to enforce marijuana prohibition we can better spend that money to implement targeted interventions that prevent and solve violent crime so we really believe the secret format is important because it will reorient the priorities of federal agencies to help assist state and local law enforcement to focus on their core mission solving and preventing serious crime we look forward to working with representative mace the other co-sponsors of this bill members of both parties to truly restore state autonomy in this area thank you so much

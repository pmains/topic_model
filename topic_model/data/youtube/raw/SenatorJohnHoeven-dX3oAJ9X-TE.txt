without objection i'm here today to discuss the tax increase prevention act we're now getting down to uh the end of the year it's important that we get our work done an important part of that work is passing the tax increase prevention act it's often referred to as the tax extenders package but what it really does is it extends tax credits and deductions used by small businesses across this country the tax increase prevention act will extend for one year 55 different tax credits and deductions that expired either at the end of 2013 or during 2014. this is a bill that's already passed the house and it passed with a huge margin with a bipartisan vote of 378 to 46. one of the most important provisions in the act is the section 179 expensing and depreciation provision for small businesses that's a provision i particularly want to focus on today and talk about and discuss why it's so important for our small businesses and and in fact for our entire economy section 179 allows farmers and other small businesses to expense and depreciate property they've purchased or repaired for their operations that's important to them so that they don't see a tax increase but also keeps our economy going without it small businesses will buy and repair less equipment slowing down our manufacturing base and slowing down our economy quite simply that means fewer jobs it's not only because small businesses costs are increased but it's also because of the uncertainty that's created when they don't know the rules of the road and that's why this fix needs to be done on a permanent basis on a permanent basis and i think it could have been done on a permanent basis this year we were working on a deal until the president threatened to veto that legislation and so now we've got a one-year fix but we've got broad support in this chamber for the one-year fix and we need to pass it we need to pass it now and then go back to work on a permanent fix next year i was home uh for the weekend about a week ago and i was talking to some of the farmers in our state they told me what they've been telling me for some time now and that's that they need the section 179 expensing and depreciation and they need to know the rules of the road and they need to know it now we're at your end where you're in they're doing their year-end planning they're doing their tax work some are still negotiating on buying equipment for next year the depreciation and expensing rules affect the decisions that they make in effect and and will also affect the number of jobs in our economy agriculture alone is responsible for 16 million direct and indirect jobs in our economy 16 million ag is also a sector of our economy that produces a positive balance of trade and american agriculture provides the highest quality lowest cost food supply in the world something that benefits every single american every day but section 179 expansion and depreciation is important for other small businesses as well and it's not just small business it helps keep our large industries going too for example case new holland john deere have manufacturing plants in my home state they produce tractors balers and other equipment in addition they also make industrial equipment so when farmers and other small businesses slow down their purchase of equipment these manufacturing facilities slow down as well means less business fewer workers needed fewer jobs that's how it works it's that simple the truth is small business is the backbone of our economy in this country the hallmark of america is that it's historically been the best place in the world to do business it's where everybody has always come to do business we've always had the best legal tax and regulatory business climate we've provided the certainty businesses need to invest to hire people to create jobs and to grow the economy that's the rising tide that lifts all bulls a higher standard of living for our people and revenue from economic growth not higher taxes to reduce our debt and deficit to get them under control as well let's create that certainty for our farmers and small businesses across this great nation let's make sure their taxes don't go up and let's start by passing the tax increase prevention and act and section 179 expensing and depreciation now i'd like to close uh by reading from some of the letters that i've received from some of my constituents i think so often the hard-working taxpayers of north dakota the small business people out there that are getting it done every day say it best first one is from dick hedol owner of bismarck based hedos auto plus he says without section 179 and the bonus depreciation uh heat auto parts would really have felt the pinch last year when we purchase equipment to service diesel-powered trucks and heavy equipment since the growth in the bach and his services have been especially important because he can save clients thousands of dollars by refurbishing worn diesel engine blocks what makes the the refurbishing possible is the 100 percent american-made equipment he'd all bought in 2012 in 2013 for 450 000. at a thirty four percent tax rate he says he wouldn't have been able to make those equipment purchases work but with section 179 expensing and depreciation he was able to make those things work and as a result he's providing jobs in the western part of our state he knows auto parts employs more than 200 people another constituent wrote in leon slava of roulette she writes quote i'm concerned about section 179 and what this is doing to the agricultural sector in north dakota farm equipment is not being sold as the farmers are concerned about the amount that they will have to pay taxes on i farm with my husband and i work in a small town small town farm supply farmers have quit spending due to low commodity prices in section 179 i'm concerned with the effect on our small town economy if section 179 is not revised after meeting with our tax consultant we are concerned with the possible tax liability we are facing and what this means to the future of our family farm please push for revision of section 179 end quote dennis miller who grew up in stark county worked for a ag equipment dealership for 28 years is similarly concerned i'm going to paraphrase from his letter four years ago he started his own business southwest ag repair incorporated he sells new mccormick tractors and repairs all brands of farm equipment he has six employees mr miller wrote to me earlier earlier this year anxious about the expiration of section 179 quote it's going to cut sales of farm equipment drastically if the farmers don't get a tax incentive to purchase equipment and quote mr miller wrote quote the loss of sales will create backlash in the economy throughout the state and the country there has to be a better way to create the tax revenue and mr miller there is you create tax revenue with economic growth not higher taxes just like you create jobs create economic activity again that rising tide that lifts all boats that's when it enables us to invest in the future of our country and roads and bridges our schools and all the things that people want for this great nation but it comes from a growing economy and of course that's what creates the jobs that we need for our families across america so when we talk about the tax increase prevention act that's what we're talking about we're talking about making sure here at the end of the year the taxes don't go up the taxes don't go up on hard-working taxpayers across this country that taxes don't go up on our small businesses across the country and that we understand that that is truly the backbone of our economy that all those people and all those small businesses are the ones that make our economy go every day every minute of every day so it's time to add it's time to act the votes are here the votes are here on a bipartisan basis in this body to get it done let's get it done our american citizens our hard-working taxpayers have waited long enough with that mr president i yield the floor

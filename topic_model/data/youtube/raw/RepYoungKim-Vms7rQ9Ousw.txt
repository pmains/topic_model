the chair will now recognize rep kim from california for five minutes thank you chairwoman davis and ranking member muser i want to thank the witnesses for being with us today my district is california's 39th district in the suburban area in north orange county l.a and san bernardino counties and this is the area that i represent and that is home to a robust startup and entrepreneur community in 2020 the la area startup ecosystem had approximately 3.6 billion dollars in early stage funding for new startups but in contrast the average startup ecosystem globally received about 431 million dollars in early stage funding for new startups and in orange county early stage venture capital investment has grown from 107.5 million dollars in 2010 to 404.2 million dollars in 2019. unfortunately the administration's proposal to increase taxes on long-term capital gains will likely disincentivize investment on our entrepreneurs so i'm concerned that the proposal to increase the marginal tax rate will punish small businesses categorized as pass-through entities such as sole proprietorships it's worth noting that 95 of businesses file their taxes as pass-through entities so let me pose this first question to mr johnson if the biden administration's proposal is enacted the u.s could have the highest top capital gains tax rates among oecd countries um so can you describe what a higher capital tax rate would do to early stage funding yes thank you very much congresswoman kim uh tax rates are important um as are programs and investments into entrepreneurship ecosystems um the kaufman foundation and the stardust national startup coalition in their america's new business plan outlines sort of the both and of policies that create an environment to provide entrep opportunity for entrepreneurs a level playing field reduced red tape tax issues funding the right kinds of capital at the right time the knowledge of how to start a business and the types of supports that we're talking about here today with the sba and support for the opportunity to take a risk from our entrepreneurs we don't often hear about tax issues being their top issue it certainly is most likely an issue we heard from mr mcguire about the challenges he has faced what we more often hear what really bubbles to the top is that they need support they need help in developing their business model and de-risking their technology turning that idea into a new product into new jobs in connecting with sources of capital being able to compete globally for capital and bring it into their community so you know the policy environment it needs to be a both and how do we reduce regulation how do we reduce red tape how do we balance taxes with investments in supports and ecosystems thank you mr jones i want to stay on the topic and let me pose the same question to mr mcguire would you agree that a higher capital tax rate put our entrepreneurs and startups at a competitive disadvantage compared to other countries and can you cite an example well absolutely i mean i don't care if you're republican or democrat no one wants higher taxes we all need to decide what the balance is for everyone out there if you're asking me if the capital gains rate will impact investment in in companies absolutely it will will it stop investment in other companies no it won't i mean we're still going to go out and work hard to sit there and and and try to make our businesses successful what i think is more important is what you said before 95 of of taxable are passed through entities once you start messing with capital gains and and and the personal income tax rate you're going to impact every small business i don't care if it's a barber shop or if it's a clearly clean products you will start impacting them negatively sure i know i got a little time left so mr mcguire uh i i really appreciate your testimony as uh you talked about the difficulty in hiring employees but i also give you a lot of kudos from growing from a very small three employee to over 300 employees and that's because of your innovation and creativity uh but i also wanted to uh talk to you about the uh recent cpi that rose to 5.4 in june compared to a year ago this is the highest inflation numbers in 13 years so can you tell us how the increase in prices and inflation impacts your small business uh you're going to see inflation i don't think anyone on this committee should sit there and not think we're going to see inflation in our business specifically we're seeing between 15 to 30 percent increases in our raw material costs and some of our supplies that are required to sit there and put our product out there to market um it's coming i mean third quarter fourth quarter you're going to see it i don't think there's any getting away from it your cpi is where that is right now it's not going to be where it's going to be in the fourth quarter in the first quarter of 2022. well thank you i see my time's up so i yield back

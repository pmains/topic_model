I promised you all morning that I would begin a 10-part series in the week before an election with a sitting United States Senator who's not up for election and the reason is because this book Only the Strong is probably the most important National Security book put out by a sitting elected official since I have been doing this show and Senator Tom Cotton joins me is the author of Only the Strong good morning Senator thank you for this congratulations on the launch of a book uh people have asked me why I'm doing 10 parts on one book in the week before an election and it is my obvious attempt to put National Security on the table is that why you released Only the Strong during an election week well thank you for having me on and talking about Only the Strong yeah I did want to release my new book Only the Strong before the election in part to outline the stakes of the election um I as I described in the book many Americans feel like America has been in Decline under Joe Biden before him Barack Obama uh and I tell the inside story about why this isn't an accident why it's not just Joe Biden's bad luck this is declined by design that Democrats going back 100 years have been undermining the sources of American power not only our military but also energy production our Southern border and the sovereignty of our nation they've been coddling our adversaries like China and Russia and they're doing these things on purpose as I explained in Only the Strong and the stakes of this election is if if you think America's been in decline if you want to reverse it if you want to restore American power I have a road map here that we can once we take back the Congress in this election and hopefully the White House in the next election now Senator you've got two small children you're married up you got two small children I have five grandchildren we are sleepwalking towards a catastrophe and I say that having lived through the Carter years and watching that catastrophic sequence of events beginning with the Iranian Revolution but I've also been listening to Churchill's the world crisis and Great Britain sleepwalked into World War One ignoring what was going on in the world that was not driven by an ideological blindness but by arrogance we're being driven by ideology that's that's the catastrophic moment we're in we are trapped by an ideology of the left into ignoring what is going on in the world do you think we can break out of this in time I do think we can't hear you because the American people are not really ideological um even those kind of Center left uh Americans who normally vote Democratic are not ideologues in the way that Barack Obama was an audio log and that his uh understudy Joe Biden has followed his footsteps or audio logs going back to Woodrow Wilson as I explain it only the strong really The Fountainhead of American uh leftist thinking especially in the Democratic party a and in particular when it comes to our safety in the world the American people are the opposite of audio logs they are usually queer-eyed hard-nosed about America's interests and they want leaders to do the same to put them and their interest first now I I've talked to you frequently about what happens if the Senate majority and the House Majority become Republican and whether or not we can buttress America's defenses in time against XI and other enemies including Iran and and many other internal enemies having to do with terrorism things like that but first we got to win first we got to win so I want to do politics then go through every chapter and Only the Strong we can't do the whole book but I can give people a taste how do you feel about the election on 11 8. we're gonna win next week Hugh I don't have any question in my mind we're going to take back the house I think we're going to take back to Senate as well I think we may even win in some surprising uh races and the Democrats are uh currently right now trying to shore up even places like Washington state where Chuck Schumer is spending millions of dollars at the last minute to prop up Patty Murray a 30-year failed career politician against Tiffany Smiley herself a great American patriot who stood by her husband Scotty Smiley when he was wounded in Iraq and stood up for our troops and our veterans demanding better care for them we've got great candidates like Tiffany all across the country that's why we're going to win a majority we can't turn everything around as long as Joe Biden is president but we can begin to stop the decline as I explained Only the Strong we can do things like begin to rebuild our military begin to restore America's energy dominance attend to our wide open Southern border it'll take a new president to fully reverse it but we can stop start it next week with a big smashing victory now every single time I bring you on people know I've known you for a long time and most people who listen to the show know your story but I want people to understand you grew up in Arkansas you went to Harvard undergraduate went to Harvard Law School 9 11 happened you paid off your student loans by working often to the Army you went but you didn't want to be a Jag you insisted on becoming a fighting Soldier you went to Ranger school he became a member of the 101st combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan a tour in the Old Guard uh you are have led a serious life you've written a serious book you're a serious person with a very wry sense of humor but what do Warriors see in here differently when they're actually deployed from what people like me who sit in studios and pontificate here and see and I'm speaking specifically about when you were in Iraq and listening to President Obama well he in my experience in both Iraq and Afghanistan obviously the aperture of one's Vision uh is somewhat narrowed to the battle right in front of you because as you say the stakes are deadly serious however uh it's also more focused uh on those Stakes as well so while you might not view all the news every up and down in the business world or local news when you're in a place like Iraq or Afghanistan you do pay attention to what your commander-in-chief is saying or what the secretary of defense is saying that goes from things like whether soldiers pay is going to be increase what's happening at on the home front back home basis and the matters of brand strategy you know we all knew in Iraq in 2006 that we were not winning the war that we didn't have enough troops and we're all most of the troops with whom I served are hopeful that George Bush would do what he did a few months after we left which is provide more troops with a new strategy to help us stabilize that country likewise that was in Afghanistan for the first few much of the Obama presidency unusually strident and bellicose terms about Afghanistan and the war it was immediately noticed by all the troops down to Front Line soldiers that when he took office he did not have a plan in place to immediately act upon it so much so that we began to hear from Afghans out on our patrols or in the local market the old Afghan proverb that you have the watches but we have the time everyone could tell that Obama despite his unusually bellicose campaign rhetoric was beginning to look for ways to kind of back out of Afghanistan and head for the exits in those early months of 2009 and then of course when he took his apology tour just weeks before we left country we were shocked by the president traveling around the world apologizing for America suggesting that we had to atone for supposed sins now in a unique way as a graduate of you know President Obama is a Harvard Law graduate as you are you're carrying a rifle in a war zone President Obama is off on the apology tour why did you how did that feel because you know that that's an ideologue that's not a commander-in-chief that's an ideologue spouting Ben Rhodes written nonsense The Meta MSNBC is out there feeding him lines which just doesn't match up with your reality walking point yeah well as I say in only strong Barack Obama was the most ideological president since Woodrow Wilson he's an example of what Gene Kirkpatrick famously said about the Democrats uh that blame America first Democrat and we took that tour in the spring of 2000 winter in Spring of 2009 he continued to apologize for what he viewed as America's sins remember it was on the apology tour when he denigrated American exceptionalism which most Americans hold dear saying it was no different from Greeks thinking Greece is exceptional or the British thinking Great Britain is exceptional which is really Obama's way of saying that it's just kind of an outdated an obsolete chauvinism for one zone that we should really all transcend our our petty patriotism and become what Obama declared himself in the 2008 campaign a citizen of the world so it makes a certain sense that he would go on that kind of apology tour because he is deep deeply hostile to American power and America's unique leadership role the world in fact he said as I explained not only the strong that no world order should Elevate One Nation above the other most Americans again are not ideological and they believe that it's been a very good thing to have a United states-led order that does indeed Elevate the United States above all other nations that's why we used to take pride in the term leader of the Free World for the American president a long conversation about Only the Strong I sat down last week with Senator cotton and did something I haven't done in 23 years of a radio show okay 10 segments on one book why because National Security matters more than anything else it's hard to get people to pay attention especially in a week before an election but we've got to and I want to pay attention to a concert and made alarm uh you know I'll remember a lot about Only the Strong but that's a great anecdote and what I what I was touched by is your remark that these are the greatest Patriots we have the men and women who go abroad that don't get much in the way of entertainment I thought of Gary Sinise and John androzik and the great men and women who go and show up for a day or two days and provide a little these people are everywhere around the country in the world and we forget about them Senator and you want him to make sure in Only the Strong that we don't forget that at this moment under the sea in the skies around the world American Patriots are serving in uniform thank you I start on Louis strong with a with a short story about my time in Afghanistan uh we were out in a very small uh patrol base in Meadowland and Logan Province and Eastern Afghanistan typically when you have Uso tours they stick to the big bases that are easier to secure places like Bagram and Kandahar but we had a band from Illinois called the Matt Haas band come in and join us in May of 2009 it's pretty hot when they're playing out on their outdoor basketball court uh but you can tell the troops even though necessarily their music taste didn't run to that style they really appreciated uh the musicians who came out to honor our troops just like we appreciate people like Gary Sinise and John androzik when we have almost 200 000 of our fellow Americans spread all around the world Manning the distant ramparts to keep the ravages of War away from our Shores we should always remember them hold them fast keep them in our prayers and most importantly provide them with the support and the resources and the weapons and the training they need to defend ourselves to spend their it is a terrific way to begin the book and then it's like a rocket to the right jaw when you say quote in Barack Obama's second term when this occurred American power crumbled and it did and it did for reasons that are lasting into our detriment do does anyone honestly assessed how bad President Obama until only destroy how bad maybe Robert Gates but anyone honestly stepped up and said how bad he was for the country Bob Gates is pretty tough in his Memoir about it but remember that Memoir is written in 2013 published in 2014. uh you really have to look back on Obama's tenure to see how ruinous it was for our nation but I have to tell you I don't think you would get that assessment from Barack Obama or John Kerry or any of the aides in his White House who helped design his foreign policy in fact I think he would like a American ozymandis tell Americans to look upon his works and despair uh one point I'm making Only the Strong is Barack Obama's failures are not incompetence they're not naivete they're not inexperienced they are exactly what he intended he came into office as the most ideological presence of Woodrow Wilson he wanted to lay American power low and at every turn he was ruthless about doing that just recently and effective yeah and effective very effective in pursuing this ideological agenda you know recently uh because of the protests in Iran he reflected on his failure to step forward and support the Green Revolution protest movement in the summer 2009 he said that he regretted that Hugh I don't believe it for a moment as I explained it only the strong he had a very careful thoroughly worked out lot to achieve a nuclear deal with Iran that was about much more than just their nuclear program it was about atoning what he viewed as our sins against Iran going back to the 1950s when he falsely wrongly believed that we somehow overthrew a democratically elected government and the reason he stood by in 2009 when he had the largest Uprising Iran since the revolution itself in 1979 again he wasn't caught flat-footed he wasn't naive it wasn't inexperienced he wasn't new to the job he was ruthless in pursuing his raw personal with the ayatollas and he was under yeah I was late to this recognition I I was one of the people who thought he was just an incompetent uh uh person who was who is Peter principled up to the presidency by mistake you have persuaded me um quote now I'm quoting from Tom Cotton's new book the Senator's written Only the Strong America's recent decline isn't an accident it's declined by Design I want to very quickly uh say Senator cotton is not accusing anyone of treason he's not accusing anyone of trying to destroy America from within there's no fifth column it's an ideological view of the world that views American power as bad for the world and Senator I want to just give you two minutes before we move on the next thing explain to people this ideological view it they don't hate America they hate American power it they're very different things well here as a right known as strong they don't they don't necessarily hate America they aren't necessarily Un-American though a lot of them are frankly um one thing though that is true of the democratic party almost uniformly going back to the 60s and the 70s is that they are at best at best ambivalent about America yes and certainly hostile to American power and they think not only the world but America itself would be a better place if we would atone for our sins if we would pull in our horns if we'd become something more like a normal Nation as opposed to the exceptional nation that most Americans grew up living in and still want America to be not only for the world but first and foremost for ourselves for our own safety for our own freedom for our own prosperity and that it's just alien to the way Democrats think I mean I defy you to name a single Democrat over the last 50 years who has been unabashedly unashamedly proud of America in the way that Ronald Reagan was in his rhetoric about our country and our history and our future anyone who takes up that challenge will not be able to meet it tomorrow we will continue with our conversation with Senator cotton about his brand new book Only the Strong as we get into the heart of it and the ideological soul of the left when it comes to American power go to amazon.com right now get Only the Strong buy a bunch of copies give them to your friends get smart National Security matters it especially matters next Tuesday thank you Senator we'll talk to you tomorrow

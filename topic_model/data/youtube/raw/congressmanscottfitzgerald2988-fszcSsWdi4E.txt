for more on this let's welcome back wisconsin congressman and member of the small business committee scott fitzgerald uh congressman good morning happy friday to you good to see you good to see you rob good to be with you again um i'm i'm wondering what you make of the the president and his team they wanted to get in front of what they thought was going to be a bad report the report was worse no one thought it was going to be over 9 the white house releasing a statement a day ago addressing high inflation basically saying that this does not take into account the fact that gas prices have gone down by 40 cents over the last 30 days thus these numbers are not accurate i thought it was bizarre because they're basically saying look june didn't happen you didn't just live through the month of june and a 40 cent decline in prices while good news we're still at 460 a gallon that's the national average nowhere near 239 where we were uh when joe biden took the oath of office yeah that's right i mean it's he's basically telling the american public kind of adjust to the pain level i you know get get ready because we're actually not going to address the problem directly uh which which is what i'm hearing back in the district right now i mean if you you know you've got to go back to 1981 to see inflation at this level uh you know i was a senior in high school and look at me i'm an old guy now right so i i i think of many people out there especially when i'm talking to constituents they are really trying to make an adjustment right now and along with that a lot of light manufacturers who have been struggling now for the last year are just starting to feel the pressure of inflation so i think everyone assumed that you know as soon as the number hit and as soon as we started to see this increase that everyone had already kind of experienced it and we're working our way through it that's not the case when it comes to manufacturing there's a lag time there yeah congressman i've got notes and emails from viewers that remember living through jimmy carter's america they remember buying their first house when uh in april of 1980 inflation hit a high of 14.6 percent uh we're not there yet but we're 10 months into 9.1 matches where we were 10 months into ronald reagan's first term we were in the middle of a recession people forget they think about the 80s and they think about go go america uh the first two years of reagan's presidency were rough because we were trying to break out of jimmy carter's america um how long does it take us to break out of this well that's the thing i you know when you talk to anyone that certainly within the banking industry and a lot i have been speaking to a lot of community bankers i mean what they're concerned about is there is some institutional history there on where they were back in in the early 80s and and you know how do you tell a couple in their 30s uh you know you're going to be paying somewhere around 14 15 16 interest on a mortgage which means you're basically paying the principal on a monthly basis you're not you're not you're not having any effect uh at all on the overall mortgage itself i mean those are the real things that i think are kind of staring down the pike at us right now that people are going to have to adjust to yeah people are going to vote people on fixed incomes and 401ks are going to vote based on what's happening in the economy the new york times of the poll earlier this week most important problem facing the country one and two the economy and inflation um congressman just want to get your reaction to the president's uh trip he's going to leave israel today head to saudi arabia what's the most important thing for him to accomplish while he's in saudi arabia you know uh proceed cautiously uh we we have concerns i think about uh not only the dynamic that you know suddenly he has seen the light and he's trying to do something about energy prices in the middle east but uh you know i i've heard mike pompeo kind of deliver the message numerous times that this is about stability in the middle east and he could have a real effect on that if he doesn't handle this correctly quite honestly i wish he was not over there i don't trust this president i don't trust his ability to actually deal with uh negotiation at this level so i'm very very cautious very nervous about what's going on over there right now wow um amazing to hear you say that congressman yeah we had stability in the middle east and here by the way 18 short months ago a lot's changed congressman fitzgerald good to see you have a great weekend thanks rob thank you thank you

  UNDER THE SPEAKER'S ANNOUNCED  POLICY OF JANUARY 3, 2019, THE   GENTLEMAN FROM ARKANSAS, MR.   WESTERMAN, IS RECOGNIZED UNTIL   10:00 P.M. AS THE DESIGNEE OF THE MINORITY  LEADER.  MR. WESTERMAN: THANK YOU, MR.  SPEAKER. I ASK UNANIMOUS CONSENT THAT ALL MEMBERS MAY HAVE FIVE  LEGISLATIVE DAYS IN WHICH TO   REVISE AND EXTEND THEIR REMARKS  AND INCLUDE EXTRANEOUS MATERIAL  ON THE TOPIC OF THIS SPECIAL   ORDER. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: WITHOUT OBJECTION. MR. WESTERMAN: FIRES ARE   RAVAGING THE WEST. I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT  ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON WITH HE  FIRES AN I WANT TO TALK AST  WHAT'S NOT GOING ON HERE IN  CONGRESS.  START WITH, I JUST WANT TO TAKE  A QUICK LOOK AT THE SCIENCE OF   FIRE.  THIS FIRE TRIANGLE SHOWS THREE   THINGS ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE A  FIRE.  YOU HAVE TO HAVE FUEL, HEAT AND  OXYGEN.  THERE'S A LOT OF TALK ABOUT WHAT THE ROLE CLIMATE CHANGE IS   PLAYING IN THESE FIRES.  CLIMATE, INCREASING  TEMPERATURES, CAN DRY FUEL.  GETS WINDY, YOU CAN HAVE MORE OX YEN. LIKE NING CAN BE ONE OF THE  THINGS TO LIGHT FIRES. A LOT OF FIRES OBVIOUSLY ARE   IGNITED BY MANMADE WAYS. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT PUTTING OUT   FIRE, THE FIRST THING WE DO IS   TRY TO GET THE FUEL OUT OF THE   WAY OR WE USE WATER TO COOL THE  FIRE AN REMOVE THE OXYGEN. BUT WE HAVE TO SPEND WAY TOO   MUCH TIME WORKING ON   EXTINGUISHING FIRES WHEN WE  COULD TAKE THE ACTIONS TO REDUCE THE FUEL TO REDUCE THE FIRES.  ANY TIME I TALK ABOUT FOREST   MANAGEMENT, I GET ACCUSED OF   WANTING TO CLEAR CUT THE   NATIONAL FOREST. I CAN PROMISE YOU THE LAST THING I WANT TO DO IS CLEAR CUT THE  NATIONAL FOREST. I WANT TO USE GOOD MANAGEMENT ON THE NATIONAL FOREST. THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING.  BUT I OFTEN WONDER IF THOSE  PEOPLE THAT TALK ABOUT CLEAR   CUTTING EVEN HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT  A CLEAR CUT IS.  I PUT THIS CHART TOGETHER THAT   SHOWS COMPARISON BETWEEN A CLEAR CUT AND A CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE. I'LL GO ON THE RECORD AND SAY  THE CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES ARE   WORSE THAN CLEARCUTS.  LOOK AT THE DATA.  DURING A CLEAR CUT THE TREES ARE KILLED.  DURING A CATASTROPHIC WILE FIRE  THE TREES ARE KILLED.  DURING A CLEAR CUT, THE TREES  ARE REMOVED. DURING A WILD FIRE YOU'RE LEFT   WITH DEAD SNAGS THAT COULD BE  FUEL FOR WILDFIRES.  AT LEAST IN A CLEAR CUT YOU  LEAVE THE  THEY ARE PROTECTED.  YOU LEAVE PROTECTION AROUND THE  STREAMS. AND SOLAR ORGANIC MATERIALS ARE  BURNED UP. SPECIAL CARE IS TAKEN TO PROTECT THE SOIL.  WHEN A CLEAR CUT IS PLANNED, IT  IS ALSO IN PLACE.  OFF EP ON CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE  THERE IS NO REFORESTATION. AND CLEAR CUT, IT IS UNPLAPPED.  AND THE CLEAR CUT IN CALIFORNIA, LESS THAN 20 ACRES.  WILDFIRES ARE HUGE BURNING   MILLIONS OF ACRES. WE HAVE BURPT 8 MILLION ACRES IN THE U.S. AND CONTINUE GOING DOWN THE LIST AND TALKING ABOUT   CARBON, AT LEAST WITH A  CLEARCUT, THE WILDFIRE, YOU  RELEASEING THE DEAD SNAGS ARE  NOT JUST RELEASING CARBON DIE  OBJECTION I'D BUT METH APRIL   WHICH IS THE WORST.  CLEARCUTTING IS NOT SOMETHING WE WANT TO DO ON THE NATIONAL   FOREST BUT PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT  ALLOWING GOOD FOREST MAMMINGMENT ARE DOING MUCH MORE DEVASTATING  BY ALLOWING THESE WILDFIRES TO   CONTINUE UNABATED. THIS IS AN EXAMPLE.  THIS IS THE AND GOREA FIRE.  NATURAL CLEARCUT.  THIS IS 12 YEARS LATER AND NO  REGROWTH ON THE SITE.  ON TOP OF THAT, ACCORDING TO THE U SMPGMPSMP, THE CARBON  EMISSIONS RELEASED THE SAME  AMOUNT OF CARBON AS THE  EMISSIONS THAT WOULD BE PRODUCED TO POWER CALIFORNIA FOR A WHOLE  YEAR.  MR. SPEAKER, WE NEED TO TAKE   ACTION.  IT'S NOT THAT THE FOREST SERVICE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO MALING THE   LAPPED BUT ALLOWED ACTIVISTS AND LAWYERS RATHER THAN THE  PROFESSIONALS. IF WE DON'T WANT TO SEE THE SAME THINGS REPEATING WITH LOSS OF  LIFE AND PROPERTY AND LOSS OF  THE RESOURCE THAT PULLS CASH BOP DIOXIDE,

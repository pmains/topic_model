SUPPORTIVE. >> WITH US NOW, CALIFORNIA  SENATOR ALEX PADILLA WHO SITS ON THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. IT'S ALWAYS A PLEASURE TO SEE  YOU. WHAT DO YOU HOPE WILL COME OUT  OF TODAY'S HEARING? >> GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN, JOSE. YES, IN A FEW MINUTES I WILL BE  REJOINING THAT HEARING MYSELF. LOOK, I THINK WE NEED TO  CONTINUE THE MOMENTUM AND  CONTINUE THE PUSH TO ADVANCE  SMART GUN SAFETY LAWS IN AMERICA THAT WILL HELPTECT NOT JUST  THE GENERAL POPULATION, BUT  ESPECIALLY OUR CHILDREN. TO THINK THAT THE TRAGEDY IN  UVALDE, TEXAS, RIGHT ON THE  HEELS OF OTHER MASS SHOOTINGS IN THE COUNTRY, TO SEE THE IMAGES  OF ELEMENTARY SCHOOL STUDENTS  WHO DIDN'T HAVE TO DIE, SHOULD  BRING ANYBODY TO TEARS AND  SHOULD BRING CONGRESS TO ACT. WE'RE ON THE VERGE OF THAT. AS WITH ANY BIG DEAL THAT  HAPPENS, IT'S GOING TO BE WAY  TOO MUCH FOR SOME PEOPLE AND NOT ENOUGH FOR OTHERS. OH, HOW I WISH WE WERE BANNING  ASSAULT WEAPONS IN THIS PROCESS  OR BANNING LARGE CAPACITY  MAGAZINES IN THIS PROCESS. BUT IF WE CAN BY STATES ADOPT  THESE RED FLAG WARNING LAWS THAT HAVE PROVEN HELPFUL IN STATES  THAT HAVE THEM, IF WE CAN INVEST SIGNIFICANTLY IN MENTAL HEALTH  AND MORE, THEN IT'S ABSOLUTELY  WORTH DOING.  >> AND THE FACT THAT SENATOR  McCONNELL SAYS HE SUPPORTS THAT  BIPARTISAN FRAMEWORK, IT'S JUST  A FRAMEWORK RIGHT NOW, IT'S  STILL IN THE PROCESS OF BEING  WRITTEN, HOW -- THIS WOULD BE  SIGNIFICANT IN THAT I GUESS WHAT THE LAST TIME THERE WAS ANY  MOVEMENT ON IT WAS WHEN BILL  CLINTON WAS IN THE WHITE HOUSE? >> EXACTLY. IT'S BEEN DECADES. AND, YOU KNOW, FOR THE LAST  DECADE SINCE SANITY HOOK  ELEMENTARY IN CONNECTICUT, OUR  HEARTS HAVE BEEN BROKEN TIME AND AGAIN AFTER SHOOTING AFTER  SHOOTING. I AM CONFIDENT THAT WE WILL GET  TO THE FINISH LINE HERE. I KNOW IT'S JUST A FRAMEWORK  NOW, AS IT SHOULD BE. THE CONCEPTS AND THE OUTLINE IS  ONE THING. ONCE YOU GET IT TO SPECIFIC  LANGUAGE, WE'LL SEE THE FINAL  DETAILS. BUT IN TALKING TO BOTH MY  DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES,  PARTICULARLY SENATOR MURPHY WHO  HAS BEEN LEAD ON THESE  NEGOTIATIONS, HE, LIKE MYSELF,  NOT JUST A SENATOR BUT A FATHER  OF YOUNG KIDS, VERY PASSIONATE  ABOUT THIS, BUT ALSO MANY  CONVERSATIONS BY REPUBLICAN  COLLEAGUES INCLUDING SENATOR  CORNYN WHO SORT OF WAS TAPPED BY MITCH McCONNELL TO LEAD  NEGOTIATIONS ON THE REPUBLICAN  SIDE, I DO THINK THERE'S A TRUE  COMMITMENT HERE AND I DO THINK  THERE'S GOOD FAITH HERE. IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYBODY IS ON  THE SAME PAGE. WE JUST NEED TO SEE THE FINAL  LANGUAGE AND GET IT SCHEDULED  FOR A FLOOR VOTE, WHICH LEADER  SCHUMER HAS COMMITTED.  >> AND SENATOR, AS YOU KNOW,  BETTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE, TODAY  MARKS TEN YEARS SINCE PRESIDENT  OBAMA CREATED THE DACA PROGRAM  THAT HAS TEMPORARILY PROTECTED  HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF  UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS WHO CAME TO THIS COUNTRY WHEN THEY WERE  CHILDREN AND KNOW NO OTHER  COUNTRY BUT OURS. ALLOWS THEM TO LIVE, WORK AND  STUDY IN THE U.S. YOU CAME FROM A PRESS CONFERENCE TALKING ABOUT THE ANNIVERSARY. WHAT'S YOUR MESSAGE? >> MY MESSAGE IS SORT OF MIXED. ON THE ONE HAND WE CELEBRATE TEN YEARS OF DACA PROTECTIONS, WHICH HAVE ALLOWED HUNDREDS OF  THOUSANDS OF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE  TO PROSPER IN AMERICA. THEY'VE EXCELLED IN SCHOOL AND  IN THE WORKPLACE. MANY ARE WORKING IN JOBS THAT  THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS  DEEMED ESSENTIAL THROUGHOUT THE  COVID-19 PANDEMIC. BUT THE TRAGEDY IS, CONGRESS HAS FAILED TO ACT, HAS FAILED TO  CODIFY THESE PROTECTIONS INTO  FEDERAL LAW, LET ALONE ADVANCE  MORE COMPREHENSIVE MODERNIZATION OF OUR IMMIGRATION LAWS, AND TO  THINK THAT SO MANY OF THESE DACA RESIP PENTS LIVE IN LIMBO, DACA  HAS BEEN CHALLENGED TIME AND  AGAIN BY REPUBLICANS AND OTHER  CONSERVATIVES, THERE'S PENDING  LITIGATION THAT WILL DETERMINE  WHETHER THESE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO  HAVE -- WHO ARE COMPLETELY  AMERICANS BY THE WAY, EXCEPT FOR ONE PIECE OF PAPER, WILL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO LIVE IN THE  UNITED STATES, CONTRIBUTE TO THE SUCCESS OF OUR COUNTRY, OR FACE  A TOUGH DECISION OF WHETHER TO  GO BACK INTO THE SHADOWS OR HAVE TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY.  >> SO SENATOR, WHY CAN'T WHAT  DEALING WITH DACA BE WHAT WE'RE  JUST SEEING WITH THE ISSUE OF GUNS? WHY CAN'T THERE BE A BIPARTISAN  GROUP OF SENATORS THAT CAN GET  TOGETHER AND WORK ON A FRAMEWORK ON THIS? YOU ALWAYS, IT'S SO IMPORTANT  THAT I KIND OF UNDERLINE, THAT  YOU ARE ALWAYS -- IT'S SUCH AN  IMPORTANT POINT TO MENTION THAT  THERE IS THE CRISIS, THE  HUMANITARIAN CRISIS AT THE  BORDER, AND THEN THERE IS  IMMIGRATION IN OUR COUNTRY. I KNOW YOU ALWAYS SEPARATE THOSE TWO AS NEEDS TO BE SEPARATED,  BUT SENATOR, WHY CAN'T THERE BE  SOME BIPARTISAN GROUP TALKING  ABOUT THIS? >> LOOK, I'M HOPEFUL, AND THERE  ARE BIPARTISAN DISCUSSIONS  HAPPENING LITERALLY AS WE SPEAK. WE TRIED LAST YEAR  UNSUCCESSFULLY. WE KNOW WE WERE LOOKING AT THE  BUILD BACK BETTER PACKAGE AND  THE RECONCILIATION PROCESS AS A  WAY TO ADVANCE IMMIGRATION  REFORMS. WE'VE PLEADED WITH THE WHITE  HOUSE TO USE THEIR EXECUTIVE  AUTHORITY. A RECENT HEARING IN THE  JUDICIARY SUBCOMMITTEE I CHAIR  REOPENED THESE BIPARTISAN  CONVERSATIONS. WE HAD A HEARING ABOUT TWO  MONTHS AGO SPECIFICALLY ON  DOCUMENTED DREAMERS THAT BROUGHT REPUBLICANS BACK TO THE TABLE. WE JUST HAD ANOTHER HEARING  YESTERDAY SORT OF HIGHLIGHTING  THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF  IMMIGRANTS ON WORKFORCE AND THE  ECONOMY. RIGHT. PRIOR SEGMENTS YOU'RE TALKING  ABOUT INFLATION IN AMERICA,  WHICH EVERY FAMILY IS FEELING,  ECONOMISTS, BUSINESS LEADERS ARE POINTING TO A LABOR SHORTAGE AS  A KEY CONTRIBUTOR TO HIGHER  PRICES AND A SIGNIFICANT  NTRIBUTOR TO THE LABOR  ORTAGE I  IMMIGRATION SYSTEM. ALL THE REASONS ARE THERE. REPUBLICANS ARE TALKING US TO  ONCE AGAIN, AND THE BOTTOM LINE  IS, IT'S BEEN TEN YEARS AND  WE'RE NOT GIVING UP UNTIL WE GET THIS DONE.  >> SENATOR ALEX PADILLA, ALWAY

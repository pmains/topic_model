for one minute mr. Chairman I rise today in support of the Western water and American food security act the Obama administration is exacerbated drought conditions in the West by putting the demands of extremists special interest groups ahead of hard-working American families for example federal regulations and environmental lawsuits have allowed for hundreds of billions of gallons of water to be diverted into the San Francisco Bay in order to protect a three inch fish hmm this has had a dramatic impact killing thousands of jobs harming our food supply and leading to unemployment levels as high as 40 percent in some communities HR 2898 is a balanced approach for combating drought conditions in the West protects private water rights and prohibits federal takings this legislation streamlines a federal permitting process and will increase water storage capacity American families are hurting in the West and need some relief HR 28 98 will help ensure a reliable water supply for our citizens and nation AG producers I urge adoption of this community common-sense bill and with that I yield back gentleman from Arizona

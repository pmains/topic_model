LET'S TURN NOW TO A MEMBER OF THE PANEL INVESTIGATING JANUARY 6 ATTACK. HE IS REPRESENTATIVE ADAM OF CALIFORNIA. HE IS ONE OF SEVEN DEMOCRATS ON THE COMMITTEE AND I SPOKE WITH HIM MOMENTS AGO. CONGRESSMAN SCHIFF, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. WHAT DO YOU THINK TODAY'S HEARING MAINLY ACCOMPLISHED? REP. SCHIFF: I THINK IT SHOWED THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT AFTER TRUMP LOST THE ELECTION, AFTER HE LOST IN THE COURTS, HE AND OTHERS COOKED UP THIS SCHEME TO TRY TO GET THE VICE PRESIDENT TO OVERTURN THE ELECTION, TO VIOLATE HIS CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY, AND THEY PUT THIS MASSIVE PRESSURE ON HIM TO DO SO. THE PRESIDENT WHIPPED UP HIS SUPPORTERS TO THE POINT OF VIOLENCE ON JANUARY 6, PUTTING THE LIFE OF HIS OWN VICE PRESIDENT, SOMEONE WHO HAD BEEN LOYAL AND DUTIFUL TO HIM FOR FOUR YEARS, PUT HIS LIFE IN DANGER. VICE PRESIDENT PENCE DID HIS JOB. HE UPHELD HIS CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY. AND WE ARE FORTUNATE HE DID. IT WAS YET ANOTHER PLOT BY THE PRESIDENT TO TRY TO INTERFERE WITH A PEACEFUL TRANSFER OF POWER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OUR HISTORY. JUDY: TO THE EXTENT ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL GOALS OF THE COMMITTEE IS TO TIE THE PRESIDENT DIRECTLY TO THE ATTACK ON THE CAPITAL, DO YOU THINK YOU HAVE DONE THAT? REP. SCHIFF: I THINK WE HAVE CERTAINLY. IN TERMS OF THE PRESSURE AGAINST THE VICE PRESIDENT AND HOW THAT MANIFESTS ITSELF IN VIOLENCE ON THE SIX, WE PLAYED THOSE CLIPS OF PROTESTERS, INSURRECTIONISTS, OUTSIDE THE CAPITAL, TALKING ABOUT WHY THEY WERE MARCHING ON THE CAPITOL, AND THE VIOLENCE THEY WERE GOING TO DO, CHANTING "HANG MIKE PENCE." THIS IS WHAT MOTIVATED THE CROWD, EVEN AMIDST THIS MAYHEM, THE PRESIDENT WEEDING OUT THAT PENS HAD LACKED THE COURAGE TO DO THE RIGHT THING. INSTEAD OF TELLING PEOPLE TO DISPERSE AND GO HOME, THE PRESIDENT MERELY TALKED -- AT THE END OF THE DAY, TALKED ABOUT HOW MUCH HE LOVED THESE PEOPLE THAT HAD ASCENDED UP ON THEM ALL THAT DAY. I THINK WE DEMONSTRATED QUITE GRAPHICALLY THE PRESIDENT'S ROLE IN INSTIGATING THAT VIOLENCE DIRECTED AT HIS OWN VICE PRESIDENT. JUDY: I'M ASKING IN PART BECAUSE LAST WEEK, REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN, JIM BANKS, WHO AS YOU KNOW HAD BEEN CHOSEN BY THE HOUSE MINORITY LEADER TO SERVE ON THE COMMITTEE, BUT THEN WAS REJECTED, HE TOLD THE NEWSHOUR THAT WHAT THE COMMITTEE HAS BEEN DOING SO FAR, IN HIS WORDS, IS SELECTIVELY EDITING INTERVIEWS AND VIDEOS. THIS WAS BEFORE TODAY'S HEARING. BUT HE SAID AT THAT POINT, THERE HAS BEEN NO EVIDENCE THE PRESIDENT DIRECTED THE ATTACK. HE QUOTED THE PRESIDENT AS SAYING AT THE RALLY, ON JANUARY 6, TELLING PEOPLE "TO PATRIOTICALLY AND PEACEFULLY MAKE YOUR VOICE HEARD." REP. SCHIFF: YOU LOOK AT THE FOOTAGE OF THAT RALLY, AND YOU SEE HOW THE PRESIDENT IS INCITING THAT CROWD. IT DOES NOT LOOK ANYTHING LIKE PEACEFUL, AND OF COURSE, AS WE WILL DISPLAY IN LATER HEARINGS, WE WILL SEE WHAT THE PRESIDENT WAS DOING DURING THAT VIOLENCE AND WHAT HE WAS NOT DOING. AS THE VICE CHAIR OF OUR COMMITTEE ALREADY INDICATED IN TERMS OF FUTURE HEARINGS, THAT THE PRESIDENT SEEMED TO BE PLEASED BY WHAT HE WAS SEEING. MR. BANKS OPPOSED THE FORMATION OF AN INDEPENDENT COMMISSION TO LOOK INTO THESE EVENTS. NOW HE IS COMPLAINING THAT WE HAVE A SELECT COMMITTEE DOING SO. WE HAVE INTERVIEWED OVER 1000 PEOPLE, SO WE ARE NOT ABLE TO PUBLISH ALL OF THAT TESTIMONY. ULTIMATELY, WE WILL. JUDY: CONGRESSMAN BANKS AND OTHER REPUBLICANS, I KNOW YOU KNOW THIS, THEY ARE NOW CHARGING THAT THE COMMITTEE HAS BEEN CAUGHT ALTERING EVIDENCE. HE POINTED OUT, HE SAID THE COMMITTEE "DOCTORED AND ALTERED TEXT MESSAGES" BETWEEN JIM JORDAN AND MARK MEADOWS, THE FORMER PRESIDENT'S CHIEF OF STAFF. I WONDER WHAT HE WAS REFERRING TO, A TEXT MESSAGE YOU MADE PUBLIC A FEW MONTHS AGO, BETWEEN JORDAN AND MEADOWS, AND THE FTS WEEK -- THE ACCUSATION IS THERE WAS A PORTION USED RATHER THAN THE ENTIRE MESSAGE WHICH TOOK IT OUT OF CONTEXT. REP. SCHIFF: I THINK THAT WAS DEBUNKED MONTHS AGO, WHEN HE FIRST MADE THAT ARGUMENT WE DISPLAYED WITH THE FULL MESSAGES WERE. THESE ARE PRETTY WEAK ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE COMPELLING EVIDENCE THAT WE HAVE BEEN SHOWING. HE DOES NOT REALLY HAVE AN ANSWER TO THIS VOLUME OF TESTIMONY AND VIDEO EVIDENCE THAT DISPLAYED THE PRESIDENT'S ROLE IN THE SCHEME. IF THAT IS THE BEST HE CAN DO, IF THAT IS THE BEST THE REPUBLICANS CAN DO FROM THE SIDELINES, IT IS PRETTY WEAK INDIE. JUDY: THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE, LATE THIS AFTERNOON, CONGRESSMAN BENNIE THOMPSON, TOLD REPORTERS THE COMMITTEE HAS NOW EXTENDED AN INVITATION TO GINNI THOMAS, THE WIFE OF THE SUPREME COURT JUSTICE, CLARENCE THOMAS, TO COME AND TALK WITH THE COMMITTEE. WHEN WAS THAT INVITATION -- WHEN DID THAT GO OUT, AND HAS SHE RESPONDED? REP. SCHIFF: THAT INVITATION WENT OUT QUITE RECENTLY. WHAT I UNDERSTAND, AND THIS IS JUST PUBLIC REPORTING, IS THAT SHE INDICATED PUBLICLY, YOU WOULD KNOW BETTER THAN I, THAT SHE WAS RECEPTIVE TO SPEAKING TO THE COMMITTEE. I ONLY HAVE THAT FROM PUBLIC SOURCES, AND CAN'T CONFIRM THAT MYSELF. WE HOPE SHE WILL COME IN. WE CERTAINLY HAVE A NUMBER OF AREAS WE WOULD LIKE TO COVER WITH HER. ANY WITNESS THAT HAS KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THIS PLOT TO OVERTURN THE ELECTION OR WAS IN CONTACT WITH THOSE WORKING ON THAT PLOT, WE WANT TO TALK TO. JUDY: THERE HAS BEEN REPORTING SHE WAS IN REGULAR CONTACT WITH JOHN EASTMAN, THE FORMER PRESIDENT'S LEGAL ADVISOR WHO WAS OF COURSE -- HIS NAME CAME UP A LOT TODAY. IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT TO SPEAK WITH HER ABOUT? REP. SCHIFF: THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS WE WANT TO SPEAK WITH HER ABOUT. PREDOMINANTLY, THAT CAME UP DURING THE COURSE OF OUR DISCOVERY OF DOCUMENTS, IN PART, SOME OF THOSE THAT MR. EASTMAN TRIED TO WITHHOLD FROM THE COMMITTEE. THE FEDERAL JUDGE IN CALIFORNIA, I BELIEVE SOME OF THE DOCUMENTS PROVIDED TO OUR COMMITTEE, COULD NOT BE PROTECTED BY ANY PRIVILEGE BECAUSE THE JUDGE FOUND THEY INDICATED A CRIMINAL PLOT, LIKELY VIOLATING MULTIPLE LAWS INVOLVING BOTH MR. EASTMAN AND DONALD TRUMP. JUDY: DO YOU HAVE EVIDENCE THAT SHE WAS IN CONTACT WITH, ON ANY KIND OF BASIS, JOHN EASTMAN, TO DISCUSS THIS PLOT THAT YOU ARE DESCRIBING? REP. SCHIFF: AT THIS POINT, I'M NOT PREPARED TO GO INTO ANYTHING THE DOCUMENTS OR OTHER EVIDENCE MIGHT SAY OR SUGGEST. IT IS ONE OF THE REASONS WE WANT TO BRING HER INTO TALK, AND HOPEFULLY WE WILL BE ABLE TO DO THAT SOON. JUDY: ARE THERE OTHER INDIVIDUALS THE COMMITTEE IS REACHING OUT TO STILL AT THIS HOUR, HOPING TO HAVE THEM COME TESTIFY? REP. SCHIFF: ABSOLUTELY. AT THE END OF THE HEARING TODAY, CHAIRMAN THOMPSON MADE AN APPEAL TO -- APPEAL AGAIN TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD EVIDENCE WHO ARE WEIGHING TO COME IN TO LET THE COMMITTEE KNOW. INDEED, WE CONTINUE TO DO INTERVIEWS, WE CONTINUE TO DO DEPOSITIONS, BECAUSE FRANKLY, ONE LEAD LEADS TO ANOTHER. THERE ARE OFTEN QUESTIONS WE WANT TO GO BACK TO WITNESS FOR FURTHER CLARIFICATION. THAT INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS CONTINUES. JUDY: CONGRESSMAN ADAM SCHIFF WHO IS A MEMBER OF THE HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON JANUAR

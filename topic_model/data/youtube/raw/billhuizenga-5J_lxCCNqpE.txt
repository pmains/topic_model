parts of Asia because of possible al-qaeda related threats to diplomatic posts worldwide that's what American officials are telling NBC News and the US has been appraised of information that out of an abundance of caution and care for our employees and others who might be visiting the installations indicates that they should institute these precautionary steps that means they're shutting down the embassies for the immediate future anyway United States congressman bill Huizenga the Republican from West Michigan on the other end of our AT&T line thank you for being available this morning a MPs good being with you but you know anything about this well I mean just what we've been seeing on the on the news and obviously it just demonstrates and underscores how dangerous for world we live in I'm going to be meeting with with someone who is residing he's from the US here but he resides in the Middle East a little later today happened to have that scheduled and it's going to be one of our discussion points just trying to find out really what what is the mood over there but obviously we're we're at war yet and we can't forget that is it the kind of thing you know when you're in Congress and you're in the Michigan delegation you could call over to say Mike Rogers office it sees a chair of intelligence committee and say you know what do I need to know about this does that is that sort of collegial back and forth happen yeah it does happen you know and obviously we have to be careful where we where we have some discussions whether things are classified or not but just you know being able to have a relationship like that to touch base and say hey what what do we need to know about this and it is extremely helpful there's no like Washington DC cone of silence you too can stand under you remember Maxwell Smart maybe you're too young yeah yeah no it is called the Intel room though so we we in all seriousness we we we do go in there for briefings on a fairly regular basis and it's you know all your cell phones are taken away all that stuff you can't take notes you just go in and you know ask questions and interact a better idea of what's happening around the world better idea of what's happening with the Affordable Care Act is sort of back in the news again dave Camp the congressman from Michigan he's got growing concerns about the implementation of key parts of the measure here's what he said this law is becoming increasingly unfair unworkable and untenable for Americans which is three months left patients doctors and hardworking taxpayers will have more questions and answers you know he's chair lays and Means Committee sander Levin the Michigan Democrat says you Republicans are just obsessed with the health care law the Republican mission is clear don't implement destroy yeah well on the heels of all that now we hear the jobs report is coming out today and it's going to be down from the jobs created in June and according to some of the economists employers are being very careful to hire part-time workers instead of full-time workers because they don't want to have to you know get over 50 and provide the health care and they think the insurance costs are going to be higher with the implementation of the law your thoughts ya know and there's so many question marks out there and this is the same administration that just announced that they wanted to delay the employer mandate a year don't like the idea that we have which we thought applied to individuals as well yeah I can tell you this this hit home when my nephew came came home he's in college and he came home and said well they just made the announcement at the restaurant that nobody's going to be working over 29 hours and that that is whacked him it's hit you know families and single moms and a bunch of other people that are trying to do this and you're absolutely right now the people that are our job creators are in the pause button right now because there's so much uncertainty and you know this I gotta pass it to find out what's in it stuff has not worked and yes I am obsessed with trying to fix this we should because even Max Baucus one of the authors has said that this has been a train wreck and implementation is grand haven in your district yeah okay Grand Haven this is in the news this morning too they're bringing back ten teachers who were laid off in June guess why because they push back the you know the implementation of the Affordable Care Act so they were allowed to you know they were capable than to bringing them back in i knows thing that is that stunning and those are the kind of fresh writing things that you see it repeatedly though in different areas I hadn't heard this one particularly in education but we're going to be checking that one out that that uncertainty and and in the cost that this is going to be bringing on to employers whether they're public sector like that with the schools or private sector it's just going to collapse under its own weight and in my friends across the aisle just simply are blind to it apparently Michael Eppley Neil that story to your office so you can get a look at where we got it from retro source news this morning at that see that's why I get on MPs in the morning so I can get my news this is great well that's why we like to have you for reaction it's a nice symbiotic relationship is that's right that is good I see that John Conyers the Democrat from Michigan congressman was the only one to vote against the deal that will roll back the interest rate on the student loans I wonder what my he voted against it I have no idea I've quit trying to figure out some of my colleagues motivations but this is this makes sense it was something that the administration and the Senate didn't want to do but the the house went out on a limb created a solution rather than creating a problem which was happening with these interest rates skyrocketing for kids that are starting starting school this fall and the Senate and its wisdom saw that we were on the right path they did a few little minor changes it came back to us we agreed and then the president's going to be signing it so you know this this is good for families and good for students what is the path act that path act this came out of the Financial Services Committee it's the dealing with with our with our mortgage situation the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac who are in charge of sort of packaging all of all of the mortgages that are out there desperately need to be to be reformed and what's been happening is this boom and bust cycle that has been happening in housing over over decades really and it's one of the things that brought this last financial crisis certainly the housing part of that financial crisis so this is this is a bill of proposed solution that will phase out the broken system of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac it'll go back and if anybody has gone in as a first-time homebuyer or low income home buyer they may have used the FHA loan FHA back when I was selling real estate I sold real estate when I had gotten out of school and was before I got into in the political world I did real estate sales full-time you know FHA accounted for somewhere around ten maybe fifteen percent of all the deals right now they're in the eighty to ninety percent of all home purchases or FHA and we need to give back to central core and then the other thing it does is that it helps try to pull in private capital into the system which we desperately need as well so 30-year mortgages are going to exist we think that there's going to be flexibility for people when they're going in and getting their mortgages and it's a good thing ok stay in close touch good to hear your voice today got it all right take care of yet congressman bill Huizenga from

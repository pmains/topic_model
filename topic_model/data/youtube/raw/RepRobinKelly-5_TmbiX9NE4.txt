[Music] [Music] i was telling some folks a story earlier that uh my first day of class i walked into a biology class and i saw the black woman professor uh stride in and that was the first time i'd ever seen a black professor this was my you know i had been in college for a couple of years and she looked down at us and she said this is biology class such and such and those of you who have your books you're prepared to work you may stay those of you who do not have your books you are not prepared you may leave and there was a shuffling of feet and i looked around and i was the only one left in the class wow and she looked at me and she said you're going to need a lab partner for this class so she sat down next to me and we did that lab together and we are still friends to this day [Applause] well here's what i'll say and i know i congresswoman kelly will back me up on this so everyone in the room young or old should know who your elected official is now most of you are already involved and engaged because you're here today at this event by congresswoman robin kelly but our elected officials need our help right they need to know what we care about and what we are passionate about and so i would say that's how you start your career in advocacy and it doesn't have to be about health you could uh care about something in the school system you could care about green spaces in your community walkable sidewalks so whatever you're passionate about talk to your elected official let them know and i walk downtown to the law office and there are you know eight people in the room everything's all set and they're like oh hi you can come in and we're just going to wait until dr green gets here for the closing because we were closing on a couple million dollar loan and um i said i am dr green good morning let's get we can get started it was such a pause in the room and this was just two years ago that you could feel that they were like oh okay i see even as a student what um black people go through in the medical system and how the lack of adequate treatment that we receive and a lot of it has to do with a lack of cultural competence competence competence but i say that all just to say for the young women who are aspiring to be a physician that don't give up persevere and you belong [Music] you

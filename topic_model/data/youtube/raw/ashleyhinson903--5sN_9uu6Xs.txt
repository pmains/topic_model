well good Friday morning everyone welcome to another edition of hot seat with Henson I'm congresswoman Ashley Hinson thank you so much for joining us here um we have a very special candidate with us this morning and a great friend of mine state Senator Don Driscoll she is running for reelection into the newly redrawn Senate District 46 which includes uh Iowa and Johnson counties parts of those counties so uh Dawn good morning to you I know it's a very busy time for you and your family with Harvest and and all the the animals that you have you are in agriculture uh Guru so um thanks for joining us could you tell everyone a little bit more about you uh and about your race in the district uh good morning Ashley thank you so much for having me on I am so glad I have the opportunity to visit with you a little bit this morning glad you're feeling better and uh yes my race it is uh it is it is going to be a tough one but I you know I will have Senate District 46 is Washington County Iowa County and the rural Johnson County so uh a little bit about myself is uh I am a family farmer my husband and I we have a corn and soybean operation here we are in the heat of of harvest right now uh yesterday we also have a cow calf operation and yesterday was I always think it's the best day of the fall when we take our uh our cows and put them out on corn stock we've got um corn harvested that we make in other fields and they just go out and they they do that and they go out and graze on the corn stock so it was a great day uh my oldest son who's a senior in high school was very happy to miss and be in sick for a couple of hours in the morning to help us move the herd from uh you know like about a half a mile away so we move them down the road like that so it's it is a crazy day always crazy in the fall and then to add the election on top of it just makes us happen so well you are a true citizen legislature a citizen legislator right where you're doing your job you're helping to literally Feed and Fuel the world with what you're doing in your operation and uh it is truly a family experience for you and I've had a chance to witness that and how how much your kids have a role in not only your operation but in learning about uh agriculture here in Iowa and one of the biggest issues of course that I continue to hear about as I'm traveling through my district are the rising costs and the rising input costs for for you uh it's the fertilizer it's all the diesel obviously those prices are still at record highs you name it under this Administration the Biden Administration the energy policy has made it more expensive for Farmers to run business day to day so what is your experience with this and um you know what if you can kind of tell people how that works in your operation and what you're seeing there and then what can we be doing both at the state level and the federal level to help ease that burden for Iowa farmers sure yeah it is a heavy burden that we every day when we go to the fuel Barrel to fill up it's basically a fleet of tractors every morning when we go out there to refuel it is something that I think about every single time when we fill it up um because that Barrel goes down these diesel prices is through the roof it's the highest we've ever seen so it is a cost that we are thinking about every single day it's multiple times a day because it weighs heavy because that's a that's a a cost that we never really had to worry as much about in the past that's a new added stress in our lives um Farmers we always say we don't go to Vegas because our whole life is is a risk we take chances every day and those are the those are the things that are that are we worry about fertilizer prices um they are through the roof and hydrous ammonia we're getting into that season where in another month or so we're going to be putting on anhydrous and we have to worry about how much it's going to cost will our co-ops have them well you know like will they make it through the season and how much it's going to cost um right now with we're actually in an area where we saw it's very we were in a drought in our area um the river is down the Mississippi River is down I just talked to my brother-in-law this morning we were talking about he runs a fertilizer plant we he was talking to me about how the Mississippi level is down so much that when they ship you know like on the barges they can only fill the barges um a third full and um you know that's going to affect I mean you're talking about fuel costs for getting the fertilizer here you're going to talk about you know potential shortages we're we're not exactly sure hopefully your co-ops have you know uh have it all on hand for this fall but you know these are all unknowns and so what happens is that these are sky high prices and it trickles down right to the consumer you know and it's one of those things where once again it goes down we you know we're feeling the cost in our operation but you are at the end of the day feeling those costs when you're putting the food on your table absolutely I mean I went through the list of all the different products that corn is in right all the byproducts all the oils the sugars all of the things everyone breaks down in addition to animal feed right and you think think about how much that cost has gone up because those input costs have gone up um the what you said about the barges and the fertilizer think about those shipping costs and how much they've gone up not only because the fuel costs but now because of that inefficiency so um it's it's a huge challenge for you it's why we need to drive those costs down as much as possible and it's why we need to be advocating for and all of the above energy strategy both at the federal level and here in Iowa and so I'm I'm thankful for what you've done here in Iowa to support E15 obviously the state legislature you supported that policy and I got that through this year um and I think that's absolutely going to be a win for Iowa so um you know we're doing what we can but we're up against some pretty good headwinds one of the biggest headwinds that I hear about um from uh from my constituents throughout the district is uh the inflation costs right it is obviously in fuel that's part of it but the cost of everything the goods and services that we are buying is up higher and working families are paying the price for this I call the Pelosi pay cut because we've seen continued wasteful spending out of Washington D.C so are you hearing the same thing from your constituents Dawn um as a state senator absolutely and what why is it so important then um to maintain the Republican majority in the Iowa senate absolutely so this uh this election cycle we started door knocking on June 8th um because we kind of had some heated House Seats and I have up to this point just myself I have door knocked on over seven thousand doors we made it through the district once by August 28th and we are almost ready to finish our second go around as far as knocking the entire district and that's what I hear at the door is you know inflation inflation inflation and I think that we are doing at a great job at the state level as far as cutting taxes um passing the flat tax from last year not taxing retirement I mean these are the things that are so important to Iowans and I am on every single doorstep uh almost every single day you know going out and knocking hundreds of doors and it's just it's it's the top thing that people talk about and it's the top thing that they talk about because they look at their bank accounts every single day and see how much less it is this year than last year so I think it's so important to keep the Senate um you know as far as having a majority Republicans in there because not only do we honor what we say we said we were going to cut taxes and we did it uh we're going to continue to look at different ways that we can cut because I think that what we are doing in this state is the exact opposite of what's going on at the federal level and I think that everything that we are doing here we are making it you know the top 10 places you know to live you know Iowa is an amazing place and we want to keep our Iowans here and we want to keep them living here and I think that will do nothing but benefit everyone and I think that what we are doing as far as cutting taxes the policies that we are making it is so important and I think that that Iowa reflects that I mean they reflect what we're doing is we're doing a good job so we need to keep our majority in there yeah well what I say is uh DC needs to operate a lot more like Iowa and we don't want Iowa to be operating like DC so that's right what's important in this conversation too is context right so uh it wasn't that long ago that Democrats had a trifecta here in Iowa and it was the late 2000s I was a news anchor at the time and I remember covering that overspending and that disrespect for taxpayers when we had a Democrat legislature and a Democrat Governor they did not respect taxpayers they spent more money than we had they had to borrow um we I think have still been paying off many of those debts um and now we are fiscally responsible here in Iowa we are living within our means but they had to do an across the board 10 cut because they had overspent that's just irresponsible governing and that's exactly what we've seen out of the tax and spend Democrats in Congress they passed the so-called inflation reduction act which expands the IRS dramatically 87 000 new IRS agents to Target Working Families only about four percent of that is actually for process so we all know we want the IRS to function uh as a as an agency um I think people should pay the taxes that they owe but what we know about those new IRS agents is they are going to be targeting hard-working Iowans and hard-working Americans so look at that context right that's what the Democrats are doing in Washington DC we saw what the Democrats did here in Iowa when they inherited a sound economic structure and torpedoed that and Republicans had to come in and clean it up that's exactly why it's important to have a strong Republican Senate a republican house and a republican Governor here in Iowa so don could you tell us a little bit more about um The Campaign Trail what's a you know you've talked a little bit about your door knocking but um what are some some of the biggest stories that you've heard that have made an impact on you um you know it it is it is those moms that I can relate to being a mom myself you know I'm in charge I'm in charge of our budget uh I'm in charge of the checkbook I have to do the farm checkbook our personal checkbook you know it's one of the things and that is what I talked to you know men you know dads and moms at the door we talk about how that is going to affect um you know Christmas I mean it's even something simple as that and um it's just one of those things where going out there talking to the people talking about the protection of our kids um like I said I have three kids in high school I have a senior this year I have a I have a junior and a freshman and um those those topics you know our kids are our future and they are also so so important um you know talking about education um you know as far as here in Iowa something that I think is very important is the trades um you know four-year College isn't for everyone especially after now what um President Biden is going to do for um the the debt relief you know four-year College isn't for everyone and I think here in Iowa promoting the trades um is something that is going to be so so important for um I mean my son on Monday we're gonna go sign our letter of intent he's going to go to a junior college where he's going to be a diesel mechanic and you know I think that's so important you know we're going to go work here in he's going to work here in the district he's going to work for Sinclair tractor he's going to be giving back to the community you know that's what we teach our kids and four-year College just wasn't for him and so we talk about a lot about that too is how we need to get people back to work you know companies are not you know the the workforce shortage and things and how are we going to fill these jobs it is to get these kids you know in these right programs as far as Plumbing Heating um you know all these trades that is going to be so important and to teach these kids that this is not four year isn't for everyone and you can and will be so successful if you go and do a specialized trade and we just need to give them the right tools to be able to access to find what their passion is and to be able to come back because that's what makes our rural districts so wonderful is if the kids coming back and working and being successful when you think about how that matches up with policy right so that's a story of your family and what you're experiencing and I've heard that same story many times throughout the District of people who are looking for the right fit for them and it's not always a four-year college that doesn't mean that those don't need to still be successful and exist in and educate our people but we need to be talking about concurrent enrollment for our high school kids I know we have a high rate of concurrent enrollment here in Iowa so that our high school students can be earning that college credit at a community college and and getting in that pipeline right um and our education pipeline as well I know you've done work on that at the state too so um kudos to you Dawn for the work that you've done in your first term um first couple of years in the uh yeah they're big ones yeah yes absolutely you've checked a lot of great things off the list there is obviously more to do to make sure Iowa continues to stay the number one place right to uh to grow to work to live and to raise a family so where can people find more information about your campaign sure they can find me on Facebook for Don Driscoll for state senate and I have a web a website to drisco4senate.com and if you

  FOR THE RALLY INCLUDING ITS  CHAIRWOMAN AMY CRAMER. JOINING ME NOW IS DEMOCRATIC  CONGRESSMAN ADAM SCHIFF,  CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE  INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE, A MEMBER OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE. CONGRESSMAN, THANKS SO MUCH FOR  TAKING THE TIME THIS MORNING.  >> GOOD TO BE WITH YOU. >> SO WHAT LED YOU, IF YOU COULD EXPLAIN, TO SEND OUT THIS LATEST BATCH. WHY THE FOCUS ON THIS GROUP? >> THIS GROUP WAS INVOLVED IN  PLANNING THAT STOP THE STEAL  RALLY THAT RESULTED IN THE  INSURRECTION AGAINST THE CAPITOL AS WELL AS OTHER EVENTS, BUT  PART OF OUR MISSION IN WRITING A CONFIDENCE OF ANALYSIS OF WHAT  WENT WRONG AND HOW TO PROTECT  THE COUNTRY GOING FORWARD IS TO  UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS THE PLANNING FOR THIS, WHAT WAS THE FINANCING FOR THIS, WHAT WERE THE  EXPECTATIONS? WAS THERE KNOWLEDGE THAT THIS  WAS GOING TO TURN VIOLENT? WAS THAT PART OF THE PLAN FROM  THE BEGINNING? SO THESE WITNESSES WILL HAVE  IMPORTANT INFORMATION RELEVANT  TO THOSE QUESTIONS, AND THE  DOCUMENTS WE'RE SEEKING LIKEWISE WILL SHED LIGHT ON IT. WE KNOW THERE WAS STRONG  PARTICIPATION OF THE WHITE  NATIONALIST GROUPS. WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT KNOWLEDGE  THERE WAS IN ADVANCE THAT THESE  GROUPS WITH THE PROPENSITY FOR  VIOLENCE WERE GOING TO BE  PARTICIPATING.  >> BIG QUESTION IS THE  INVOLVEMENT, THE KNOWLEDGE OF  THE WHITE HOUSE, RIGHT UP TO THE PRESIDENT AS WELL AS SENIOR  REPUBLICAN LEADERS. ARE YOU GOING TO SUBPOENA THE  REPUBLICAN MINORITY LEADER KEVIN McCARTHY, TRUMP, THE VICE  PRESIDENT, THE FORMER VICE  PRESIDENT? >> WE ARE CONTEMPORANEOUSLY  SEEKING RECORDS FROM THE WHITE  HOUSE, FROM THE RELEVANT  AGENCIES, THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT AND OTHERS TO FILL IN EXACTLY  THAT SIDE OF THE EQUATION AS  WELL. WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT WAS GOING  ON WITH THE PRIVATE PLANNING AND HENCE THE 11 SUBPOENAS THAT WENT OUT YESTERDAY. WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT WAS THE  PRESIDENT'S INVOLVEMENT, WHAT  ABOUT THE PEOPLE AROUND HIM? >> WILL YOU ASK HIM DIRECTLY TO  ADDRESS THOSE QUESTIONS  DIRECTLY? >> WE HAVEN'T MADE SPECIFIC  DECISIONS ABOUT MEMBERS OF THE  CONGRESS YET. BUT ANYONE FRANKLY THAT HAS  PERTINENT INFORMATION THAT WAS  IN COMMUNICATION WITH THE  PRESIDENT AND WE KNOW KEVIN  McCARTHY WAS, YOU KNOW, I HAVE  TO SAY, CERTAINLY APPEARED TO BE A PRETTY PERTINENT WITNESS TO  ME. >> OKAY, I WANT IT TALK ABOUT  INFRASTRUCTURE. THERE IS A POSSIBLE VOTE ABOUT  INFRASTRUCTURE, WILL THE HOUSE  VOTE TODAY ON THE BIPARTISAN  INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN? >> THE SHORT ANSWER IS I DON'T  KNOW WHETHER WE'LL TAKE UP A  BILL, WHETHER WE'LL VOTES IF WE  DO AND IF WE DON'T HAVE THE  VOTES, WHETHER WE'LL MAKE THE  DECISION TO PUT THAT ASIDE FOR  ANOTHER DAY. BUT I AM CONFIDENT OF THIS,  WHETHER IT IS DONE TODAY OR A  WEEK FROM NOW OR A MONTH FROM  NOW, GOD FORBID, HOPE IT IS  SOONER THAN THAT, WE'LL GET THIS DONE. WE'LL PASS A FISCAL  INFRASTRUCTURE BILL. I VIEW WHATEVER HAPPENS TODAY AS MERELY ACT ONE IN -- I DON'T  KNOW IF IT IS TWO PART PLAY, OR  THREE PART PLAY, BUT I'M  CONFIDENT WE'LL GET IT DONE.  >> WHY SHOULD FOLKS WATCHING NOW SHARE THAT CONFIDENCE? THIS IS DEMOCRAT VERSUS DEMOCRAT HERE AND THE GAP IS WIDE BETWEEN SINEMA AND MANCHIN IN THE SENATE AND WHAT PROGRESSIVES IN THE  HOUSE WANT. HOW DO YOU BRIDGE THAT GAP? >> WELL, WE HAVE, I THINK, THE  MOST LEADERSHIP IN NANCY PELOSI  THAT THE CONGRESS EVER HAD. IF THERE IS A PATHWAY AND I  BELIEVE THERE IS, THE SPEAKER  WILL FIND IT. THE REALITY IS, YOU KNOW, 98% OF OUR DEMOCRATIC DELEGATION AND  HOUSE AND SENATE IS ON THE SAME  PAGE HERE IN WHAT THEY WANT. BUT WE HAVE 50/50 SPLIT IN THE  SENATE AND WE HAVE THE MAJORITY  IN THE HOUSE EVER, EVEN WITH 98% PARTY UNITY, THAT 2% CAN CAUSE A REAL HEADACHE AND WE'RE TRYING  TO GET TO YES BECAUSE WE'RE  GOING TO NEED 100%. >> WHILE YOU, WHILE THE  PRESIDENT HAVE BEEN FOCUSED ON  INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE BUDGET  PLANS, REPUBLICAN LED STATE  LEGISLATURES HAVE BEEN PASSING A WHOLE HOST OF MEASURES, NOT JUST TO RESTRICT VOTING, BUT TO GIVE  PARTISANS INCLUDING STATE  LEGISLATURES GREATER ABILITY TO  OVERTURN OR INTERFERE WITH THE  RESULTS OF ELECTIONS GOING  FORWARD. I WONDER HAVE DEMOCRATS MADE A  MISTAKE BY PRIORITIZING BUDGET  AND INFRASTRUCTURE OVER  SOMETHING THAT COULD HAVE, YOU  KNOW, IMMEDIATE AND SEVERE  IMPACT ON ELECTIONS AS SOON AS  2022 AND 2024. IS THAT A MISTAKE? >> I THINK BOTH ARE INTEGRAL TO  OUR DEMOCRACY. IN TERMS OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE  AND HUMAN INFRASTRUCTURE, THE  BUILD BACK BETTER, ONE OF THE  REASONS WHY OUR DEMOCRACY IS AT  RISK IS THAT IT NEEDS TO DELIVER AND A LOT OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE LOST FAITH THAT THE GOVERNMENT  CAN DELIVER. I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT. THE ISSUE OF THESE VOTING  RESTRICTIONS, THE EFFORT BY  REPUBLICANS TO GIVE PARTISAN  BOARDS AND LEGISLATURES THE  POWER TO OVERTURN AN ELECTION, A LEGITIMATE AELECTION IS PROBABLY THE GREATEST DANGER TO OUR  DEMOCRACY. AND THAT MUST BE GIVEN AT  ABSOLUTE TOP PRIORITY. AND I WOULD HOPE THAT THE  ADMINISTRATION IS WORKING TO  FIND THE PATHWAY AROUND THE  FILIBUSTER OR CARVE OUT BECAUSE  THIS IS HOW DEMOCRACY -- THERE  MAY BE --  >> EVEN THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T  SUPPORT BREAKING THE FILIBUSTER. IF IT IS THE MOST SEVERE THREAT  WHAT ARE YOU DOING ABOUT IT AND  WHEN? >> I THINK THE PRESIDENT IS  GOING TO NEED THE SUPPORT AROUND THE FILIBUSTER. WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET TEN  REPUBLICANS AROUND THE SENATE TO DO THIS. THE ONLY WAY THEY CAN WIN POWER  IS BY CHEATING, BY EFFECTIVELY  OVERTURNING THE POPULAR WILL OR  DISENFRANCHISING PEOPLE OF  COLOR. THAT'S WHERE THE SENATE MAJORITY IS RIGHT NOW. IT IS A CULT AROUND THE FORMER  PRESIDENT AND ANTI-DEMOCRATIC  CULT. SO THAT'S JUST GOING TO HAVE TO  BE OVERCOME. AND I WAS GOING TO SAY, JIM,  THERE MAY BE ANOTHER ATTACK ON  THE CAPITOL. I CAN'T RULE THAT OUT. BUT I CAN TELL YOU THIS, IT WILL BE UNSUCCESSFUL JUST LIKE THE  LAST ONE. IF OUR DEMOCRACY COMES TO AN  END, IT WILL BE BECAUSE OF THESE QUASI LEGAL MEANS THAT THEY'RE  EMPLOYING AROUND THE COUNTRY TO  OVERTURN FREE AND FAIR  ELECTIONS. THAT, TO ME, IS THE BIGGEST  DAGGER AT THE HEART OF OUR  DEMOCRACY.  >> FINAL QUESTION ON  AFGHANISTAN, NEW REPORTING FROM  AXIOS THAT DURING A CLASSIFIED  BRIEFING, GENERAL MILLEY BLAMED  THE STATE DEPARTMENT FOR THE  BOTCHED EVACUATION FROM  AFGHANISTAN. WHO DO YOU HOLD RESPONSIBLE FOR  THE CHAOS, THE DELAYS, THE MANY  THOUSANDS OF AFGHANS LEFT BEHIND WHO WORKED FOR THE U.S., WHO DO  YOU HOLD RESPONSIBLE AND DO YOU  THINK SOMEONE SHOULD RESIGN,  OFFER THEIR RESIGNATION AS A  RESULT? >> LOOKING AT IT FROM THE INTEL  PERSPECTIVE, I THINK THE  INTELLIGENCE WAS PRETTY GOOD. NOW, THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT THE  INTELLIGENCE AGENCY PREDICTED  AFGHAN GOVERNMENT WOULD FALL IN  A MATTER OF DAYS, BUT OVER THE  LAST COUPLE OF YEARS, THE  INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY HAD  ASSESSMENTS OF WHETHER THE  AFGHAN GOVERNMENT WOULD MAINTAIN ITSELF AND EVENTUALLY HOW  QUICKLY IT WOULD FALL. AND SO I THINK THERE ARE  PROFOUND QUESTIONS THAT THE  MILITARY NEES ANSWERS AND THE  STATE DEPARTMENT ABOUT WHY THE  MILITARY DIDN'T HAVE PLANS FOR  THIS CONTINGENCY WHEN IT WAS A  FORESEEABLE ONE, EVEN IF IT  WASN'T THE MOST PROBABLE ONE,  AND WHY THE STATE DEPARTMENT  DIDN'T MOVE WITH GREATER  ALACRITY TO PROCESS THE VISAS,

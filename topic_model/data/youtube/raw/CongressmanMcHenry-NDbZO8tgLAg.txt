Carolina mr. McHenry vice chairman of the committee thank you so much mr. chairman thank you mr. Clayton thank you for being here and I actually want to follow up on mr. Foster's question about initial coin offerings you know your investigative finding from July 25th I found encouraging that the SEC had had a finding in order to establish a rationale for for initial coin offerings or icos he walked me through your thinking on on that finding because I know it was a major decision for you to enter into a new space and try to try to regulate and point to good actors that are in the ico space sure and I mean there's a process in a substance element to it the process element was instead of instead of starting with enforcement actions we decided to start by level setting with this with this report and saying hey here's how to behave well and here are some things that trouble us so that's what that was the intent of that was to was to notify people in this space there's a way to do this right and there are some things that trouble then there are some things that trouble us and if you do it right we're all for it and if you do it wrong you know you're not some splaining to do that was that that's it in a nutshell how we went about it and so you know I've been involved in crowdfunding and it looks to me that that I SEOs are an avenue that that are that basically trying to that level set to enable the flow of capital and enable different opportunities via technology so what are you doing to controllers ensure that they're pursuing icos correctly well that that was part of the report was the process first ask yourself it's if it's a security in most cases where you're funding some other it is and then go through whether it's crowdfunding procedures reggae procedures regular whatever whatever exemption works for you go through that exemption or if an exemption doesn't work you're gonna have to consider registration which you know is probably not a practical Avenue at this point it I think it does highlight that this area of funding smaller businesses through crowdfunding or other means technology can can really help it it can help us do our job - so do you foresee the need for congressional action to ensure the secondary trading of coin you know crypto currencies are enabled or do you believe you have law on your side - to properly do that the fair answer is I don't know enough about how they're gonna trade yet to know if we can do it with what we have or whether we need your help okay all right but it's a first step I mean we're only we're only three months in for your you the SEC is finding so yeah with time I hope we can get more data on that so let me shift to a separate issue that I know you care about as much as is I as I do which is this this discussion about the rise of the rest right how do you help what we do know is 80% of startup capital goes to three states there are 47 other states have great ideas and but the flow of capital is not there is not commensurate with with the set of ideas and opportunities around there and I know this is something you care about as we've discussed what can we do for medium-sized and small businesses in the rest of the country and what can we do as policymakers what can you do at the SEC to make make sure that's possible well I think first first recognizing that this is this is the landscape I mean I I have to say I was surprised at the you know the three states get the VAT lion's share we had some folks in the other day we've been been talking to people about this small and medium sized businesses not not intermediaries but but you know people who have these business I learned something new which is the Midwest is the world's fourth or fifth largest economy depending on how you measure it but it has very little venture capital has lots of great companies lots of well-educated people a big economy but very little venture capital and that should tell us something so that initial finding now we've got to work through steps and in order to enable this right so the surprising thing to you was was the lack of capital yes well Latin and a lack of that type of capital the type of expertise in the in the venture market to put that capital work because there must be people who have businesses that are worthy of my times expired but I'd love to follow up with you more on on those ways that we can enable policy so that the other 47 states benefit you'll back time of the gentleman has expired the chair now recognizes the gentlelady from

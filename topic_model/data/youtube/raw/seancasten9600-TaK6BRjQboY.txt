thank you uh mr chairman um thank you director grey wall i want to ask a couple of questions if i could more on the investor protection round that realm this is the a little over the two-year anniversary of the death of alex kearns from naperville illinois this was the young man who um was told by robin hood that he owed them 730 thousand dollars took his life after writing his parents a note saying that he didn't know how someone who only had five thousand dollars to his name was allowed to trade 730 thousand dollars of options that story was soon eclipsed in the national zeitgeist by the gamestop hearings and getting into where were the incentives within robin hood and what you know what emerged on this committee was that that robin hood is really this sort of near perfectly toxic brew of selling only to people where they have payment for order flow contracts earning their revenue not as a fixed fee on those p5 contracts but as a as a percent of the spread the bid ask spread on the back end and then relying on gamification and so they just had these incentives to find the least sophisticated money in the market connect them to the most sophisticated players and then you know basically use gamification to put the whole thing on steroids we've had a number of hearings in this committee we've had a number of bills i wonder if you could just speak for a moment about what the sec is doing specifically around gamification and payment for order flow because as i sit here we still have not created the regulatory conditions that will protect you know a future alex kearns from being caught up in this same toxic brew can you can you speak briefly to that uh first i i'm i'm sorry to hear that about the constituent uh it's a horrible horrible story and and i i've read about it um gamification is a huge concern last year in the fall we put out requests for information about gamification and we're trying to gather more detail from people across the market to see how this practice exists different perspectives on that practice and and my hope is that that will help us inform next steps from an enforcement perspective i'm concerned when gamification crosses the line into a recommendation uh if if it does and and then it has those folks have to comply with regbi and so i see that as a potential avenue for us to get involved in that space and we're concerned about it and gamification also i think as we've seen can be used for manipulative conduct to further manipulative conduct and so that's a concern from an enforcement perspective so you've you've touched exactly on my follow-up and i i mean this format is horrible because we want to play gotcha and get zingers on the record but at least as i sit there from my perspective i have no idea how you could you could honestly say you were looking out for the best interests of your of your customers if you are using gamification to recommend stocks and if you are only relying on payment for order flow off takers right i mean by definition you are not looking and can you say anything affirmatively that we know this and it it just it hurts me because we're two years in and what seems to be obvious we're still waiting for a hearing and a ruling and meanwhile you know the companies like robin hood continue to make a lot of money [Music] from what seems to be not looking after their investors best interests so again i i can't talk about specific specific entities or individuals or firms that we may or may not be looking at i could tell you that digital engagement practices more broadly are concerned for the chair we've started this information gathering last fall on this issue perhaps that will inform future rulemaking i've shared with you how i think it impacts enforcement it's something that we're very concerned about particularly with with rugby eye how it intersects and could constitute a recommendation uh and then on the manipulation side how could be used in furtherance of manipulative conduct and it could have horrific uh consequences as well as we've seen in the case that you highlighted um i know we've only got 50 seconds left here but the a lot of those same factors seem to be i mean the crypto ryzen crash looks an awful lot like the meme stock ryzen crash it's driven by a lot of the same zeitgeist it again looks like the unsophisticated players taking charge leaving aside that you can't tell us exactly what you're doing on the gamification and people issue is is crypto the same way or are we going to have to at some point clarify whether you or the cftc has authority over crypto before we can make sure that we're protecting those investors there we're using uh congressman our authorities to to investigate and bring actions against those who violate our laws whether they be the anti-fraud provisions or other aspects of the securities laws are you satisfied you have the resources to do that well i could always use more resources but were you making the best with the additional 20 slots and i'm hopeful to get the 125 additional slots that we've asked for okay yield back thank you thank you now recognize the gentleman but before i do

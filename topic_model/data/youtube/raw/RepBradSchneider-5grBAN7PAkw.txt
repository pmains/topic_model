grrrrrr I rise today as a proud co-sponsor of this amendment this amendment is significant not only to our oceans but to our Great Lakes the Great Lakes contain a fifth of the world's freshwater and RMA nificent natural wonder they are critical to our economy in the quality of life in my district in many states the National Ocean policy helps protect the integrity of the Great Lakes ecosystem however this bill would undermine the National Ocean policy and the ability of agencies to coordinate with States local governments and other agencies to protect these beautiful waters if we are sustained our national ecological and environmental health its natural beauty and precious resources we must protect the National Ocean policy that's why I support this amendment I urge my colleagues to do the same and I yield back thank you gentleman from Alabama reserves

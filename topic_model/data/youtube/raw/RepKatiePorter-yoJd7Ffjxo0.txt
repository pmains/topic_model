mr calabria you're here today before this committee to explain why the agency that you are in charge of fhfa needs to charge an additional fee to homeowners who want to refinance their mortgage during the pandemic and as i understand it you've said you need to do this because the chronovirus pandemic is costing your agency um money and there's money that you said is going to come from loan losses money from foreclosure moratorium losses money from servicer compensation my question for you is um wouldn't the homeowners homeowners would actually save money by refinancing their mortgages yes let me clarify this isn't costing our agency anything uh it's costing fannie and freddie we're two distinct things we're not fanning freddie we're fhfa benny and freddy requested these fees they said they would be distressed if they wouldn't obviously refinancing improves bar you know bars are a better situation but again i want to emphasize nobody's payment goes up because of this correct but there is a out this adverse fee so we have this adverse market fee that we're dealing with here without this adverse market fee this creates an additional fee on homeowners when they refinance that would not exist if you had not put forth the adverse market fee without without this fee i'm not paying to keep people who've lost their jobs in their home without this fee families are on the street without this fee families mr calabria homeowners can refinance with or without this fee by adding the adverse market fee into the refinance process you are increasing the cost of refinancing for homeowners their overall mortgage payment will go down by refinancing i understand how a refinance works but as compared to no adverse market fee versus your proposal which is adverse market fee homeowners are being asked to pay more congresswoman i would certainly welcome your assistance in finding a way for us to pay to keep people in their home which is my first priority here i will appreciate the burden on i have an idea for you mr calabria did you go to congress instead of creating fees on families that total you know five or six million um dollars why don't you simply um sorry five or six billion dollars why don't you go to congress and ask them why didn't congress pay why didn't congress pay for these things when the cares act was passed well have you asked us was there not understood that if you pose mandates on private companies via legislation has been does in the cares act it was widely understood when the cares act was passed the costs would be placed on the mortgage market perhaps i naively assumed that when those who voted for the cares act knew that perhaps they didn't know there would be costs so this is why it's been delayed to give congress the opportunity this is why the numbers are being presented today so if congress wants to come in and provide the funding the fee goes away it's really quite that simple but mr calabria you're in charge of the agency it's your job to come to us and say we need additional resources one way we could get it is by increasing the cost on homeowners who are already struggling to stay in their homes to add costs to a refinance that is in fact designed to benefit homeowners it's not our job we're here today you could have come to us today and asked us for the six billion dollars so that we avoid putting these costs on the homeowners and yet you're not and that's why no we have respect for the congressman we've delayed the fees so that congress can't come up with a solution the fee has not been implemented i okay so if you have eat let me ask you again have you asked congress for this money i am not we can find a way to pay for it than the mortgage market what because again that's the stats the charters require expenses to be covered by income i simply assume that in congress passing the cares act and congress having passed the charters that congress very clearly intended for me to recoup expenses via income because that's a statutory framework of course the power you write the budget you know how much money you need but congresswoman we don't write you know these are the fees that you know you have cbo none of this went through cbo if the carers act had been scored and again i also want to emphasize we don't determine the ultimate cost of the borrower the lender determines the cost of the borrower this is the fee charge to lenders not a fee charge to borrowers you don't think lenders you mr like very free market don't think that lenders will pass this fee onto borrowers that's a question upon lenders just like any costs out of dodd-frank openly possible some of them said they would absorb it really yes i'm happy to provide to the committee i guess those are words that said they would absorb some of it thank you the gym the latest time has expired thank you very much miss porter

thank you the whole world is transfixed by the humanitarian disaster in ukraine but 500 000 people have died in northern ethiopia as you note in your testimony the majority of those facing famine-like conditions in northern ethiopia and ninety percent of tigray's population needs humanitarian assistance um right now maybe three to five percent of the amount of food that's needed is being allowed in and this is not because humanitarian organizations don't have the food and the capacity it's because the ethiopian government lets only a few percent in and the eritrean government lets nothing in um the back in december the assistant secretary for african affairs molly fee testified before our committee that the state department had decided to refrain at the current moment from making a public determination on atrocities human rights but most significantly whether this is a genocide or an attempted genocide uh just last month secretary blinken was sitting where you are now and he testified that a legal determination will in fact be made on those issues by the state department it may not be your exact portfolio but there's very few people in america who have your background in your testimony you say that addressing these atrocities in ethiopia is a a major top priority if you have a government or in this case two governments deliberately starving hundreds of thousands of civilians to death does that constitute a genocide or attempted genocide um thank you congressman obviously my past life this is a question questions of what constitutes a genocide or how courts have adjudicated that over time is something i've studied a lot but as you noted it is not um something as usaid administrator that i'm involved in in terms of making that determination and you have raised it with secretary blink and i believe he's given you the assurance that that determination will come i don't think the question of uh again whether one is using uh that whether that legal determination is made is uh influencing in any way the us government's uh posture toward the ethiopian government in other words we are acting in just the same way we would be irrespective i i would point out that in this this room i've suggested ways to pressure the ethiopian and especially uh on particularly the uh eurasian government um which has of course the ports that could be used um particularly by interrupting um sea traffic uh going you know uh even hundreds of miles away from eritrea um and uh so there i think a determination of genocide would spur our administration to do more than simply send harsh letters to addis ababa on asmara uh you visited the uh uh the refugee camp uh in sudan where tigray and refugees are also hungry um are we going to increase our aid to those refugees um well we are as part of the the broader package of assistance that we hope is going to be voted on by the senate we are able now to have additional humanitarian assistance to meet global needs that are profound and just to come back to where you started you do have a million people facing famine in ethiopia by the end of june i mean we're past mid-may this is upon us and that includes 700 000 people in tigre so uh you know i think the the the pressure uh by the united states has been uh a belated but an important factor in why the number of trucks that have gotten into tigre in recent days has increased we got 320 trucks in this past week but congressman as you know better than anybody we need 500 trucks a week if we are going to meet those those and and i would say that congress should provide the money but only the administration can provide the pressure and only the administration can use the us navy to put additional pressure on the two countries involved and without that pressure you've got a certain number of trucks in with um oral pressure we can do more i yield back thank you

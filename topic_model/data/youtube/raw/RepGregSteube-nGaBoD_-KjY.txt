[Music] thank you welcome back remember the Biden administration's botched Afghanistan withdrawal House Republicans officially launching a pro but the chairman of the house Foreign Affairs committee has now formally requested intelligence intelligence assessments Communications with the Taliban and much more from Secretary of State Anthony blinken the committee is also expected to issue subpoenas to compel U.S officials to sit for depositions so more than a year later will we finally learn why the administration evacuated our military before our civilians and then let the Taliban take over joining me now to discuss Florida Republican congressman and house Foreign Affairs Committee Member Greg stuby hello sir good to see you um so this is one of those things that I am still shocked that there is not more bipartisan support to figure out what went wrong when you have 50 of people in this country who say that the entire War our longest war ever fought in this country was a total waste why more people don't want to get to the bottom of all of the questions we have about the war itself but certainly about that deadly withdrawal well I think they do and and thank you for talking about it because mainstream media is not talking about it and as you and I sit here having a conversation we still have Americans stuck in Afghanistan that can't get out an Afghan was just found at the border trying to cross how did he get there uh all of these questions that we have asked and we want to have answers to yet the administration's ignored us for over a year and finally that now that we have the gavels the ability to subpoena these individuals bring them in put them under oath and start asking them tough questions uh veterans like myself who served overseas have a lot of uh hard feelings about the way that this withdrawal went down and it's hard to even begin where do we even start the questions is it the service members that died and the people that you left from Bagram that caused this to occur the Americans that are still left there are people that worked with us that are still left there the 80 billion dollars worth of military equipment that's still left there I mean the Taliban could be selling our military equipment to the Russians right now and you wouldn't know it and nobody in the mainstream media is talking about it but when we get all these can committee settled which will happen this week we're going to start the investigations in Earnest all right so what would it take to actually get the secretaries of state and defense to resign in shame I've been calling on that since this happened and it it's so disgusting to me the smugness with which they portrayed the advice they were given about the state of Afghanistan um you know they they blamed the government over there they even blamed American citizens for not heeding the warning of the state department which even if they could have done so there weren't State Department officials there to help them out of the country so what would it take to actually move the needle so this isn't just another wasted Congressional committee what would it take to get them to finally stand down I I don't want them to resign I wanted to bring all this information before the American people and impeach them because I think that would have bigger weight before the American people to show the evidence to the American people of the impeachable conduct that Millie and blinken and others have done I actually think that that Millie should be court-martialed for the dereliction of Duty that he has done to the American Service members that were there I mean we as members of Congress while all this was going down didn't even know who was in charge is the Secretary of State in charge is the military in charge they didn't know who who was going on and who was making the decisions so I want to bring them before these committees let the American people see the evidence that they had and that we had before the American people that now we can get and show them that these individuals should be impeached for the conduct that was Unbecoming of their positions in our government well I hope that happens I really do and you know I I do like the idea of impeachment as accountability because you're right if if they do just resign and walk away we'll never know what happened we have to know what happened so we don't repeat this entire thing again Congressman stewby thank you so much for your time yeah good to see you top of storm is next

Thank You mr. chairman mr. Speer I'd like to ask you some questions relating to an important safety issue that I've been working on preventing truck underride crashes and underride crashes when a car slides under the body of a large truck such as a semi-trailer during an accident when these accidents happen a car safety features are not able to protect passengers because most of the car slides under the trailer and the truck crashes straight through the windows and into passengers the passengers in a car often suffer severe head and neck injuries including decapitation on impact of the truck these accidents are fatal even at low speeds this past summer four individuals were killed when their cars slid underneath the disabled milk tanker that had swerved to avoid a deer in New York State two cars crashed into the truck and continued to slide completely under the truck all four people were pronounced dead at the scene I recently introduced a bill to require trailers to be fitted with underride guard so that the car could no longer slide underneath the truck during an accident are you aware that the National Transportation Safety Board has recommended that trucks be equipped with side guard and improved rear guards since 2014 yes ma'am and are you aware that the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety petitioned the US Department of Transportation to require stronger rear guards on trucks after studying how guard how guard that comply with the current federal regulations often fail and result in serious injury or death I am senator and are you aware that the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety performed a successful side underride guard at 40 miles per hour I am Senator and would providing a weight exemption for the weight of adding an underride guard make it easier for industry to add this safety measure most definitely senator do you think this is a safety measure we should push forward with I wouldn't dismiss it and I applaud you one fatality is too many 40,000 a year's just inexcusable we need to be doing more one area that I would ask that you press Nitsa on a d-o-t is to speed up their analysis of this and report back on the weight the added weight of the under eye guard to be sure that it does not compromise the integrity of the trailer itself we're talking 80,000 pounds in these trailers you're adding more weight underneath it you don't want to be trying to solve a safety problem by creating another one so I would very much like to have that report that data back that validates that the added weight of the under guards would not compromise the integrity of the trait of the trailer itself I think the way it's not that much I think it's about 800 pounds of panel so relative to the overall weight it's not a lot and from what I understand the only opposition was because it just means they carry less Freight and so they're putting well your exam plenty of money in front of safety so well I think would also add to the cost of the requirement if you're if you're saying that we have to reduce Freight to pay for the added weight of the under guards that is going to be a massive figure we're talking millions of trailers so that's a big number so I think the exemption is well taken I would like to make certain that that cost is the only issue those are the kinds of things Congress can address

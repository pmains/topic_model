working cooperation on this side of the aisle mr. Sablan I know that you have to leave and so I'm going to allow you to go next and thank you very much madam chair good afternoon and then thank you everyone also for the courtesy I need to be had another hearing that started any federal program of the size and scope of supplemental nutrition assistance program must constantly be monitored to make sure it is sufficient free of abuse and reaching the people it is intended to help I have to say however that the discussion seemed academic to me when the people I represent do not have access to staff the Northern Marianas receives about blog read each year that's supposed to be the equivalent of snob but in fact only provides half and sometimes less than half the system the snap would in fact the local government and the Department of Agriculture do such a poor job of negotiating that grin that just last week for the second for the second year in a row benefits have to be caught at a place where GDP has decreased every year since 2005 we r minimum wages is at five dollars and five cents an hour we're gasolina only on one island is over six dollars a gallon and we're util echt rissa t is about 42 cents a kilowatt hour so food lots of Wheaties with lots of it important and ship over long distances it expel it's expensive in their islands yet for some over for some 10,000 people about twenty percent of the entire population are now forced to get by on three dollars and sixty four cents per day for food I have tried doing this and I plan to do it again I can tell you that living in this little money to feed oneself is not healthy and very very unpleasant I've been working to get more food aid to the people since the day I arrived here in 2009 Secretary Vilsack provided is thirteen point six percent increase that here too massive increase in the Recovery Act that other Americans received last year IRA culture for another for 1 billion dollars 1 million dollars to add to the fiscal 12 program but the fact is this piecemeal approach trying to fix a block grant system that simply cannot adjust to changing need is working if it were working benefits will not have been caught last week so I have also introduced legislation HR 14 6614 65-year duda Act which includes the Northern Marianas and snap being included in stab will give Americans the Americans I represent the same access to food assistance as other Americans receive being included in snap will make the system more efficient and will reduce fraud being included in snap will mean that as economic and circumstances change the Morales federal expenditures who go up or go down in response replacing this zombie block grant program that operates oblivious to economic realities regarding the need to reduce fraud an issue that we are almost we are all most concerned with I would remind a subcommittee that when Northern Marianas governor made US Department of Agriculture officials here in Washington in February he told him that fraud is occurring in the system he administers chairwoman Smith ranking member Baca obsessive being we and myself sent a formal request asking the Department to investigate but we have written received no response we have also received reports that the block grant program has been administered in the Northern Marianas in a manner that is in violation of the department's own civil rights policy the only response i have received from the department is is that the loco operations manual will be rewritten to say that such violations are prohibited which checks the bureaucratic box but does nothing to make hold those who did not receive the food assistance they were entitled to what is even more frustrating to me about the situation the Secretary of Agriculture already has the statutory authority to extend snap to the northern Marineris it could give my constituents the same assistance other Americans receive if he chose to do so he could exercise greater management control to ensure that the reports of fraud and civil rights violation are addressed effectively he has not last summer in an open hearing of the nutrition subcommittee Department officials promise we will work with you on my goal to bring all the miners into snap as I mentioned the department did provide an additional 1 million dollars for the Block Grant for this fiscal year but now as that was insufficient to keep benefits from being caught what weighs on me each and every day is that hundreds of families Arabs and have to choose whether to pay the utility bills of their kids can have lights and a critical part to the door or fill their cars with very expensive gasoline to get to work or put sufficient and nutritionally adequate food on the table this should not be snap has proven its value it has long-standing bipartisan support because it is a program that works responsive in times of need helping the most vulnerable and lifting people out of poverty yes we need to find ways to reduce our government deficit but snap Spencer's who decline in the years ahead as the economy continues its recovery in the meantime we need to continue helping those Americans who need our help including those who live in our in the islands and I thank you very much for the opportunity madam chair you

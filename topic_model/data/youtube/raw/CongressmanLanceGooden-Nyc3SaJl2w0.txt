Thank You mr. style and thank you for being here I just had a few questions a yes or no will suffice but feel free to answer as long as you'd like as well Fargo the largest bank in the world no Wells Fargo is not the largest the largest bank in the Western Hemisphere no we're not what about North America no we're not so not the United States either I'm guessing no congressman of the banks that are larger than Wells Fargo are you aware of any that were involved in a scandal of such magnitude as Wells Fargo's and if so about how many I'm not aware of another Bank that's had the extent of the issues that we've had so I guess what I'm getting at is it's obvious that there are large banks in this country that are doing a pretty good job and is it fair to say that Wells Fargo's problems are perhaps unique and you all are trying to get to a point where like the other large banks in our nation they're able to to operate fairly smoothly and honestly despite being large congressman I do believe that we've not been run the way we should be run and our culture wasn't what it should be and that but but it's possible to change those things and it is possible to run the company well I appreciate that and thank you for being here you know I also wanted to kind of just make an observation I'm looking through some of the majority's reports and it's it's been very helpful and I appreciate all the work they put into it before I made that observation I was just gonna point out we've had the head of the OCC here I guess last month it was and kind of one of the overarching themes was that there was mismanagement going on and he was to paraphrase doing the bidding of the Trump administration a report that this committee put out a news release on February 3rd 2020 kind of really blasted the FDIC's and OCC's plans to weaken components of the Volcker Rule and in the Indy press releases that I've read it made clear that they held these accountability groups the FDIC the OCC responsible for putting out the for doing the wishes of the Trump administration so they kind of blamed the administration for decisions by the OCC the reason I bring that up is because when I look at these this report page 23 committee staff findings and I don't dispute these findings I'm sure they're accurate it says before the 2016 and 2018 consent orders financial regulators knew about serious enterprise-wide deficiencies at Wells Fargo for years without alerting the public well our great president was elected in 2016 and so when I read all these deficiencies and regulatory efforts page 24 on April 19 2017 a report issued by the OCC s office of enterprise government and the Ombudsman reviewing the OCC supervision of the bank sales practices concluded that the OCC did not take timely and effective supervisory actions the OCC failed to conduct comprehensive reviews and testing and monitoring systems and controls over sales practices between 2011 and 2014 that is right in the middle of the Obama administration I just can't help but wonder how this report would read if a Republican were in the White House during the years of mismanagement by the regulatory groups that just allowed this to go on and so my conclusion that I'd like to make is that the Trump administration has really done a great job in their first two years they have executed enforcement action and I think that things are really turning around and I want to applaud the Trump administration for their progress I'm disappointed that so much of this was apparently asleep at the switch actions during the Obama administration but I wish you you luck and I thank you for coming here before us today and I yield back to the chairwoman

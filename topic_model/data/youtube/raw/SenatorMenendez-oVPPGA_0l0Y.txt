CONTLS ON EXPORTS T RUSSIA WE'LL IMPOSE OUR ALLIES TO JOIN  US. INING ME NOW T TELL US WHERE  WE ARE ON THIS IS THE CHAIRMAN  OF THE SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS  COMMITTEE, DEMOCRATIC SENATOR  FROM NEW JERSEY, SENATOR MEN  MENDEZ. ARE WE JUNE NEED? E STEME MAKESTEEMS  LIKE WHATEVER SCTIO BILL  COMES, I WILL COME AFTER PUTIN  DOES SOMETHING, NOT BEFORE. >> UCK, FIRST OFALL, I'M  THRIED THAT T MAJORITY AND  MINOTY LDERS ALONG WITH THE  CHAIRS AND RANKING MEMBERSF  THE NATIONAL SECURITY COMMITTEE   TENATE CAM TOGETHER AND  PU OUT A STRONG STATEMENT  YESTERDA AS WE SPEAK, SENATOR SHAH MEAN  AND PORTMAN PUT TOGETHER  SOMETHING THAT I BELIEVE WE'LL  L SIGN ON TO ECHOING A COITMENT. WHAT SHOD BE CLEAR HERE IS  THAT, IF PUT INVADES, THAT T SENATETANDS CMITTED TO,  NUMBER ON UKRAINE'S  TERRITORIAL INTEGRIT THAT THE  SENATE STANDS COMMITTED TO  SUPPORTING UKRAINE WITH LETHA  AND NON-LETHAL ASSISTANCE AND  THE SENATE STANDS MMITTED TO  SWPI SANCTIONS AGAINST  RUSS. NOW, T SPECIFICS O WHAT THAT  IS HASEEN A CHALNGE. WETARTED OFF WITH MY MOTHER OF ALL SANCTIONS LEGISLATION. WE JOINED WITH RUBLICANS WN  THEY EXPRESSED AN INTEREST I SAID ABSOLUTELY. WE INCLUDED MANY O THE IDEAS  THAT THEY SEEM TO HAVE DROPPED  IN THEIR BILL. AS A MATTER OF FACT, TWO DAYS BEFORE THEY DROPPED THEIR BILL I SENT A SERIES O PROPOSALS THAT  EVEN MOVED FURTHER IN THEIR  DIRECTN IN PURSUIT OF A  BIRTISAN AGEMEN BUTT T END OF THE DAY, WE  DI'T GET AN ANSWER TTHAT. ALL WE DID SEE IS A BILL DROP. MY DOOR REMAINS OPE TO AND  COMMITTED TO A BIPARTISAN  EFFORT. WE'LL SEE IF WE CAN GET ERE,  BUT I GLAD THESE EXPRESSIONS   MUTUAL CMITMENT TO UKRAINE  IS INCREDIBLY IMIMPOANT. >> IS POLITICAL ANNEXATIONNN  INVASION? DOES THAT MEET E TERMS? >> WELL, DEPENDS HOW THAT'S  MANIFEST,, RIGH THE REALITY IS THAT YOU HAVE THE RUSSIAN PARLIAMEN SAYING TWO OF THE REGIONS OF EASTERN UKRAINE  ARE TO BE PROTECTED B RUSSIA,  VING THEM SECURY GUARANTEES. PARLIAMENT PURSUING A RESOLUTION SAYING NO, THE PARTS OF DONBAS ARE A PART O UKRAINE'S  SOVEREIGNTY. I HEA YOUR EARLIER REPORT WITH RICHARD ENGEL AT THE AGREEMENT  TH HAD BEEN ENTERED INTO  IOUS. THAT RECOGNIZES RARAINE'S  RRRRITORIA INTEGRITY BY RUSSIA. SOT THE END OF THE DAY, IT  DENDS WHAT THAT ACTUALLYSS  MANIFESTED AS.  >> WHAT HAPPENS, SENATOR, IF  WHAT PUTIN REALLY WANTS TO DO IS KEEP THE CURRENT STATUS QUO? WHEN D WE DRAW THE LEE OF  SAYING, YOU KN, THIS HOSTAGE  STANDOFF HAS TO STOP? >> THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION. WE'RE GOING TO KNOW THAT PRETTY  SOON. THESE MANEUVERS THAT ARE TAKING  PLE THAT ARE SUPPODLY BEING  ENGAD AS ANNUAL MANEUVERSND  MILITARY EXERCISES ALONGITH  RUSRE SUPPOSED TO END TS SUND. WELL, IF THEY END THIS SUNDAY  THEN THERE SHOULD BE MASSIVE  WITHDRAWS AWAYF THAT'S  RUSSIA REAL INTE, NUMBER  ONE. NUMBER TWO, WHEN YOU SEE  CYBERATTACKS WHICH I CERTAINLY  BELIEVE WAS RUSSIAN SPOORED  AGNST THEENTRAL BANKS OF  UKRAINE AND THE MINISTRY OF  DEFENS THAS NOT SOMEONE WHO  WANTS AN OFFSHOOT TODIPLOMACY. WEONTINUE TORAMATICALLY  POINT F DIPLOMA BOTH  DIRELY AND WIT OUR ALLIES BUT  P PREPAREOR T PSISIBILITY  OF AN IASNN OF UKRAINE. AT SOME POINT,F TRERE GOING  TO BE A CONTI HARASSMENT OF  UKRAINE IN A WAY IN WHICH  UKINE CANNOT FLOURISH AND IS  CONSTANTLY UNDER REAT, I THINK THAT WILL CALL FOR A SERIES OF  CONSIDERATIONS OF WHAT TYPE OF  ACTIONS, ILUDING SOME  POTENTIAL NCTIS AS A RESULT  OF EMEM.  >> I WANT TOHIFT TO  AFGHANISTAN AND THE REFEE  CRISIS RIGHT W. LASTEEKHE PRESIDENT FROZE  AFAN ASSS. HE HAS A PLAN THAT HE' LIKE TO  DIVIDE THE MONEY BETWEEN 9/  FAMILIES ANDERHAPS  HUMANITARIAN AID TO AFGHANISTAN. WHERE DO STAND O ATAT? >> WELL, CERTAINLY SUPPORT THE  9/ 11 FAMILI, I'V BEEN ONE OF E BIGGEST SPONSOR I IN MAKING SURE COMPENSATION -- AL THROW  THE LOSS OF LES C NEVERE  COMPENSATED, B TOHE EENT  THERS SOME EMENT O JUSTICE  AS A RESULT OF THAT  COMPENSATION, I SUPPORT THAT. ON THE HUMANARIAN SIDE, I  WILLEPEPEND UPON HOW AND WHERE THATONEY IS FLOWING. IS IT GOINGOO NON-GOVERNMENTAL  GANIZATIONS, INTNATIONAL  ONES? IS IT GOING TO THE WORLD FOOD  OGOGRAM?  T THAT'S THE WAY IT'SEEN  DIRECTED AND NOT WITH THE  TABAN GETTING THEIR HANDS ON  IT, OF COURSE WE WANT TO HEL  AFGHAN INHIS MOMENTF  CRIS. BUT WE CAN'T ALLOW THE TALIBAN  AT THE END OF THE DAY TO GET ACCESS TO THAT MONEY AND BE ABLE  PROMOTE THEIR OWN CAUSES  INSIDE OF AFGHANISTAN.  >> ALL RIGHT, SENATOR. I HEAR THAT. BUTRY TO SQUARE THIS CIRCLE. WE BELIEVE THE TALIBERE A MINOR ENOUGH THREAT TT WE  WOULD ALLOW THEM ESSENTIALLY T  TA OVER AFGHANISTA W WALK  AWAY, BUT THEY'RE A MAJ ENOUGH THREATHATE'RE GNG TO  ESSENTIALLY PUT THE COUNTRY INTO POVERT AND NOT HPP THE COUNTRY OUT FM WHERE IT' HEADED. IT IS A BIT OF A CONUNDRUM. THE TALIBAN IS A THTHREAT, BUT T ENGH O A THREAT THAT WE'RE  WILLING TO KEEPUR MILITARY  THERE IN PERPETUI, WHICH I  KNOW, WE GET THAT. T ANSWER THE SECOND PT OF  THE QUESTION. >> THE PART OFHEUESTION  ABOUTELPI THE AFGN OPLE? >> YEAH, HELPING THE AFGHAN  PEOPLE. AT THEND OF T DAY,HE  TALIBAN A IN CHARGE WHETHER WE LIKE ITR NOT. >> THEY'RE IN CHARGE, AND THERE  ARE NEFARIOUS ENTITIES ACROSS  THE GLOBE THATRE ICHARGE. ITOESN MEAN WE ALLOW OUR MONEY TO FLOW THROUGH THEM IN  ORDER TO HELP PELE. IF T TALIBAN CARES ABOUT ITS  OPLE, THE UIMATY IT WILL  ALLOW INTERNAONAL  ORGANIZATIONSE THE WORLD FOOD ORGANIZATION, DOCTORS  WITHOUT BOBORDERS,NTERNATIONAL  RESCUE COMMITTEE AND OTHERS TO  BE ENGAGED IN H HELPING THE AFGN PEOPLE.  WE STAND READY TOELP THE  AFGHAN PEOPLE BUT NOT AT T  CONTROL OF T TALIBAN. YOU KNOW, I'M JUS CONCERNED  THAT THE TALIBAN HAS NHOWN  THE FULLOMOMMITMENT TO WOMEN AND GIRLS IN THE CIY.Y. I'M N SEEING THE FULL  COMMITMENT TO MAKINGURE THAT AL Q DOESN'T RAISE ITS UGLY HEAD AGAIN INSIDE AFGHANISTA SO THEY M N NOT BE A TEAT TO  THENITESTATES, BUT WHAT TY DON AFGHANISTAN OR WHAT THEY  DO NOT DO IS OF A CONTINUIN  CONCER TO US. >> ALL RIGHT, SENATOR MENENDEZ, THE CHAIRMAN OF

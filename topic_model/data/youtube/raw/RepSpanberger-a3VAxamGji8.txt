your communities are facing i hope many of you are looking forward to easter and passover celebrations and for those in the midst of the month of ramadan i hope you are having a good fast one of the main issues that i hear about when visiting with our neighbors across the seventh district is the economy the state of our recovery how prices continue to rise and how families are finding it tougher and tougher to plan for the future so a primary focus of mine in recent weeks has been to help address the supply chain challenges we face in particular i have heard from virginia's trucking industry about chronic challenges with both hiring and retaining skilled drivers and as we all know the ability to move goods is paramount to our ability to have a healthy supply chain so i have a recent update on this front in response to these concerns i have introduced a bipartisan piece of legislation the strengthening supply chains through truck driver incentives act yes it's a bit of a long title but it very clearly states what the bill is intended to do i introduced this bill earlier this month i teamed up with republican mike gallagher from wisconsin to introduce this legislation and we are in the process of gathering more and more support for it our bill is very straightforward we create refundable tax credits for both current cdl drivers as well as those in apprenticeship programs to help both attract and retain drivers and i have heard directly from many virginia organizations that are very supportive of this bill because they know it would encourage more young people to enter the industry it would reduce headaches for our trucking businesses and the companies that rely on them to haul goods and it would make sure that those who are already on the road are rewarded for their hard work and that we as a community recognize the real value and the essential nature that they uh the essential nature of their work to our supply chain of course this is just one way that we can combat rising prices and shortages and i look forward to hearing your ideas and concerns as well before we begin taking questions i want to make sure that everyone listening is aware of the services that my office can provide our team can help you secure backlog benefits get fair treatment from agencies like the va help track down delayed irs refunds and in recent months we've also been able to help small businesses receive their emergency loans so if you are having any challenges contending with or dealing with a federal agency please know that we are here to help and i invite you and welcome you to reach out to our office to see how we might give assistance just in the last week i'm happy to report that our team has surpassed 15 million dollars in casework funds returned to seventh district constituents um that number includes nearly four and a half million dollars since the beginning of this year and what that represents is those are benefits that veterans have earned those are social security dollars that uh retirees have paid into the system and should be able to pull out those are idle loans and sba loans uh that constituents should be eligible for but have been unable to attain um on their own without support and so this is the the help and the constituent services that my office uh can can help you with also any challenges with the postal service or with uh passports please do be in touch we can help you or at least try to help you with every federal agency if you or someone you know would like to get in contact with our office please do not hesitate to give us a call 804-401-4110 you can get in touch with us there or on our website at spanberger.org thank you for joining this evening and i look forward to taking your questions all right thank you very much congresswoman and we're going to get the lines open here we're going to start off with trina and trina has a question about getting in touch with the irs trainer what is your question for the congresswoman well my question was i helped my mom emailed the office and i we clicked on the irs department and basically my father passed away in 2018 and after she filed taxes um that went okay but the following year um the irs listed her as deceased and they won't change it they blame the social security office social security office says it's not us it's them um reapply for your uh passport and your social security card and it'll make you a citizen again and then you'll be back in the system and you'll be able to do it but nothing working she never got any of her stimulus she can't fight i mean they take taxes out of her paychecks but they're not letting her file her taxes they're not letting her pay they're not going to get her refunds because they say she doesn't exist and so a representative did call her back and say we need to email you some information so we can get more information on you and they just never did it and so she's called um the number back and they just haven't returned her call well trina i i want to first begin by saying i'm so sorry with with your father's passing this is not what your mother should be contending with um and and so my office is happy to help i appreciate you billing being willing to share your story during the town hall because i i do hope that um anyone listening will understand that these are the sorts of circumstances that we can uh provide assistance with so i'm i'm gonna go ahead and take your information or have one of my team members take your information off the public aspect of the line but just for the purposes of the town hall i wanted to let everybody know that what will happen next is we'll follow up with with trina and her mother and open a case and what that means is we'll file for privacy disclosures uh we'll need trina's mother to give us permission trina will need your mother to give us permission for us to do an inquiry on her behalf uh to look into her circumstance and to receive some correspondence between us and the irs and then moving on from there we'll be able to follow up on the circumstance um ensure that we can assist in this inquiry and make sure that we get it fixed very very quickly so i look forward to working with you and your mother i'm so sorry for these circumstances but hopefully we'll be able to assist you in getting answers and so we'll move you off the public line so we can take your details and have someone from our team follow up with you thank you so much next up we have richard and richard has a question about the border and illegal immigration richard you're on live with congresswoman spanberger thank you congresswoman spanberger i i like a lot of the things you're doing uh my concern continues to grow on the border on immigration i know you've done some some action on that for illegal drugs and whatever but this is just expanding and expanding rate you know we're going to allow 100 000 uh ukrainians come in which have valid reasons coming but that's half a month supply that's coming across the border right now there needs to be some immediate controls put on that particularly when the title 42 is being released this is kind of a lame excuse to stop people but there needs to be some bipartisan action immediately to stop the drain on the train across the border because there's there's costs associated with that for the long term i'd like to know what what what's the latest that you may be doing on to stop this well thank you for this this question richard um and and certainly the latest that i've been doing is about as of about 10 minutes ago um i was i was putting the finishing touches on um a formal correspondence that i plan on uh following up with uh the department of homeland security so um let me just outline some of the concerns that that i have which may be similar to yours um and maybe different and then go from there and explaining my take on on what comes next uh certainly i am proud of the fact that the united states continues to be an extraordinary place a beacon of hope a destination that so many people only dream of of ever getting to um we are a land of opportunity we are a country of immigrants and that is what has made us strong throughout our history we also are a country where we need to have law and order along our borders be they are points of entry at airports or points of entry along the southern border or the northern border and and really what we are contending with is ongoing challenges in part because of covid um in part because of natural disasters throughout central america that um over time have sent people looking for refuge again in the united states um and and now with the crisis in ukraine um in the invasion of ukraine by the russians uh we see ukrainians fleeing uh mostly and predominantly throughout europe but certainly um many with family here in the united states are also attempting to rejoin a rejoined family uh some of the concerns that i have related to um upcoming changes is um there's an intended reversal of title 42 and so for those who aren't familiar title 42 is a public health emergency circumstance that limits the number of individuals that can cross the border and file for asylum here in the united states it's been in place since the early days of the pandemic as part of a public health mitigation strategy that was implemented under the prior administration and continued in the current administration um ultimately we need to move to a place where title 42 is no longer in place but my concern is that we is whether we are indeed prepared to make that shift um certainly my inquiry to secretary mayorkus and to the department of homeland security is what is the plan what is the plan that we have to contend with what we know will be an increased um surge of immigration towards the southern border notably uh seasonably seasonally we see shifts in migration towards the southern border anyway so independent of any changes that may or may not occur with title 42 we should anticipate an increase um i want to know what the plan is from the department of homeland security to contend with uh increases in potential um um encounters apprehensions um and and detentions for for onward processing uh currently border patrol is at or exceeding its capacity its operational capacity at this moment um certainly we have in the omnibus provided greater funding uh to dhs but ensuring that they have all that they need in terms of personnel technology resources supplies i mean uh humanitarian supplies food and and um and resources for anyone who may be um held in detention or be processed through our system you know these are all of the questions i have in terms of what are the needs that um that they anticipate and what are the plans to ensure that we're meeting those needs um it is imperative that when we have a shift in policy uh we are prepared for it so i've been um i think it's important that this plan be laid out clearly defined well before any changes in border um policy are implemented in this case at the current moment it would be title 42. um and this is a humanitarian priority as well because certainly my my background is um in national security i'm a former cia officer i worked for a time in what was then called the counter-narcotic center uh cia undertook some naming convention changes but um the counter-narcotic center in that role i tracked drug smuggling throughout the world uh for a time i was handling an asset who was reporting on cartels operating throughout mexico and the impact of their dealings their financial engagement and their violence on the stability of the mexican government and regional governments um and so noting that surges in migration also equate to increased revenue for uh narco traffickers and cartels is yet another aspect of this larger discussion related to immigration we want certainly one i certainly want uh to protect um every person who might be interested in arriving at the united states claiming asylum working here coming as a refugee whatever the parameters or the need that that that begins their desire to move to our country um it's incredibly important that they avoid potential violence on that thousand mile long journey depending upon their point of origination uh the thousands upon thousands of u.s dollars that it costs to pay smugglers to get one uh to the border or across the border um and then the increased revenues and what that might mean for narco traffickers is something that's of great concern to me um i did have legislation um under the last administration uh bipartisan legislation focused on informing um and planning our strategies related to the border pulling on building on intelligence related to narco-traffickers and human traffickers that was bipartisan legislation that i led with uh republican will hurd from texas and it was signed into law by by president trump so certainly richard this has been an area of great interest and long interest um and i think that it's imperative that we uphold our country's values certainly um ensure the safety and security of anyone who might be interested um in filing for asylum or potentially working in the united states and we need to recognize the the operational constraints and challenges that our border agencies face and be prepared to ensure they have the resources that they need um one more comment there among the other things that i'm urging the administration to consider would be um third country review for asylum cases certainly this is something that's currently done with minors being able to expand it out to um as single adult travelers or fuller families is potentially a way that we can relieve some of the numbers that may surge towards the border but also ensure that we're watching out for and ensuring uh not just the safety of those who might be otherwise making longer treks towards the southern border but also denying revenue to the the human traffickers uh who would charge them exorbitant amounts of uh money to make that charge um so those are among the things that i'm expressing concern over legislation of various elements that i'm working on certainly that bill that i passed last last congress with congressman heard um and um continuing to to press the administration for fulsome plans that include how we might contend with not just the numbers of individuals at the border but the impact that has on resources um individuals you know certain staffing technology et cetera but also the impact that it has um on on the whole of the hemisphere in terms of potentially increased revenues to human traffickers and destabilizing implications that that might have in in mexico and the rest of central america uh so uh stay stay tuned i'll continue to be um publicly pushing out information related to the actions that i might take um in this space but um i appreciate your concern richard and i appreciate you um raising it in a way where i um have the opportunity to speak to a variety of different elements of this larger discussion and because i took so long answering the question of course i want to say a lot more related to the farm workforce modernization act and the dream and promise act um but i feel that i've gone lengthy if anyone wants to hear more about those specific pieces of legislation uh that sort of meet the the economic and uh um and and demands of of the united states then i'm i'm happy to follow up but um i could probably spend another 10 minutes filibustering on this and i wish to get to the next question so uh thank you so much for listening thank you for your question richard all right thank you congresswoman as a reminder forum is interactive and we'd love to hear your questions if you have a question you can press star 3 on your keypad at any time to get in the queue to ask a question a member of congresswoman spamberger staff will collect your questions you can also ask a question by submitting one through the portal below our online streaming player at spanberger.house.gov again that's spamberger.how forward slash live if you're watching on facebook live tonight and you wish to ask congresswoman spanberger a question we encourage you to visit that online streaming portal so you can submit your question now back to the phones we're going to go to brandon brandon has a question about inflation brandon you're on live now with the congresswoman hey thank you congresswoman for taking the time my question is it deals with inflation but i think part of that is as we go around in our daily lives we see so many of the policies and both parties sort of playing to the extremes on either end of the spectrum and what it feels like i think for most average americans is that we're getting left behind in the dust in other words nobody seems to really be listening to the concerns that we have one of your previous speakers talked about the border i think everybody's concerned about inflation we've got social issues that are going on recently the president discussed additional restrictions on guns and i think for a lot of us we're asking the question of you know are we addressing crime in other words you know we're talking about guns but are we truly going to the problem and addressing crime there are a lot of people who are killed with knives and other types of weapons besides ghost guns i know that that's important so my question for you and i appreciate you taking the time is where do you stand on a lot of these issues that i think are impacting regardless of whether it's democrat or republican but most of us in the center who see a lot of these issues with inflation of crime and and you know some of these other social issues and where where do you stand on these and what are you doing to address some of these problems within your capacity thank you so much for this question so i am focused on trying to find solutions trying to in some cases where we can solve a problem outright i'm trying to do that where we have to kind of hit at a problem in different places from different angles i'm trying to do that um i also share your frustration with uh some of the the hyper partisanship that certainly has invaded capitol hill um and you know i i am proud that i am raided by the luger center as the most bipartisan member of the virginia delegation and and what that means to me and the reason that i was receiving that award and then i will get to your question um is that you know i work really hard to build coalitions i work really hard to build bipartisan coalitions around good ideas um and garner support for those ideas and work to try and get them across the finish line the the border security bill that i worked on with will hurd that's how we achieve that i do a lot as it relates to addiction and recovery um lowering the cost of prescription drugs and much of this work ensuring that rural hospitals representing a district such as this that has so many rural communities that rural hospitals are receiving the rebates that are owed to them that help them care for their communities and populations you know all of these things i i build out bipartisan coalitions um but for the everyday things that are impacting everyday people well first and foremost i would say you know i'm i'm an everyday person i'm impacted by the challenges that everyone else on the call is facing um and i also then have the unique responsibility to advocate for um for changes and for legislation that would impact it so if we're talking about inflation right inflation wasn't caused in a day it won't be fixed in a day but there are things that we can do to impact the experience that you or i have at the grocery store when we see the cost of food um going up and so i mentioned in my opening remarks the legislation related to um to truck drivers because whether i'm with cattle producers or loggers or small businesses within the district or truck drivers um one of the things that i hear about so frequently is that a gap in the supply chain a challenge in the supply chain is the fact that we have a shortage of 80 000 truck drivers nationwide and we are feeling that here at home and so the bill that i worked on and introduced with ref gallagher from wisconsin is meant to recruit and retain truck drivers it has the endorsement of multiple truck driving associations both national and local as well as other organizations that depend on truck drivers to make their businesses go um because it's thoughtful legislation that will get at the heart of this problem another example of trying to address these challenges is the cost of me among all of the things that we purchase meat has been one of the places where we've seen real surges in prices i also represent in our district many cattle producers who are particularly impacted by the centralization and i would call it the monopolization in the meatpacking industry and so i led two efforts one is a bipartisan bill called the butcher block act that would make it easier for local meat processors so local large-scale butchers to be created in communities across virginia so that our cattle producers are not dependent on these sort of choke points that really control the market and that would allow them to sell locally and have usd sort of usda certification when they do so um so this bill is a really important and relatively common sense solution and some of it i'm proud to say has actually been enacted by rulemaking by usda because it is such a straightforward effort and making the system better another element of the problem is that there is a monopoly of these large-scale meat producers and so i'm leading legislation in the house and senator tester has it in the senate that would move forward with an investigation because these monopolies are not only pushing smaller meat processors out of business or making it impossible for them to enter the market but it has downstream impacts on meat producers right here in virginia and that has downstream impacts on you and me at the grocery store um and so these are the sorts of things that i'm working on they're not the flashiest of solutions but if you're a cattle producer in nottaway county it matters and if you're buying meat uh somewhere along the line it it matters um as it relates to gas prices um and and this is a space where i've been really um pretty forceful with the administration urging them to release from the strategic petroleum reserve because part of the challenge that we see has been ebbs and flows and demand and supply and certainly um you know while we had increasing gas prices uh in part due to the pandemic and supply chains um certainly we've seen heightened uncertainty in global oil markets because of russia's invasion of ukraine and so i pushed for the administration to release from the strategic petroleum reserve um and they did and now we are seeing barrels of oil the prices are decreasing but but locally at the price well we've seen a slight um decrease um uh and you know i'm driving up and down 95 between uh capitol hill in the district certainly i i keep an eye on on prices so there is some variation um but we have seen some small decreases which gives me a bit of hope but it hasn't kept pace with the decrease in um in overall production so i'm um excuse me with it hasn't kept pace with the overall reduction in price of the barrel of oil um just last week the united states house of representatives and the senate had oil executives come before congress um to ensure that um to question them about what's happening why prices um are are not being um why prices are not falling now that there's increased supply and also to question as to why it is that there's more than 9000 unused leases that these oil companies possess and are choosing not to pump from um so you know these are the sorts of some of these actions in response to your question or legislative actions that i've taken some of them are efforts that i've taken direct with the administration certainly president biden came out with an announcement today related to ethanol um which is um uh uh something his announcement is something i'll be tracking very very closely in terms of what that might need for energy production um and you know i think ultimately i also am a member of the bipartisan group the problem solvers caucus we're 29 democrats and 29 republicans who endeavor to work together on a whole host of issues we don't certainly don't agree on everything but the intent is that we want to build coalitions around good ideas and try to find solutions to problems um even on to some of the most contentious contentious issues notably and i'll end with this um three years ago i traveled to the border when there was a particular surge at that time of of individuals to the border i traveled to the border with a bipartisan delegation uh to ensure that not only could i uh see the the circumstance and ask questions um both next to and in front of my colleagues from across the aisle but that they have that same experience um and that group in fact we upon our return uh back to capitol hill worked on a couple different pieces of legislation um focused on trying to get at um the the challenges of you know many many years delayed uh in terms of immigration reform uh one of the bills that we worked on as an as an entity and now i get to talk about it was the farm workforce modernization act which is a bill that recognizes that throughout our communities particularly our agricultural communities there is a significant need for labor and for foreign-born labor and that there is a significant number of people who are most willing and excited and proud to do that work and would love to get visas to be able to do so legally and there are many employers who would love to bring people to the united states to work either in seasonal labor uh or year-round labor um at dairies and greenhouses or seasonal uh with some of our our row crops uh throughout the district and the country uh this bipartisan piece of legislation passed the house of representatives with strong bipartisan support uh it provides for the security of knowing who is entering the country through the utilization of e-verify and it also ensures that employers throughout the country have access to the workforce that they want to hire legally the bill passed the house of representatives with bipartisan support and was not able to garner uh a vote in the senate but these are the sorts of you know some of the bills i've mentioned have moved forward um some have moved forward in the house uh are facing some hurdles in the senate but i'll keep doing the work of trying to push to remove those hurdles and and come up with some of these pretty straightforward solutions to the challenges that that people face but i appreciate this question and the opportunity to speak to a variety of issues related to inflation all right thank you next up we have jamie is a nurse who's concerned with rising mental health issues jamie you're on live with congresswoman spanberger what is your question hello and thank you for everything that you are doing to support virginia i am in the healthcare industry and a nurse and i work in the richmond virginia area i guess my concerns um you know pre and post covid and still dealing with covid is our mental health crisis our substance abuse disorder crisis rural health and homeless populations and then what are we doing you know once a patient is ready or leaves the hospital and is discharged like where are our programs with um some of the issues that i just spoke about and you know our outs our outreach programs that can continue to follow a patient support a patient for both short-term and long-term goals so that they're not ending back as you know repeat citizens coming into our very busy emergency centers thank you oh my goodness jamie i really appreciate this question because it gets at the heart of so many things first and foremost i want to thank you for your service to our community as a nurse um my my mother is a nurse i'm a daughter of a nurse um and i am just acutely aware of the tremendous work that you do um to to keep our community safe and thank you for advocating for your patience um quite frankly which is exactly what it is that you're doing um in this call um with this question so i want to speak overarching uh jamie mentioned the the impact of kova the challenges that people are facing she mentioned addiction and substance use disorders um and i just want to note that we now are at a place where year over year we had an 18 increase in overdose deaths last year um since 2013 in the commonwealth of virginia overdose is the leading cause of unnatural death so higher than car accidents higher than other accidents it is the leading cause of unnatural death in virginia and even with that high rate we had a record number of overdoses um during the pandemic and so i have worked on issues related to mental health related to substance use disorder in a variety of different ways up until recently when recently i introduced a really substantial piece of legislation that i'm proud of the prior ways that i've worked on it has been in the american rescue plan ensuring that money that went to localities and schools had significant flexibility for our school systems and our localities to be able to utilize those funds to support mental health crises to support substance use disorder and recovery to support children facing unique stressors caused by the pandemic i've also led an effort to have a 10 set aside of dollars focused on recovery efforts so um within the substance abuse block grant funding we have um dollars for treatment for prevention for education and and we have incredible organizations throughout virginia and the rest of the country that utilize these dollars to support our community and so frequently by the time we get to that person in recovery so that person who's who's battled their addiction they're trying to maintain their recovery but particularly with the stresses of the pandemic they have faltered and they need additional support um and that's where this set-aside would say we need to lock in those dollars so that our community's investment jamie's investment in keeping people safe and helping them through their addiction is is able uh to be realized into a long-term reality of somebody who moves from short-term recovery to long-term recovery um and so i i want to talk about the my most recent effort in this space which is called the summer barrow um act and it is legislation that um well it's actually called the summer barrel prevention treatment and recovery act um and it's legislation that's named after a young woman who died in the seventh district and you know throughout my time in in congress and and actually even as a as a candidate before i was ever elected i've had the extraordinary um opportunity to hear from family members from loved ones from parents about someone they have lost to addiction um and what i have found upon my arrival to capitol hill is just about everybody is touched some way or knows someone who's been touched by addiction or by overdose um and in my conversations not just with healthcare providers with like jamie but recovery advocates we have some incredible recovery organizations in virginia we have incredible work being done um in some of our jails that are doing really um proactive engagement efforts to help people in their recovery and law enforcement i have heard directly from law enforcement officers sheriffs and police chiefs about the challenges that they face time and time again and the stressors that their officers face and deputies face time and time again when they're responding to these health care crises and mental health crises so this bill the summer barrel prevention treatment and recovery act what it does is it it pulls out 12 programs so existing programs that we know work that help our communities to create uh a comprehensive response to how we can address substance use disorder and it reauthorizes these grant programs to support states and communities local work and recognizes the value of them and among some of the things that they do i'll just give a couple examples is it encourages alternates to opioid use so many of the individuals with whom i've spoken who have developed a substance use disorder particularly as it relates to opioids began with a prescription from a doctor they had a tooth pulled they had a surgery a woman had a cesarean section and they're prescribed opioids they become addicted and very quickly their addiction turns to heroin and in tragically too many cases they overdose so ensuring that there's alternatives to opioids and that patients are well-versed at their risk with with um with opioids expanding jail diversion programs um certainly jamie mentioned that people who come through the er where else are they supposed to go people who are experiencing homelessness and mental health crisis where else are they supposed to go well many of the people who flow into our jail system are individuals who have severe mental illness which is or who are struggling with addiction which is why some of our communities jails have created recovery programs within the jails but in talking to the leaders of these programs they're the first ones to say the jail is not where this should be this should be a resource within the community so that somebody doesn't ever get to jail and so this program would continue those this bill would continue those grant programs would also improve access to emergency treatment and really ensure that there's essential programs for those who are homeless also experiencing mental illness so that they can get the support that they need um and i i want to just thank jamie for this question because there's so many aspects to this larger issue certainly as a mental health provider um i i also just wanted to note that there's a bill that i was proud to co-sponsor and vote for called the lorna brain healthcare provider protection act which supports healthcare providers access to mental health services and protects and to protect them and to fight against the stigma of seeking treatment this bill was signed into law and um while i'm proud to have co-sponsored and voted for it um i i'm sad that it is in fact named after a virginia health care provider who during the darkest days of the pandemic um was struggling with uh some of what she had seen and took her on life um and but i'm i'm proud that we can remember her legacy by making sure that health care providers as well um are able to receive the the support that they need um especially during these ongoing challenges that that we face in our communities so again jamie thank you for your your work um and and thank you for giving me the opportunity to talk about a bill that i i care so much about well in addition to the telephone questions number of online questions in our queue so let's go there next and call this woman this is a question from molly molly asks we've come up with ways to give seniors access to free or affordable health care but our patients still are having a hard time paying for prescriptions how quickly can we see a difference in costs and thank you for all you've done well i it's too bad that uh that question uh isn't from someone on the phones because i would want to ask a follow-up question but i think that what we're talking about here is that seniors who are on medicare certainly um there's uh significant benefits to being on medicare but when it comes to prescription drugs those can still be so incredibly costly this is why and if you've listened to prior town halls you've most certainly heard me talk about this bill before this is why i've been such a proponent of hr3 the lower prescription drug costs now act and that bill would um ensure that medicare can negotiate the cost of its prescription drugs and be able to actually negotiate for cost savings currently and this may seem just extraordinary within our capitalist country but medicare is prohibited by law from negotiating the cost of the prescription drugs that it utilizes um and those costs go to medicare users in the va system the va can negotiate of course if you have a private insurer they can negotiate but here we have medicare legally prohibited from being able to negotiate so hr3 would allow for medicare to be able to negotiate the cost of prescription drugs and then it would actually allow for commercial insurers to be able to leverage those same negotiated rates so the benefit is not only to those who utilize medicare but in fact anyone uh kind of across the board in the united states that utilizes prescription drugs this bill's past the house uh with bipartisan support i i am working to ensure uh that it can move forward in the senate but that does not seem like it's on the quick horizon so we worked on a different version that would allow medicare to negotiate certain drugs uh not all of them but certain drugs and also uh to cap the price of medicare part d copays right which would be incredibly important allow for seniors presumably on a fixed income to know and be able to plan for what their prescription drug uh prices would be this is another piece of legislation that passed through the house or continuing to advocate i'm continuing to advocate um uh for this bill to to move in the house and then ultimately in the senate so it would cap again prescription drug costs um at two thousand dollars a year uh which is just transformative and in fact i guess i would note that i brought president biden to culpepper county virginia in our district to hear directly from people that i represent about the impact of prescription drug prices and exorbitant prescription drug prices on their families we had young constituents we had seniors on medicare everybody in between because i want to make clear to the president of the united states and most importantly i want the people i represent to make clear directly to the president of the united states that this is an issue uh that is a an important one here in virginia and certainly across the country um and and when i talk about the inability of medicare to be able to negotiate the cost of prescription drugs and how that that implication is not just a negative impact for those who require drugs but frankly for anybody who's utilizing medicare i think you have probably seen some of the news reports related to the alzheimer's drug um that costs 56 000 a year um and when there was a recent announcement in changes in medicare premiums um that was because that that 56 000 a year was just the cost that the drug companies said they would be charging uh and there was not even an option for medicare to be able to negotiate so it's not just about lowering the cost of prescription drugs which of course is part and parcel of it but it's also by extension being able to lower premiums as well all right thank you as a quick reminder that this is an interactive

slash live if you're watching on facebook live tonight and wish to ask congresswoman spamberger a question we encourage you to visit that online streaming portal so you can submit your question and now we're going to go back to the phones we got uh paul from louisa paul's got a question about ukraine paul you're now on live with congresswoman spanberger what is your question honorable representative spamberger um many of us are uh have become very emotional about the war the russian invasion of ukraine um it brings some of us for some of us in our 60s it brings us back to uh relatives who may have come from europe in world war ii and i'm i'm i'm trying not to become emotional about this but um my question is at what point um i i know uh we we don't want to invoke nuclear action we're afraid of nuclear action um i also know that look we have you the cia we have mi5 and we have mossad to potentially take out putin um but at what point in your opinion and perhaps you cannot voice this but at what point in your opinion do we trigger um us getting involved in nato getting involved to save these people in ukraine thank you for this this question um and so much of what you touched upon is um is a topic of regular conversation and debate uh so i'll try to touch on a couple things which one um i think that the images that we have seen coming out of ukraine have been more and more horrifying day by day um and i'll i'll i'll get and the reality of that uh you know i'm a i'm a mother i have two elementary school children a middle school child um and the images of children who've been killed or um women and their babies in a maternity ward who've been bombed trains that have been attacked and families that have been murdered in the streets uh the reality of what this war is what this grotesque invasion is um is is i think becoming ever clearer day by day um and the atrocities that uh the russian soldiers have committed um with vladimir putin at the helm um are are reprehensible um so so let me talk through from an american perspective what it is that we have done um and how it is that we continue to help and and i recognize and and i continue uh to be questioning every single day what's next what comes next what do we do next first and foremost we led and have led our partners in imposing crushing sanctions crushing sanctions um which has destabilized russian's economy made them a pariah on the world stage and we've done it in a way that has unified our nato and our security partners the world over i have worked on and co-sponsored legislation that would not just sanction russian uh oligarchs and those who are the subject of sanctions but seize their items seize their items so that when we can assist in the rebuilding of ukraine we will do it with the ill-gotten gains um well with the i would argue actually the well-gotten gains of the items that we have sanctioned and seized from those who enable this horrific war we have provided substantial military assistance certainly the stingers and the javelins switchblade drones all of which the ukrainians have used in an exceptional way as they continue defending themselves and their democracy we have facilitated and worked with other partner countries to facilitate the transfer of other lethal aid weapon systems the recent announcement that slovakia will be providing s 300 is such an important and timely announcement and it's one that is made possible because the united states will be backfilling their their capacity uh with american-made weapons um and and this is a an important step forward a really valuable one um and and and one that i'm proud that the united states helped facilitate um those are the sorts of things that we are doing out in the open and and fully clear we're also providing um medical supplies and intelligence and information to the ukrainians um and have been supporting their actions um directly um in a whole host of ways um i believe that in your question you know it was well what what do we do to trigger uh you know what what what comes next and um what are the concerns related to to triggering a response and and you mentioned nato in your question so for anyone listening who who may not have been following this as closely the challenge that we continue to face is that we are in a an alliance with our fellow nato countries and so the minute uh we are engaged in a wartime conflict uh we are essentially triggering the involvement of all those other countries which is the challenge when we talk about issues related to whether we engage militarily we send u.s soldiers the issue there is that our decision to send u.s soldiers would be a decision essentially to send all of nato um and that is the challenge uh that that exists um i was heartened um by the visit that we saw of boris johnson to keeve to visit with zielinski uh certainly i hope that we will see um various members of the administration follow suit um and have on the ground visits with uh ukrainian leadership to demonstrate our support uh for them and ongoing support um but but i think that what is also an important um uh parameter to to get to your question is um you know i think we'll know more in the in the coming days there's of course reports that there may have been a chemical attack uh potentially against civilians uh by russians and so recognizing the reality or the truth behind that um will be an important determiner of what comes next but i do think it's very important that this administration has not uh put out any uh stated red lines because i think the the worst thing that we could do would be to state a red line um and then uh not adhere to it so i will tell you that there are constant briefings for members of congress and i serve on the foreign affairs committee uh and certainly have more briefings due to that assignment um there are constant briefings for the whole of congress and particularly those of us with relevant committees and we are day by day continuing to assess uh the the circumstances on the ground u.s level of engagement and i will tell you that i continue to encourage the administration that certainly there is a line where we would trigger nato involvement but we should spend every single day pressed up against that line uh supporting the ukrainians with everything anything that they need in order to be able to defend themselves uh their people and their democracy their bravery is astounding and i'm really grateful that um people here on the ground in virginia's seventh district are thinking of them advocating for them uh and and holding me accountable for um uh with questions about what the united states is doing uh now and into the future um i can also provide additional information related to the provision of thousands of uh sets of body armor and helmet um billions of dollars in support um but um but i i can follow that up with you on that sir if you provide uh if you'd be interested in additional uh kind of listed details so thank you for the question all right thank you next up we're going to go to wayne on the phone when wayne is from henrico and he has got a question about inflation when you're on live with congresswoman spamberger thank you very much my number one concern is inflation today the federal government announced that the cpi index for the first quarter is 8.3 percent the highest in decades i voted for president biden in 2020 but now i'm totally disenchanted with him and democrats by the fact that much of our huge increase in inflation is due to actions by biden and i is very exasperated by the fact he's not taking any responsibility for it give you two examples he put eight thousand of my union brothers out of work when he stopped the keystone pipeline and he also imposed when he came in office very restrictive regulations on the oil companies in the area of r d of new oral refineries question what are you doing you personally doing to stand up to president biden and speaker of the house nancy pelosi to put the voters first in fighting inflation thank you thank you for this question um and and thank you for being so honest with uh where you were in 2020 and and what your disappointments are and you know i've i've been i've been quoted before saying and in fact it's it's been used to attack me that you know ultimately the buck stops with the president but i think that's real uh regardless of the source of inflation and and certainly um i you know i would i would make the statement that inflation isn't caused by any one thing it's been a variety of circumstances and certainly in a global pandemic we had circumstances like nothing we've ever seen before but ultimately uh it's the president of the united states as uh responsibility uh to try and work with us members of congress uh the communities to rectify these problems um and so i have been very clear um in the fact that regardless of the cause it's our responsibility to contend with it um so in in terms of the things that i have been doing to deal with inflation um you know i mentioned some of the supply chain related issues specifically um that cause an increase of prices when we are at the grocery store at the pump um and out and about living our daily lives um notably when it comes to um other things we can be doing to combating inflation it it comes down to the types of investments that we're making um and and certainly i have heard and and continue to hear uh from some constituents that you know in the early days of the pandemic and continuing on that uh we spent a lot most of it was bipartisan in nature um but we ensured that small businesses would survive we ensure that localities have the resources they need to contend with just extraordinary circumstances of the pandemic and i continue to believe that ensuring that the small businesses that are the economic drivers across our district that they can survive is incredibly um important and so i think that we've made good choices as it relates to supporting small businesses as it relates to supporting communities and schools um and then looking towards the future uh we need to recognize that we are not out of the woods inflation as you mentioned um is a at record-breaking levels which is uh something that should be uh an alarm uh moment for anyone and so among the things that i have done apart from related to truck driver legislation supply chain related legislation urging the administration to appoint a supply chain czar which they have not yet done but i think is important to have a whole of government approach urging the administration to release from the strategic petroleum reserve which they have done i continue to advocate for us to um pass bipartisan pieces of legislation that would meaningfully impact the needs across our communities um and that are focused on the things that frankly i'm hearing uh from from you all in fact it makes me realize an earlier caller discussed crime uh in a question and i think i i didn't fully answer that aspect of the question so i would add you know i have drafted and sponsored legislation that would provide nearly triple the funding to the community oriented policing grant so those are the cops funding because in fact when we're looking at the challenges of crime that we're facing in our community some of it's related to the ongoing addiction crisis some of it's related to ongoing mental health crisis and i got to some of the challenges there um but we also need uh a strong uh and well-trained uh police force uh here in you know our ten counties across our district but across the country and so investing in community oriented policing programs grant programs that allow for recruitment and vetting and training of our law enforcement is part and parcel particularly at a time when we continue to see our first responders be they ems and fire be they law enforcement or be they the folks at you when you arrive at the emergency room continue to see some of the most tragic and difficult circumstances that they've seen in their career and i recently spoke with uh one of the providers in our district uh at a ems uh an ems uh fire chief excuse me um who was saying that right now folks going out on calls are seeing things that it previously would have taken somebody 15 20 years to see and they're seeing it time and time again and the stressors that that creates are real challenges uh create real challenges for them for the departments and for our overall response and so you know what i what i seek to illustrate in this answer is that there are pieces of meaningful legislation and meaningful change that we can enact that have uh impact on people um i and and while not related to inflation i also do a lot of work related to trying to clean up congress um you know i have a background in national security um and i think it's incredibly important that every person on this call who might agree with my answers might disagree with my answers might agree with my policy or disagree with my policy should know that every day i am working for the people of this district uh whether you like the job i'm doing or not is a different question um and and so i am leading efforts which the last caller asked about where i might be pushing up against um leadership uh in congress and surely this is this is one place where i'm um advocating for uh the prohibition of members of congress house or senate being able to trade in individual stocks certainly there's been unbelievable um allegations though they're true uh of members of congress who in the early days of the pandemic are buying pfizer stock members of congress as russia is invading ukraine buying uh lockheed martin stock and so it is just outrageous to me that while any member of congress or while while any member of congress is contending with the challenges before facing the people of of our communities that they might be uh buying or selling individual stocks so well well not related to the issue of inflation certainly and i uh recognize that i think it's important from a good governance standpoint uh to demonstrate that i think that you uh constituents people i represent here in the seventh district should know that uh any member of congress is constantly focused on public service and not their own portfolio and that's why i continue to push for us to be able to ban members of congress from from trading individual stocks it's not the best way to make friends on capitol hill actually but i believe in it so i continue to work for it and to get that legislation moving forward but uh thank you for this question and and certainly um sir thank you for your advocacy on behalf of your union brothers and sisters and uh thank you for your questions and that's going to bring us to the end of our q a portion of the town hall this evening we're coming to an end of our live event but before we go i'm going to turn the floor back over to congresswoman spamberger for some final comments thank you so much for all of your questions this evening certainly i think that they touched upon the issues that i hear about most frequently when i am out and about across our 10 counties inflation uh prices at the grocery store gas prices uh certainly the conti concerns that people have related to the border concerns that people have related to the uh the russian invasion of ukraine um and and overall uh concerns about mental health substance use disorder um and some of the uncertainty that exists uh in today's day and age so i appreciate the opportunity to share with you the work that i've been doing on capitol hill uh and and certainly the advocacy that i've been working on legislatively for um for bills that would meaningfully impact so many of these issues i i thank you for your time this evening thank you for joining me and uh i would like to remind everyone that if you're having any challenges with a federal agency uh that i would urge you to give our office a call uh four eight zero four four zero one or one one zero and we send out regular

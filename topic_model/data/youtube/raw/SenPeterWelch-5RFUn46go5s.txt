  HUFFMAN. PETER WELCH OF VERMONT AND   CONGRESSMAN WELCH CALLS  ATTENTION TO A STORY OF A  DREAMER THAT HE KNOWS. AND IT'S A LETTER FROM JUAN. JUAN, MASTER OF SCIENCE,   MARYLAND IN CURRENT MEDICAL  STUDENT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF   VERMONT. THIS IS KILLING ME.  STANDING UP IS NOTHING, BEING  THIRSTY IS NOTHING.  DEAR CONGRESSMAN WELCH, I TELL   YOU MY STORY ABOUT DACA AND THE  COLLEAGUES WILL COME UP WITH A   LEGISLATIVE SOLUTION.  I'M ONE OF THE DREAMER KIDS. I LIVED MOST OF MY LIFE IN THE   UNITED STATES. I HAVE UNDERSTOOD CANCER AND   OBJECT SUSTAINED THE TRAINING  NEEDED TO HELP CANCER PATIENTS.  THIS TRAGGETTY MADE ME REALIZE   THAT I WANTED TO FIGHT.  I DEDICATED MY LIFE IN RESEARCH  AND THEN D.N.A. OF TOBACCO AND   SMOKE FROM MY DOCTORAL STUDY.  I CHOSE SCIENCE BECAUSE IT WAS   IMPOSSIBLE FOR STUDENTS TO   ATTEND MEDICAL SCHOOL AND I  WANTED AN IMPACT ON A DISEASE  THAT AFFECTED MY FAMILY. BUT I PERSISTED BECAUSE I  BELIEVED IN THE PROMISE OF THE   AMERICAN DREAM.  WHEN DACA WAS ANNOUNCED, IT  TRANSFORMED MY LIFE. I COULD BE FREE OF THE FEAR OF   DEPORTATION KNOWING THAT MY HARD WORK WOULD BE NOT MEANINGLESS. AND MEDICAL SCHOOLS INCLUDING MY CURRENT SCHOOL, UNIVERSITY OF  VERMONT COLLEGE OF MEDICINE GAVE DACA STUDENTS A CHANCE TO  ENROLL.  I UNDERSTAND THAT LEGISLATION  TAKES TIME, BUT IF THERE IS  ANYTHING INCLUDING A DISCHARGE   PETITION, PLEASE DO SO.  IF YOU DO, YOU WILL HAVE THE   GRATITUDE OF A GROUP OF  DEDICATED INDIVIDUALS WHO WISH   TO GIVE BACK TO T

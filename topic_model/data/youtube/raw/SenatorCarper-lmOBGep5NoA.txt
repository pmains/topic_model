thank you mr chairman our ranking member chuck grassley and all of our colleagues on this committee and uh thanks for giving me a chance to introduce greg williams for his confirmation hearing to serve as a judge on the u.s district court for the district of delaware i always want also also want to acknowledge my delaware wingman and friend and our colleague senator chris coons remember this committee who shares my belief and the belief of the american bar association that greg williams is well qualified and well suited to serve in this important role for delaware and for our nation a few years ago senator coons and i had the opportunity to make recommendations to the white house for two vacancies on this very same court there was a president then of a different political party and there was a different political party in the majority in the united states senate at the time our process then and now was simple and straightforward and borrowed heavily from a process that we use while i was serving as governor of the state of delaware we relied then and relied now on a judicial nominating commission of sorts and charged them with a simple task here was the task find the most qualified individual regardless of political party and help us make recommendations to the president we use that same process this time around it serves delaware well serves our nation well and has yielded yet another extraordinary nominee mr chairman and colleagues greg williams is a partner the firm of fox rothschild he's a former president of the delaware state bar association and president biden's nominee to serve as the next judge on the u.s district court for delaware but greg is more than a lawyer and he's much more than that he's a husband he's a father he's a son and he's a brother in fact he's the youngest brother in his family of five with get this four older sisters uh and even though those four sisters couldn't be here with us today i wanted to know that they did a good job of helping to raise him and make sure he got on the right path even leading him here today greg is joined here today by his high school sweetheart and wife of 27 years terina trina welcome big uh by his anissa uh i'm hoping to screw this up too badly jamatka and uh and by his godmother joan reed and her two children george reed and scott uh reed who are really more like greg's second mom and brothers there are also several of greg and terina's friends uh represent present with us uh today i want to thank you all for help for being an important part of greg's support network and uh terina a special thanks to you for your willingness to share your husband with our country so that if confirmed he might have an opportunity to serve in this important role a villanova law grad greg has worked at one of the top law firms in the country fox rock trial for the past 28 years through hard work and commitment to excellence in 2003 greg became the first african-american attorney to have been hired as an associate and then be later named as a partner at fox rothschild greg learned those values hard work and commitment to excellence in part as a member of the us army reserve where he served from 1986 to 1994. after law school greg embarked on a successful legal career that has earned him the respect and admiration of delaware's highly regarded legal community greg has a particular expertise in intellectual property and other business litigation which makes him particularly well suited for the delaware district court more than his professional qualifications though is his personification of the golden rule which causing us to treat one another the way we want to be treated he is the personification of judicial temperament like senator coons and me and many of our colleagues greg is a person of deep faith who understands what the words golden rule actually mean and if confirmed i believe that he will use it to guide him on the bench let me close by saying this colleague we've all uh heard uh uh saying that's oftentimes uh used in relations to boxing the boxing that's talking about an undersized boxer who punches above his or her weight the delaware district court is one of the busiest courts in our country it handles an array of cases related to intellectual property law patent law bankruptcy law and other specialized business cases that are critical to the functioning of our national economy like our state this court punches above its weight and our nominee greg williams is not just the credentials and the temperament but the strong work ethic that is necessary for this court to continue to function as one of the most important district courts in our country i consider it a privilege to give him my strongest possible endorsement and i always want to thank again our chair our ranking member and our colleagues for the opportunity to introduce greg williams to member of this uh committee today and to greg i say i leave you in good hands and all the other nominees and their families and friends that are here uh congratulations and good luck to all of you god bless thanks so much thanks senator carper with four older sisters and a wife he's used to being overruled so prepared for the bench and thank you for that nice introduction senator coons um thank you chairman durbin ranking member grassley um and thank you to my colleague and friend senator cartwright i want to welcome and congratulate all of the nominees appearing before us today and i'm pleased to join senator carpenter introducing our district court of delaware nominee greg williams someone as a member of the bar i've known four decades he brings a special suite of skills and background to this particularly important court as my colleague mentioned the district of delaware is a particularly busy and important court it handles a massive volume of often complex and commercially significant litigation is one of the busiest patent courts in america it is also a court that at times has struggled to reflect the broad diversity of our state i've known greg first as a rising star and then as a well-established leader in delaware's legal community he began his practice in 1995 with fox rothschild one of the most significant of our firms in our region and he has taken a whole series of leadership roles in our state bar uh he's someone who served as past president of the delaware state bar past chair of the delaware state judicial nominating committee uh he helped create the barristers association in delaware serves on the board of legal services corporation and he took the initiative to create an annual martin luther king day of service and to recruit hundreds of lawyers and community members from across our state to spend that day engaged in service to those in need in our community he's active at seeds of greatness a bible church a church well known to me and is also someone who given his litigating experience across a broad range of complex commercial issues and intellectual property issues i think is particularly well suited for this court at this time since 2020 he's been serving as a special master for the district of delaware in ongoing complex cases putting his considerable experience to work helping manage discovery including by conducting hearings and rulings and discovery disputes as my colleague mentioned in all of this he is strongly supported by his wife terena their children and extended family we welcome them today as well i know greg to be a skilled advocate a brilliant lawyer a dedicated leader in our community and i think his exceptional qualifications and lived experience make him a strong asset to the court i support him without reservation and urge my colleagues to move him swiftly to confirmation thank senator coons and senator carper for kind introductions we're going

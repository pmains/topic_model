dr. McKinney you've chaired the working group on saltwater recreational fisheries management of the Mara steel Commission and the working group came forward with a number of recommendations I've got a little bill called the modernizing recreational fisheries management Act of 2017 and I've got nine co-sponsors in the Senate representative Garret graves in the house has introduced a similar bill with 23 co-sponsors if enacted the bill would allow for alternative management tools for recreational fisheries re-examined fisheries allocations provide flexibility in rebuilding fish stocks and improved recreational data collection how does this compare to the recommendations of your working group and what do you think of my bill well on behalf of my commission we'd like to thank you for obviously taking a look at what our recommendations in the Commission report because they did include many if not all of those and so we appreciate the that it meshes up quite well and I think it addresses those issues that we would hope to see addressed in Magnuson sir and now would it help well as I try to provide my testimony and every one of those areas of looking at timelines were coming back cooperative management and every one of the recommendation we made in that Commission report it addresses each one of those essentially okay well you know I did I must say we've had to come and go and I did mr. to miss your testimony so thank you for touching on that then I'll go back and and be advised by by your oral testimony dr. Hill born let's talk about golf mid menhaden as an important forage fish down around where I come from they're embroiled in the debate over whether to enact one-size-fits-all restrictions on forest fishing or whether to go on a case-by-case basis are you familiar with the min Hayden issue with the forest with the forage fish it and can you help us decide where to come down on this issue yes I'd be happy to I've been leading a study group looking at the impacts of fishing forage fish on on their predators for the last about two years now and and a number of my colleagues have who were not working formally with us but working on similar similar fisheries and what we've really shown is that every system is different that in some some systems there's really very little impact of fishing forage fish on their predators we we suspect that in in other systems it's it's much stronger but so far none of none of art we haven't we haven't gotten to those systems yet we've looked at the California Current system I've looked at the Atlantic menhaden I haven't not look specifically at Gulf menhaden except insofar as we've looked if there is an empirical relationship between the abundance of the forage fish and the rates of change that is whether they increase or decrease of the Predators for pretty well all US forage fish fisheries and we we found no empirical evidence to support the idea that the abundance of forage fish affects their their predators largely we suspect because most of the most of the Predators are reasonably generalists and they if their forage fish species is low and low abundance they they switch to something else so a one-size-fits-all rule of thumb on forage fish we can do better than that is that your testimony yes that way you know that all you need to do is sit down and and take the biology of the forage fish and the Predators and and and put those into some reasonably simple population dynamics or ecosystem dynamics models that allow for the important biology particularly the natural variability of forage fish and you can do better than one-size-fits-all doc dr. Jones let me ask you briefly are you familiar at all with our Mississippi tails and scales electronic reporting system for for red snapper and and would you comment about the the accuracy of state-by-state reporting of this of this type coming from anglers I'm afraid I'm not familiar with that so well our if let me tell you about the concept they have an app and they can provide fisheries data to the fisheries agencies and they've developed apps on their smartphones to provide information that would be helpful in creating policy and so uh although it's we call it tails and scales perhaps you for me with it with it as a concept elsewhere yes yes thank you yeah so what we're talking about is this sort of what I want to say kind of exploding opportunity to use mobile social networking type of technology to inform assessments inform the the assessment of caches of of exploitation rates and so on and so forth and I guess my sort of opinion on that as a scientist is that it's it's a wonderful thing but it is going to take us a while to figure out how to do it how to use that information in a way that is more informative than misleading because of the challenges of sort of quality control on the data I I see great promise in that I think we should we should invest in learning how to you resource users to provide us with information on the fisheries they're exploiting in ways that we can we can use to then inform our assessments on our evaluation of status but I don't think it's it's not a silver bullet right now well our guys like it and and there's got to be a use for data supplied by about people who want to help and who are out there so thank you for thinking with me about that for a few moments and Thank You mr. chairman

OPEC uh the de facto leader of Saudi Arabia has turned down a request from President Biden to delay its oil cut decision this has prompted Republicans to raise concerns that the administration's energy policy is more about politics and not about Americans wallets joining us now Louisiana Senator Bill Cassidy is here with us this morning he serves on the energy committee when he made Casablanca little did they know that we would be using that expression forever oh my God there's politics going on here of course there is Senator of course and it go it goes on both sides and the American people watch this and you know probably don't like it very often but we all know it's just par for the course of course he wanted they didn't want the a production cut before the elections but it's you know you're trying to do your best for the American people too you don't want higher oil prices there would be more to that if they actually just hadn't said oh Saudi Arabia don't cut prices until just after the election wait till November 10th yeah that's a little it's an incredible but Republicans would do the same thing Republicans would have done tell me we what we would not have done is that the first week after a Republican president took office we wouldn't have done what Biden did which is to kill the Keystone XL pipeline that would have been 800 000 barrels a day a pipeline that would have been completed by now coming from Canada to the Gulf Coast to be refined for distribution across the United States what about the the notion that that oil companies have nothing to to drill on and we had a big art the big big discussion yesterday with someone off the camera but so Federal leases are down at the lowest level in in 50 years how much uh do the oil companies need to drill on federal versus private lands so the so the privates are doing their job if you look at the rig count in the private sector it's up 50 or even more than 50 percent relative to a year ago okay on the other hand in the outer Continental shelf of the which is federal which is federal there were I'm told by a reliable source that there were permits applied to drill off an existing platform in January and that if they have been granted within six months there would have been oil and gas production coming to the shore to be refined now that was in January do the math even if it wasn't six months it was nine months we still would be having an increased Supply available now at every point the byte Administration has done their best to shut down North American energy production and now they're like oh my gosh we got to blame this audience but oil companies didn't have workers all companies went through a Slowdown there were a lot of fracking companies went out of business because of prices there were a lot of other things that happen we're not back to 2019 levels but we're supposed to be there next year so there has been a slow Rebound in in oil production everything you just said but in the private sector the rig count is up 50 percent year over year her and and again recall what I was told by somebody who was in charge of these operations if we get our permits within six months we'll be producing oil and gas I'm just trying to play Devils because I saw the exactly you're doing it I saw the executive orders on January 20th 2021. that that basically spelled out what Joe Biden said in during the campaign I will put an end to the fossil fuel industry what I don't understand is when the excrement hits the air conditioner over in Europe suddenly all the left is going we didn't want to cut production no who was we didn't want it we we weren't working but you that was your stated but that was the stated intention of what he was going to do look I don't like the politics of what's happening with Saudi right now but let me say this the flip side is you we all want lower lower gasoline prices right and the question is when when do you think uh you want lower gasoline prices not higher gasoline prices you'd want to push the higher gasoline prices off as much as you possibly we could right and you'd want to do the the spr is the same discussion we want to help Americans we want some Str left for a bad well For Better or Worse there happens to be an election here in the middle of it but like you can't change I said the date I said that I said okay the spr production is essentially opening up another oil well and so the fact that we're draining it tells us that they think Supply is important and that domestic Supply is important they would rather just take it from that which has already been produced as opposed to creating new American jobs and new Canadian jobs North American jobs by allowing the Keystone XL XL to be built or to allow drilling off the coast of Louisiana by the way one of our problems in this economy is how do we help that kind of non-college educated but hard-working person who's going to show up every day get a job which pays his or her bills which sends their kids to a better school which change the trajectory of that family those oil and gas jobs do that you work on a rig 30 days on 30 days off think about that a month out a month in you can make a hundred thousand dollars a year now I can tell you that changes the trajectory of a family and this Administration is doing their best their best to kill those jobs I got nothing I can't argue you're gonna have to take over because I I disagree I do agree with with some of that uh Andrew so you're gonna have to take over and push back you want me to push back I mean you you know what the pushback is no I know we can go we can move on I was kidding we can move on to other subjects like inflation like uh what the FED is doing it that is so I mean we've been talking about should you approach this in some kind of supply-side way or is there something else that can be done the supplies energy or inflation everything well it's all related it's all related yeah I think you supply first it is two sides it is supply side clearly the high cost of fuel is driving up the cost of everything else right number one but number two people people are criticizing Liz truss and the bank of England for simultaneously pursuing both a stimulatory policy and let's raise interest rate policy that's what this Administration on the other side yeah on the other side the inflation reduction act the counseling of student loans the American relief package rescue package is a stimulatory policy working at direct odds to raising interest rates and if you look at the American Rescue Plan American real wages have fallen every month since two years this is not an American Rescue plan this is an American hit shop if you're talking about the salary the effectiveness okay so what's your position on what this trust is doing um so trust has an issue of where they've got declining productivity and they are falling behind other G7 Nations I am told that they are the only G7 nation whose economy is smaller now post covered than it was pre-covered so I don't have special Insight but I do know what they're doing is what we did in the um in our tax reform bill when Republicans control things which is to allow basically immediate or one-year expensing of capital investment now that can increase productivity uh it increases productivity which means that you now have more money to pay to pay higher wages there's a lot of good economy in there the uh it the point's been made that that are that the GDP is quite a bit worse than the UK's but and and this was a small addition the the way it was received a lot of people say that mistakes from the bank of England prior to Liz trust even being there or what set this up with you know defined benefit plans uh not being able to match liabilities for all the pensions and that's the way it happened but we have a strong dollar here and we're we can handle probably a higher debt ratio but does that make it a good thing we're we're adding we're layering on more more spending we're not cutting taxes but as you said we did the same stimulatory stuff just from the other side of the of The Ledger it's a schizophrenic economic policy and the American people are paying the price for the mental illness of this Administration it's better you got to say something to that you can't let them get away with that I'm not going to because I you know like I said but you got to push back on that did you hear what he just said I did hear what he just said that's just these fruits he's throwing it down [Laughter] Senator Warren on we we do the same stuff anybody can come here and and say things like that some people are going to complain and complain when you do and then when we have you know Senator and that's what makes it makes a market that'll make this a good show by the way so thank you thank you appreciate it

gentlemen welcome thank you for your willingness to serve welcome to your family members as well I appreciate the opportunity to meet with you in person sorry our our meeting had to be rescheduled and so always look forward to that opportunity but mr. Quarles would like to start with you and and let me just say I think your actions in the past are important for us to figure out how you're going to pursue your roles currently that you've been nominated for so some of the questions are going to be some of the past actions that in the work that you've done in the past so mr. Quarles one of the things I want to understand that you've been a member of the board of directors at FINRA since 2015 correct yes ma'am okay and FINRA is the organization that's supposed to serve as a watchdog for Wall Street you qualify as a quote public Governor on FINRA's board which is the slot that's meant to represent the investing public when it comes to how FINRA operates correct that's correct okay and and as qualified as a public interest representative you you qualified even though you have investments in lines of credit from many firms regulated by FINRA and you also serve currently on the board of directors for the US Chamber of Commerce during that time is that correct yes ma'am okay and the chamber of commerce has repeatedly sued regulatory agencies to overturn investor protections on behalf of its Wall Street members if confirmed to a position at the Fed how can we trust you to balance the public interest against the interests of Wall Street given the obvious conflicts in your current role can you explain that to me the in the same way that in representing the public on the FINRA board I have done that without any influence from or even discussion with the chamber of commerce I think that it is possible to exercise responsibilities given the nature of the duties that a person has so when the chamber of commerce which includes Wall Street some of the Wall Street's biggest banks and accepts their contributions whose to overturn rules on the our behalf your are you in a role of supporting those actions by the Chamber of Commerce even though you sit as on the opposite side as a public interest representative with FINRA if there were any specific decision that involved a matter of which the chamber of commerce was a party I would recuse myself that has not arisen well I've been on the board so you've never recused yourself while you're on the board of a US chamber and/or FINRA in relationship to the your interactions on both no matters have arisen that would have required okay and if confirmed to the Fed will you use your position to try and stop the CFPB's arbitration rule I don't believe I have a role with respect to that so they have to know I haven't given any thought as to how I would affect that the CFPB is an independent regulator and and appropriately so with regard to it I think that the robust enforcement of the consumer rules is an important policy matter and I certainly support that thank you did you ever use your slot on fenders board to advocate for the Chamber's position on arbitration no ma'am okay thank you my time is running low so mr. odden let me let me jump back to some questions and a follow-up to the conversation you were having with Senator Brown if I understand this correctly you said 160 thousand homes were saved and when you say 160 thousand homes were saved they were actually modified people were able to stay in their homes is that correct they did not go to foreclosure that is correct okay and then 175 thousand non-bank not I guess the homes that were not in your portfolio or the subject of a separate modifications or can you claim that hundred seventy five thousand dollar figure you said there were 175 loans that went through a Consent Order look-back which was done by an independent consultant under the guise of the OCC okay and it's true that one West is the only bank that did not settle the independent foreclosure review correct that is correct okay and so can you well Cheryl Hanson the other Bank settled one West Bank was one only one who completed the look back that had the actual results associated with the consent order okay thank you and can you tell me how many actual loan modifications did one West provide to Nevadans during your tenure while you were there do you know I do not have that number okay I appreciate that can you let me just say this as the Comptroller of the currency you know you're going to be entrusted with tremendous responsibilities the decisions the comptroller makes impact whether borrowers can keep their homes or whether we have another economic crisis as you well know we've talked about this when we were together and can you point to a single area where you think additional consumer protection is needed um I think there's a lot of discussion today about small ticket dollar amounts for lending activities and what came out of dodd-frank was a fairly highly complicated product that almost requires you to underwrite a twenty five hundred dollar loan like a mortgage and I think that's one area that would require a lot of input and discussion to be able to make those products available we've kind of pushed those out of the banking sector and I think they should be actually invoked back into the banking sector where oversight and regulation can can allow those to be offered in a fair and economic manner to the exclusion of the CFPB no not to the exclusion and participation okay thank you I know it's my time is up thank you very much Thank You mr. chair so mister adding in your answers to Senator tester did I hear right that you said that one West did not engage in robo-signing I I said when I answered the question that there could have been Aires they weren't identified in the robo-signing but our process is in place and again comment on is that I think a lot of people have different definitions of robo-signing mine is did we have a process for the affidavit second of all did anybody sign any affidavits of another person's names third where was the data check before somebody was signing the affidavit and lastly did was a notarization process done and I would respond that we did do those at one West Bank accurately there may have been exceptions I'm not aware of those exceptions and they weren't identified as any issues in the interim OCC report that reported our results okay here's my concern in very briefly I have in front of me the consent order between the office of Thrift Supervision and one West and specifically states that one West Bank engaged in unsafe or unsound banking practices relating to mortgage servicing and the initiation and handling of foreclosure proceedings specifically those unsound practices included filed or cause to be filed in state and federal courts or in local land records offices and this isn't happened in Nevada numerous affidavits or other mortgage related documents that were not properly notarized specifically that were not signed or affirmed in the presence of a notary litigated foreclosure and bankruptcy proceedings and initiated non-judicial foreclosure proceedings without always ensuring that the promissory note and mortgage document were properly endorsed or signed and if necessary in the possession of the appropriate party that is robo-signing that is what is in this consent order that our density events that were made if you'll know we did not confirm or deny you have to look at the results that came from those and why did you sign the consent order if you didn't agree with the decision so in order actually I would already general the state of Nevada we do not have a choice when the REA you're telling me that your company did not engage in this but you were forced under duress to sign this consent order I I hope you are never in the position that I was I had great pride I had been at that company a little less than a year and I was I would argue I had to for the benefit of our employees sign that consent order that when I did not agree with what was was described the words that were inserted in there were do not confirm or deny I think I would encourage you to look at the results that were produced in 2014 I'd be happy to get those over to your office I think it paints a different story of one West Bank if you didn't engage in the practices then you shouldn't have consigned signed the consent order but we should we I appreciate your comments and thank you very much it was very instructive

Thank You mr. chairman and ranking member Blumenthal thank you for continuing your work and leadership to bring witnesses before this committee that can provide us real answers I know that members of the committee to take this very seriously and our hard at work to provide more structured safeguards for our Olympic athletes and then to the survivors in this room I want to personally thank those who have stood together to present an image for the world and are standing up and telling their story I know it's not easy but you are athletes with unimaginable strength and courage and I thank you for everything you do every day for using your voices as elected leaders we must remain committed to our obligation to demand reforms and provide for real thoughtful solutions that will make positive change I remain committed to working with my colleagues survivors advocacy groups and many others to make fundamental changes to the governance and oversight of amateur sport in this country and so miss Lyons let me start with you and I want to follow up in a conversation with the chair that you started with on regarding the band lists can I ask you what are the consequences that the u.s. OC outlines if a member Club hires a coach or an individual on the band list that's an excellent question to my knowledge we do not we at the u.s. SC do not have anything that is written as to what would happen if an outside club hired someone on the band list typically the u.s. SC is not aware of which coaches are at which clubs that's generally something that the ng B's are much more aware of but I think you point out a structural issue that is something that we should look at so miss Perry let me ask you this what actions is USA Gymnastics taking to identify and remove coaches athlete directors employees and officials who witnessed emotional and physical abuse of athletes and did not report child abuse to the authorities and did nothing to stop it so we have made both are permanently ineligible list in our suspension list public on our website there are several ways that we communicate that information out of course we provide notice to the adverse party and we provide notice to the club owners and we also ask the club owner to provide notice to the membership there in their club area and let me ask you this so you are actually taking action to identify and remove coach's athlete directors employees and officials who witnessed emotional and physical abuse of these athletes and did not report the child abuse to authorities as long as we have a report and and we're made aware of it we are gonna follow our safe sport policy and our bylaws which allows us to take action and again depending on the nature of the misconduct if it's sexual misconduct that goes to the center if it's non sexual misconduct that stays presently with the national governing body and so we have specific processes that we follow some of that of course is governed by not only our bylaws and our safe sport policy but by the Ted Stevens Act and so we follow all of those processes to find at the end of a Hearing Panel for example what their decision is and based on their decision in that Hearing Panel the action is taken so are you currently taking any actions to identify and remove current employees who knew about the sexual abuse and didn't do anything to report it but stayed silent did you say current employees so right now we are going through an independent investigation the ropes in gray and that information I think is not only critical for this body and all of the investigations that are going on but it's very critical for us because it's important that we learn the facts around this and so you know if there are right so let me let me stop you there George great the filibuster but I've only got five minutes and we'll follow up with you and the testimony offered by mr. Rick atoms of the USOC in March of 2017 he testified that there was quote an environment that discouraged victims from reporting abuse unquote @ng B's including the USA Jay do you agree with mr. Adams assessment of the culture at USA gymnasts gymnastics prior to your tenure senator I saw immediately that we had to become an athlete centric organization does that mean yes I saw immediately that this organization and probably very much other organizations need to focus their priorities on the safety of the athletes so and I mean let me ask is it mr. Shou Shou thank you very much you've heard the opening statements of the individuals that are on the panel with you let me ask you this is there anything that they have said that satisfies your concern that structural change is going to occur I think that we're engaging in this process in good faith from the athletes Advisory Council and will continue to provide our suggestions for structural changes but in the end as I as I said in my testimony I do think that we've done this before I think we've done independent commissions we've done sweeping governance changes we've done the taglio commission not too long ago and here we are today and that's my concern so did you hear anything different today that's gonna change your mind make your hourly satisfy concerns that changes personally I don't think so I think that it's not a failing necessarily even of the organization I think it's a failing of the entire system the way it's set up thank you I know my time is right now thank you

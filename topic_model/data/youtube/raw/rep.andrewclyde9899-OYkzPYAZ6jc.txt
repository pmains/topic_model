again we are here today because of the Supreme Court's landmark and life-saving decision in the Dobbs V Jackson case but the truth behind why we are really here is the Democrats want one more opportunity to place the issue of abortion front and center in the news before the November 8th elections they somehow believe that saving innocent unborn lives is a problem and they want to use this last session week before the elections as an opportunity to campaign on killing innocent unborn children Dr Verma I see you are a fellow Georgian uh recently gubernatorial nominee Stacy Abrams from our great state of Georgia stated and I quote there is no such thing as a heartbeat at six weeks it is a manufactured sound so let me ask you is a heartbeat at six weeks a manufactured sound a yes or no will suffice a yes or no will suffice ma'am is is do I need to repeat the question I'd love to answer your question but like so many things in medicine it's complex I don't believe it's complex ma'am it's a pretty simple question is a heartbeat at six weeks a manufactured sound yes or no again I'd love to answer your question I need a little bit of time to do so okay all right I just need a yes or no is it or is it not okay you're not going to answer my question I do provide comprehensive reproductive health care so I take care of people Madam chair I'd like to ask for unanimous consent to submit for the record this study titled role of ultrasound in the evaluation of first trimester pregnancies in the acute setting which was published in ultrasonography in 2019 in which it finds that in normal fetal development a heartbeat is expected at or around six weeks without objection thank you and while we're talking about science let's talk about biology and let's just keep it real simple just two yes or no questions and this is for um Dr Kumar Dr Kumar can biological men become pregnant and give birth um so men can have pregnancies especially trans men so can biological men become pregnant and give birth so are you saying that a biological female who identifies as a man in therefore becomes pregnant is quote a man is that what you're saying these questions about who can become pregnant are really missing the point I'm here to talk no no no no no no this is me asking a question and you answering I'm asking the question sir not you right and I'm answering the question somebody with a uterus may have a capability of becoming pregnant whether they're a woman or a man that doesn't mean okay we're done not every person this isn't complicated let me tell you if a person has this medicine and is born as a is born female they are a woman that is not a man and the vast majority of the world considers that to be a woman because there are biological differences between men and women I mean clearly any high school biology class teaches that men and women have different chromosomes females are XX chromosome and male are X Y chromosome I can't believe it's necessary to say this but men cannot get pregnant and cannot get birth give birth regardless of how they identify themselves why in the world would Democrats have brought in a person whose title is director of trans care for an abortion hearing when only biological women can become pregnant Dr Kumar in your opening statement you said quote abortion Bans are inherently racist inherently classist and fundamentally part of white of the white supremacy agenda how do you rationalize working for Planned Parenthood an organization founded by Margaret Sanger someone who associated with white supremacist groups and Eugenics Margaret sanger's entire Focus was to decimate communities of color through abortion to eliminate their future Generations you know how many abortions have you performed in your lifetime if I can answer your no no no how many abortions have you performed in your lifetime likely thousands likely thousands okay so as a doctor yourself do you believe you have terminated enough unborn babies to justify Margaret sanger's beliefs and your continuance of her Legacy this is unconscionable this is inexcusable I'm thankful it is now criminal and I look forward to the day when life is again respected across our entire nation in closing I'd like to ask for unanimous consent to submit for the record a copy of the United States Constitution which despite my Democrat colleagues absurd claims does not and I repeat does not include a right a constitutional right to abortion the word abortion doesn't even exist in it and I would also like to ask unanimous consent to submit for the record the Declaration of Independence which highlights the inalienable right to life so so ordered thank you and I yield back

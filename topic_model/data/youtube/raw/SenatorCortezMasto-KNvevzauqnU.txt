thank you first of all let me let me just say I wasn't here the time you passed the American innovation competitiveness Act but it was a wonderful time I want to thank both of you I mean it really is good legislation and it has a positive impact on our communities in the country so thank you for that and thank you for both of you for being here dr. Cordova I'd like to start with you I am a a proud supporter of broadening opportunities in STEM fields for minorities and women that's why I introduced the code like a girl Act which is supported by groups like our Girl Scouts to further promote efforts to engage young girls and computer science and hopefully provide the role models and exposure to make the estimated millions of unfilled STEM jobs an option for everyone I know dr. Kovac dr. Cordova you obviously are one of those incredible role models as I've looked at your background and while we are talking about this however and the need for it and we are making advancements just last November Gao documented that from 2005 to 2015 they found that no growth occurred for female workers in technology so would you agree is there more work that can be done really to get young women exposed and motivated and energized in these fields and and if you would talk a little bit about how we can do just that yeah absolutely that's that's kind of a shocking statistic there's there's just enormous potential out there and we really need it I mean just harkening back to senator Gardner's remarks about the recent science and engineering indicators reports we have a lot of other countries are making faster progress than we are and we we really need to for many reasons including that one turn to the talent pool that is right here all around us and develop that for our country's future so NSF has been involved in in all disciplines including of course computer science in in promoting the advancement of well in broadening participation in general and promoting the advancement of women and underrepresented minorities in particular and I just want to mention two programs really quickly and then go to computer science we've had for a long time the advanced program which is to promote women in universities to engage them in joining universities professorships and then ensure that they stay there sustained and then achieve higher levels and I myself as a PI for the advanced grant at Purdue and so like loved the program and more recently we've initiated a program called includes which is really addressed to bringing in everyone in the nation to giving them more access to STEM careers and and with a particular focus on women and again underrepresented minorities we are funding currently 70-69 includes pilot programs in all across the nation which are really community groups comprising universities and civic organizations community colleges the some cases the state itself in in furthering opportunities and many of those includes grants have to do with computer science in a number of states and I can give you a list of those in more specific to computing we have a program called computer science for all which is to make sure that teachers have the preparation they need because after all going back to my remarks about scaling you in order to really scale something you you have to train the trainers and and so forth this has to to go forward through other people so this effort combines professional development opportunities for teachers at all grade levels together with research studies at the pre-k to 8th level that will focus on how to integrate computer science and computation computational thinking into their classrooms and I I have any number of examples which I could send you subsequently senator about specific examples of computer science programs that were funding that are are making a real difference I think in that are directed towards increasing women and underrepresented minorities and we have the data to show that they are making the difference thank you and so I'm glad you highlighted that because I know particularly in Nevada as well UNR is a recipient and works with you and include a program our community colleges RHS is Hispanic serving institutions work closely so thank you I think there is a benefit to the funding and the support of really targeted in this area and working with our colleges and our universities at the same time you also focus on the last question I had with the metrics I think it's so important that not only as we put the money in here and we're working very hard to open this door that we are collecting data and the metrics to show that it is having a positive impact or the intended impact that we are focused on through this act so thank you very much I ran out of time mr. cope and so I didn't get a chance to ask you questions but I'll submit those for the record thank you very much for being here

Thank You mr. chairman and mr. chairman thank you i think the focus that you and the staff have been putting on poverty and particularly the anti-poverty opportunities to address these issues in a fresh and creative way makes a lot of sense and i very much appreciate it dr. Haskins you've been doing yeomen work in this field for a long time and to really looking forward to being you are it will put you in the youth caucus as well and I'm looking forward to pursuing economic mobility issues with you as well in the days I hadn't all have a question on that in a moment now I want to take what we've done in Oregon and get your sense sort of on one of the opportunities for reform my home state has focused primarily on education and trying to find ways to keep families together those are our special kind of kind of priorities now this approach coincided with the recession which hit my state particularly hard between december 2007 and December of 2009 nationwide caseloads went up twelve percent but Oregon's went up forty percent to parent caseloads alone went up over two hundred and fourteen percent so now we're looking at the prospect of 27 and a half million dollars in federal fines for not meeting the work participation rates so the question I have in your sense of a policy change in an economy with fewer jobs than job seekers wouldn't it make sense to give the state's more credit for moving a public assistance recipient into a job rather than simply moving them off the rolls because it seems to me if we take that is kind of a fundamental proposition we could look at a variety of new approaches like perhaps gives the state's a waiver to start trying some demonstration projects in this area what you're thinking on that point yes I think it's a good idea it's a reasonable thing to do I'm worried about the way you actually measure it I would get to the state something new to report what is compared to his issue so there are a lot of issues about how to measure but I think basically it's a sound idea as long as we did not lose the focus on work a lot of people get jobs during a recession what you say about the number of people looking for a job and the racial to the number of jobs available was worse in this recession at any time since since the depression so that's a consideration it's harder to find a job but people still find jobs even during a recession so again it's like the original tana program the balance between a reasonable policy and a policy that does put pressure on people to work as long as that's maintained and I think your idea is a good one well it's that balance that I'm interested in I think senator Cardin has made a number of good good points on this and that's why the approach of trying particularly to let states that have been creative and as you know Oregon has been consistently in terms of human resources to get a waiver to try some of these approaches I think would be attractive let me ask you a little bit about the economic mobility issues as you know I'm going to be one of the co-chairs of the caucus which is going to kick off here very shortly in partnership with pew now you've touched on a number of policy recommendations but why don't you if you wouldn't mind just give us a couple of recommendations with respect to the economic mobility work that you have been pursuing because I think this is hugely important we're seeing of course these major you know regional differences which I gather our colleagues have touched on before I came in as well and once you just stuff for purposes of the rest of my time give us a sense of a couple of recommendations that you think are particularly important on the mobility issue okay let me mention to the first one is everything we've been talking about in this hearing room today because the way to increase mobility one big way to increase it is to start at the bottom those are the people that are most disadvantaged if you look at the data on earnings and in almost any measure of income the bottom is what has really been stagnant in fact the bottom would have been even worse than stagnant would have declined if it had not been for federal benefits so the federal transfer of payments from wealthier or more advantaged people to low-income people has actually meant that even over the period over the last two or three decades at the bottom has actually moved up unlike what you're likely to read in New York Times and a big part of that is that so many people at the bottom work especially single moms so what the purpose attentive is it's verified by the importance to increasing mobility United States start at the bottom help them first the second thing is that I think we need to figure out a much better way to get kids into junior colleges and colleges we're working on that and you know I would not fall social policy do you do to the federal or state level but we need an even more intense and a smarter focus on it the reason is that low-income kids are still at a disadvantage they're less likely to enroll either in two or four-year colleges and they're more likely to drop out despite the fact that they're less likely to enroll so the difference in achieving a two-year four-year degree between kids from the bottom and kids from the top is enormous and that's something we ought to focus on especially because we have very good data from universities and long-term data where we can compare the income of kids to their own parents that's a Hong these kids have been followed 40 / 40 years and it shows that if a low-income kid from the bottom twenty percent of roughly below twenty thousand dollars if they get a college degree their chances of staying in the bottom are cut by more than half and their chance of making it to the top is increased by a factor of four name any other intervention that will increase something by a factor of four so this is a stream ly important problem we just simply have to figure out a better way to get kids in junior college in college especially low-income kids and a big part of it is making a high schools better I know that's hard but that's a big part well fed my time has expired mr. chairman

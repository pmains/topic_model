for my stp i worked with the angus king campaign for senate i was basically motivated to join this campaign because i really love politics with olympia snow dropping out of the race i thought this was actually a great opportunity because of how much national recognition this campaign is getting so while i was there i did lots of things i was not above doing the grunt work such as addressing letters or doing database entry there's also a lot of in-depth like policy research we created a database for of all the main state legislators that have been in office i researched the affordable care act and how it affected mainers and he would use that information to further his own understanding on the topic and help him make uh educated um decisions for policies so then we went this week to augusta to deliver the signatures that we had gathered and a normal candidate needs 2 000 signatures to be put on the ballot an independent candidate needs 4 000 signatures and angus king had gathered 6 500 signatures he brought him up to augusta we went up to that rally and there was a bunch of people up there standing room uh and in there and when he was there he gave a speech what angus king said i thought was really profound that uh congress right now is broken it's not fixed and you need someone to fix it and mr king isn't so naive that he thinks he's just gonna walk in there and all of a sudden everything will be great because he's an independent but he wants to go there and actively work and bring compromise back into the equation and i thought that was a really good point because compromise is basically the center of our government republicans are they're coming into office running on campaigns of like no taxes like always like saying no to democrats and then democrats are running campaigns like saying like we're going to bring money to to health care here we're going to bring money to infrastructure so when they get to washington it's just they're kind of butting heads i really do think he's the right person for maine his being separate from the two parties is is just perfect i met mr king two or three times during the course of the week took some pictures with him he shook my hand said hey like capture lacrosse season i mean he was just really personal and that meant a lot to me

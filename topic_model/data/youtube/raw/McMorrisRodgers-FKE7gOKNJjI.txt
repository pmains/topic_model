Thank You mr. chairman appreciate everyone being here today the shale revolution over the past decade has made the United States the global leader in natural gas production is striking to me when I was first elected to Congress there was a lot of concern about the rising cost of natural gas and our dependence upon other countries for natural gas supply and today we're one of the largest exporters of natural gas in the world this renaissance of natural gas production has created hundreds of thousands of jobs decreased prices of energy and home heating increased American energy independence and reduced emissions we should all be proud of this responsible and innovative use of our natural resources as countries like China and Russia seek to use their energy resources to pressure other countries America must counter their influence with our natural gas exports China is building hundreds of coal-fired plants in developing nations as part of their belt and Road initiative Russia continues to use their natural gas which is almost 50 percent higher in lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions to influence European countries if we expand our LNG infrastructure eeew I estimate estimates our exports can more than double by 2050 by replacing these coal plants in Asia our LNG can reduce GHG emissions by up to 54% calls to ban fracking block pipelines and reduce our natural gas exports will result in the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs increased energy prices increased emissions and the spread of authoritarian influence globally instead we should be focusing on continuing to modernize and build our infrastructure so that we can meet the world's growing demand for our clean natural gas mr. McMahon the US has arguably the most highly developed and technologically advanced pipeline network in the world combined with our Mendes shale resources do you believe the US has the global energy advantage when it comes to price and supply of natural gas I do and as a follow-up how have pipeline and LNG exports helped our trading partners reduce their carbon emissions well as the as the pipeline industry's build out the infrastructure the LNG facilities net a lot of them which were originally designed to be importer Mills they're now exporting cargoes so by providing LNG to the world is allowing us to put our natural gas at work in other parts of the country where they are I should say the world were there burning you know coal fuel oil and other things so I think it's been a very big boon to us to be able to export clean energy to the world and as I mentioned earlier I believe that we need to be expanding our LNG infrastructure to increase exports to markets such as Asia FERC is the lead agency for siting interstate natural gas pipelines and many state and federal agencies have a role to play they may review aspects of an application or they may be required to issue separate permits to mr. McMahon again are you concerned that some states are using their permitting authority to block pipelines for political reasons what I will say is it over the last five or six years we see it becoming increasingly more difficult to build pipelines in certain areas by inability to obtain the necessary permits so what what suggestions do you have to improve the coordination for for quicker decisions well I think that it's kind of twofold is the pipelines we typically build are those in interstate commerce and those are crossing multiple state lines the idea is that the Commission has found that the pipeline is in public convenience and necessity and it needs to be in interstate commerce and it becomes very frustrating it goes back to my stability and predictability is if you if you're getting all the way and you hit a roadblock because the state is holding a permits or refusing to issue or denying permits then you've you know you maybe getting to where the gases actually very much needed bass blocked right right and unfortunately that's happening too much today it's happening more than it's ever in my career Wow well our pipeline infrastructure has been so important not just to Americans but also to the rest of the world so I appreciate everyone being here and appreciate the hearing today I will yield back

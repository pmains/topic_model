on how are you today thank you for being here I have to pull my script up so that I make sure I don't veer off course here a bit and first of all we recognize what an honor this is to be here and we recognize more so just that we're lucky we're very very lucky to be here and it's an honor so without further ado and I want to start with a quote from Toni Morrison if there's a book that you want to read but it hasn't been written with yet then you must write it and that's what we've tried to do along our journey is to really document every little facet of this journey because there have been great pieces and there have been challenging ones that i wrote a post not too long ago called the club and i'm just going to read that to you i am a member of a club it's not one that sends fancy invitations out the potential members it's not one that has a welcome party yet to edits induction it's not a club I chose it's a club that's non-discriminatory anyone can become a member individuals with hefty bank accounts are those on welfare those who are devout in faith are those who believe in more earthly deities those who have it all figured out or those who just can't seem to find their paths those with advanced degrees are those whose educational paths are limited all are welcome no one wants to join this club but you're not left with a choice to opt out however once you officially join this club you remain in it forever you wear the coat of arms on your breasts proudly you celebrate and grieve alongside those two who wear the same crest for your parents of children with cancer unfortunately and fortunately you're not alone in your initiation every club member has his or her diagnosis story Surgical woes transfusion speed bumps hair loss tears and countless sleepless nights fearing for the life of your child each member of the club can recount specific details of the day that changed his or her life the day the dreams for his or her child were modified and survival became the sole mission side note I wrote this right before September began so we're whined back to September 30th I mean autist 31st tonight the eve of the month when our world skipped off its comfortable access two years ago I reflect on the families who / grudgingly joined this club to which I pay costly dues each month in money time and heartache it's the worst club to be assigned to yet the greatest club to inhabit when explaining solidarity to those excluded from our club I've seen mothers and fathers lose their babies and their teenagers they still remain members of this club I've seen organs limbs and eyes removed from children and their parents remain faithful members paying daily membership dues parents you've lost the child who earned them their membership fight daily for other families who are in the club holding tight to their children whose battles are far from over they aren't released from the club or their duties their membership card is non-transferable my child is in remission but I am no less a card-carrying member of this club that I would have gladly avoided at all costs I'm proud of my membership I'm proud of my child I'm proud of my family we embraced this club and we'll gladly flash our cards to non-members to raise awareness so that our membership numbers don't increase September's childhood cancer awareness month please spread the word in order to limit our membership we need others help we dedicate our lives as permanent members of the club to ensuring others stay away from our club we're striving for exclusivity how will you help us with this caused by being here today you're doing that and we can't thank you enough Rex was diagnosed two years ago last weekend on excel I guess in a way it was the celebrations at I remembrance of where our lives how our lives have changed statistically speaking he's not supposed to be here but thanks to the advance of Medicine creating hope act and I think especially for us tema del he is here um tomorrow morning I will be absolutely exhausted but all the exciting so I'm taking Rex to soccer tomorrow he's got soccer practice and his pictures those are the kind of moments for the first 17 months of his life that we took for granted we assumed would come and then two years ago today sitting there almost a week after his diagnosis I didn't think that was going to be possible I remember when they came in and told us just saying over and over he's just a baby he's just a baby um being prepared and thinking I'm going to lose my baby boy um but thanks to the great team at Dell the care they took of not only our baby boy but of our entire family she is still here thanks to creating Hope act it doesn't just create hope it didn't just save or acts his life it saved our family um and we're here today it's result of that um and we wear our rec strong bracelet bracelets every day and we have another one that a buddy of mine he took from Chip Kelly when he was in Oregon apologies to Washington Redskins fans for the Eagles reference but win the day we can't control what happened yesterday it's done tomorrow we can't attack until tomorrow but we will win today we can be the best to whatever it is we do for Rex that's being a little three-year-old boy in preschool today tomorrow will be a soccer player for lesson is to be the best parents we can be the best assistant principal the best elementary school principal for her we take each day and we don't take it for granted anymore we attack each day and we've learned that from the syllable but there are many other children who have lost this fight or still in this fight so I ask all of you you're all here because you are invested we need to continue to spread this word because until this battle is done we have to keep fighting as a group this is not a political issue although it's being fought in the political arena my three-year-old boy is not a Republican he is not a Democrat he's a three year old boy who when he wants to he grows up he wants to do two things he then wants to work at p terry's a burger restaurant in Austin or he wants to be mr. Wilmer who is the custodian at his school so whatever path Rex takes as a result of what happened here thanks to you congressman McCaul congressman hall in your work for the creating hope act the folks who created the unit oxidant helped him the team at Dell who held our hands and held a little boys hands I want to thank you all for being here today and continuing to spread this word if the battle's just begun but we're winning it and we have to keep fighting it so thanks for here I apologize that you have to go I in Texas we got high school football and your assistant principal you got to be at the game so gauche apps on thank you all i hope you enjoy the rest here today

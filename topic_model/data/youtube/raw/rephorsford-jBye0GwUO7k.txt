I was pleased to introduce the mental health transparency act with my colleague representative Vern Buchanan of Florida the covid-19 pandemic has without a doubt highlighted the importance of access to comprehensive mental health and substance use disorder Services one study from the Boston University School of Public Health indicated that the rate of depression in the U.S tripled in the first few months of the pandemic since then there has been a dramatic uptick in a number of mental health disorders such as anxiety and the egregious increase in drug overdose deaths that we are all privy to these crises continue to emphasize the need to access comprehensive coverage our bill the mental health transparency act will enhance transparency and oversight regarding the number of mental health and substance use disorder providers covered under private insurance plans it does so by developing new indicators for the provider Network size empowering consumers while they select their health insurance plan and requiring information on planned coverage to be made publicly available should this bill be signed into law patients will be able to immediately understand how good their plan is for mental health and substance use disorder Services rather than having to figure out after they have already chosen their health insurance I'm grateful to have my Republican colleague representative Buchanan on this important bill and I look forward to the passing on the house floor

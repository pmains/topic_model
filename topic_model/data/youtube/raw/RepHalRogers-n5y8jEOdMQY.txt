thank you mr chairman welcome to our distinguished guests yesterday we all woke up to some alarming news reports from seattle indicating that ice had not only released from custody without bond 28 non-confirmed illegal immigrants using false documents and also had given 24 of them work permits after having been released allowing the group to go out and get jobs this policy affects every law-abiding american citizen a slap in the face for those who are struggling every day to find a job in this economic downturn questionable enforcement practices such as these send a decidedly mixed message and effectively put illegal immigrants at the front of the employment line in front of american citizens seeking a job in these hard times now i'm cognizant of the sensitivities surrounding an ongoing criminal investigation of an employer make no mistake but i do intend to get some answers today on the consequences of these apparent new guidelines and its effect on the immigration enforcement missions of the department that is the law

Arizona mr. Gosar mr. ash are you an engineer no sir kind of one of those micro engineers so things have to make sense to me you you made the comment that the hundred thousand dollars was was kind of per se hogwash so I need to deliver you handle the maximum there was one point one to 1.3 million dollars not even close to the eight point five million dollars this guy has an engineer stamp they have actually worked to death full-heartedly I dislike people coming back at me stating something other than fact number two is you claimed the rainbow trout stocking program at Willow beach was not terminated yet I'm pulling up the fish and wildlife service's own website and it says and I quote as of 2014 the hatchery will no longer be raising rainbow trout and will focus on the work of the endangered bony tail chub and Razorback suckers in partnership with the Bureau of Reclamation 1,700 jobs 75 million dollars at stake as a result of the termination of the rainbow trout stocking program at Willow beach the sole reason let's go back through this the sole reason for the hatchery was established in 1959 to offset the loss in native fisheries resulting from the construction of the Hoover Dam so your website says nothing about a catastrophic event again it says as of 2014 the hatchery will no longer be raising rainbow trout at the July 25th hearing your deputy director said if the pipeline is fixed the rainbow trout program would be reinstated will you honor his pledge if the pipeline is fixed we will reinstate the the rainbow trout production thank you very very much okay number two on August 11th the Fish and Wildlife Service held a public comment hearing in Arizona on the draft environmental impact statement the Mexican gray wolf my mech my district director attended this hearing on my behalf after two minutes she was cut off by officials within your agency that apparently didn't like the comments I had prepared to read this is shameful it is common practice is it come practice for your agency to prevent or restrict public input that disagrees with her proposed listenings and regulations it is not practice at all but well I did happen I mean there's plenty of people there it was a packed auditorium so it is a packed auditorium and when we conduct the public hearing people are limited to the time available because we have to provide time for for all of the people who want to speak to speak so there is always a time long gladly doing this because you know and now all the internists it is inexcusable that the Arizona cooperative alternative was not one of the options included in the release of the draft environmental impact statement for the Mexican gray wolf this alternative was developed by 28 different cooperating agencies and stakeholder groups now while I don't support everything included in the Arizona cooperative alternative I was encouraged the proposal was developed based on actual science and from local stakeholders why did you agency prevent this alternative from being considered in receiving public comment you have five other options why couldn't you include a sixth option it seems common sense the Arizona cooperative proposal was has been conceived and developed subsequent to the publication of our proposal and we all wasn't we are working with the state of Arizona I met with Leigh Voyles two weeks ago I'm meeting with labor Saturday I saw Larry where's this morning boils on before you came here so I my comment is this this was included here and to say otherwise was is disrespectful to have that six option on the table that's not disrespectful at all we're we're involved with the state of Arizona and we are considering the Arizona cooperative proposal we are sir yes so you have your commitment that we're going to actually have an open debate with the sixth option on the table we literally like I said I saw a lady this morning at the wildlife hunting heritage and conservation council meeting I'm meeting I'm seeing Larry next the week after next in st. Louis and we're gonna sit down and talk about the Mexican wolf and we are working with the state of Arizona I'm handing love it doesn't mean we always agree and that we are working with them and very cooperative I want to make sure I get this run riding one more time so he fix the intake pipe it will alow beach we're gonna have rainbow trout and I mean I'm giving you six different options don't even come close to eight point five million and this this I mean no working hard here if we can fix the pipe and we do and we are we are in you and I seeming to be in an argument here and we're working toward the same objective on the hatchery we really are but I'm Isabelle since time is of essence I really thank you

mr speaker i rise in support of something every single member of this body should be able to get behind capping the price of insulin at 35 dollars a month in my home state of massachusetts over half a million people rely on their life-saving insulin prescription but being forced to pay anywhere from one hundred to sixteen hundred dollars a month for it simply isn't doable for so many families far too many diabetics are being forced to ration their doses and some are even skipping them all together because they can't afford the medicine they need let's be clear about what that means hard-working folks are risking their lives each day because big pharmaceutical companies are putting profits first we have the ability to change that with the legislation before us today mr speaker and shame on us if we stand by and do nothing while people we have the honor to represent die waiting for congress to act i plead with my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation our constituents are depending on us thank you mr speaker i yield back

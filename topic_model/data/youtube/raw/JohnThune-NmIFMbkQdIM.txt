Mr President ask any group of Americans how they feel about the IRS and you're unlikely to come up with a lot of positive reviews and with good reason repeated mishandling of taxpayer data not to mention almost non-existent customer service is unlikely to gain any agency many fans and at this point the IRS has a disturbing record of mishandling taxpayer information in the past two years alone the IRS has inadvertently posted confidential information from a hundred and twenty thousand taxpayers on its website destroyed 30 million unprocessed tax documents and had troes of private taxpayer information end up in the hands of the left-leaning news site propublica and the agency's customer service record might be even worse during fiscal year 2021 the agency answered just 11 percent of the 282 million calls that it received 11 percent that means that 250 million taxpayer calls went unanswered 250 million in 2022 was no better during the 2022 filing season 90 percent of taxpayers calls and 90 percent went unanswered any business with a customer service record like that wouldn't be in business for very long Mr President given the agency's record I think most Americans would say that the IRS is right for reform Democrats however apparently thought the IRS was ripe for more funding a lot more funding in August Democrats passed their so-called inflation reduction Act this legislation takes no meaningful steps to reduce inflation but it does flood the IRS with a staggering 80 billion dollars over the next 10 years a sum equal to six times the agency's 2022 budget that's enough money to double the size of the IRS the bill provides for the hiring of as many as eighty seven thousand new IRS employees an estimate that came from President Biden's Treasury Department that would make the IRS larger than the Customs and Border Protection and the U.S Coast Guard combined Mr President suddenly and dramatically increasing the size of any government agency's cause for concern are there plans in place to make sure the money is used efficiently can the agency in question handle such a swift expansion and the increased responsibility that comes with it these are serious questions no matter what agency we are talking about but these questions are particularly relevant when the agency in question is already doing a poor job of handling its basic responsibilities and yet despite the IRS record despite the repeated breaches of taxpayer confidentiality and the nearly non-existent taxpayer service Democrats pass legislation to double the size of the agency without including any meaningful accountability measures to ensure that the new funding is used responsibly I guess it's not terribly surprising given the Democrats made it clear that their main interest in supersizing the IRS was increasing government revenue but it is deeply troubling we should not be doubling the size of an agency that is already notable for its failure to adequately carry out its basic mission but since Democrats are flooding the IRS with a lot of additional money Americans deserve to know that that money is being spent wisely and efficiently and that it isn't going to make taxpayers experiences with the IRS even worse and that's why I and my fellow Republicans have been focused on doing everything we can to provide rigorous oversight and accountability for this new money and I've introduced multiple bills to help protect taxpayers my increased reliable Services now act which I introduced with Senator Collins would prevent the IRS from hiring new enforcement agents until customer service at the IRS has reached a more acceptable standard I also worked with Senator Mike krapel on a bill to protect taxpayers earning less than four hundred thousand dollars per year from increased audits Democrats main reason main reason for boosting IRS funding was to increase tax collection measures including audits to squeeze out Revenue for their Green New Deal agenda and they're a substantial reason to be concerned that despite Democrats protest to the contrary some of that audit funding will be used to increase audits of middle-income taxpayers it's hard to explain why else every single Democrat opposed an amendment to prevent the IRS from using its new funding to increase audits of these Americans the bill I introduced to Senator krapel and my Republican colleagues on the Senate finance committee would protect middle-income Americans from seeing increased audits as a result of this new money most recently just a few days before Thanksgiving Senator Chuck Grassley and I let our fellow finance committee Republicans in introducing the IRS funding accountability Act our legislation would require the IRS to provide congress with an annual plan for how the agency intends to use its new funding a plan that could be rejected by congress with a joint resolution of disapproval and the IRS would be required to provide congress with quarterly updates on implementation of its spending plans this would enable consistent and transparent oversight provide accountability for any misuse of funds and guard against violations of taxpayer rights and there would be real consequences for failing to submit plans or reports on time including the recision of funds until the IRS complies with reporting requirements Mr President the mission statement of the IRS is to and I quote provide America's taxpayers top quality service by helping them understand and meet their tax responsibilities and enforce the law with integrity and fairness to all end quote unfortunately in recent years the IRS Has Fallen far short of the standard and flooding the agency with 80 billion dollars over and above its current budget the majority of it for increased enforcement let's just be honest with no accountability low oversight measures is unlikely to do much to ensure taxpayers receive top quality service I hope at least some of my Democrat colleagues will decide to join Republicans to enact measures that will provide real accountability to the IRS at the IRS which is needed now more than ever American taxpayers deserve nothing less Mr President I yield the floor

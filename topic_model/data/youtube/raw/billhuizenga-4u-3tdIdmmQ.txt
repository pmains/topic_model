Detroit made history yesterday the city fire for the largest municipal bankruptcy ever Detroit is 18 and a half billion in debt can't borrow can't repay is the question will President Obama make any move to bail amount representative bill Huizenga from Michigan Republican joins us now I I'm taking this as a remote possibility of presidential bailout but a possibility nonetheless how do you judge it congressman yeah I mean it might be a possibility that they attempt to do that I think there probably will be some people calling for that however I think the likelihood is pretty low okay now you you you're in the Congress in the Detroit area I believe you represent the surrounding part of the droid is that correct sir no I actually am on the other side of the state about about two hours away however I was in the state legislature six years and dealt with the dealt with Detroit extensively as chairman of the Commerce Committee and look this has been an issue that's been 60 years in the making this is not something new and it's time that we deal with it who's to who's primarily to blame I'm hearing that the union's get a lot of the blame here so too does the decline of the auto industry so too does population decline where would you put your finger on blame yeah it's all of the above with with a lot of things that have happened in Detroit you know this is a city that at one point was 1.8 million people it's now seven hundred thousand people and you can trace it way way back and this this failure unfortunately has a lot of fathers what does the rest of Michigan think about this yeah I mean that's a great question yeah it's a frustration for a lot of the out state people and I've been trying to make sure that those of us who are not from that direct Detroit area aren't aren't doing they see we told you so this is a time to stand with Detroit but it is a frustration over the years and I'm glad that the governor and the emergency manager are moving ahead with this and it really can be viewed as I think an opportunity now the Phoenix can rise here this is a fresh start for Detroit and I hope the people in Michigan look at it that way and put people in Detroit as well you say you're going to stand with the city of Detroit but there's no way around it creditors to Detroit are going to take a massive loss and so probably are those 20,000 hurries not much you can do about that is that well it's you know the important people to think of here Stuart are the citizens of Detroit the surrounding areas as well and frankly the citizens of all of Michigan again when I was in the legislature we would pour millions and millions of dollars into Detroit that that's trying to resuscitate it trying to improve it yeah but when you've got forty percent of all the street lights out you've got 58 minutes for police response you've got all these other infrastructure things that are there literally have been crumbling over the decades you've got to go in and fix those things and it's gonna it's going to take some tough decisions from everybody the union's the employees that the citizens and in the people of Michigan Congress mcclintock the city's reached the end of the road it's it's hit a brick wall but here's the last question if you were to vote on a bailout in DC a DC bailout would you vote for it a direct bailout aight which i don't think is going to be happening I couldn't go along with that as it's currently structured however I think there is a difference between bailing out a state or a city like this versus trying to add some help to them so that might be a possibility of the way that we can structure and sort of ease the burden that they may have from the federal so some help of financial help is not out of the question call us from bill Huizenga Republican Michigan thanks for joining us so we appreciate it thanks Stuart appreciate it yes sir another question for the president

welcome back his stunning insurgency and the March primary was as devastating and surgical as the Navy SEAL operations he once helped lead now Republican Dan Crenshaw has locked in a head-to-head runoff with Kevin Roberts in a battle to succeed Ted PO in congressional district 2 dan welcome to the hot seat thank you for having me here all right it didn't take long for your opponent to go negative Robert says your proposal to allow Americans to control how some of their social security contributions are invested it's actually a new tax what do you say that well you said it yourself does does it sound like when you can control how your money is spent that that's a new tax I'm very clear about no new taxes I signed a pledge to never raise taxes if you look at my website and you read the very next sentence it's very clear no new taxes no new payroll taxes it's really a shame that he's taking that out of context and trying to create something that isn't there let me be clear this is the your existing social security contribution you would just control part of it right I'm not an additional it's it's a path to the private retirement accounts this is a long-standing conservative mainstream conservative policy and it's a way to keep Social Security solvent so that our seniors can continue getting their benefits but future generations can actually have a solvent Social Security system okay Dan Robertson and supporters have dug through your Facebook account and are circulating a post from 2015 in it you say the worst thing modern Christianity stands for is anti homosexual marriage you also say quote Trump's insane rhetoric is hateful and you go on to call him an idiot now what did you mean at that time explain that well first of all those comments are drastically taken out of context if you read that whole post you know what I'm doing there I am vigorously defending Christianity because leftists were trying to compare Christianity to Sharia law that's what was going on at that time and I stand by traditional marriage I think the state should have been out of the institution of marriage is an inherently religious institution a long time ago now with respect to what the comments on President Trump you know I supported a different candidate in the in the primary I'm not ashamed that a lot of conservatives did you know he did say things that I didn't agree with but I will be clear that I have stood by the president ever since he was elected as our GOP nominee and that is I have a long record of that he's doing great things for our country and I just want to say on this one in particular this is a new low that a fellow Christian would question my faith like this I honestly can't believe it and it you know it's it's a really a new low in politics even for politicians like Kevin I mean it's really a shame to see well Roberts has been our program he's called himself a principled conservative with a clear record is there anything about his record that voters should know about that it's hard to say great honestly he spends a lot more talking time talking about me than he does about his own policies and messages and you know if you really take a good look at both of our websites I've put a lot of time and effort and detail into my policies or is you know I would I would ask toters to go look at his I have seen some you know independent third parties take a look at his record he is some failing scores there on fiscal responsibility index but in Indy and this is for voters to decide and I would ask that they do the research you know I think I have a very strong conservative message and you know the voters need to decide that for themselves considering that conservative message the president has ordered troops to the border and and and border security has been an issue of yours do you support that and with your background do you think these troops in a supportive role can be effective yeah absolutely you know and I'm going to record send this quite a few times I have a national security background I know what it takes to secure a border sometimes you just need more eyes and ears and now we need a lot more things than that just to be clear we need the border wall we need technical surveillance like drone technology sensor technology aerostat technology but for right now because the President does need to keep his promise and he doing that sending about 1,400 National Guardsmen down to the border they will be the eyes and ears that will help out our Border Patrol agents on the ground this is a huge issue for Texans we're on the front lines and we've been fronting the bill for this particular issue for a long time we're tired of it then you literally ran across the district for Harvey relief as you talk to voters now eight months after Harvey does it remain their top concern and what would you do in Congress this has been a huge issue for me right from the beginning you know during one hurricane Harvey it I was working with Team Rubicon to muck out my neighbor's homes and I was so pleased to see just that Texan grit and resilience that we all know so well neighbors helping neighbors church groups helping neighbors it was just amazing thing to see and while campaigning I've been trying to raise money for volunteer groups that are still out there every single day doing this that's why I was running across the district and I've been working I've been blessed to be able to work now work with mattress smack doing this as well and helping helping some of these groups raise money there's just so many great people in Houston coming together to get this done I would urge voters to take a look at my website again versus Kevin's and see who puts in the most effort and detail on their flood policy write-ups this is gonna be the most important issue for historians for a long time it's an existential threat to us we cannot afford another hurricane Harvey we have to have the infrastructure in place to prevent and mitigate future flooding and there's different solutions for different parts of the district on the west side it's a reservoir problem right we need to we need to prepare an upgrade attics and barker and possibly build that third reservoir that study hasn't even started that is a huge issue for us we need the Army Corps of Engineers to start this immediately or let have Harris County step in and get it done and this has to happen there's multiple projects in the Lake Houston side which is also my district that also need to get done and from Congress you need to be that leadership you need to be bringing the right people together to get this done if there's funding that's needed and that needs to come from the federal side we need to make that happen quickly as we move closer to election day would you be willing to debate your opponent Kevin Roberts head-to-head course I'm always willing to debate Kevin Roberts right here on Fox 26 absolutely can't wait all right on

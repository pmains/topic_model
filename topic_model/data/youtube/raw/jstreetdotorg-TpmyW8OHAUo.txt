hi my name is Rachel Cohen and I'm the president of j street you at Johns Hopkins University salam fayyad occupy Judaism the Israeli social justice movement in equality and pay for men and women in Jewish organizations Marwan Barghouti these are just some of the topics the Jane Eisner has written about recently in her role as the editor of the Jewish daily forward in doing so she explores and engages some of the most important questions facing all of us my generation especially as we look to the future of Israel its neighbors and the role of the American Jewish community here as a young woman i am especially honored to introduce Jane Eisner tonight five years ago in 10th Grade I read her book taking back the vote which played a truly influential role in helping me to realize the necessity of political participation in enacting meaningful social change she is one of the most important voices in our community highlighting the distance that remains in ensuring that the American Jewish community is fair and equal and continues to raise up women's leadership I'm honored to introduce Jane Eisner Thank You Rachel it is always a special privilege and a pleasure to hear rabbi Hartman speak and I thank him for his inspirational words of Torah and the Zionism that he embodies I am here for a different reason as head of a news organization that covers J Street and the many fascinating aspects of the contemporary American Jewish story what I can contribute I hope are a few words not of texts but of context that's what we journalists do we tell stories and we try to tell you what they mean the story happening here and around America is one of a Jewish community at a historic turning point we face challenges that we might not have even imagined a generation or two ago challenges brought by our prosperity our transition from a victimized minority to a group with extraordinary wealth social status and political power and alongside the challenges that come with power that is first and foremost to use it well we have an unprecedented opportunity to bring our religious values and our faith commitment into the public square so how will we do that there's an old saying that good journalism is all about comforting the afflicted and afflict income fir tible we Jews are for the most part the comfortable in 21st century America and we need to recognize that to absorb that to allow it to shape our public behavior or religious expression and our pro-israel advocacy to illustrate how quickly this change has happened and how very American it is I'll start with a brief story some years ago I was named the London correspondent for the Philadelphia Enquirer before moving there I went to look for a place to live and since my visit was during sukkot a friend from our acara in Philadelphia put me in touch with an English family and they offered to host me for a meal so there I am sitting at their table I'm trying to sort of build a kind of connection with them and so I thought I'd relay some news about our mutual friend I told my English hosts about our kuvira's celebration of Simplot hora the previous year we brought the Torah's from the place where we had dhavan into Rittenhouse Square in center city philadelphia we danced out in the open and invited others to join in our mutual friend who was a rabbi took great delight in standing in the middle of the street leading to the square his arms stretched out like this stopping traffic for us to cross so i joyfully recounted how wonderful it was to see our friend dressed in a white kittle holding up cars and bicycles as if he was Moses crossing the Red Sea all of this in public in the fanciest square in Philadelphia well this did not go over as I had planned rather than delight in my story my hosts were stunned silent they were too polite to say what I realized afterwards they were probably thinking which is that American Jews are crazy to be so demonstrative in public to literally bring their religious zeal into the public square and maybe we were then but we no longer are now let's fast-forward to October 2011 another group of young engaged Jews wearing white kittles are leading a prayer service outdoors but this time it's yom kippur the holiest day of the year and the place is not a small fancy square in Philadelphia but a large encampment just steps from Wall Street the center of finance in the richest country on the planet instead of a few dozen people dancing with Toras the kolnari service associated with Occupy Wall Street last year drew hundreds of Jews and probably some non-jews who repeated ancient prayers and beat their breasts in repentance under the bright lights of lower Manhattan this was an extraordinary assertion of power and identity a sign of a rival for Jews and incense a return to the historic place that religion has played played in the public face of progressive activism in America at the time it seemed kind of new and gutsy because for at least the past three decades religious expression in the political sphere has been dominated by evangelical conservatives a trend that we are seeing in dismaying detail in this current Republican presidential primary but the right has not always had a monopoly on the expression of faith in the public square in a sense the Jews who chanted Kol Nidre were upholding a tradition that began in the revolutionary war continued through the anti-slavery and civil rights movements and even was manifested in the protest against the Vietnam War a weaving together of faith tradition and progressive politics there was a time not very long ago when rabbis like Abraham Joshua Heschel marched for civil rights and Arthur wasps Kyle created a freedom Seder and Catholic priests and nuns were instrumental in anti-war agitation their actions propelled by a fervent religiosity and expressed in liturgical terms rooted in this progressive past this new form of what some of us have been calling occupied Judea ism is very much a creature of the moment it could not have come together without the extensive use of social media by savvy organizers who didn't need or seek the blessings of communal leadership like the social justice protests that swept Israel last year it is bottom up not top down in both its political and its religious character and to be successful and sustainable this style of activism requires more than just a motivation for change it's not just that the organizers of Occupy Judaism didn't depend on a hexer from the Jewish establishment they were knowledgeable enough and skilled enough to conduct a service on their own this I think is an important point if we are as Jews going to bring about a new relationship of faith in the public square we have to know what our faith tradition believes and what it asks of us the foundation for this new relationship can't be built on some squishy iteration of tikkun olam or other sorts of bland universal sentiments if we're going to be more public Jews we have to know what Judaism requires of us and similarly if you're going to be effective advocates for Israel you have to be informed learn more visit debate engage we also have to recognize that a religious tradition as old and is which as ours omits several and sometimes competing strains of values and narratives we can't be so arrogant as to say that the true Judaism is only a progressive one an even greater challenge is to incorporate a realistic appraisal of who we are in this society into our public role it seems to me that most of the establishment Jewish organizations operate under the assumptions of the last century that Jews are vulnerable and this close to another disaster and that the best people to lead those organizations are white men of a certain age and experience I understand where that comes from I understand where that comes from our history is littered with examples of Jews attaining great wealth and status think of Spain in the 14th century or Germany a century ago only to have that privilege crumble under the oppressive weight of an inquisition or a Holocaust I understand the fear that good moments will evaporate in an instant hey I'm a Jewish mother guilt and anxiety are my constant companions but those episodes in history didn't happen in America which I believe has a far more tolerant DNA and despite our sometimes ugly past has a far better chance of guaranteeing the rights of minorities than any other place on earth nevermind the fact that Americans love us here they really do Robert Putnam in his recent seminal work Amazing Grace how religion divides us and unites us asserts that we Jews are the most popular religious group in America and he offers the data to back it up this very fact I know does create a kind of cognitive dissonance with some Jews I actually spoke to Putnam about this and he told me that when he lectured at his own reform synagogue just outside Boston about this topic and here I'm quoting he said people said you're wrong they do hate us and he replied to them best as I can tell they don't they don't so as you chart the future of pro-israel advocacy I urge you to do that in the context of this new reality we are a vulnerable people in many places in the world the tragic events last week in Toulouse are just only the latest reminder but right now here in America we are in a fundamentally different place and we are a fundamentally different people we should never forget that power is always a privilege that it can corrupt those who wield it and that it comes with its own sense of demands and responsibilities as we become more assertive in the public square we should also be mindful to support and maintain the constitutional separation of religion and state that I believe has enabled us to function as such a free religious minority and ethnic group here in this country when I was researching an essay on occupied Judaism last fall I had a wonderful conversation with Alan wolf a political scientist at Boston College and he offered an astute observation by linking public prayer with protest he told me quote it says that the protest has an element of the sacred associated with it invoking holiness in the public square implying that such work is divinely inspired can make us uncomfortable because it can't smack of the kind of arrogance and certainty that becomes dangerous and intolerant but thinking of this as sacred work can also be viewed in another way it can encourage humility you can embrace a new vibrant role for Jewish faith and progressive activism that is also respectful of the past and untell intend on upholding that legacy for me this balance is beautifully enunciated by Martin Luther King in his letter from a Birmingham jail and I can't help but quote that in my closing we must come to see that human progress never rolls in on wheels and inevitability it comes through the tireless efforts and persistent work of men willing to be co-workers with God thank

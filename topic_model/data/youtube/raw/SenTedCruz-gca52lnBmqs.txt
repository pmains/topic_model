give us chairman welcome undersecretary Thompson I'd like to ask you some questions about the State Department's policy towards Iran the State Department and as I understand it your Bureau in particular has advocated for civil nuclear waivers to continue implementing parts of the catastrophic Obama Iran nuclear deal that allowed Iran to conduct nuclear research top state Department officials in your Bureau have stated that it is your policy to facilitate quote international cooperation with Iran on a number of projects contemplated under the jcpoa that provide Iran opportunities to benefit from nuclear technology to signal our appreciation for the security benefits these projects were intended to provide elsewhere officials including those in your Bureau have touted the benefits of the so-called transparency as promised in the deal these positions appear to be in significant tension if not direct conflict with the positions of President Trump I find it troubling that we're continuing to implement parts of the nuclear deal and I want to understand the basis for these decisions your predecessors and previous administrations suggested that Iran's access to civil nuclear technology hinges on whether Iran is a member in good standing in the nuclear non-proliferation treaty during the Bush administration acting under secretary John Rood said Iran was no longer a quote member in good standing of the NPT under the Obama administration under secretary Rose Gottemoeller said that Iran had been quote brought back into good standing with the non-proliferation treaty regime because of the Iran deal I'm glad to know that recently the Trump administration appears to have reversed the Obama administration's whitewashing of Iran's conduct Jeffrey Eberhardt has been nominated to be special representative for nuclear non-proliferation recently confirmed to this committee in writing that quote Iran standing as a non-nuclear weapons state party to the NPT cannot be described as good that's a step in the right direction first of all I'd like to confirm that assessment do you consider Iran to be a member in good standing of the NPT thank you senator and I appreciate the support for Jeff Pfeffer hard as this nomination process moves forward it'll be a great representative of this administration for our countries we have those those key discussions I've known Jeff for quite a while now we have concerns and we laid out those concerns we've laid them out publicly and would have more details if we if we talked at the classified level on some of the concerns that we have with the way around it's going and Jeff's reflection is is a definite reflection of where we are today okay let me just try that again do you consider Iran to be a member in good standing of the NPT we have concerns that Senator we have concerns with where they are going do you agree with mr. Eberhardt statement in writing that quote Iran standing is a non-nuclear weapons state party the NPT cannot be described as good that is correct and that's what we laid out in the compliance report and we can give you the background of that in a classified setting absolutely senator so why do why do you believe we should keep implementing parts of the nuclear deal allowing Iran to do nuclear research even though Iran is not entitled to those benefits and and president Trump has correctly rejected this foolhardy deal again senator the we've give the information again it's a rigorous interagency a discussion with intelligence with policy with where DoD is with do-e etc and then we make a recommendation to the secretary and he even forms that with the president we can we can give you the background about on the classified version behind it but there are in some areas and that's why this secretary made the determination some of the dates aren't you know the length isn't the same and some of the areas on where it's in our best interest to have some of those waivers for shorter duration how is it possibly in our best interest to allow Iran to continue doing nuclear research and the Fordo bunker that was built into the side of a mountain to be able to develop nuclear weapons to use to murder Americans how is that in our best interest senator you know this is a discussion that I'd prefer to have in the skiff on what information we have and what information we don't have with all respects the American people care deeply about this so I am perfectly happy to have classified briefings but whether we are allowing Iran to do nuclear weapons in a bunker designed to create weapons of mass destruction to murder Americans is an issue of concern to 28 million Texans and and so the American people are entitled to get an answer if it is the State Department's position that that's a good idea the American people are entitled to know that absolutely senator so I will give you the answer to the American people to all those in Texas and to friends and family back in South Dakota this president the secretary myself and everyone in this administration will stand for what's right for the safety and security of the American people bar none okay with all due respect that didn't answer the question remotely is it in our interest to allow Iran to continue to do nuclear research in the fordo facility the decision made by this administration and with the secretary for this last round is always in the interest of the American people senator thank you so it really is the position that every decision state makes is always in the decision of the American people the safety and security yes sir that that is a stunning Orwellian position and let me be the first to say that I don't believe that's true in any administration that every decision an elected official makes or an appointed official makes is by definition in the interest of the American people and that's one of the reasons Congress has oversight responsibilities senator I won't do a challenge here in public I will tell you I took an oath as did you do this to the Constitution and the American people and to the enemies foreign and domestic my underlying going in position is always the safety and security of the American people I did that as a soldier I did that as a national security advice for the vice president and I'm doing it as the Undersecretary of State as we now know the nuclear archives seized by the Israelis contained a wealth of new information about Iran's nuclear program we know that Western intelligence agencies and the International Atomic Energy Agency didn't know about these elements of Iran's nuclear program because the IAEA declared in 2015 the never conducted activities which the archives now clearly show that Iran conducted they were keeping nuclear weapons blueprints on the shelf to use later do you consider Iran's past possession of the nuclear archive seized by Israel last year including the materials and the archives relevant to the development of nuclear weapons to constitute non-compliance by Iran of any of its non-proliferation obligations again senator I would prefer to talk about what is in those documents not to be done in an open forum okay those talks are now public it have been released to the world so there's information there that were protecting sources and methods in all candor I will give you that information I would tell you what just refer to the public part that you can go to the internet and read so I'm not asking for classified portions I'm asking for the public portions of the archives that the Israelis seized that show Iran in open defiance do you agree with that I agree with the process that they have in the past years if those documents was disconcerting absolutely then why would the State Department continued to give waivers to allow them to conduct nuclear research particularly in the forto site I did I mean that I find staggering it's a bunker built in the side of a mountain it's not a medical research facility it's not a diaper factory it is a bunker built to make nuclear weapons and the state department assigned waivers saying Iran the Ayatollah can continue to do nuclear research there how is that possibly in the interest of the United States I would say that's your assessment senator I would not characterize it as such well that's the problem

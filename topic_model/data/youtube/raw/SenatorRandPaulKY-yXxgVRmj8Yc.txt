every day virtually every day we seem to hear from you things we can't do but when you're asked can we go back to school i don't hear much certitude at all i hear well maybe it depends guess what it's rare for kids to transmit this but i hear nothing of that coming from you all i hear dr falchi is we can't do this we can't do that senator rand paul republican of kentucky and one of the few people in public life willing to question dr fauci dr fauci is not infallible but so many in the media and so many in politics seem not to accept that senator paul welcome to newsmax uh getting a second opinion it seems like it's perfectly legitimate and perfectly american quite frankly but you're not supposed to do with dr fauci why is that well i think it's a mistake to place all of our trust in one individual there are lots of experts there have been people on the other side of this there's a scott atlas who's the chairman of the department of medicine out in stanford uh there are many other doctors and epidemiologists infectious disease we shouldn't rely on just one and when we listen to all the experts we should also remember that we're not giving them the power to dictate our lives and we shouldn't ultimately each individual in america must make their own individual choices based on the way they perceive risk so frankly the risks are a lot different for an 18 year old than they are for an 80 year old and frankly their behaviors with regard to this pandemic should and ought to be allowed to be different based on their own individual choices and we have a bit of a track record i mean dr falchi has been wrong on some key issues yet he still commands this authority which quite frankly you know i don't think he necessarily deserves right now but let's talk for a little bit about schools it seems like a no-brainer if we don't go back to school we're going to have untold social upheaval parents are really counting on this how much is the effort to delay school openings do you think political all day long we hear all of the naysayers and all the doomsday predictions and none of them cite any of the facts the facts are actually pretty good with sending kids back to school mortality for kids under 18 is about one in a million mortality for ages 18 to 45 is about 10 in 100 000 that's where most of our teachers would be in that range but also if you study contact tracing what you find is that not only do kids rarely get it not only do kids rarely die from it but kids also rarely transmit the disease and you saw this a couple weeks ago when a wh o scientist came out and she said just as much and she quoted a study but you know what happened within 24 hours the political correctness police came out they made her withdraw it and if you look on the who website they took down the link it was a link to a scientific paper that said exactly what many papers are showing and what many studies are showing is that kids rarely get this and kids rarely transmit it so there's no excuse for not going back to school european countries have opened most of their schools and there has been no surge i really think that we got to get our kids back to school i don't know if you've ever heard this you are a physician on capitol hill one of the few there but if you mix politics and medicine you only get politics and i i fear that really that's what's happening regarding the school situation you made a an effective argument i think the facts are on your side but the hysteria out there uh is is widespread the media hype is uh extremely intense right now and it doesn't seem like well it seems like a lot of school systems will not be opening up when they should yeah and see all the hysteria now is that there's an increase in a rise in infections and i think that is true some of its testing but there really is an increase in those who are infected but what we're finding is it really has not been a significant increase in mortality if you look at nationwide mortality there's a possible uptick in the last week but really if you look at the overall curve it looks just like what people wanted and that was a flattening of a curve so we have a very flat and and slowly downward trending death rate and if you look at new york virtually no one's dying up there anymore and here's what's probably going to be true and nobody can say this with certainty we're probably not going to require herd immunity that's about 60 some odd percent new york has about 25 immunity and historically a lot of viruses have burned out and much less than herd immunity and you haven't heard this anywhere but there's something called the break point for a disease and the break point for disease is when you historically look at what percentage of the people got infected before the disease seemed to disappear diseases do disappear sometimes so we don't know and i can't predict exactly when but i think the number of how many people have to be infected the percentage on the immunity is much lower and i frankly think new jersey new york connecticut massachusetts have already passed that number and the rest of us including all the states that are hotbeds now never got to that number but the fortunate thing is we learned a lot of things from the mistakes of the democrat governors in new york and new jersey not to send patients with coronavirus back to the nursing home i want to roll some video now not sound but video from something i saw on msnbc this morning big lines i believe in miami of people in cars waiting for covet 19 testing and the reporter mentioned that some of these people were in the cars for seven hours um i just can't imagine that that's good for you i i is this the way testing is supposed to work i mean if you're healthy enough to sit in the car for seven hours uh i mean isn't that kind of counterproductive maybe you should just stay home if you're that concerned what do you think of the testing situation right now well because the media has told everyone they have to be tested everybody's showing up to be tested everybody's saying we need more more more testing we all know the symptoms pretty well and if somebody around you gets a headache or flu symptoms or achy joints or a fever or call it's probably this virus because it's so prevalent it's out there good news is if you had it you can go back to work and really we shouldn't be forcing people who are immune to wear masks it should be yeah it was terrible that you got this all 10 million of you but that's 10 million people that shouldn't have to go around looking uh like they're they're trying to do sort of theater as far as security for this disease when they are already immune senator rand paul yes who did have coveted 19. thank you very much good to see you on television the whole country saw you in cartoon form this morning just want to show our viewers this is by ben garrison some frustration with a doctor faucet guess who that is uh leaking things like school stay closed and uh doesn't seem to care about the economy and here's senator paul that's a version of you back when you had a beard shut him off any comment i got 10 seconds left well he needs to stay out of baseball football hockey leave our sports alone leave our schools alone let people make decisions let them make balanced decisions senator rand paul republican of kentucky thanks very much sir thank you

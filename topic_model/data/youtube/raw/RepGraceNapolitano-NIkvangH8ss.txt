  RESERVES.  MR. DEFAZIO: I YIELD TWO MINUTES TO THE GENTLELADY FROM   CALIFORNIA.  THE CHAIR: THE GENTLELADY IS   RECOGNIZED.  MRS. NAPOLITANO: THANK YOU VERY  MUCH, MR. CHAIRMAN.  THANK YOU, MR. DEFAZIO.  I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO THE  DENHAM AMENDMENT WHICH WOULD   OVERTURN A FEDERAL COURT   DECISION THAT DETERMINED THAT  CALIFORNIA MALE AND REST BREAKS  APPLY TO TRUCKERS. ON JULY 4, 2017, THE SUPREME   COURT RULED THAT THEY MUST ALLOW FOR 30-MINUTE MEAL BREAK AFTER   FIVE HOURS OF WORK AND 10  MINUTES REST BREAK AFTER FOUR  HOURS. THIS IS REASONABLE WHEN YOU  CONSIDER THAT TRUCK DRIVERS CAN  BE SUBJECT TO 14 HOURS ON  ON-DUTY TIME.  THIS AMENDMENT WOULD NOT ONLY  PREEMPT CALIFORNIA'S LAW AND   PREEMPT LAWS IN 21 OTHER STATES  AND TERRITORIES. THIS AMENDMENT IS HARMFUL  BECAUSE IT PREEMPTS THAT WOULD   PROHIBIT LOCAL STATES FROM   ENACTING LAWS THAT IMPOSE ANY  ADDITIONAL OBLIGATION ON MOTOR   CARRIERS.  THIS WOULD IMPACT LAWS OUR TRUCK DRIVERS. MR. CHAIRMAN, STATES SHOULD BE   ALLOWED TO SET THESE IMPORTANT   STANDARDS FOR TRUCK DRIVER   WORKING CONDITIONS AS THEY SEE   FIT FOR THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THEIR WORKERS AND ALSO FOR THE   SAFETY OF OUR CITIZENS.  I ASK MY COLLEAGUES TO OPPOSE  THE DENHAM AMENDMENT AND I ASK   UNANIMOUS CONSENT TO INCLUDE   INTO THE RECORD LETTERS OF   OPPOSITION FROM TEAMSTERS,   AMERICAN JUSTICE --  THE CHAIR: GENERAL REQUEST WILL  BE COVERED UNDE

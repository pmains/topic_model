stuff with the opening statement of the chair and the ranking member a number I've said who support the jcpoa or have said that we should always regard the signature the president the United States as binding on our country that the president gives our word and that word is binding on us I would hope that Congress would reject that view for example this president might sign an agreement with Russia that said we will never base American soldiers in Poland or the Baltics unless that is approved by Congress it should not be regarded as binding on the American people so I think it is legal for the president to renounce the jcpoa it's just a terrible idea at this time it will meet the president's psychological needs this agreement has the scent of Obama on it it will meet perhaps his political needs it is terrible statecraft the president would be doing so in order to say he wants to sanction Iran just a few weeks ago a bipartisan letter was sent to the president urging him to use the addition existing sanctions from 2010 to sanction those who give spyware to the Iranian government to suppress its people he has not sanctioned a single company near nor has his predecessor we it doesn't seem like the president wants to sanction Iran in order to sanction Iran he wants to sanction Iran in order to desecrate a document signed by his predecessor if we're going to renounce this deal we have to ask what rights does each party acquire if the deal is voided well Iran gets the bill go forward with its nuclear program no inspectors heavy-water unlimited centrifuges and that and they can seek a return I'll get to this in a second of the stockpile of fissile material that they shipped abroad under the deal what do we get well we know that sanctions can change Iran's behavior there are many reasons to sanction Iran does voiding the deal allow us to impose sanctions we couldn't impose otherwise well we know that voiding the deal angers European and Japan and makes it incredibly difficult to have effective multilateral sanctions but some of us we but many of us were here when John Kerry sat at that table and told us that even under the deal adhering to the deal we can sanction Iran in full proportion to its non-nuclear wrongdoing they're responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths in Syria tens of thousands of deaths in Yemen they stoned people to death for who they love if they did never had thought of a nuclear program we would be coming up with every possible sanction and if we said we're doing it because of Syria and Yemen we'd have European support so the only reason there are plenty of reasons to sanction Iran to change its behavior staying in the deal allows us to sanction Iran and have the hope and expectation of European and Japanese support voiding the deal liberate s-- them and reduces the effectiveness of our sanctions I don't even know why we're talking about this but I believe it and I do have a question but this deal was the good the bad and the ugly good and bad at the beginning it gets ugly next decade the best part was that Iran shipped 16 thousand pounds of low enriched uranium a little bit of mid enriched uranium out of the country they had the fissile material which if further refined could create several nuclear bombs they shipped it to Russia miss Harmon would mr. Putin if we voted this voided this agreement would he entertain a request from Tehran to return that fissile material which was shipped to Russia would he tease us would he return part of it in return for more control of Syria how would we empower Putin if he's sitting on 1600 pounds of low enriched uranium that he may or may not return to Iran first of all let me commend Congress for something it did last year by a veto-proof margin and that was to pass a sanctions law against Russia Iran and North Korea that dramatically increased sanctions against all three countries and I think that law has been very effective and Congress did this on a bipartisan basis so there's something to celebrate there what would the the the newly sworn-in President of Russia do he would make mischief I'm not exactly sure how he would do it but I think that is his MO and oh by the way there has been a vacuum in the Middle East as US leadership in my view has has reduced that has allowed Russia to to increase it's it's it's its power in Syria and elsewhere to our detriment so I think leaving the deal on a unilateral basis if that's where this comes out even if we do and I hope we do waived secondary secondary penalties that permit Europe and Iran to keep the deal further isolates us and that that's a mistake in in terms of US strategy if the clock is accurate I have time for one more question but I'm not sure it is if we simply don't enforce the secondary sanctions and all we're doing is cutting off trade with the United States would that be significant enough for Iran to withdraw from the deal if all they're losing is the US caviar market well I actually don't think so but let's understand it does have significant effects on at least one US company that would be Boeing which has sold a number of airplanes to Iran and I think that deal would be in in jeopardy and thousands of jobs in various locations in the US would be in jeopardy so I don't understand I think none of us understands what the advantage to the US and I think that's the point of your question is from from the the way the administration seems to want to proceed this afternoon we're all in favor of a better deal and I think there is a path to get a better deal we go to Christmas

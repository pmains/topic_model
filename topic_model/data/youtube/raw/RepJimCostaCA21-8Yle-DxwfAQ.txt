the chair will now recognize himself briefly I want to thank the ranking member mcpaul and chairman Engel for the good work that they and committee members have done on this and block a series of resolutions legislation and amendments that reflect I think a consensus on this important Foreign Relations Committee that attempts to every day work on behalf of the American people in terms of what is in the best interest of America's foreign policy clearly the challenges that we discussed here today as it relates to the Middle East particularly with regards to Israel and and the West Bank the Palestinians have been vexing issues for decades my first visit to Israel was back in 1981 I have had numerous visits to that part of the world like many members of this committee actually spent a vacation just a few years ago in Israel well there has been progress made in many areas the ability to arrive at a two-state solution still seems to be very very difficult as we all know but I think that the good will and the good work in a bipartisan effort by this committee will continue to try to move the ball forward ultimately define a two-state solution that will resolve the challenges we see there and hopefully have a lasting peace certainly that is the goal that we all share hearing no further requests for recognition then without objection the committee will proceed to consider the notice items and block the reporting quorum is present without objection each measure is considered as read amendments to each are considered as read and agreed to the question occurs on the measuring block as amended if amended all those in favor say aye aye aye all those opposed hearing none in the opinion of the chair the have it the measure considered in blocker agreed to and without objection each measures ordered favorably reported as a minute if amended and each amended to each bill shall be reported as a single amendment in the nature of a substitute and without objection the staff is authorized to make any technical and conforming changes to any of the measures considered during today's markup and we thank the this staff on a bipartisan fashion for all of their good work the chair will now recognize mr.

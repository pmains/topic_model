i saw a black suv pull up i knew immediately what it was i'm just proud to have been his father i take refuge in how proud my son was to serve it gives me a deeper appreciation for the price of freedom and what it means to be an american it's important that we get political leadership that will not squander the sacrifices that have been made to keep this nation headed in the right direction that's why i support dan sullivan i know that he shares the same values my son had this is a man of the highest personal integrity that will not compromise his principles for political gain he's ready to fight for alaska and he is the right man for the job and this is the time that we need him the most i'm dan sullivan and i approve this message

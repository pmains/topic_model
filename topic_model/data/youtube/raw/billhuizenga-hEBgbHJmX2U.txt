thank you madam Speaker and I appreciate that from my friend from Arkansas who's shown great leadership on this on this issue well madam Speaker thousands of companies across this country and in my state of Michigan utilized derivatives to better manage the risks that they face every day the the proper use of derivatives to lower risk benefits the global economy by allowing a range of businesses from manufacturing healthcare agriculture and a myriad of others to improve their planning and forecasting and to offer more stable prices to cuss the customers by imposing over-the-top regulatory burdens on end users this could increase costs and reduce liquidity that prevent these companies from using derivatives markets efficiently effectively and properly that's why I'm a proud sponsor of HR 742 the data swap repository and clearing house indemnification correction act quite a mouthful but an important piece of bipartisan legislation which you Nana's unanimously passed both the agriculture and the Financial Services Committee a rare feat in Washington these days and it would remove the unrealistic requirement to to secure against future losses which some have noted is a unique concept to US law but it would it would remove these unrealistic requirements imposed on foreign regulators by dodd-frank and as a condition of obtaining access to the data repositories that we need to share well in fact earlier this year the CFTC and the SEC the the regulated regulatory agencies issued a joint report on international swap regulation acknowledging the problems with indemnification provisions in dodd-frank the SEC and CFTC staff report said that the indemnification provisions have quote caused concern on foreign regulators some of which have expressed unwillingness to rec register or recognize a slots data repository unless we're able to have direct access to necessary information end quote additionally the report noted that quote Congress may determine what a legislative amendment to the indemnification provision is a propriate end quote well folks despite opposition from the secretary of the Treasury in the White House here is the bipartisan answer to this problem and we're glad to see that people on both sides right left and center have all agreed that this is a proper measured step to solve this issue and as you can see this legislation solution is small it's a technical pics to the dodd-frank act but it's desperately needed and is vital to maintain the integrity of domestic and global derivatives market regulations and I urge swift passage of HR 742 thank you and I yield back

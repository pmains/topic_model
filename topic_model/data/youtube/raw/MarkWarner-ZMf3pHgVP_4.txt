well we actually had some bipartisan success about two months ago where we passed the first part of this uh this act to try to help uh entrepreneurs and small businesses uh get access to capital that was the jobs act that's been signed into law this is the second phase it's kind of startup act 2.0 where we've got two democrats two republicans saying let's go ahead and make sure we're successful also trying to win the global battle for talent the fact is uh 80 of all the new jobs created in america are created by startup businesses not traditional large businesses uh we've got to make sure we those businesses are successful and one of the ways is to access global talent and what you will see is i think across the central virginia area out particularly in the blacksburg area up in northern virginia where you've got a lot of entrepreneurs wanting to start start new businesses we've now made it easy for them to raise capital if we pass this legislation it'll be easier for them to also attract the kind of world-class talent to grow those virgin businesses right here in virginia i think the the four senators who are involved marco rubio jerry moran two republicans chris cones and i we're all new we didn't get the memo that we're supposed to take presidential election years off from getting stuff done you know you look at brazil you look at china you look at india they're still plunging ahead we've got to do the same we don't have the luxury of sitting back in america just because a lot of politicians want to blame each other for all our problems as opposed to getting stuff done we want to get stuff done and i think that partnering with these guys i i always believe a bipartisan solution is better because i think for most americans they don't trust either political party enough to give them a blank check and if you've got a bipartisan idea that means you're trying to find that common ground where actually stuff gets done

this Thank You mr. chairman them I've been curious say a little bit about the issue of if when we export natural gas we're going to see an increased price and I'm not a consummate engineer but I'd probably like to see a little bit more statistics about that why that would occur because as you know we've been exporting fifteen percent of the coal production and we haven't seen coal prices increase as a result of that so I I'm interested in the disconnect why coal prices aren't going up a gas prices well under those scenario but more importantly to that the other question I have is that the under article 1 section 9 paragraph 5 of the Constitution there is the prohibition about putting duties and tariffs on exports and that's been clarified if I might in 1996 in the IBM decision in which it went on to say something that affected that that same protection extends the services and activities closely related to the export process so my question has to do with the permitting process if it takes three years to get a permit for natural gas I know Cole has been longer than three years trying to get the permit approved over in a state of Washington in bellingham to put a coal terminal they're trying to prevent exporting by use of government authority what's the difference between imposing a tariff but yet imposing a slow-walked permitting process to prevent something from happening in an expeditious way how can that be justified how is that constitutional i should say what they're doing i'd like to get mr. Bachus to answer this but he's a lawyer and I noticed that he's being reticent I believe that and I have I'm an amateur reader of law journals but i think i am pretty clear i'm just waiting to be asked a question I'm sorry I'm vented then I will read I will receive the congressman you raised a very good point as we've all learned in this country in the past few years sometimes it's hard to tell a tax from a bee or attacks from something else that may have the effect of attacks and it may be that under the US Constitution there might be some issues raised by the lengthy delays in this permitting process as I advised the Chairman at the outset I'm here today not to advise on policy but on law and specifically international law and from a legal perspective I'm fascinated by this debate because as a matter of international law we have long since made this decision that we're talking about today when we sign the WTO treaty we concluded then that it was presumably in our public interest in agreeing to this treaty that we would impose restrictions on exports only in some very limited exceptional circumstances permitted by that treaty and I've heard no circumstances discussed today that fit those exceptions in that treaty as a matter of international law right now with no action whatsoever by this Congress we have a legal obligation to export natural gas unrestricted to her country and other countries in Central and Eastern Europe that are members of the WTO period the only reason that we're not doing so at this point is because they're friends of ours and they haven't bothered to sue us in the WTO but somebody could do so at the same time as I mentioned our valiant trade negotiators and trade lawyers and the administration are at this very moment arguing in the WTO in not one but two cases against China that they cannot do what these laws were discussing that we have in place today do and they are winning those cases as they rightly should meantime more than one-third of WTO members under the threats of the current financial situation are imposing more and more sport restrictions this is a form of economic nationalism and protectionism that is illegal ISM as a matter of international law and the United States on a bipartisan basis has been leading the charge against this in the WTO and should thank you and maybe you can stop I'd like to carry on this conversation regarding the constitutionality of that that the third question I have it has it do you think that this Supreme Court's decision yesterday about the Spruce mine allowing the EPA to retro actively withdraw a permit that they've given could that have an impact on our LNG exports if someone can build the facility which could be a billion dollars or more and the EPA withdraw that permit two or three years later is that an appropriate gesture or what has happened in the law that allow that to happen I haven't read the opinion congressman so I couldn't advise you on that at this time I'll be happy to figure aware of the sprues mind where they pulled the money that four years after had been granted for years afterwards that the EPA pulled the permit that they had been granted by the Corps of Engineers that's a chilling effect for anyone in any business not just coal co anyone that has a water permanent they have that permanent pole I'm concerned about what it's going to have an LNG thank you yield back my time gentleman yields back and we'll go a couple more questions both mr.

from the beginning uh when pvp was offered or sba loans where it's just been a challenge since for small businesses to be able to get you know any access to those my name is esterand i'm the owner and ceo of borderlands brewing company down here in tucson arizona we're located in the heart of downtown the banks kind of prioritizes big businesses and kind of left us out on the blue it took months to to get a reply from sba and then ppp went straight from the banks and the banks had control over where they wanted to go so if there happens to be another program that is there to to incentivize the small businesses uh would you agree that it should be streamlined or should be more accessible to small businesses rather than big chains this assistance was intended for small businesses not intended for those big companies i mean i've talked spoken to small business owners who wound up you know on the phone for three hours but they happen to live in a rural area of our state and two and a half hours into the or three hours into the phone conversation the call drops and now they're starting all over again you vote for the issues now for the party so i really hope that that uh captain kelly can do that um being able to identify what his constituents need not what this party is telling him to do um it's something that should be admirable he will be a good leader for the state of arizona the role of government is to try to anticipate these things and get ahead of them and i'm hopeful that they're going to do a better job this time around

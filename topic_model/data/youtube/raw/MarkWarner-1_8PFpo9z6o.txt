salves also out there not telling the truth about it joining me now Senator Mark Warner of Virginia he's the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee senator thanks so much for joining us so Michael Cohen says in this court filing on Friday the quote that he quote remained in close and regular contact with the White House staff when he when he was lying to Congress about the development and attempted development of a Trump Tower in Moscow did President Trump or the White House staff know that he was lying instruct him the line that July do we know anything about that well first of all Jake I just in light of the earlier segments in the news the last few days I want to add my voice in terms of great deal of respect and admiration for President Bush oil boy that kind of strong leadership he brought to the world stage we could use that now could you imagine a George Bush at this last g20 versus the performance of them mr. Trump to the mower investigation and what happened last week with the Cowan pleading but step back and look at what we know we know that now that then candidate Donald Trump was still trying to do business with Russia in the summer of 2016 we know as well that his son and son-in-law had been meeting with Russians to get potential dirt on Hillary Clinton we know that his campaign aides had knew about the emails that had been stolen by the Russians and we knew that his campaign chairman Paul Manafort was trying to offer to brief the Russians and we really the campaign aides knew about you talking about that Papadopoulos Papadopoulos often happens so these are all things that have been established by Muller and what I find particularly interesting with the revelation of Cohen's plea is that he's saying he lied to protect then candidate Trump's stories that he had nothing to do with Russia so now I the president seemed to already be changing his story a little bit and saying what was all legal I'll leave lawyers to make those determinations but I got to believe that most Republicans who were about to nominate Donald Trump in the summer 16 would probably have thought it was a relevant fact they would like to have known that then candidate Trump was still trying to do business with Russia do we know whether you know Michael Cohen said that he was in he in contact close to regular contact with White House staff while he was lying to Congress about this deal of the Trump Tower Moscow do we know anything about whether or not the White House was aware that he was lying I'm not aware of that obviously this was just the plea arrangement with Michael Cohen and clearly most of these characters who were around Donald Trump none of them have exactly a sterling record of telling the truth right but I gotta believe that the special prosecutor has more details to come now you said on Thursday that it might not be a coincidence that Muller waited to announce Michael Cohen's new plea until after he had received these written answers to his questions from President Trump are you suggesting that President Trump was less than truthful in his answers to Robert Muller I'm not suggesting anything and I'm purely speculating but I know there'd been a four or five three or four-month timeout where Muller had not taken many actions appropriately I think before the election and it just appeared that he was waiting to get the president's written responses before he took or at least announced this complete but that's pure speculation and obviously with this White House that seems to not be able to go a day without a factual inaccuracy or failing to tell the truth anything's up for grabs Jerry Nadler the congressman from New York who's likely going to be the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee he said on Friday quote it's become very clear that the Trump campaign colluded with the Russians now he meant that not necessarily about conspiracy to affect the election but collusion and in a broader sense having to do with business deals having to do with whatever do you agree is there evidence of that again I'm gonna continue the same position I've had from the beginning of this investigation why we've kept it bipartisan both chairman burrow and I are going to reserve that final judgment until we get all our facts we still need to see people like Michael Cohen back before our committee but we do know this pretty clear that the Russians not only did they they hacked into the emails not only had they stolen other information but they were very forward-leaning in terms of offering this information to the Trump camp pain and it appears that a number of the senior Trump officials or campaign officials continued to lie about those kind of contacts I wonder though if there is a narrative here that is different from the one that a lot of Americans were thinking it was which is for instance in March 2016 President Trump suggested or then-candidate Trump suggested easing sanctions against Russia for the invasion of Crimea he was in the middle of also trying to do you know curry favor with Putin to have this very lucrative deal from tower mosque you know a trump tower deal that supposedly they were going to offer Putin a fifty million dollar house suite for free yes exactly so Mike what maybe there was a motivation of greed and avarice and business in wings and not we're doing this for Russia so that they helped us win the election maybe it's we doing this for Russia so that after we lose the election we can make a lot of money in Russia well they were clearly from the outset I think everyone wondered why was Donald Trump who is willing to whack almost anyone was never willing to say an ill word about Vladimir Putin right now was it and we still don't know the answer this was it because of his business dealings or potential business dealings with Russia or was it because at some point during the campaign and I think special prosecutor Muller is zeroing in on Roger stone as well was there some communication about what the Russians had and the potential then release through wiki linked and the ties between WikiLeaks and Roger stone that's a whole chapter that I think that Moeller still has much to reveal well I guess well well on that subject of the Roger stone a part of it is there evidence that Roger stone Randi credit co jerome corsi any of this gang actually coordinated with wikileaks for the release of we've we've not had a chance to interview mr. stone yet clearly the special prosecutor has and I like you and I think most of America wanna hear the results of those kind of interviewers the special prosecutor has interviewed Roger stones miner believe I'm not a hundred percent sure on that I know they've been back and forth ya know at least they've dealt with 4c I'm not sure what yeah it seems to me like they've been circling around Rajasthan they haven't necessarily gone towards I'm

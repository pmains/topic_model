I think Americans expect to be treated with dignity when they go through airport just as we hope that our visitors to the United States are treated with dignity when they come here for many Americans a use of x-ray scanning machines a detail that produced a detailed body image is a bridge too far but many Americans the alternative of pat-down is even more difficult to tolerate so I understand there's an effort among the TSA and the manufacturers of these scanners that develop new software that would render images without anatomical detail in a truly anonymous manner when you come from a small state like mine where everybody knows everybody in a matter of what kind of secure you put in there is just a viable concern if our Airport for example had such a screening when it when a were images in pretty graphic detail Americans and a good number of Vermonters so I mentioned to privately in the earlier expressed concern over the screening technology in the physical searches conducting airports I understand the the need for safety but we also Americans appreciate their privacy understand TSA is working in the industry develop software the render x-ray images travelers into anonymous images without anatomical detail but I also understand that even when they software ever takes the image and alters that to obscure a body images there was still a raw x-ray images captured and so we need a little bit more information about this one how long would be before all airport screening machines are updated to better protect citizens privacy and what protocols are procedures followed by TSA to make sure that the raw images not stored or improperly viewed and disseminated well Thank You mr. chair of course would be a crime disseminating exactly first of all we we are moving to this new technology because of the threats that we faced as illustrated by the so-called underwear bomber in December of 2009 but it's clear that al Qaeda and its affiliates still view aviation as a as a target the intelligence tells us that and they have moved beyond explosives that contain metallic material so the magnetometer isn't by itself always adequate the new machines we call them AIT advanced imaging technologies we are piloting right now software that produces on the image a stick figure as opposed to a more complete image and as we even as we purchased the machines the the protocols the contracts the rules all say they cannot collect store disseminate any image indeed all that's happened is that the officer who is not actually at the line so they can't associate an image with a person they see it they see whether there's an exported amelie and it moves on I mention I'm glad you've delayed implementation of Real ID Act I said for years now the best way to encourage the states to make improvements and driver's licenses is make them a partner in this now there have been homeland security grants have been used by state to meet some of the Real ID benchmarks if we realidie were repealed and replaced with alternative program would that result in the waste of taxpayers money or would we be able to build them what's already been done uh actually mr. chairman I'm now harkening back to my days as a governor my I never saw an issue unite Republican and Democratic governors so much as Real ID as a huge unfunded mandate that really didn't recognize how motor vehicle divisions actually work state by state by State we worked with the governor's and with the National Governors Association shortly after I became secretary to devise an alternative that would meet our nation's security the states pass ID I did not move forward in the Congress I suppose with the press of other things we would ask that the Congress take a fresh look at that

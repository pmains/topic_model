well thank you very much what a privilege to be here Denisha thank you for sharing your story Walter thank you for sharing your story you're why we're here today let me say thank you especially to all the kids who are here to all the kids who are up here with us you're why we're here today we're here celebrating you but we're also here celebrating your future let me say to all the school kids here you can do anything you set your mind to you can do anything you can dream no matter how big your dream and what we're here fighting for is the key to getting their education can open every door you want to see opened in your future and a lack of education can close every door you hope to see opened in your future and I'll tell you to all the kids you may think life is tough but my father when he was a teenager was imprisoned and tortured in Cuba my father came to America at 18 years old with $100 in his underwear by the way kids don't carry money in your underwear kind of ass but that's what my dad did he came here with nothing he washed dishes making 50 cents an hour he couldn't speak English but he came here and got an education he'd been admitted to the University of Texas and he learned English he got a degree he went on and got a job he worked to build a career education opens those doors and I believe school choice is the civil rights issue of the 21st century what does that mean it means if you care about civil rights if you care about fighting for the future of every kid in America then you care about school choice and I believe every child in America has a right to have access to excellent education it doesn't matter what your race is it doesn't matter what your ethnicity is it doesn't matter how much money you have it doesn't matter where you live we are fighting for every single child in America to have the right get excellent education now today is an exciting day this legislation that we're introducing today it is big and it is bold ten billion dollars a year 100 billion dollars over ten years going to expand educational options even in Washington that's a lot of money and the lives that this legislation which will change the lives the Des Neiges and Walters that will come up here one after the other after the other that who will say I was trapped I was scared I didn't know that I had a future I didn't know that I had an option but then I got a scholarship then I got a lifeline then I got a path towards hope the way this works is simple it's a federal tax credit dollar-for-dollar tax credit for giving money to scholarship granting organizations to organizations in each state that will be giving scholarships to get kids now this legislation is opt-in which means each state can decide whether to participate or not this legislation is controlled and administered by the states which means it's not the federal government dictating to every state here's how you should run education rather it is respecting federalism it is respecting each of the 50 states could decide the right way to do it there are ironclad protections in this legislation that the federal government can't stick its fingers into curriculum and change what schools are teaching that's a state and local question this legislation also provides for apprenticeships and for workplace development so that you can go if you want to go and get a job in the trades and if you want to go and get a job and join a union if you want to go and get a job and work at a factory that you can get steps training to work towards that secretary device rightly noted that there'll be a political fight over this legislation and some will characterize this somebody's gonna write a story saying this is an attack on the public schools anyone who writes that story is not overly concerned with truth because here are facts not only does that this legislation doesn't take a penny one penny from any public school in America it doesn't take one penny from any teacher in America what it does do is adds a hundred billion dollars worth of new pennies to create scholarships and expand opportunities and what that's going to do is it's number one going to provide lifelines to kids that wouldn't otherwise have that lifeline and that that hope but number two this legislation is going to improve public schools I believe in public schools public schools are what are educating will continue to educate the vast majority of our kids but what we've seen in state after state after state is that when you have school choice options when kids and parents are empowered the public schools improve competition improves and in this case injecting new money to give that freedom to give that competition to give that power of choice will enhance the quality of education for kids all across this country I want to thank secretary DeVos for her strong and passionate leadership fighting for every child in America I want to thank my colleagues in the Senate and house for working together this should be and I hope it will be bipartisan legislation today in Washington is divided as it is there are a lot of partisan fights but we ought to be able to come together and say look one thing we agree on is kids and every kid deserves a chance I'm proud to stand up here and be fighting for each and every one of you I'm proud to tell your stories and I'm proud to work with you till we realize the dream you know dream is a term that's used a lot dr. Martin Luther King stood on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial declared of the world I have a dream and it was a dream that every person would be judged not by the color of their skin by the content of their character this legislation today is a major step towards fulfilling that dream towards making that dream a realization because it's a major step to helping kids get the education that can open up your dreams to your future and I'm proud to stand with you today thank you

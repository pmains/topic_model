congresswoman nancy mace congresswoman it's great to see you okay a lot of debate about what to do about the third of americans who have not been fully vaccinated the delta variant is spreading there's talk about vaccine mandates what do you say about this it's twice as contagious as the original strain what do you think should be done about that well i think we should have more data too republicans and democrats alike need to do more and continue to do more to encourage americans to get vaccinated i do wonder for the 30 percent of america that hasn't been vaccinated if they've had coven 19 what percentage of those individuals have some natural immunity um to the virus i think that's very important in the conversation but also individuals and families should be able to make this decision as the health care decision with their doctors and their health care practitioners and the medical community we're kind of loving that you're coming out of the parking lot of the waffle house there but it's good to have you on the show i stopped i started my day at a waffle house and apparently i'm going to end it at a waffle house i sat in a lot of traffic this afternoon so thanks for for being flexible with me today yeah well i wish i was there at the waffle house with you okay let's talk about the mass confusion okay los angeles county california they're out with a new mandate everyone must wear masks even indoors even if people are vaccinated but you know there's been a lot of controversies over masks why if they're vaccinated they're not getting sick why do they have to wear a mask inside i don't know i don't know why you should have to be forced to wear a mask inside if you've had covet if you've been vaccinated i think that's really important to one to acknowledge that when this all started dr fauci lied to the american people about wearing masks the cdc and dr fauci were not honest about the origins of kobit either or how much taxpayer money might be going to the woohen lab and so i think that there's a lot of distrust out there as well with regards to what policies the government at the federal state and local level that's why i think you're seeing a lot of pushback from the american people yeah we hear you there's been skepticism there's been a year of botched lockdowns flip-flops from fauci and others on masks uh politicians breaking their own pandemic rules that they put in place for everyone else you know the thing is the pfizer vaccine is between 10 to 30 percent less effective in blocking the new variant it's still more than 90 percent protective against severe illness so you're right about the information that needs to get out there right no absolutely and i think everybody everybody at every level in our community should promote the benefits of being vaccinated i had a very serious case of covid19 i was a long hauler i got the modern ara vaccination there are other vaccinations available including the johnson johnson that's one single dose and not two doses it's really important it's also important that if the government's going to make rules for the rest of america to live by that the governor of california maybe follow those rules this time or the mayor of dc follow the rules that they're going to instill on their communities we've got to set the example and i've tried my hardest when i got vaccinated when i had cope at 19 explaining to people in my community in my district how important it was to wash our hands and to be safe and to save others from a very terrible illness yeah and just be real and just be honest about how you got it wrong the first time and saying yeah you know we're going to try to do better i mean the american people get it you know what i mean it's just stop trying to whip fastballs by the american people because now the w.h.o has said you don't need to wear masks children under age five or young uh limited five and under don't need to wear masks but now dr fauci says if you're two years or older you know infants should be wearing masks you know what i mean so the credibility problem there's a crisis and credibility here with this go ahead absolutely no absolutely i mean dr fauci i mean he's flip-flopped i can't i can't count how many times i call the voucher flip-flops not like the kind that you wear in the sand and so when you have lost that credibility it's very difficult for people who are skeptics um to then believe that the vaccination will prevent them from getting sick and you're right statistically the vaccination keeps a far greater number of people out of the hospital and from dying from this very what can be a very serious illness and it's up to people to be honest and to be transparent and to tell the truth and to make up for it when they're not wrong okay enjoy the waffle house we'll join you there next time congressman nancy mace it's good to see you

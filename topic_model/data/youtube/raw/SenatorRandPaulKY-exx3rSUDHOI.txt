hi this is Senator Rand Paul with an update from Washington over the years I've reported to you on the many outrageous things your federal government does but this one stands out even in that crowded field trust me what you're about to hear is not a problem with your audio or video Uncle Sam may be in debt to the tune of 26 trillion dollars but that hasn't stopped your federal government from writing checks to people who have passed away that's right the federal government is writing checks to people who are dead the Government Accountability Office revealed recently that approximately 1.1 million stimulus checks were sent to the deceased adding up to about 1.4 billion dollars in response I announced that I would work to stop such payments and get this money back I'm pleased to tell you that the US Senate agreed with me and unanimously passed my bill Senate bill 4 1:04 the stopping improper payments to deceased people Act my bill simply requires that the US Treasury to use data from the Social Security Administration to reclaim these kovetz stimulus checks that were sent to dead people it also provides a process to make sure this never happens again I promise Kentuckians I would fight against out-of-control spending in debt when I first ran for the Senate and I've kept that promise since day one including introducing several balanced budget plans exposing waste and offering fiscally responsible alternatives to Congress's budget busting proposals both parties should easily be able to agree that we should not send stimulus checks to dead people and I'm glad that even in a divided Washington where spending is king we came together to pass my legislation

Louis have a proud history of service and heroism during the First World War a brave group of st. Louis women volunteered to go to war-torn France to start a hospital for injured Allied soldiers they were among the first Americans to deploy to Europe and some of the very last to leave when they departed for France in May of 1917 the United States had not even entered the war and many remained in France for a year after the Armistice they treated more than 60,000 patients before they returned home to st.

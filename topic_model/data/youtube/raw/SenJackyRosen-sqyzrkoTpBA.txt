fight any private internal bidened Administration concerns that the new Israeli government is too far right and not sufficiently committed to democracy the United States and Israel today launched their largest ever joint military exercise involving a U.S aircraft carrier strike group and nearly 150 planes from both the United States and Israel prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu continues to move forward with plans to undermine Israel's independent Judiciary giving the parliament the knesset the power to overturn court rulings despite massive protests against the move let's discuss this with Democratic senator Jackie Rosen of Nevada along with Republican senator James Lankford of Oklahoma they just returned from Israel where they led a bipartisan Senate delegation welcome to both of you Senator Rosen you reportedly told the Israeli government that you did not want to meet with any members of the controversial far-right parties within this ruling Coalition during this visit why well thank you for having us uh this evening I can tell you that Senator Lankford and I just reach returned from a bipartisan Congressional Delegation focused on the Abraham Accords we went to Morocco Moraine UAE and Israel was very important to us as we met with high leading high-ranking officials in every country to talk about the concerns and the opportunities for the Abraham Accords I can tell you that we spoke with all the high level officials prime minister Netanyahu and others in the Israeli government as we were moving forward on the mission of this Congressional Delegation we were quite firm in talking to prime minister Netanyahu about not doing anything that would change the status quo and that would impede the process of a negotiated two-state solution Senator Lankford analysts have called this the most right-wing government in Israel's history and questioned the government's commitment to democracy given its attempts to undermine the the Supreme Court in his Israel one of the ministers Ben gevir has previously been convicted of supporting terrorism and inciting anti-arab racism I'm sure you must have some concerns about these individuals yeah these are all members of the that have been elected as the Israeli people have spoken on this so as Americans we have been very strong to stand with Israel we'll continue to be able to stand with Israel that's an unbreakable bond that we have with Israel and we've done that regardless of party obviously they had a different uh prime minister and a different government 18 months ago had Benjamin Netanyahu then before that so the United States still continues to be able to stand with Israel regardless on this this is a friend that we have in the region and as we went to that area we were speaking to them about the Abraham Accords which is the most significant Middle East policy that we've had in a shift and an opportunity for peace in that region that we've seen in a generation so the whole reason we win is a bipartisan group and visit all the countries from the Abraham Accords was to reinforce to work on how we can actually grow that partnership how we can add new countries to that partnership but what we can do for the existing Partnerships regardless of which government is is there to be able to continue to be able to grow that friendship among the region it's incredibly important for American National Security and for Middle East peace in the region and without question the Abraham Accords are one of the the most significant achievements of the Trump Administration Senator Rosen the Accords are for people who don't know normalization agreements between Israel and various Arab states um why haven't we seen more on these agreements more building on this from the Biden Administration well I can tell you that the Accords are pretty new just signed in the last administration of course we're still coming out of covid so some some travel has been a little bit difficult between the countries but this is really uh historical the foundation and the framework that it lays and so when we went to visit the four Abraham Accords countries we talked about the challenges the threats from Iran the opportunities how they can partner on water Security on food security and energy technology and of course medical Partnerships and what everyone wanted to do was be sure that they talked about peaceful coexistence in the region and prosperity that's what they're hoping for and that's what we were there to talk about we have a lot to bring back not only to the Senate but I believe to speak with the administration about as well Senator Langford you talked about Israel uh being a friend of the United States one of the closest friends in the country isn't part of a friendship when you see your friend hanging out with individuals with Shady ethical or racist beliefs when you see your friend acting in such a way so as to undermine democracy isn't it the responsibility of the friend and maybe you do it privately but isn't it expressing concern and trying to steer the friend back in the right direction sure it is that's the nature of being friends and having Frank conversation they're Frank conversations that occur privately there's also actions that we continue to be able to work on publicly I would tell you everything that we were focused in on is how do we continue to advance the Abraham Accords how do we continue to strengthen this well we've seen just in the last couple of months is what they call the negative four meetings these are practical meetings of all those Nations meeting together talking about it as sooner Rosen had mentioned how they deal with water energy all the key things there in that region if you're going to continue to be able to work towards a peaceful future you've got to be able to sit down at the same table together as I like to tell people all the time you can't get all the issues on the table until you get all your feet under that same table they're doing that now in that region through the negative forum and through other ways as well and they're working towards advancing that and they have those Frank conversations with us and with all the governments quite frankly with all of those Nations we would say we have differences of opinion on human rights and on different issues that are out there so it's not just the United States and Israel as we're building these alliances and friendships we've got to continue to have Frank conversation about what it means to have religious liberty what it means to continue to advance human dignity and rights what it means to be able to advance economic freedom for everybody so this is an issue that we'll continue to be able to work on in the days ahead Senators Jackie Rosen and James Langford thanks for being here and thanks for for being here in a bipartisan way it's it's always good to see good see you our pleasure

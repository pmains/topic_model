joining us now is independent senator angus King of Maine he serves on the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services committees senator always a pleasure thank you taking the opportunity so let's talk about this you saw me going at it with Kellyanne and this is a proposition that needs to be tested either you believe that the dignity of the survivors and those who did not survive warrants a look at this problem that recurs or you see it as insensitive because that's politicizing a tragedy where are you I don't think it's politicizing it at all if this was a dam break that didn't drown 59 people we and there was a faulty valve we'd be talking about how do we fix that valve this is a case where a particular piece of equipment enabled this tragedy to occur the bump stock allowed this guy to shoot six seven hundred rounds a minute rather than 60 and have to stop and reload so it was a integral part of this tragedy and it was legalised of seven years ago shouldn't have been and I think it's something believe it or not we've got Republicans and Democrats both talking about the danger of this thing machine guns are illegal they have been for many years this effectively converts a semi-automatic rifle into a machine gun and it shouldn't be allowed eighty-six the law then took away manufacturer of machine guns for the public you can still buy older ones pre 86 they're just really expensive but I have to tell you what are we seeing online right now people running out to buy bump stocks it's not because they just heard about them it's not because they're a novelty it's because they're afraid they're gonna be taken away sure that is a big part of cultural currency you're right we see it every time we're gonna see it now and it helps fuel the speculation you people want to take away all our guns well any defense that want to help the bad but that's one of the problems with this discussion because it's gotten to the point where any any limitation whatsoever we couldn't get a bill through last year to let keep people who are on the no-fly list from buying weapons that was viewed as you know the first step I don't consider this a first step I'm from a states it's a very strong Second Amendment Strait I'm a strong Second Amendment guy we have one of the highest rates of gun ownership in the country one of the lowest rates have gone crime we know how to handle guns responsibly but the bump stock it seems to me is a specific piece of equipment that enables a tragedy like this most real in my experience most people who are really into guns and how to handle them don't have much respect for the bomb stock it makes the gun less accurate and they don't really think it's very important now we'll see how the discussion unfolds and what the NRA says and what the gun ownership but I don't see this as a slippery slope argument this is a specific piece of equipment if it hadn't have been for this piece of equipment this tragedy would have been much much less serious well we'll see if there's any discussion at all to be frank about it because this is gonna take political courage and I made the analogy for a reason to Kellyanne if you want to show respect to the survivors you do what they did they face something that was dangerous lethal in this case and they helped each other anyway by the way themselves out there anyway watching that tape that you just showed the guy I want to give a medal to is that guy who stayed saying keep your head down move out get out he was there and he was he was in effect putting his life on the line for those other people that was really impressive and first responders would do that they put themselves in harm's way a lot of citizens did it why would you let somebody have something they can put on a device that would overwhelm his ability to defend himself against it but again we'll see what you guys do on that other topics as well this morning we have what's going on with the Russian investigation the president and his surrogates continue to say there's nothing there and they're proof is you've come up with nothing how do you see it well I wish they'd quit saying that I mean the the the what was clear yesterday from the press conference and it's clear to me being on the Intelligence Committee working on this for nine months eight nine months is the Russians meddled in our elections at the order of Putin and in the end they were trying to help Donald Trump that's there's no argument about that and the problem is if we're going to defend ourselves against this in the future and by the way they are going to be back this isn't a one-off deal we have to acknowledge what they did so the American people can begin to prepare themselves for it we can understand how to prevent it now the question of whether there was illusion is a second question that's important but the problem is the White House is so defensive about that question they're trying to say the whole thing is a witch hunt the whole thing is a hoax it's not a hoax you know the the Facebook ads were paid for with rubles give me a break I mean if if that is an evidence of Russian involvement in trying to get what they say that the show where Trump became involved instead of as an unintended beneficiary who around him who was part of this why everyone that's that's a question that you know the remember Watergate was a two-hour event involving four people this is an 18-month event involving a foreign country hundreds if not thousands of people and it's going to take time to get to the bottom of it and some as Richard Burr said yesterday some of the things that we've turned up and gotten into we wouldn't have expected nine months ago the whole thing with Twitter and Facebook that may be one of the most important parts of the investigation we're gonna have the CEOs in in a few weeks and we're gonna go from there now senator you came this morning you said to me before we came on have to talk about Iran it's not in the headlines right now what's the issue it will be in two or three days because the president has to certify whether Iran is in compliance with the agreement next week by the 15th of October where all the Indian well if he doesn't certify then it throws it back to Congress Congress has to act to put the sanctions back in place it begins the unraveling of the agreement which I think would be a disaster you and you don't have to rely on me two days ago in the Armed Services Committee is the secretary mattis point blank do you believe it's in the national security interests the United States to stay in this agreement he paused and then he said yes senator I do there is no upside to unraveling this Agreement Iran is doing a lot of bad things this wasn't a friendship treaty this was about a narrow issue of nuclear weapons and all the bad things Iran is doing in the region are terrible they're unacceptable we just passed a new set of sanctions on those things the only thing worse than a malignant Iran in the Middle East is a malignant Iran in the Middle East with nuclear weapons and that's what this agreements all about so I I understand the president doesn't like the deal it's not a great deal I didn't think it was a great deal but it's the deal we have and if our allies aren't with us on this and there was a meeting up at the Capitol yesterday they're not with us on this there's no violations intelligence community has told us there are no violations they've abided by the agreement to try to unravel it now I think a year from now we'd have North Korea and Iran almost identical if I were the president I'd say I'll take one of these at a time not both at the same time senator thank you for being with us thank always a pleasure good to see from man

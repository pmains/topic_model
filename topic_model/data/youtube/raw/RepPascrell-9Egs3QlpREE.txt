democratic congressman from new jersey bill pascal congressman pasqual is a member rational ukrainian caucus uh congressman thank you for being here on this day richard as we talked about this issue and now as you look at new jersey it has a very large uh ukrainian-american population what has been the reaction to this i've been meeting uh with the ukrainian uh delegation uh from my area uh for the past five six months i mean this situation just didn't start yesterday or the day before we know uh from the orange revolution several years back that ukrainian wants peace and kenyan wants to be one united nation we we we've seen what's happened with crimea this is this is an extension of russian power and authority i mean when the question is asked who's in charge uh the president of ukraine he's been duly elected and and russia is violating the sovereignty of a sovereign nation and that's where we begin we don't want to make enemies of the russians but on the other hand if we listen to uh our ambassador powers at the u.n the other day rich she was very clear and very succinct about what our responsibilities are and what russians should take responsibility for and not simply walk away they are hiding in the shop the shadows as you just heard congressman as you heard from jim mesada who was reporting from ukraine just about a month or two ago and he was going through the process and i remember speaking to him on camera doing his reporting on post-election they thought things might get better we are now post-election do you think things are going to get better well i think that they could get worse they could get better depending upon how the ukrainian government responds to this there are guns not put there by the ukrainian government in the eastern part of ukraine that has meant death and now we see what could be an accident what could have been an intentional shooting down of an airplane 80 children of the 298 kill this is a preposterous situation and i believe that this could lead to even more dangerous situations that would engulf the entire way as well we have we have those hot spots in the world the mideast etc etc one one stupid move and we could get into a world war the president is committed to no boots on the ground on the other hand we have a responsibility i want to play a bit of sound from congressman peter king a member of the house intelligence committee he says russia must be held accountable let's listen to that and i'll get your reaction sure russia has to be ultimately responsible at the very least for criminal negligence and in the world of international politics and diplomacy they have to bear responsibility to transferring weapons of this magnitude to a rebel group uh you have to be responsible for the consequences first of all do you agree with him there's also criticisms coming from the right uh peter king uh saying that the president had he handled this differently we may not have to have had to address what we see right now happening outside of the nest well it's very easy to say if the president handled it differently uh if the president became even stronger than what i believe where he's at at this particular point i think it risks us getting into a situation where we will have to show some military force in the area we don't want that i don't think that helps the situation look i i'm a good friend of peter kings we agree on a lot of things we were on homeland security for a long period of time together i i deeply respect his position but those who are going to rattle the cage at this particular time better be understanding it could only get worse and the cage could even be tighter and will never get out of it so i'm saying that we should have strong sanctions not meaningless not tooth sanctions as i would call them uh and i think that the un has to handle this and respond to this i think they have to speak to the u.n as well as the russians yeah and putin could be silent and hot as what long as he wants but the u.n has a responsibility i think unless they want each nation to be on its own and we don't want that that's why we have a u.n very complex problem here it was very intractable there for a while is this a new opening you think i think it is and i think you know some good can come out of this cooler heads must prevail but i can't think of how you show remorse to the families of these 298 people it's a difficult situation and and we need to understand this now the european countries have not stepped up to the plate as we have we're asking them to do the same thing to russia to to ask for russians to to sanction much of what russia is doing yet we know they depend upon for oil russian oil we understand that but you got to step up to the plate here or else what where is the european union the winter is coming soon does that mean that is the if you will the door when it closes when we see winter hit yes and ukraine is a very important part of this if you know how russian oil flows i think this is very good i have a tremendous amount of respect uh in mr and the president poroshenko i think that he has a good sense of what's going on here his government is it doesn't have exactly clean hands in what was going on in eastern ukraine much of it feels much of the east feels it's been ignored and isn't that familiar sounding to you whether we're talking about iraq or to talk about some other syria when people feel ignored and left out and particularly if they're speaking mostly russian on the eastern part of ukraine you can understand this development doesn't give an excuse to shoot planes out of the air and it doesn't give excuse to kill people uh in in in in a way that doesn't allow for life and death to understand and go day to day congresswoman pasqual thank you so much for stopping by have a good weekend i'll try richard all right appreciate it up next the

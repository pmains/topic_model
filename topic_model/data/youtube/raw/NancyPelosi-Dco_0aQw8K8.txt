recognized for one minute thank you and thank the gentleman for yielding madam Speaker I rise in strong opposition to this rule and this bill instead of focusing on jobs Republicans are continuing to wage their war on women with this dangerous legislation today this bill forces comprehensive coverage for women to be dropped from the state exchanges cutting off millions of women from affordable comprehensive health care and you know that federal funds have not been allowed for abortion since 1976 to my dismay and nothing has changed this bill makes it virtually impossible for any health care plan to offer abortion coverage and allows hospitals to refuse mind you refused to provide life-saving care to a woman who needs an abortion to protect her own life this is unprecedented and should be rejected we cannot and we must not allow Republicans to turn the clock back on women on choice and on our access to health care I remember the days of back alley abortions women died women were injured for life let's not go back there I urge my colleagues to reject this unnecessary and harmful legislation health care decisions should be made by women and their health care providers not Ricans in the House of Representatives who want to impose their own ideological agenda on limitless we should be creating jobs not interfering with women's reproductive rights gentleman's time has expired gentleman from North Carolina madam Speaker I will reserve gentlewoman reserves gentleman from Florida

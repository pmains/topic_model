monitor kane jr this man inspired all of us that day his words he was the line speaker he turned those marble steps of the lincoln memorial into a modern-day pool apart he gave us hope he inspired a nation i spoke to ms6 in my brief speak i said something like we march today for jobs and freedom but we have nothing to be proud of for hundreds and thousands of our brothers and sisters are not here for their receiving starvation wages or no wages at all near the end of my speech i said where is our party where is the political party that we make it unnecessary to march on washington and i continue by saying we must seek more than civil rights we must work for the community of love peace and true brotherhood our minds souls and hearts cannot rest into freedom and justice exists for all people so i said to you 50 years later we'll come a distance since that day but many of the issues that gave rise to that march are still present needs in our society today violence poverty hunger long-term unemployment homelessness voting rights and the need to protect human dignity we have come a great distance but we are not finished yet while struggle is not a struggle that lasts for one day one week one month or one year it is a struggle of a lifetime to build a beloved community or to redeem the soul of america we still need to find a way to humanize our political institutions our businesses and our system of education 50 years later those of us who are committed to the cause of justice need to pace ourselves because our struggle is an ongoing struggle there will be progress but there will also be setbacks we must continue to have hope and be still in our faith that this nation will one day become a truly multiracial but until that day we must continue to work we must not give up or give in but keep the faith and when we see people hurting and suffering we must be ready to take action cast our votes and move our feet we must have a sense of urgency to use the power granted us to help in human suffering when the march on washington what the march of washington is saying to us today is that we are at our best as a people as a congress where we understand our differences do not divide us we will be at our best when we finally accept that we are one people one family the american family that we all live in the same house the american house the world house it is saying that no one but no one is worthless that everyone can make a contribution the march on washington is saying to us today that we as a nation and as a people can come together and lay down the burden of race that we can unite for the common good we can believe again that that divine spark within us all to use the authority granted us to accomplish great things for all americans and not just for some after the march was over president kennedy invited us back down to the white house the president stood in the door of the oval office and greeted each one of us he was beaming like a pro he was beaming like a proud father he was smiling he was so glad that everything had gone so well he shook the hands of the 10 of us and he said you did a good job you did a good job and when he got to dr king he said and you had a dream we all can dream 50 years later so let's continue the work that has already begun to build a beloved community a nation and a world community at peace with itself that value the dignity and worth of every citizen and every human being that is the calling that is the message of the march on washington thank you

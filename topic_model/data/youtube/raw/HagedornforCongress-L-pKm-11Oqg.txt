I'm Jim Hagedorn Republican candidate for Congress in Minnesota's first District you deserve to know where I stand on the issue of gun control and the Second Amendment I believe it's dangerous to think that more gun control laws are going to prevent or stop the acts of evil or deranged killers actually not allowing our law-abiding Americans to exercise their second Amendment rights well that's like getting rid of the First Amendment because some lunatics say I'm whoring things on the internet or in public frankly it's time for government at all levels to get out there and fully enforce the laws to do everything possible to keep the bad guys off the streets and those databases those systems that we use to prevent people from acquiring weapons well they need to be updated and improved and I support that did you know that a Minnesota firearms ownership is at a record high concealed carry permits are at a record high and yet violent crimes of Minnesota are at a 50-year low that just shows that good people acting responsibly do make a difference as your Congressman I will defend the inalienable right of law-abiding Americans to keep and bear arms for self-protection and all lawful purposes I'm Jim Hagedorn and that's where I stand

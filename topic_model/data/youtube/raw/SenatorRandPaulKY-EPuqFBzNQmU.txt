hi senator paul thanks for joining us glad to be with you so i want to get to a number of things but let's start with this you recently rejected criticism that you received over a tweet advocating for naturally acquiring immunity from covid you clarified saying that you weren't arguing against vaccines rather saying that those who've survived should celebrate their immunity do you think that it's safe for anyone who's had the virus already to go back to their normal routine as the pandemic continues uh without question 11 million people in our country have had the infection and there's about five that have confirmed to have a re-infection so that means 10 million 990 950 people or more haven't been reinfected and have shown evidence of immunity not only that all of the studies have shown that people have a significant antibody response whether they have symptoms or not but they're also finding that as the antibodies go down people have a t cell and a b cell memory response which means that your body remembers this and can respond to this so really the evidence is overwhelming that you have immunity even the evidence of reinfection argues for immunity because it's so extraordinary that it's a handful of people that have been reported the interesting thing is let's say we accept that 200 people in the united states have been reinfected that means the effectiveness of natural infection would be better than a vaccine so i think that the people who argue against immunity are really arguing against the science of vaccines but there's a lot of things that for the people who have had it would be good you can feel more comfortable visiting with your parents or your grandparents you can feel more comfortable going out to dining you can feel more comfortable you're doing a lot of things you also could be useful in society if you're a waitress and you've already had it you'd be great to be serving and restaurants could then advertise that you've already had it and you're much less likely to give it to anybody and i think it would make people feel more comfortable about getting out and we do need people to get out because you know our restaurants are being collapsed by all these orders mostly from democratic governors so do you think herd immunity offers a greater benefits in a vaccine would and would you encourage americans to trust in a vaccine once one is available to them well the thing about herd immunity is you can get it through vaccination or you can get it the natural way the natural way is obviously not the preferable way because a lot of people are dying from this even though the death rate has plummeted nearly 80 percent from the spring we're doing a lot better we still over have over a thousand people a day dying from this so it's still very serious so the vaccine would be preferable who takes the vaccine should be up to the individual in a free society every individual assesses their own risk and makes their own decisions but i think there are people who are at high enough risk nursing homes and those over 80 and those who have other illnesses that i think millions of people will voluntarily sign up and what will happen is over a several month period because it's going to take several months for them all to become inoculated that those people plus those who have naturally got it will begin to approach herd immunity there's also some belief that people who have been previously infected with coronavirus colds about 20 percent of colds are coronaviruses there is some believe that these people already have some pre-existing immunity which may add to herd immunity and get us there sooner a lot of these things are unknown but the good news is the vaccines out there seems to be working and yes if you're high risk i say people ought to take it and then we're seeing your state's governor andy beshear announce several new restrictions to curb the rise of new cases of infections that means no more in-person classes for for children starting monday and no more indoor dining nor no gatherings of more than eight people the list goes on do you agree with other medical experts who say that these measures help reduce the spread of the virus what i would say is it depends on who you are whether you should take advice from people on this idea of social separation and the idea of mask wearing so if you're over 80 years old or if you're over 70 years old and have comorbidities probably wearing a mask would be reasonable thing to do to try to lessen your chances but wearing a cloth mask is of no value 97 of virus particles of that size go through cloth masks so the cloth mask or theater so if you're really worried wear an n95 mask and the government ought to be more honest and let people know the other masks don't work then n95 work if you handle them very very carefully and that's really in a setting where you probably are using sterile technique and throwing them away but when i tell people to accept the advice a lot of the advice advice there's no problem with advice from experts what i don't want is a governor who's not consulting the legislature to tell us absolutely what we have to do because frankly if you're 18 years old you have a much lower risk profile than if you're 85 years old so every individual should get to make their choice and we shouldn't have dictates from a governor who basically is flying by the seat of his pants and dictating whatever comes to his mind most of which are not backed by science there is no science and no objective evidence to show that when government institutes a mass mandate that the incidence of the infection goes down right now we have mass mandates everywhere and the incidence is exploding it's going up exponential despite all the mandates so really i think it takes our eye off the prize the prizes vaccines if you tell everybody you're safe with a mask you're kidding them and you're you're delaying what we really need which is a good good functional vaccine okay and i want to get your take on a couple other things and then i'll let you go um switching to this topic the president's re-election campaign as we've heard is uh pushing a number of lawsuits challenging the results of the election they're also seeking recounts as we heard in states like wisconsin and georgia where do you stand on this senator do you think that there's been enough transparency in our election process so far i think the first thing we have to acknowledge is that this is an extraordinary election it we've never ever had an election like this and so it does need to be scrutiny typically less than one percent of people vote by mail or absentee it's a very few people a handful of people usually not enough to overturn or change an election now we're talking about an election where 20 30 even 40 of the votes millions of votes were mailed in so we should check to make sure they were mailed in with the postmark which means they actually were mailed and not created by someone we need to check the signatures we need to i think do some random sampling to call people at home and ask them did you vote because it would be terrible if we found tens of thousands of votes where the voter says no i didn't vote so this is something that would be pretty easy to put to bed but uh we should absolutely look into it because this is the first election we've ever had millions of mail-in votes and would be irresponsible not to look into it and uh finally the president's ordered the pentagon to withdraw about half of u.s troops from afghanistan and iraq which would leave about 2500 troops in both countries your fellow kentucky senator majority leader mitch mcconnell said that doing so at this point would be on par with president obama's drawdown of troops in iraq which saw the surge of isis in the middle east do you agree with mcconnell that we could potentially see a terrorist resurgence if a drawdown happens too quickly no and i disagree with the analysis on isis i think isis arose because we deposed saddam hussein we created chaos a power vacuum and weak government and we also were in the process of trying to depose assad in syria so there was chaos and civil war there and isis occurred along the border and largely in syria but maybe in syria and iraq but in these lawless areas where there was no government i don't think it had anything to do with our troops i think our troops and our mission in afghanistan was to get those who attacked us on 911 and anybody who helped them well that mission was accomplished about 17 years ago the last 17 years have been spent building bridges schools hotels gas stations all kinds of stuff for them and then somebody blows them up again and then we build them again we don't have the money to be doing it we need to get the heck out of there i'm not for leaving a small contingent i'm for leaving no contingent i think we should come home we can monitor them from a distance and if there's a problem we have the ability to strike from 6 000 miles away we don't need to have troops on the ground in the middle of every civil war look we're all over africa too we're in somalia mali eritrea you name it sudan we're all over africa as well but uh no leaving the troops there i don't think makes us safer i think the troops there become a tripwire to terrorists who say if i kill an american maybe i can get something going so americans are targets and not necessarily i think keeping the peace but become targets for terrorists i wouldn't have them there uh the iraqi government's voted to have us leave i think we should take tomorrow and we should leave but the whole iraq war was a mistake because it now has iraq more aligned with iran it has emboldened and made iran stronger so there's a lot of reasons why we should reconsider these ill-considered foreign adventures all right kentucky senator rand paul taking the time to weigh in on a number of issues thanks so much for your time we appreciate it thank you

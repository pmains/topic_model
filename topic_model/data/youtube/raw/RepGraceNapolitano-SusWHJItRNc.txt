the chair and welcome to this chair is the new chairman to water the Subcommittee on water resources environment mr. chairman when you and I met just over a month ago to discuss a potential agenda for Congress I suggested we start those areas where we could find common ground the subcommittee is most successful when we work together in a bipartisan fashion to rebuild our nation's crumbling infrastructure and prepare communities for challenges they are facing decades to come without question this nation is witnessing a changing water-related environment those changes are having a profound implication on our local communities our national environment and our overall way of life ironically a respective districts are facing very different challenges yours with too much water and mine too often too little but the reality is that both districts must adapt and adequately prepare for what lies ahead I am pleased that our first year in focuses on area that we should find common ground they need for increased investment in our nation's water related infrastructure especially federal investment we all know that the challenges facing our communities are in addressing the local water resources needs and adapting to a changing world whether the issue is crumbling dams and levees outdated sewers and stormwater conveyances inefficient navigation quarters or select large-scale ecosystem restoration authorities I am certain that every member in this room can point to water related challenges facing their constituents at home yet if your electro officials are like mine the central theme in meeting this challenges is the help needed for additional funding as former chief of engineers once noted before the subcommittee by failing to officially fund projects we ultimately fail the American taxpayer by delaying the realization of project benefits and by none unnecessarily increasing costs due to these delays similarly we fail to provide the necessary resources to invest in update and adequately maintain our infrastructure we should not be surprised when systems fail for communities are placed at risk and the cost begins to become greater and when our state and local economies underperform my community want to do the right thing they want to provide our citizens with safe reliable affordable water and wastewater services but they cannot do it alone they're calling on us in Congress to renew the federal commitment on to our water related infrastructure I was excited when infrastructure investment became a recurring theme during the 2016 presidential election I was secretly pleased when president made his commitment to triple the funding level for the clean and drinking water state revolving punch this subcommittee needs to take the next logical step in advance legislation like a reauthorization of the clean water state revolving fund to renew the federal commitment to meeting our communities infrastructure needs this straight forward legislation Lester proof on a bipartisan basis by this committee in 2009 will help our communities meet the challenges of a changing water related environment and creating well-paying jobs in the United States but we need to do much more we need to address the very real affordability concerns raised by the communities in a way that does not weaken the Clean Water Act protections and ensures our neighborhoods have access to clean safe water and reliable waters local environments we need to look at targeting more additional federal resources to our urban and rural communities when the traditional tools failed to meet the financial challenges these communities face on a daily basis mr. Chairman I believe this committee can play an integral part in creating and sustaining family wage jobs in ensuring US economic competitiveness and improving the daily lives of all Americans and I do look forward to working with you and a bipartisan basis to honor these commitments to our communities now yield back

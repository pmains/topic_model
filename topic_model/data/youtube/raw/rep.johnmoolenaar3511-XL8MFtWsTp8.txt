Thank You mr. speaker successful diplomacy requires statesmanship a mutual benefit and a commitment to peace none of these elements are part of the administration's deal with Iran on statesmanship this administration's acquiescence has been met with Iranian hostility just this week the Ayatollah said Israel would be destroyed within 25 years words matter and we cannot discount Iran's dangerous rhetoric where is the mutual short of immediate access to a nuclear bomb Iran has been given all it wants it will receive billions of dollars that can use to fund terrorism against our country and our allies it will be allowed to reject any time anywhere inspections that are vital to verifying compliance and ensuring our national security and in less than 15 years Iran will be allowed to have a nuclear weapons program capable of attacking targets anywhere in the world the fundamental question is are we willing to gamble that Iran's government will end its destructive behavior and belligerent rhetoric in the coming days I for one am not willing to take that chance and I believe this is a bad deal for America and the world and I oppose it Thank You mr. speaker gentleman's time

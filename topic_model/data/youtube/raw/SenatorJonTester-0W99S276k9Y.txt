my name is Brenda Desmond I'm a district court standing master in Missoula and I preside over the Missoula veterans court Hanna Walton I'm the coordinator for the veteran and co-occurring treatment courts veterans courts generally focused on veterans who have a mental health challenge such as post combat stress and a co-occurring substance use disorder anyone can be referred as long as they have a substance use disorder and a mental health diagnosis that looks like that it's going to make them recidivate through the justice system again and again in the Missoula veterans court the majority of the veterans have been combat veterans and most of them have been post 9-11 veterans this was a veteran who who had returned with significant PTSD both he and his significant other had had used together they had a case in which their children had been taken and they both entered components of the the treatment court they got the children back and the the father has just now the father he graduated I want to say about two years ago and we had a there was a very emotional graduation and he is now in recovery long enough that he has been hired as a peer support and so now he gets to go out and do mentoring peer work for other veterans who are re-entering you know from either the criminal justice system through treatment and kind of trying to reintegrate into the community so he's doing amazing all of the three current treatment veterans courts in Montana have very high completion rates and that is a testament to I think that the participants are veterans we do amazing work in this program on a very limited budget but the outcomes are astounding senator testers office been very supportive of the Veterans Court they always come to the graduation ceremonies with their letter prepared from mr. tester and that you read those and they present those to that graduating participant that they have this like solid piece of you know kudos to you you finish the treatment court directly from Senator tester I don't really I don't see any more that we can be asking of Senator testers office then then we're already getting and for a person who has so many issues regarding Montanans on his plate it is incredible to me how focused he is on Montana veterans we all know we have a very high number of veterans nonetheless for him to have taken a net national leadership position on veterans is wonderful for veterans in Montana

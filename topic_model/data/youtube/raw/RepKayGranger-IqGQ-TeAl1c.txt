we invited the awardees to share highlights of their political experiences with our interviewer karen nicholson a texan and long-serving officer of the league of women voters in the united states on this video you will meet hey granger one of our democracy stars a former teacher and business owner kaye's public career began as a member of the fort worth zoning commission followed by election as the first female mayor of fort worth she has experienced a trailblazing career and has been recognized for her achievements with election to the texas women's hall of fame and the fort worth business hall of fame among many other honors i am pleased to present karen nicholson interviewing hey granger welcome congresswoman k granger uh congratulations on the democracy star award we thank you very much for agreeing to talk with us as a female elected official and let's get straight to the questions so you can tell us what that experience is is uh why did you run for the first elected office that you ran for what inspired you uh what what inspired me i lived in fort worth all my life raised my children went to school here in fort worth and it wasn't a very good time for fort worth because with defense downsizing lockheed martin lost the biggest contract they'd ever had had to lay off 8 000 people bill helicopter the same thing and it looked like we might have our base closed which turned out to happen and since i lived here so long circle and city council and some other places i said i'm going to try to bring us out of this and and work for this and that was really my my goal we did it really well because we were won the all-american city with the highest crime decrease in the nation when your economy goes down your crime goes up and so we took did that and approached in a very different way it was very successful what was the hardest part about running and what was the part you enjoyed the most i started what i enjoyed the most is visiting all the neighborhoods in in my district and meeting people hearing their experiences that was wonderful the hardest thing was asking for money because uh that's just it that's just something that's hard to do i do it really well now but at that time i never had and i didn't know whether to ask for ten dollars or that or a thousand but people kind of knew that that was uh that was one of the things that was new to me and i learned a lot what advice would you give in 2020 to women who are running for office i would tell them i think important now is that they run not as the first woman not necessarily as a woman or a minority but just say this is what i think the nation needs or my city needs uh and this has been my experience and this is my plan to to improve that i think there are enough women in office now not enough but enough for people to not have to say i'm going to vote for hard just because she's a woman but all that the women bring um to elected office do you think women or people of color color have to do anything differently than ben do not as much as they did when i first ran when i first ran i ran for mayor and i was the first woman mayor they ever had and i always think about that one of the first things i did they said we want you to know what the city does and meals on wheels they asked me to go and and i did and uh to deliver meals and walked in a man who's 90 years old and they introduced me to this is kay granger the mayor and his response was well what are we going to do with her and and everyone started to laugh but i think he may have thought what are we going to do with her because she's serving the meal i hope that's true but it gave everybody a laugh and it's i always think about that so do you feel that you get a much better or different reception now that you have so much experience in an elected office absolutely i one time when i was in early stages when i just been elected had a very uh important business person who came to see me and in my office if i want to make sure they knew i was the mayor i would sit behind my desk otherwise his friends i'd sit out in the middle of the room and and he made a presentation i asked a question and he turned to my city manager and answered my city manager which is a little discerning so i asked another question and and he did the same thing he didn't he didn't speak to me he spoke to my city manager i remember this and i know he will too uh i said to my city manager i said would you change place with me please and he said mayor there's something wrong with your chair and i said no so he sat behind the desk and i sat in his chair and i said now maybe you can talk to me sometimes you you have to do that if you do it all the time then you get nowhere but in that situation i want to make sure that that the decision would be made the right way and he recognized who i was how do you think that women who struggled to get the 19th amendment passed and ratified would evaluate the role of women in politics today i think they'd be proud there aren't enough of us for instance in in congress now republican women there are only 12 in the house of representatives a republican nearly a hundred democrats but that means there are a lot of women and they're used to seeing more and more women so i think they would be proud there's always room for growth there's always room for improvement um but i know that the women that are that are in congress uh do an excellent job and they're going to be some more because there's some more women that i'm supporting to run that haven't been to congress you bring up a good point about the number of women in congress do you all have a network do you meet together you know we we know for years there's been a good old boys network is there a good old girls network in congress there is it's not as not as fully blown as i say as the old men's group but we do help each other across the aisle too anita lowey democrat from new york and i uh work together the first time when i chaired a subcommittee and she was the ranking member the next time it was she was the chair and i was ranking member but we became fast friends and when that happens then you work together and i believe when you do that and you work together you have better laws oh you're speaking to a league of women voter's heart we like that going across the aisle when will we have a female president i i think we're getting very close i know it will be uh in my lifetime um because i'm going to make sure that happens i just think it's that important i think it's just a matter of time democrat republican i don't know but i certainly know that we can do the job as women and i hope i get to see that i like your in my lifetime okay after you were elected and you can you can choose as mayor on the city council as congresswoman whatever what do you consider your singular proudest achievement as mayor it was making the city safe again as i said when we lost all those jobs and that employment was so high unemployment goes high so crime goes high and we had one neighborhood had the second highest violent crime in the nation so we put together a program to add police officers specially trained community police officers and then we worked in the in the areas that had the most crime and said we're all in this together our crime decreases over 50 percent the highest in the nation we won the all-america city based on that when we did that i was supposed to make a presentation i took the people that helped me the most uh that and not the elected people or appointed people but just neighborhood people that made the difference then i'm very proud of that in congress i'm proud of my work in defense um coming from a community that has lockheed martin and bella helicopter and a base and almost subcontractors defense is extremely important and i made that very clear when i came to congress newt gingrich is the one he said you know now you've been elected uh what what platform are you going to take and he said child care is important education is very important you're a teacher and i said both of them were there i'm here to make sure that our our soldiers sailors marines all have the best equipment and the best support in the world and so i got to as a freshman be put on defense and that was really a a huge honor and i took it very seriously i ended up chairing the first one to ever chair defense appropriations but it's just if we're not safe we missed everything companies won't come they won't grow and we won't have the respect in the world so that's what i've been most proud of to make sure that the funding was there to make sure they had their training their equipment uh and know that the american people supported them you've mentioned listening as something you've learned and advice you would give what was the best advice you got about being an elected official i don't know the best advice but i'm going to tell you some advice that i'll never forget when i was mayor i had the first town hall meeting in 40 years that we'd had and i said to get out of the situation we're in at that time it takes the whole community so i call for a town hall meeting they had to be in the convention center we had so many people and before that i had a reception for the governor the governor was ann richards at that time and so she came there and had all the top business people for this reception she grabbed me by the arm dragged me on the stage and said look at that audience what do you see and i see a lot of people that are interested and she said how many of them are in navy blue suits and i said almost all the men she said then why are you wearing a baby blue suit don't ever wear that again this is a funny story because i spent more with that suit than i'd ever spent for any item of clothing in my life and what she was saying is don't get elected and say i want to be one of the guys that's that was not the deal and so um and if you remember she wore bright red or bright yellow orange she said also another secret the cameras will always go to you when you have those colors so that's interesting advice probably not you expected but i remember very well oh i love that advice sometimes it's that little stuff that really makes the most difference that's exactly right is there any last thing you would like to either go back and emphasize over something that you've already said or summarize in some way or is there something new you'd like to talk with us about being a female elected official i think one of the most important things after you're elected to never forget who elected you and i my staff knows that my constituents the people that elected me that that's my who i owe the most and care about every day and they have to too uh and so i think it's really important um that we that we remember that and we seek that out and we stay close and remember you're just you're just a person like everyone else you just got a great opportunity to help your community and with my case help other women well thank you so much you've given us so much to think about and we really do appreciate your participating today thank you very much for asking me thank you thank you for watching and the league thanks the many donors who support its mission of empowering voters and defending democracy

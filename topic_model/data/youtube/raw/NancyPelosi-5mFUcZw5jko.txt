thank you madam speaker i thank the gentleman for yielding and i thank him for his leadership year in the year out to clarify what our mission is to make sure that we honor our troops and honor them means not having them stay in harm's way any longer than is necessary for our national security madam speaker i rise today in opposition to this rule and i do so with some level of sadness because when we're talking about the defense of our country and the oath we take to protect and defend the constitution i would have hoped under the under this bill we could have had on the floor the appropriate discussion of what is happening in afghanistan i rise today just having returned with a bipartisan all-women congressional delegation to afghanistan it's our traditional mother's day visit to our troops wherever they are in combat and this uh year in and year out we've recently been going to afghanistan iraq before that the purpose of the trip this time was to have conversation with the certainly the president of afghanistan president karzai as the first delegate congressional delegation into afghanistan following the signing of the strategic partnership agreement between president obama and president karzai but our main purpose of the trip was to visit our troops to thank them for their service and their sacrifice to keep america's families safe on mother's day and on every day in the year further purpose is to thank in particular our women who are in service there our mothers in combat and believe it or not our grandmothers uh who are in in the uh in the war zone we met a mom who has a baby 16 weeks old i had the uh honor of pinning a ribbon on a newly uh newly appointed commit captain a woman captain of six children four to fourteen at home in the tenth year of her one-year tenth month of her one-year deployment in afghanistan our women in the military serve our country very well they strengthen our national security and we are grateful to them and their families and we are grateful to all of our men and women in uniform they are the one percent that we should care the most about and focus on you hear a great deal about the 99 percent and the one percent well this one percent is less than one percent of our men and women in uniform and a little higher than that when they come home and what we say in the military is on the battlefield we leave no soldier behind and when they come home we have no veteran leave no veteran behind we'll be meeting with our veteran service organizations today as this bill is being debated so i wish that the rule would have allowed for the consideration of the mcgovern amendment i was surprised frankly and i'm rarely surprised around here but i was surprised that that discussion could not take place on this floor in the form of approving that amendment uh because it is uh in furtherance of of what has happened in the strategic partnership i can tell you this on the basis of our trip and we have to be careful when we return uh congressional delegations from a trip that we don't read too much into our own observations but what we did here that was different from before going every year is that our troops leadership is fabulous general allen is so great and the other generals and commanders who serve with him they are preparing for the timetable spelled out in the president's strategic partnership agreement signed by science uh that on the civilian front and what we are doing with usaid and our americans who are serving there as well as of the uh the coalition forces and friends who are helping in afghanistan are working along the path of this uh strategic partnership and then the civilian part to go beyond that so really i've come home more encouraged than ever that it is possible for us to accomplish our mission which is the protection of the american people to do so in a way that has a that comes to an end it's never over as long our protection of the american people is an endless commitment but at least the commitment of that many troops on the ground and that country is one that we can say that soon we will bring our troops home safely and that hopefully will be soon so the timetable that mr mcgovern has in his amendment is in sync with what that partnership is there's other language in the bill frankly that i think confuses the issue and that's why the clarity of debate would have been helpful i am glad that the amendment by mr smith the ranking member that is bipartisan amendment will be able to come to the floor which addresses the detention issue and and we'll have a fuller discussion of that when that amendment comes to the floor but to recall president obama when he signed last year's bill did a signing um statement that said he would not uh enforce that part of the bill hopefully today we can remove that part from the bill because it flies in the face of our commitment to protect the american people and to have the proper balance between security and liberty and freedom and that is our responsibility so i urge my colleagues to vote no on the rule to vote no on moving the previous question unless we can take up the mcgovern amendment and again salute the president for the strategic partnership agreement but most of all support our men and women in uniform and their families for their service their sacrifice and their patriotism for our country and madam speaker i yield back thank you gentlemen from utah reserve reserves gentlemen from massachusetts

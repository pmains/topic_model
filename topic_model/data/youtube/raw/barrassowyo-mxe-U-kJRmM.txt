joining us right now is Republican senator from Wyoming he's the ranking member of the Senate energy committee and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee John barrasso is here Senator it's great to see you this morning thanks so much for being here give us your reaction to what you just heard from the president well it's it's a sound bite it's not a solution look the president and the Democrats declared war on American Energy day one kill the Keystone XL pipeline block oil and gas exploration and the American people have been paying a very high price for this at the pump at the grocery store ever since and the Democrats are going to be made to pay a very high price for this come election day the president has now announced this winfall profit look it's going to backfire on the Democrats Jimmy Carter did the same thing at the same problem it's going to lower production not increased energy production when I see the president at the podium up there I mean I see a president who's overwhelmed ineffective really desperate right now you just want to take down the presidential seal and put up a help wanted sign well I mean look you feel it in Wyoming your state is an energy producing Jade can you walk us through some of the things that this Administration did as you say on day one on week one they canceled the Keystone Pipeline certainly but what have they done in terms of putting limitations in place for oil companies to actually get leases approved or or increase Drilling and increase production because he's talking as if they can do so with no problem but isn't it his policy that put the limitations in to begin with well it is his policy and he has broken the law and the courts have even said that this Administration has broken the law in terms of not doing these oil and gas leases to allow for exploration on public lands Revenue comes into the federal government as a result of that they blocked all of that a block the construction of pipelines the infrastructure that we need and the president may have forgotten this but just a couple of months ago he and all of the Democrats the Democrats voted for it and he signed into law additional taxes on oil and gas production we need the energy we need all of it the reason it produced the American Energy here the lower cost for consumers that's critical we can then more cheaply refill the Strategic petroleum Reserve our emergency sources that the president has I believe wasted used irresponsibly we can once again become energy dominant as a nation energy independent we're still a million barrels a day less than we should be and it's because Joe Biden and the Democrats have choked off American Energy it is a self-inflicted wound we need to unleash American Energy we take back the house take back the Senate that's the focus do you think he'll take back the Senate majority we had uh Senator Rick Scott on earlier and he said that he's expecting the GOP to have 54 seats in the Senate is that what you look for well I've been talking to our candidates around the country I'm going to be in Nevada this weekend with Adam lack salt helping the lower campaigning with him I'm optimistic and here's why the American people under straight Democrat rule are very concerned almost sickened by the impact of the direction of the country by where they think the economy is going by their own future and this election is going to be a report card on the Democrats policies and they get an F an F on inflation and F on the economy enough on the border and F on crime the American people do not believe the Democrats are really up to the task of dealing with the issues that are the major issues of the American people which is being able to fill your gas tank and your grocery cart on the same week we can't do it if we want to stop the damage we need to we need to get rid of the Democrats and vote Republican up and down the ticket well will you be able to stop the damage what can you do to reverse this because as you say inflation is at 40-year highs and it's interesting to see real pocketbook issues driving the vote This Time Around by the way the president continues to say that if the Republicans gain the edge after the midterms inflation gets worse and he's also talking about inflation on a global stage here's what he said about that yesterday watch you know we're dealing with that for homesick inflation is a worldwide problem right now because of a war in Iraq and the impact on oil and what Russia is doing I mean excuse me the war in in Ukraine and uh I think Iraq because that's when my son died the uh because he died the but the point is that they're uh you know that's why it's up we have the lowest inflation rate of almost any major country in the world wow a lot of missteps there uh he said that inflation is because of the war in Iraq he corrected himself to say Ukraine and then he said his late son Beau died in Iraq we know that Beau died of brain cancer in 2015 Senator your reaction well as I said earlier we have a president who is overwhelmed and ineffective and we're at 40-year high inflation right now in this country the Pres the president denied that for a full year so it was going to be temporary wasn't anything don't worry about it well the American people have worried and have paid a huge price as a result of that then the president started looking for people to blame and he has a whole Litany of folks that he's blamed over the last two years we know the cause of the inflation it's runaway government spending that was passed only with Democrat votes Republicans will be able to stop that day one massive amount of red tape from this Administration which has hurt our energy production in so many things this inflation is you your last segment was on was talking about real estate if you're you're further people are falling further and further behind if you're a young couple trying to save for a home with double inflation rates no way you're going to be able to buy that home and if you're a senior trying to sell a home so you can move to be closer to the grandkids hard to get that asking price yeah well well said we're going to be watching all these issues Senator we'll be watching you on the campaign Trail and talk with you along the way thanks so much for being here this morning thank you Maria all right Senator John barrasso

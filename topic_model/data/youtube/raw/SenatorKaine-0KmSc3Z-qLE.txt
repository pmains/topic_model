and then great yes um so once again welcome to everyone thank you senator for leading on this important discussion I just want to do a quick final housekeeping items again keep yourself on mute unless you are ready to ask a question during our q a portion in order to ask a question just put your name in the chat and let me know that you asked the question and I'm going to keep a list in the order that I receive them also as a reminder we are recording this session and this is an Open Press event after the Q a session with participants press will have a 10-minute q a at the end so that's the order we'll go to and now I'm really excited and pleased to hand it over to Senator Tim Kaine who's been doing some great work here on the hill on voting rights and he will let you know where we stand and of the work that he's been engaged in so Senator over to you well well so much many of you know Corinne is my state director which means that she's essentially my Deputy Chief of Staff but also in charge of my six State offices all of our constituent Outreach and engagement with um important groups of constituents around the Commonwealth and she does a superb job um I I wanted to do this today because I believe that next week is probably going to be the most important week that I'll spend in the Senate next week was traditionally scheduled as a Martin Luther King Day recess we would be off next week but Senator Schumer the majority leader has decided to scrap the recess and after the celebration of the MLK Day holiday on Monday we will return to the Senate on Tuesday to begin a debate about voting rights I want to thank all who are on this call we've got leaders from around the Commonwealth NAACP State leadership NAACP chapters on Urban League leaders legislators and other public officials representatives from Key fraternities and sororities in Virginia and I think we're going to have a good discussion and what I want to do is really take some time to lay out exactly what's going on right now because Senate procedure is very very bizarre there's no legislative body in the country or really in the world that sort of operates under the same set of rules as the United States Senate and so this is a discussion that's not only about voting but it's going to end some very fundamental questions about Senate rules and the question of what is more important Senate rules which the Senate can change and has often changed over time or protection of voting rights indeed the very protection of the Democracy that we take an oath to protect all of this is going to be at stake um next week I'm going to ask Corinne and other staffers of mine to post up in the chat their contact information because we will have a q a at the end of this but in case he doesn't get a question answered or you think of one later I want you to know who to reach out to okay so here's here's what's going on um all of you on this call know um the the painful chapter of voting in this country and the systemic exclusion of many people from being able to participate in elections either to vote or to run for office and you can basically track the history of this country um in terms of who has been allowed to vote the 15th Amendment saying that African-Americans couldn't be barred just because they were African-American the the uh the Jim Crow era uh the Virginia constitution of 1901 and many other constitutions trying to disentry franchise African-Americans through stunts and schemes the 15th Amendment wouldn't allow just an outright prohibition against African-American votes but if you could put schemes in place that would disenfranchise African-Americans the 15th amendment was not held to block that um the passage of the 19th amendment to give women the franchise the the battles over civil rights laws in the 1950s and 1960s the the Voting Rights Act of 1965 after a 60-day filibuster on the senate floor the Voting Rights Act passed it was it was passed at a time of massive disenfranchisement it was passed after an act of violence the beating of John Lewis on me Edmund Pettus Bridge thankfully it was tasked with strong bipartisan support in fact Republican support for the voting rights of 1965 and the Senate was stronger than Democratic support that act has been repeatedly reauthorized in Congress by by bipartisan majorities as recently as 2006. but the Voting Rights Act was dealt a very critical blow in 2013 By the case of Shelby versus Mississippi and I I know everyone on the call knows this but just in case for some members of the press or whatever if this isn't you know your normal Peak what Shelby did was it took a core provision of the Voting Rights Act the pre-clearance provisions that require jurisdictions where there had been a history of voting rights violations primarily in the South it required them to pre-clear any changes to voting so in Virginia or in Richmond when I was a state local official if we wanted to make changes to voting we would have to submit them to the justice department 90 days prior to the implementation date the justice department would ask questions and normally they would not object and then the changes that go into place but that pre-clearance mechanism protected against efforts to disenfranchise people the Supreme Court in the Shelby case struck down the the formula not not the pre-clearance mechanism but the formula over that said which jurisdictions had to get pre-clearance and it told Congress that Congress had to fix the um the decision making about which jurisdictions had to seek pre-clearance I was in the senate in 2013. we went back to the Republicans knowing that they had been strong supporters of the Voting Rights Act and we found to our surprise there had been a fundamental change in the Republican party from 2006 to 2013. I basically put that change as a reaction to the election of President Obama um and in 2013 many of the Senate Republicans who had voted to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act were still in the Senate probably 30 of them were but none of them not a single one would sign on to a simple even-handed Fair fix of the Voting Rights Act in the aftermath of the Shelby decision once jurisdictions didn't have to pre-clear voting changes many jurisdictions started to put up new obstacles and schemes and stunts to deprive people um in subtle but surgical ways of their rights to vote and we didn't have the pre-clearance tool that could provide a protection against those disenfranchising efforts many states did this in the years after 2013 and it was sort of an increasing Crescendo of efforts to disenfranchise people but that Crescendo really hit warp speed with the election of Donald Trump as president in 2016. as you know he came into office claiming that the American election system was fraudulent that he had really won the popular vote that millions of people had fraudulently voted in Virginia and elsewhere um he he led a concerted campaign to undermine the integrity of American elections driven largely by his own embarrassment at the fact that he had lost a popular vote um and that led other states to then start to repeat the big lie about voter fraud and put more obstacles in people's way to participate the warp speed of disenfranchisement upped significantly in November 2020 there was a historic turnout in the presidential election Donald Trump lost by 7 million votes and then went on a concerted campaign to demean that election outcome to file dozens of meritless lawsuits challenging the election outcome to to trash lotion officials in the states where he had lost in such an extreme degree that they even faced significant threats of violence to actually call the Georgia election office and say you need to find me X thousand votes the precise number of votes that he would have needed in order to win Georgia rather than lose when all of those efforts fail the efforts to demean the election the efforts to attack election officials the efforts to directly and illegally solicit votes from election officials president Trump then invited followers to come to D.C for something Wild on January 6th the attack on the capitol you all know it you all watched it but what exactly was that attack about is really important because many in Congress are now saying you know it was a protest it was mostly a peaceful protest some will acknowledged that it was violent some will acknowledge that those violent attackers who injured 150 police officers and some died were terrorists but what they usually will not say is that it was violence for a particular purpose that attack was on a day at an hour for a dangerous purpose to over to stop the peaceful transfer of power and thereby disenfranchise the 80 million people who had voted for Donald Trump in common for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris it was the biggest single day disenfranchisement effort in the history of the United States the largest disenfranchisement effort of course was the historical disenfranchisement of African-American voters that at least a one-day disenfranchisement effort the attack on the capitol was an effort to disenfranchise 80 million people by disrupting the peaceful transfer of power in the aftermath of that attack many state legislatures and about 19 States thank goodness Virginia is one of them I see how I yell on it I'm going to give her and her colleagues praise in a second I think we might have some other state legislators but before I get to Virginia about 19 states around the country have basically picked up Donald Trump's big lie that the 2020 election with robust turnout was fraudulent that the election was stolen that it was rigged that people voted who were dead the people voted who were not eligible to vote and they have picked up that Mantra the Donald Trump big why and although they may not be using flagpoles and fence posts to batter police officers are wearing Camp Auschwitz t-shirts or waving Confederate flags they are acting in state legislatures all around this country to impose new restrictions on the right to vote and the states where they're doing this they're not a random assortment of states this is not a partisan call but I have to just be factual the only states where this is happening are states where both legislative houses and the governor's mansion are held by Republicans and they are driven by a Fidelity to the Donald Trump big lie and they are undertaking efforts to block people's rights to participate with a variety of stunts and schemes that are really dizzy I mean to give you examples I think people are familiar with the example in Georgia where they've made it a penalty to hand out water or food to somebody waiting in an election line now in Georgia the election lines in minority neighborhoods and metropolitan areas tend to be very long in Suburban or rural communities they're very short so in order to vote this is already an inequity that people should have to wait hours to vote in some parts of the state in minutes and other parts of the state but to say that somebody can't hand you a bottle of water if you're waiting for two hours in line and that you would be subject both to jail and a fine if you were to do that is a cruel form of intimidation Georgia has also passed a law giving the right to any Georgia resident to challenge the voting credentials of anyone trying to vote on Election Day and mandating that that challenge must lead to an administrative hearing before open election board and so just imagine you're waiting in line and somebody comes up to you and they don't like the way you look or they make a prediction about who you might vote for and they say I'm going to challenge your credentials you then are faced with the requirement that you have to appear and an administrative hearing before a local election board who may or may not be friendly to you to demonstrate your Bona fides to vote even if you're completely able to be successful the hassle of having to do that would be enough to intimidate or push some people away from voting in addition Georgia officials Georgia Republicans largely in the in the special election for the senate in January of 2006 they challenged their credentials of 370 000 voters so imagine these hard-working and low-paid election officials having to hold 370 thousand Administrative Hearings to respond to these challenges it's it's a way of burdening them so they can't do the job Georgia has also put in place mechanisms whereby the state can selectively audit jurisdictions Fulton County where African Americans are a sizable percentage of the population where Democratic vote is high will get audited but other jurisdictions won't Georgia has also put in place mechanisms to allow the partisan legislature to take control of the outcome calling the winner away from the dually sworn election officials in the state these stunts and schemes and disenfranchising efforts are going on all across the country to give you another example state of Montana not a Southern state not a state that was originally covered with pre-clearance requirement in the uh in the Voting Rights Act what's happening in Montana my friend John tester is the senator there Montana has had automatic registration same-day registration for years after the 2020 election the Montana legislature um both Republican houses Republican Governor uh eliminated the same day registration that had been part of Montana election law for years Montana also has a voter ID requirement now Virginia has a voter ID requirement you can have a voter ID requirement that is Broad and even handed but in Montana the voter ID requirement allows things like concealed weapons permits to be used as effective voter ID but not not how student identification not some forms of identification that are very commonly used on tribal reservations and so if you take an ID requirement and you allow certain IDs to be used but you borrow other ideas from being used you can carve away at portions of the electorate in a way that will skew the elections in any event 19 states around the country have passed laws already and as state legislatures are about to convene across the country many more are considering such legislation I said I was going to compliment our Virginia legislators who were on this call Virginia by most measures was one of the hardest states to vote in the country no early in-person voting no non-excuse absentee balloting but when Democrats took control of both houses of the Virginia legislature after the November 2019 elections the legislature about 2020 2021 undertook a series of steps to make it easier to vote and in just two years in these nonpartisan rankings of ease of access to the ballot Virginia has moved from 49th in the country to 12th in the country in terms of ease of access to the ballot and that's a good thing and it's important to point out that that is a good thing for small D democracy it's not a partisan thing the the governor's race we just had um produced an outcome that I wasn't happy with and my partisan had as being a Democrat a republican won the election but but the turnout went up by 25 percent over the governor's race four years earlier because we made it easier for people to participate so while I wasn't happy with the outcome I would say a 25 increase in voter turnout that was a positive thing for small D democracy and so voting rights sadly get seen as a partisan issue with Republicans undertaking efforts to kick people off the rolls and purge them but protecting voting rights is not partisan it's it's it could be good for Democrats it could be good for Republicans it could be good for Independence but it's definitely good for democracy so in the in the aftermath of the attack of January 6 and then watching so many states try to utilize the Shelby decision in the absence of pre-clearance in a way to force through changes that disenfranchise people and undermine electoral Integrity we have been since the beginning of the year uh looking to find a path forward on voting rights legislation and this is where I come in the two committees in the Senate that do work on voting rights are the rules committee and the Judiciary Committee and I'm not on either of those committees but I think I'm the only Democrat here who has done voting rights work as a civil rights attorney before I got into politics I practiced law as many of you know in Richmond for 17 years I was a civil rights lawyer primarily housing discrimination cases but I did some voting rights work representing people with voting rights challenges but also representing local governments trying to do redistricting and as a mayor and then a governor I was under the pre-clearance provisions of the Voting Rights Act that was fine and I didn't mind pre-clearance and we were glad to do it and we wanted to know whether things we were doing would would meet the standards of the Voting Rights Act or not so in May Senator Schumer asked if I would become involved in the battle for voting rights in the Senate because I had done voting rights because of Virginia's history sadly some of the worst violations of voting rights in the country were perpetrated by Virginia Senators who hold the seat I now occupy Harry bird senior and Harry bird Jr in the 50 years between 1933 and 1983. but I was also asked to get involved because I have known Joe manchin senator manchin for many many years my first task was get Joe manchin to be a co-sponsor of a Voting Rights bill at the time in May there were two pieces of legislation out on the table and Joe manchin was not a sponsor of either so I worked with Senator manchin and I worked with other colleagues between May and September to introduce something called the freedom vote act which is the the core bill that is now before us the freedom to vote act that has all 50 Democrats as co-sponsors including Joe manchin as an original co-sponsor the second bill that's before says the John Lewis act which is a bill that simply restores the pre-clearance provisions that were struck down by the Supreme Court in 2013. those are the two bills that we are working on together when we finally got all Democrats on board with these bills in September the current Senate rules the way they've been used or really the way they've been abused in recent history and I emphasize recent history because during much of the history of the Senate this was not the case but in recent history the the normally fairly rarely used device of filibuster requires you essentially to get 60 votes in the Senate to pass legislation the super majority in the house it's simple maturity in the House and Senate in Virginia it's simple majority and in most city councils and state legislatures it's simple majority but in the in the Senate the abuse over time of filibuster rules have led to a situation where you need virtually 60 votes to do anything not only to pass a bill you even need 60 votes to get a bill poised for discussion I I argue that that use of the 60 vote threshold is essentially like the gag rule many of you know the history of Congress in the 1830s and 1840s there was a gag rule that prohibited even the discussion of legislation related to slavery on the floor of the U.S Congress the filibuster rule is being used as a modern-day gag rule not only to stop passage of civil rights legislation but even to stop discussion of civil rights legislation and so for example I've been in the Senate now for nine years we have never had a piece of voting rights legislation on the floor in the for a debate and discussion in the nine years that I've been here because Republicans will not vote to proceed to the legislation so we um knowing that we would we would under current Senate rules we might need Republican support after we put the freedom to vote act together Joe manchin and I and our colleagues spent months talking to Republicans we have these two bills Republicans in the past have supported voting rights legislation we would like your help the answer was no we we would move to proceed to the bills on the floor of the Senate and Republicans would uniformly vote no with the exception of Lisa murkowski of Alaska who will vote to proceed to the John Lewis bill no other Senator on the Republican side will proceed either to the lowest bill or freedom to vote Act we went to them and said if you will vote to proceed to these bills we'll guarantee you unlimited amendments which is rare in the Senate we we would accept counter proposals what would you do instead what we've heard very bluntly from them is they're unwilling to do anything on voting rights and they're unwilling to do anything on campaign Finance reform and so once it was clear that we could not get any Republican cooperation beginning in November I have worked very hard with all 50 Democratic senators to see whether we might be willing to contemplate a change in the Senate rules to allow Passage of voting rights legislation by a simple majority we Face two challenges how can we get a bill up on the floor over this gag rule 60 vote requirement even for debate and how can we pass a bill if Republicans are not willing to help us out and so we have been involved in a very intense discussion about the Senate rules the history of the Senate rules the history of changes in the Senate um and whether this is a time when such changes would be warranted because of the threat to voting and the threat to democracy beginning on Tuesday we will begin that debate on the senate floor we have not been able to find Republicans who are willing to vote to proceed to our voting rights legislation but we are utilizing a very obscure Senate procedure that allows the house to send us a message and the Senate can take up the message by a simple majority vote without the 60 vote motion a perceived threshold normally house messages are ministerial you know we're going to go into recess uh for August and we'll come back on after Labor Day or something like that house messages often come over to the Senate and they're fairly ministerial but there's no prohibition about the house message being used to do something more substantive and so yesterday the house took a very simple message it was actually a message on NASA funding that had been drafted by Don Byer our congressman from Northern Virginia they took that very simple house message and they added into it the John Lewis Act and the freedom to vote act as currently sponsored by all 50 Democratic senators and they sent it to the Senate yesterday we're going to take the weekend off for Martin Luther King weekend we we think I think all the Senators believe we need to go back home and and get re-energized for this battle ahead but then we're going to return Tuesday and we're going to start debating voting rights the Republicans can't block us because we don't need to get 60 votes to have this debate and we're going to start debating voting rights and we may be on this debate for some time the Voting Rights Act of 1965 it was six weeks Civil Rights Act of 1964 was 60 days I don't know how long we'll be on it um we will be debating the challenge of the moment we will be debating the obstruction that we see underway both in the attack on the Capitol and state legislatures around the country we will be debating the provisions of the John Lewis and freedom to vote Act and why they are good responses to the current danger threatening voting and threatening our democracy and we'll also be debating the Senate rules and here's the challenge right now while we have all 50 Democrats who support the Voting Rights bill the combined Lewis and freedom to vote Act and we have the ability to debate the bill through this procedural mechanism we found we don't yet have all 50 Democrats on board with willingness to consider changes to the Senate rules so that we can pass it by simple majority yesterday President Biden asked for an opportunity to address the Democratic caucus and he also asked for the opportunity to visit with two senators Joe manchin and Kirsten who had not yet committed to a to an openness to rules changes um in my view it was unfortunate um that meeting was set up the president was set to come visit and his meeting with the two senators was on the calendar but right before the president came and spoke to the Democratic caucus Senator Cinema took the floor and gave a speech saying I am unwilling to consider any changes to Senate rules I I would have hoped she would have at least listened to the president first but she gave a speech in which she said she is unwilling to consider changes to Senate rules and Senator manchin put out a statement shortly after saying the same thing so we we go into this debate as an uphill battle we we have enough votes to pass the bill because if if we were to have a simple majority in all 50 Democrats were to vote Yes vice president Kamala Harris would be the tiebreaker if the rule was simple majority we would win but the the current Senate rule under most scenarios requires 60 votes and unless we have all Democrats willing to for example say but on voting rights we're changing the Senate rule on voting rights simple majority is sufficient you need to get 60 votes changes of that kind are made often in fact um Democratic senators were willing to make this very change a month ago the nation was about to reach its debt ceiling when that happens Congress has to accept extend the debt ceiling Republicans in the Senate said they were not going to vote with us to extend the nation's debt ceiling and so the Democrats we all met and we agreed but look if we get no Republican support we will change the Senate rules to affirm the full faith and credit of the United States the 14th Amendment to the Constitution not only guarantees equal protection of the laws but in Article 5 of the 14th Amendment it says the public debt of the United States shall not be questioned we believe we have a constitutional obligation to affirm the public debt of the United States and so we basically told Senator McConnell hey if you don't provide votes to enable us to do this we're going to vote to change the rules simple majority change the rules to affirm the public debt of the United States my friend Senator Rafael Warnock of Georgia has made this very his asked this very pointed question if affirming the public debt as the United States is an important enough priority the Democrats would change Senate Rules by ourselves by simple majority to do it why isn't protecting the right to vote just as important why isn't protecting the right to vote just as important and so we'll get into this debate next week we'll start debating on Tuesday we'll likely have a vote Tuesday or Wednesday about actually taking up the house message we may well have debate on amendments uh to the Voting Rights bill at some point we'll likely have a vote on a cloture motion we'll move to bring debate to a close under current Senate rules that would require 60 votes we won't get them my expectation is at that point leader Schumer will say we propose a new Senate rule just for voting legislation that a cloture vote shouldn't take 60 should just take 50 and then we'll have a Senate vote on that um and everybody will have to go on the record 100 Senators every Democrat and every Republican will have to go on the record about their view of the importance of current Senate rules which have changed over time versus the importance of doing voting rights legislation if you read any press accounts of where we are right now they would suggest pessimism that we will ultimately be able to pass this bill um they would suggest that Republicans won't lift a finger to help us and I think that's accurate and based upon the statements of two Democratic senators Senators mansion and Senators Senator Cinema they would predict that we ultimately will fall just short of being able to get this done but but I'm a believer that epiphanies can happen and that surprises can occur and that people can have insights and change their mind I saw it once in the Senate in August of 2017 the Republicans had worked for eight months to repeal Obamacare and they had done it with surgical precision and they had 52 votes and all they needed under the reconciliation process that was being used at the time was simple majority to take health insurance away from 30 million people the vote was undertaken in the wee hours of the morning on a hot day in August of 2017. senators Collins and murkowski two Republicans that said they would vote with Democrats to not repeal the Affordable Care that would have made it a tie vote and so we had that vote and Michael Pence the then vice president came to the chamber to cast a tie breaking vote excited and proud to be a tie-breaking vote to take health insurance away from 30 million people which is almost unimaginable to me but at the last minute as you recall it was about three in the morning John McCain who had been voting with the Republicans to repeal the Affordable Care Act it would initially opposed Obamacare but who had recently been released from the hospital after a glioblastoma diagnosis John McCain walked down to the aisle and voted no we're not going to repeal Obamacare we're not going to take health insurance away from 30 million people and it was a surprise and it was a surprise that was driven by his own Revelation while he was being treated for cancer surrounded by a whole lot of other patients who were fighting for their lives the taking health insurance away from people is not a good idea while the Vegas odds about the outcome next week may not be great I I never never give up on the prospect that illumination and epiphanies can occur and I think you'll see some spirited spirited debate um about the most fundamental aspect of our democracy next week and I'm going to be thinking about this all weekend long and thinking about this is probably most important vote I'm ever going to cast in the U.S Senate and whatever the outcome this battle isn't over the you know the movement of Dr King that we always think about on Monday it's not a movement that's in the rear view mirror I mean it's a movement that is underway and and win or lose on this the the journey will continue because even this bill as good as it is it's not it's not true for all ales um and so we'll have more work to do but I wanted just to kind of brief you on this and on my role in it [Music] um I I and the last thing I'll say before I open it up for questions is this January 6th for me was a pivotal day in my life um an unforgettable One A Day Never To Be Imagined and a day that hopefully never to be repeated it's not changed my personality and it's not changed my relationships but it has changed my priorities and some of you have heard me say this I was extremely angry that day there were many emotions confusion certainly that anger was my dominant emotion and I've been angry before in my life there was plenty to be angry about that day but it took me a number of months to really identify the source of my anger and it wasn't until a number of months later that I realized this is why I was so angry that day I'm a white male born in 1958 nobody had ever tried to disenfranchise me I'm a civil rights lawyer I battled for people's Voting Rights Act my whole life but I was always fighting for other people's voting rights because mine had never been threatened well for about five hours that day as there was an attempt to disenfranchise all 80 million people who had voted for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris I had a little empathy window for a very brief moment in time to what many people have experienced their entire lives that there's been a consistent and persistent effort to disenfranchise people of color for for centuries women for centuries you know immigrants for generations and and many many have had that experience in a very personal way and I I had and um by the end of that day the threat to me was over I guess and I was no longer jeopardized in the way that some are jeopardized today by these actions that are being undertaken in States all across this country and that and it will happen more and more and more if we don't do something to stop it but it sort of took what had been a priority for me and really turned it into an existential necessity because it's not just being disenfranchised as bad that's horrible but even the feeling that others want to take away my right to vote that others don't think I'm worthy that others want to exclude me is a horrible thing and so that's why I'm so glad that I would I have jumped into this in an intense way um next week will be an unusual week we hardly ever have anything in the Senate that's not all pre-di pre-digested and completely predictable and everybody knows exactly how it's going to go the Senate used to have a lot more surprise to it these multi-day multi-week debates the surprise has kind of been drained out of the legislative process here over some years but next week we ought to pray for some surprises and some twists and some turns and uh with that um I'm really glad we could do this this morning and I appreciate you letting me talk about this at some length but the Senate is such an unusual institution and the rules are so bizarre that I felt like I should go into some detail about what we're about to embark on and with that Karen I'd love to open it up and take questions and print I'm assuming that you are going to be maybe the traffic cop on the Q a yes Senator thank you so much the first question is to um president Barnett the Virginia state conference of NAACP hey Mr President good morning Senator Kane thank you for your leadership in the Senate thank you for your leadership here in the Commonwealth we are are very we are at a Crossroads and now is the time that we uh step forward and make sure that voting rights cannot be taken away and so my question I I just put it in the in the chat that this is a very important issue how do we fix it right right now Robert the key is we have to figure out a way to persuade to persuade senator's mansion in the cinema to place the priority of voting rights over adherence to Senate rules that have been changed frequently throughout our history and that can be changed we we have given to Senators mansion and Cinema a number of possible rules changes we can carve out an exception for voting rights and say voting rights can be done by simple majority or we've actually given them a completely different set of changes let's return to the old talking filibuster you know if you've seen Mr Smith Goes to Washington if if you are in a minority and you want to uphold if you want to stop the majority in the setup for moving then you take the floor and you try to persuade them they're wrong and you can hold the floor for as long as you want but once you're done if you haven't persuaded them the Senate rules still say the vote would be by simple majority so you only need that elevated 60 vote threshold for what's called a cloture motion which is a motion to terminate debate if you're in the middle of debate and you're not trying to terminate it when debate is over the vote is by simple majority so we've gone to them and said if you don't want to change the the cloture threshold how about this let's just return to talking filibuster force all 100 Senators just to be on that floor both sides should have to work it's tough on both sides but everybody's going to be got to be on the floor and we're going to do as much talking as we can but as soon as everybody has spoken twice which is allowed under the current Senate rule then we'll go to simple majority they haven't agreed to that either but they haven't completely rejected it so there are a couple of paths forward and I I think I think the key is less with Senators mansion and Senator getting into the the nuts and bolts of the Senate rules in the way that I have explained to you because I wanted everybody to have a context but just what you said at the start of your question we're at a Crossroads now we're at across roads and and you have an opportunity to do the right thing or to put us on a path that's that's the wrong path and I think that that's that if if we could make that argument um NAACP chapters you know your Virginia chapter has ties to the West Virginia chapter local chapters have ties to West Virginia chapters some of you might have ties in in Arizona I think the in-state voices are the most important voices for these two senators to hear from but but again because they are co-sponsors of both pieces of legislation we can't give up we can't give up on them they don't like to change Senate rules but it's not like they're opposing the bills they they are co-sponsors of the bill so Outreach to those two offices is really really important awesome next we have Eric clavelle hi Senator good morning good morning to everyone here on the call hey Eric our question is surrounding the um realistic chances of the passing of those bills to restore the protections to voting rights you've misarticulated the challenges that we have with some members on the Democratic side of the aisle and the reluctance of the other uh legislators on the Republicans are they out so from what I'm hearing is that there is not really a realistic chance of it really passing unless there is some change of heart or some event pushing others to really you know vote for the good of voting rights so with that being said how do you what is the perceived impact upon the midterm elections uh the rest of the Bible Administration and the ability really to thwart adviases of state legislators from restricting access to the voting box such as states of like Georgia as opposed to providing more protections and increasing access to the voting box like the Commonwealth region Eric you're if again the the Vegas odds are tough right now not impossible but if if we cannot pass the Lewis and the freedom to vote act it basically will allow states to continue to do what Georgia and Texas and other states are doing and selectively fence people out from participating and also undertake other steps that demean the Integrity of Elections um and that will that will be ongoing now the justice department still has the capacity under section two of the Voting Rights Act to file lawsuits against jurisdictions and they're in court all the time um as are lawyers for the Democratic National Committee and the Senate Democratic Campaign Committee we we're in for all the time challenging States actions if they in violation of section two of Voting Rights Act would have the intent and effect of deluding minority vote strengths and so that that part of the Voting Rights Act is still there but the Supreme Court has even narrowed section two down in the brainovich decision this summer you know they basically say look the Voting Rights Act is is meant to stop intentional disenfranchisement of African-Americans if you say yeah I was just trying to hurt Democrats not African-Americans you know the the court is now moving to a position well that's okay you can do that even though the overlap between African-American vote and Democratic vote is you know so significant if you claim that you're doing it for partisan reasons rather than racial reasons the Supreme Court seems to be accepting it so what we would have before us Eric would be a strategy where we would have to rely on the justice department and courts recognizing that the Supreme Court precedent is not as helpful as it used to be and we would also have to rely on intense organizing in the states to try to have more states do what Virginia is doing and fewer states do what George is doing one of the things I'm going around and really using this Virginia message hey guys we just expanded the vote and a republican governor won this is not a partisan thing if you broaden the franchise it could be good for one party it could be good for the other party it's good for democracy and and we may we may need to make that argument it's going to be interesting to see whether in Virginia under a republican Governor now it's a republican house will there be an effort to carve back the voting expansions that were done in 2019 and 2020. um I I would hope that the Democratic Senate would block such an effort but it might be that the Republicans would look at the increased turnout November and say you know we fought like hell against all this stuff but it's actually not so bad so we might we might be able to use the Virginia example in some other states to help them broaden rather than restrict the franchise so look the the best solution is for us to get this done at the federal level but there are other litigation and state um legislative paths your point about the the Biden agenda in the midterms I I'm worried about that now I'm more worried about the Democracy that I am worried about any particular election but I do worry about this effect um Raphael Warnock in Georgia is very powerful in saying he's up for election in November of 2022 reelection of the Senate he says if the Georgia laws stay in place he thinks it's going to be virtually impossible for him to win my friend John tester in Montana he's not up in 22 he's up in 2024 but he says what they've done to restrict youth voting and tribal voting he said you know he hasn't made his decision about whether he's going to run in 2024 or not but he says he wants to be able to make that decision on his own not have the state legislature pass rules that say oh it's impossible for me so I can't do it um Mark Kelly in Arizona is up in 2022. the Arizona legislature is contemplating a number of challenges that will make it very hard for him that's one of the things that makes it a little more difficult for me to understand Senator Cinema's position because remember Arizona was one of the states where they tried to throw out the electoral votes Arizona is one of the states where he seems and stunts are being imposed in a way that will have an impact on her Senate colleague and friend this year um and uh and then there's a bigger effect on the midterms if I mean and I'll just say it this way bluntly if Democrats won't stand up for voting rights there's a whole lot of other groups out there that hope Democrats will stand up for them but if they see that we won't stand up for voting rights they'll ask the question wow what's the chance they're going to stand up on climate or minimum wage per LGBT equality or police reform what's the chance that they're going to stand up on immigration reform what's the chance that they're going to stand up to reduce the cost to college or broaden Access to Health Care this is going to send a powerful message either that we've got a backbone we're going to stand up for things we told people we would do if we had a majority or to the contrary they'll see it and suggest power you know the dev's got a majority for a particular reason but on the fundamental issue of protecting people's voting rights especially the people who voted for Democrats if they're not willing for that I mean the these efforts in the states are being essentially directed at people because they were loyal to us because they voted for us and so the question is are we loyal to them the states are extremely high on this not just on voting not just on Democracy but on whether people believe that we and and look we're not all the same 48 out of 50 at least are going to vote for this and zero Republicans will vote for it but we got to have all Democrats to protect Democratic voters who are under attack right now thank you that moving to Brenda Hall foreign [Music] from Roanoke good morning to you sir uh we thank we thank you for all of your educated service throughout the years and uh I want to speak to when the Supreme Court designated the Voting Rights Act we lost pre-clearance um that was the state of Virginia also in the textbook example of why this was so important Roanoke County moved its registrar's office out to Vinton Virginia way back in the woods there is no access by bus uh I guess to take a taxi but most minorities cannot get there and without the teeth of pre-clearance without this Voting Rights Act that everyone is fighting so hard for including you and so many others Senator Mark Warner and so many others but the this is critical that we put this back in place because what else can I fight with I have no teeth you know when I fight I like to win you know that's a competitiveness in me but right now as a stand I have no teeth to stand and fight against this because everybody is saying why can't the NAACP do something you know they just don't understand that we no longer have pre-clearance and we have something to fight with well well Brenda I'm really glad you brought that up and and let me I want to talk about the John Lewis Act and the pre-clearance question because when you when you hear what the John Lewis Act is it is the most reasonable and even-handed restoration of pre-clearance possible and yet we can only get one Republican Lisa murkowski in the Senate and no Republicans in the house to support it so so here was what pre-clearance was before the Shelby decision the Voting Rights is 65 identified jurisdictions primarily Southern jurisdictions like Virginia that had a history of excluding people voting based on race and it said those jurisdictions have to be clear if they're going to make changes to elections moving the registrar's office switching from a May municipal election to a November election the state changing rules about absentee voting if you were in one of those primarily Southern jurisdictions you could pass a change but you had to submit it 90 days in advance to the justice department and they had to look at it and vet it before it could go into effect what the Supreme Court said in Shelby was not that pre-clearance was wrong the the Supreme Court just said you can't assume in 2013 what you assumed in 1965 that it's only these specific jurisdictions that are Bad actors that need to pre-clear and so Congress you need to come up with a pre-clearance formula about who needs to get pre-clearance that matches this moment not 1965. now there's a lot of argument about whether that Shelby decision was good or bad but I I could see some logic in it in this way I grew up in Kansas Kansas wasn't required to pre-clear and Virginia was in 2013 By 2013 it was easier for an African-American to vote in Virginia than Kansas it was easier for an African-American to get elected to office in Virginia than in Kansas and so some of the states that had required pre-clearance had made a a whole lot of progress in some of the states that hadn't had backslid so the Supreme Court said you can do pre-clearance you just have to fix the formula about who has to pre-clear so guess guess what we came up with now this is so even-handed and I give Bobby Scott Bobby Scott actually because it was his role at that point he was the you know key Democrat on the Judiciary Committee in the house he basically said you know what let's eliminate anything about the geography and just have one rule for every Community north south east west midwest if you had any voting rights violation in in the last 15 years then you have to seek pre-clearance but as soon as you're 15 years past any voting rights violation you don't have to seek pre-clearance so you might be a bad actor in Montana you weren't subject to pre-clearance originally but you're going to be subject to pre-clearance until you have a 15-year clean period and then you don't have to pre-clear until you commit another voting rights violation and then you'll go back into the the pre-clearance formula talk about even-handed I mean there's nothing more fair or straightforward than that you have to pre-clear if you've had a problem you don't have to pre-clear if you haven't had a problem we can only find one Republican who will vote for that bill in both houses I mean there's I don't know there's 230 Republicans or 250 Republicans out of the 535 in both houses we can only find one who will co-sponsor that even though Republicans before Obama would vote to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act all you know all the time the election of President Obama turned the Republican party from a promoting rights party beginning in the 1860s the 15th Amendment the 19th the Voting Rights Act in 1965 the 26th amendment 18 year olds could vote all of those were done with overwhelming Republican support some were done in Democratic administrations like the 19th wardrobe Wilson but that overwhelming Republican support 2006 reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act overwhelming Republican support it was only after the election of Barack Obama that the Republican Party turned from a pro-voting Rights Act party into a party that does not even want to discuss it much less supported much less co-sponsoring so the pre-clearance restoration piece of the John rossack it's as in my view non-controversial logical rational Fair way to do exactly what the Supreme Court said Congress should do and we can only find one Republican who will stand with us to support it thank you we'll go next to vote Carpenter it's great to be on with you Senator uh my question uh is more strategic um because you know more of the tone this conversation is this is a great Bill uh we should pass it most the the caucus is for it but it's probably going to fail what what can we do between now and when a vote is held to try to apply pressure to some of your colleagues uh to maybe sway their decision making or at least make them take a second look at uh why they are opposing the rules changes to pass his legislation though let me give you a sort of a little bit of a preliminary answer on that because what I would like to do and I may ask Corinne some of you see on the on the screen Tracy Tracy is my general counsel who works with me on all this voting rights work and she and Karen May strategize and get back to you a little bit on this I think Senator Schumer together with the national civil rights groups are meeting today to sort of plot out what's going to happen next week and here's what I expect's gonna happen I think you're going to see um different blocks of floor time taken on different issues so you know there will be a block of floor time under the big lie that animated the attack on January 6 there will be a block of floor time on here's what's happening in the 19 states there will be a block of floor time on here are the provisions of the bill one of the provisions is no secret money in campaigns every campaign contribution should be transparent so the public can know whose funding campaigns and we may want to do a block of floor time on that and I think what Senator Schumer and National groups will do is they'll they'll try to coordinate activities of national groups like the NAACP depending upon the blocks of floor time maybe we'll have activists here at the Capitol who want to talk about campaign Finance reform as we're talking about that or activists from the 19 states that have passed bad laws here talking about that when we're on the floor talking about it so I think the effort will be inside the chamber it'll be intense but there's going to be out of the chamber component some here in Washington but some social media some communities around the country and I think that strategy is being developed today and I wouldn't be surprised if and and I know Hillary Shelton and the folks at the NAACP in Washington are very involved in those discussions so I suspect NAACP will be putting out sort of thoughts about you know here's here's here's what would be helpful on which day next week I mean this will all begin Tuesday now the king family is doing activism this weekend the king family is doing a coordinated civil rights activity in Phoenix tomorrow interestingly enough when the King Family announced they were going to do civil rights rally in Phoenix tomorrow president Trump decided he wanted to go to Phoenix tomorrow to do something too so there will be some dueling activity but it's all going to draw attention to this issue and we've got to put everybody's attention on this issue the king family is going to be here Monday on MLK day doing an event on the Frederick Douglass Bridge so there will be activity in DC on Monday but I think there is going to be a coordinated strategy the NAACP is involved in that coordination will probably send out information uh quite promptly on that but but the other thing is anyone on this call if you just kind of brainstorm do you have contacts either in Arizona or or um West Virginia that could be helpful in reaching out to Senators Mansion or Cinema and again they're not enemies in the sense that they're against the bills they're co-sponsors of the bills so that's halfway we don't have to treat them like they're you know hairy Birds you know senior or something like that there you know their co-sponsors of these bills we and they've taken a big step with us to do that we just have to hopefully convince them to be willing to take a second step and so contacts that you would have in West Virginia and Arizona are are important so all we're going to take Just One Last Question from the public um and then we're gonna move to q a for the Press but if you do have questions Tracy is going to drop in her she did drop in her contact information I dropped in my contact information I'll do so again and we'll be happy to answer your other questions but the last question will go to um Reverend Bailey and I know there were others in the queue I'm so sorry time um ran out but we promised to get back to you on your questions uh thank you Korean good morning Senator Kane and all others who are here and uh readings from The Prince William branch of the NAACP uh Senator uh the the question I had was very much related to the one that my colleague uh Beau just uh asked and you answered and and so I want to Pivot just a little bit you know those the the tactics that that we are looking for for what we can do and you've uh alluded twice to uh reach out to possible contacts we have in either the state of West Virginia or the State of Arizona um what what I'm what I want to Pivot to is that as I look at the the party of opposition as uh you know forgive my phrasing as soulless ideologues and and I'm just curious you've been in the the Senate and we've been a part of putting you back there you know for for a couple of terms what is it that can crack through that particular stone wall for the party of opposition to those things that are of interest uh to NAACP and you know more acutely you know what makes them tick that would actually get to the heart of uh understanding the importance the humanity of fairness in both access you know I would I would comment and I'd never speak for my wife who was an elected official but I will say this is that at the local level here she has had some success in Reaching Across the aisle probably you know a c or a c plus because you know she reaches she she also faces that but she's been able to figure that out what is it in the Senate that could possibly work there sir and that we could you know assist you with cozy it's a really good question and you know that that would be the subject of a a complete hour-long Zoom to to really dig into it and answer it but but because now that I've been here nine years I work very closely with Republicans on the armed services committee on the Foreign Relations Committee on the health education labor pension committee you know we give you an example Mitch McConnell a couple years ago met and said you know what with this e-cigarette thing we should probably raise the tobacco age nationally from 18 to 21. and we're both from tobacco States so rather than let somebody from other states do it why don't we say let you and I do it and we worked on this bill it was in 20 I think it was in 2019 and we got it passed and the CDC set when it passed that 250 000 fewer people would die of lung cancer as a result we worked on that together and there are other examples we did an infrastructure Bill earlier this year there are items where we can work on together but in the months in the fall where we we all Democrats got on the bill and we were searching around to find Republican cooperation a a very senior Republican who I'm going to leave nameless for reasons you'll understand kind of gave me the facts of Lifetime and here's what she said she said here's what he or she said he or she said Mitch McConnell is a very effective leader of our party and one of the reasons he's affected is he gives us a lot of latitude he says follow your conscience I may not agree with you I may not support you I may vote against you but I'm not going to tell you don't follow your conscience except that I have two red lines and my two red lines are you cannot work with Democrats on voting rights and you cannot work Democrats on campaign Finance those are the only two red lines I have do whatever else you want well these two bills are both Crossing red lines uh complete disclosure campaign contributions and voting rights these are the two red lines that their leader has put up for them they they like the fact that he gives them latitude on everything else now just because he says I have a red line here doesn't mean that no one will ever cross it but under Senate rules we would have to get 10 Republicans to cross those red lines there's not 10 there's not five you know on a good day to cross a McConnell Red Line there might be two but there's just not going to be a critical mass to enable us to do this when we're on issues that aren't the red lines look if if we if we lose on voting rights we're not giving up on police reports reform there are things we can do together on them there's been a an obstacle around this issue of qualified immunity that has has thus far blocked a path forward but there are things that we agree on and uh you know I'm either gonna have my best day in my Senate career or my worst day while we're underway but whether I have my best day or my worst day on voting I'm still going to go to work the next day and try to find a path forward on things that I care a lot about things that matter a lot to the NAACP and I'm not not despairing of opportunities to find common cause it's just on this set of issues which is sadly you know the most important set of issues the most urgent in terms of where we are as a country right now it's only on this set of issues where we cannot realistically expect to find any assistance thank you so much for time today and um reach out to Tracy or Corinne and and there may even be guys there may even be a need to you know do a little bit of a status update at some point along the way once we're in the debate or there may be in response or Robert's questions as we get into the debate next week hey this would really be helpful and if that's the case you know we'll we'll be in dialogue about that all right thank you so much thank you very much Senator we do have press to have questions for you so the first press question um I know the Richmond Free Press had a question and then after after the Richmond request price could unmute themselves and ask their question hi Senator Kenneth Bonnie Winston the Richmond Free Press hi everybody else on the call thank you all as the NAACP and other people who are concerned about voting rights uh for fighting for these important um for this important issue um I think the big question is what else can we do as Virginians to try to push the ball in the right direction to get Senator manchin to get Senator um Cinema to get Mitch McConnell to stop this blockade I mean you've talked about it some but I think somebody on the chat had a very good point of having President Biden um to do a joint address of Congress um to stress the importance of this um it seemed from his the president's remarks yesterday that he had sort of given up um which was hard to take frankly um I think President Obama was a nice guy but he saw kind of late in his for years that he had to play hardball what can we do to play hardball I it seemed almost as though Biden felt that um things would be different because he'd been a member of the Senate for so long but but I think to most of us out here in the world we we know who that um that there's been a real backlash for so long uh so what can we do to help push things now um but Bonnie and it um you know I I think the combined way to President Biden's speech in Atlanta Monday and then to the caucus yesterday that that was strong but I will say when when the president of the United States says I want to come and talk to the caucus this is really important and it's on everybody's calendar but then before they even listen to him people are going out and basically saying yeah no matter what he says I'm still doing something else I I think respect for the office would have suggested that it would have been wise to at least listen to the president before taking a definitive position and I think I think that happened right before the president walked into the room and I think he was a little bit deflated by that I mean you know you can I always think about if I was the president you could like me or not like me personally I hope you would respect the office at least listen to what I have to say and remember this is a president who has been was in the center for 36 years I mean this is somebody who if you want to talk about what Senate rules are whether they changed it over time or how important they are I mean not since LBJ if we had a president who understands the senate in the United States better than Joe Biden so I think that that was that was tough yesterday to to find that people had staked out definitive positions apparently before they were even willing to listen to them um but the the option of a joint address to Congress is there um I I do think the the ability to get any Republican votes is virtually Dale again there is one exception of the Lisa murkowski on the Lewis bill and that that there's a door open there although she hasn't been supportive of the freedom to vote act and we now have merged those into one bill so I do really think this is very focused on the the the two Democratic senators and again focusing on them with the beginning point that they are co-sponsors of bill so you're not having to convince them that the bills are a good thing or that they're needed you have to we have to convince them that which have been changed over time it's not uncommon for example for Joe manchin to talk about Robert Byrd who was the majority leader of the Senate longest serving U.S senator Robert Byrd changed over time he was a klansman Robert Byrd was a klansman in the 1940s Robert led the filibuster to the Civil Rights Act of 1964. he gave a 14 hour and 13-minute speech on the floor of the senate in 1964 to filibuster against the Civil Rights Act of 1964. he helped lead the filibuster against the Civil Rights Act of 1965. but then he rethought his position he voted for the fair housing act in 1968 he then became a civil rights Champion progressively between 1968 and when he died in the senate in 2010 and President Obama said about Robert Byrd when he died that he was a man with the courage of his convictions including the courage to change his opinion over time changing your opinion takes courage changing your opinion takes courage and Robert Byrd was willing to do it and Bonnie I I'm struck by the difference between Robert Byrd and the two Harry Birds I occupy the seat in the Senate that was occupied by Harry Byrd senior and Harry Byrd Jr from 1933 to 1983. and they weren't klansmen but they were just like Robert Byrd in their in their voting records in the Senate on civil rights issues except that they never evolved they never change their mind they never apologized they never became champions for civil rights as a result around this place we still talk about Robert Byrd but in Virginia you know the hairy bird middle school and Henrico has been changed to the quiacas in middle school and the Harry Bird School of Business at Shenandoah University they've taken harrybert Jr's name off that even in his hometown and the Harry bird statue on Capitol square has been taken down none of us are perfect I mean we can all have viewpoints that are wrong and if we have courage and pay attention to the world we can change our minds and um and so I'm thinking exactly about that occupying the the emergency in the Senate that was used to filibuster civil rights legislation often during the 1950s and the 1960s and I think you know advocacy for Senators mansion and Cinema that we really appreciate your support for these voting rights bills but just being co-sponsors and allowing them to fall short and allowing people to be victimized by schemes designed to reduce their participation you know we need you to go farther than just being co-sponsors um I I acknowledge that a Richmond newspaper you know I might not have the the you know the direct line into to persuade a a West Virginia or a Arizona senator but you know as as Doug Wilder used to always say when the thing is right the time is right and the Fang is right so making the making the point to the best of your ability and then all those who do have contacts in in West Virginia Arizona saying thank you for co-sponsoring these bills go the final mile with us other questions from the Press uh good morning Senator Kane this is Alex Scribner I am from Dogwood news um I just wanted to throw out that I love uh my heart I I love seeing uh I love seeing all of these uh women running Virginia because our papers devoted to uh voting and women so I'm just loving all of this anyway um as we know like funding uh can affect a broad swath of things for example on the transportation funding that's coming in could potentially help the uh get the Roanoke County Citizens out to visit potentially to go vote and stuff like that so basically my question is you talked about uh working across the aisle and that sort of thing what do you see your role as in um the state government and helping uh the federal funding get to those in need and not quote undo the process as we have a republican-led executive and a split General Assembly but it's a great question it's interesting to have passed this transformative infrastructure investment it's just going to bring billions and billions of dollars to Virginia for Road public transit rail airport Port Broadband power grid offshore wind and a republican Governor is going to get to do you know most of the the ground breakings and ribbon cuttings but that's okay it's going to help it's going to help Virginians now most of these dollars um go from the federal level to the kind of appropriate state agency so like the Road and Bridge money goes to the Commonwealth Transportation board that is a board that has your you know a project list already they're going to get vastly more dollars than they've been used to and so they'll either be able to do many more of their projects that they have on the current was faster or be able to think of new projects and and we included in the allowable uses of funds things like you know rail to Trail and bicycle trails I mean we we put broad so that states and cities counties could have real flexibility to use them the best way possible so I think I think the key for any Virginia activist who wants to make sure that the transportation dollars are used for the right projects or that the right you know that that people have an opportunity to get hired to work on these projects maybe from communities who have traditionally not been you know working on these high-paying infrastructure jobs I think the key will be interaction with the new governor with the with the new secretary of Transportation uh with the Commonwealth Transportation board while the while the governor and cabinet secretary are you know part of the new Republican Administration the Commonwealth Transportation board doesn't just expire those boards stay in place and cycle in you know there's a few people each year that either get reappointed or stay so there will be continuity from the Northam Transportation board that will last for some period of time and and getting in and making the case for good projects and for making sure that the work that's being done people that there's Fair access to that work Fair access to the contracts um that would be the way it should be done thank you everyone the senator does have another event to attend but once again thank you and if you have any more press questions you could direct them to Ill say and she will um get any responses that you need and for other public questions you can direct them to me thank everybody have a great day thank you guys take care

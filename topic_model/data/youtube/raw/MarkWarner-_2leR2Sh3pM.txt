THOMAS-GREENFIELD, REALLY  APPRECIATE YOU COMING ON AND  SHARING THE ADMINISTRATION'S  PERSPECTIVE. LET'S HOPE THIS WORKS. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, CHUCK. >>> WE HAVE SENATOR MARK WARNER  AND SENATOR ROB PORTMAN. THEY SIT ON THE RELATIONS  CMMITTEE. THEY TRAVELED TOGETHER LAST  WEEK. GENTLEMEN, WELCOME TO "MEET THE  PRESS." WE HAVE SOME NEWS THAT HAS  TRICKLED OUT IN THE LAST FEW  MINUTES. PRESIDENT PUTIN HAS AGREED TO  MEET WITH A RUSSIAN DELEGATION  ON THE BORDER OF UKRAINE IN  BELARUS. OBVIOUSLY WE'LL ALWAYS DEPLOY  DIPLOMACY IF DIPLOMACY CAN WORK  HERE. ANY ADVICE TO HOW WE CAN MANAGE  THESE NEGOTIATIONS? >> I THINK UKRANIANS KNOW HOW TO DO IT, AND THEY ALSO KNOW TO BE  DISTRUSTFUL OF ANYTHING RUSSIA  SAYS SINCE IT'S BEEN PROPAGANDA, DISINFORMATION. BY THE WAY, BELARUS IS WHERE  THEY WANTED TO HAVE THE MEETING, AND BELARUS IS FIGHTING THE  ATTACK ALONG WITH UKRAINE. THIS IS SOMETHING WHERE THE  AMERICAN PEOPLE A STANDING  FIRMLY WITH UKRAINE. THERE ARE OVER 40 RALLIES AROUND THE COUNTRY TODAY IN SUPPORT OF  UKRAINE. I'LL BE AT ONE IN CLEVELAND,  OHIO THIS AFTERNOON. BUT AROUND THE WORLD YOU SEE  THIS, INCLUDING IN RUSSIA. THE WORLD IS STANDING UP AND I  HAVE NOT SEEN THIS SINCE 9/11. IN THE END, THIS WILL BE  HELPFUL. WE HAVE TO TIGHTEN UP THESE  SANCTIONS FURTHER. IN YOUR CONVERSATION WITH THE  AMBASSADOR, TOUGH SANCTIONS WERE NOT PUT IN PLACE. WE SHOULD HAVE AND COULD HAVE  DONE MORE, AND A LOT OF US WERE  CALLING FOR THAT. WE ARE WHERE WE ARE NOW, BUT WE  ALSO NEED TO PUT ALL RUSSIAN  BANKS UNDER THIS SWIFT BAND. >> VLADIMIR PUTIN HAS ORDERED  HIS RUSSIAN NUCLEAR DETERRENCE  FORCES ON ALERT. HOW SHOULD THE UNITED STATES  RESPOND  THAT? >> FIRST OF ALL, THE UNITED  STATES RESPONSE HAS BEEN  STRONGER BECAUSE WE'VE ACTUALLY  BROUGHT ALL OF OUR EUROPEAN AND  OTHER ALLIES ALONG WITH US. ROB AND I WERE IN MUNICH LAST  WEEK. THE EUROPEANS WERE BELIEVING AND MOSTLY IN BUT NOT FULLY IN. LOOK WHAT'S HAPPENED OVER THE  LAST FEW DAYS. WE'VE GOT NORD STREAM 2  SANCTIONS. WE PERSONALLY SANCTIONED PUTIN. HE NOW JOINS GADHAFI AND ASSAGE  WITH SANCTIONS. AND YOU'RE SEEING EVEN FORMER  RUSSIAN ALLIES LIKE KAZAK SKAZA. HE'S NOT DONE EVERYTHING, HE'S  NOT THROWN THE CYBERATTACKS LIKE WE EXPECTED. WHAT HE'S ALSO BEEN ABLE TO DO  ISIS UNIFY THE VAST MAJORITY OFS AND THE SENATE, DEMOCRATS AND  REPUBLICANS ALONG WITH NATO AND  HE'S GOING TO PAY THE PRICE. >> MARCO RUBIO THE OTHER NIGHT  SAID, I WISH I COULD SHARE MORE. IT'S EVIDENT THAT SOMETHING IS  OFF WITH PUTIN. HE'S ALWAYS BEEN A KILLER, BUT  IT'S BEEN A MISTAKE TO THINK  THAT PUTIN RADIO REACT THE SAME  WAY HE WOULD FIVE YEARS AGO. WHAT DO OUR INTELLIGENCE FOLKS  TELL YOU? >> CHUCK, AS A MEMBER OF THE  INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE, I'M NOT  GOING TO COMMENT ON THE SPECIFIC INTELLIGENCE. BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS, PUTIN HAS BEEN MORE AND MORE ISOLATED. HE'S NOT BEEN IN THE KREMLIN FOR THE MOST PART, HE'S BEEN DOWN IN HIS PLACE IN SOCHI OR HIS DOCK  OUTSIDE OF MOSCOW. WHEN YOU ARE AN AUTHORITARIAN  LEADER AND YOU HAVE LESS AND  LESS INPUTS AND YOUONLY WTT TO SAY TO THE BOSS, YOU'RE RIGHT, I THINK THAT LEADS TO  MISCALCULATION. I THINK THAT IS WHAT HAS  HAPPENED IN THE INVASION IN  UKRAINE. >> SENATOR PORTMAN, HE WENT INTO UKRAINE. HE DID NOT GO INTO LATVIA  LITHUANIAOORRESPOND -- OR  ESTONIA. SHOULD WE HAVE BROUGHT THEM INTO THE NATO ALLIANCE? >> EVEN NOW, CHUCK, WE SHOULD BE OFFERING UKRAINE AND OTHER  COUNTRIES WHO WANT TO COME  FORWARD. JORDAN IS ONE. I'M TOLD SWEDEN AND TWO OTHERS  AT SOME POINT. THERE IS A ROAD MAP TO GET INTO  NATO. MANY OF US HAVE BEEN CALLING FOR NATO TO ALLOW UKRAINE TO GO DOWN THAT PATH. WE SHOULD HAVE DONE IT. IF WE HAD DONE IT, I DON'T THINK WE WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE  SITUATION WE'RE IN NOW. OTHER PEOPLE SAID THE OPPOSITE. THEY SAID, WELL, IF WE ALLOW  THEM INTO NATO, TS WILLAKAKE  RUSSIA MAD. WELL, HERE THEY ARE WITH THIS  ATROCITY IN UKRAINE, KILLING  HUNDREDS OF UKRANIANS, WOUNDING  THOUSANDS OF THEM. UNPRECEDENTED SINCE WORLD WAR II TO HAVE ANOTHER COUNTRY INVADE  ANOTHER'S BORDERS. IF THEY WERE IN NATO, I DON'T  THINK HE WOULD BE DOING IT. PUTIN MISCALCULATED. HE THOUGHT THIS WOULD DIVIDE  NATO. IN FACT, IT HAS STRENGTHENED  NATO AND BROUGHT US TOGETHER IN  A WAY WE HAVEN'T SEEN FOR YEARS. >> WAS IT A MISTAKE FOR  PRESIDENT BIDEN TO RULE OUT AN  TRIPS TO UKRAINE FOR THAT  REGION? WE ALWAYS HAD A POLICY OF  STRATEGIC AMBIGUITY WHEN IT  COMES TO IRAN. SHOULD WE HAVE DONE THIS HERE? >> I DON'T THINK AMERICA WOULD  HAVE WANTED UKRANIAN TROOPS ON  THE GROUND. NATO A YEAR AGO WAS BROKEN UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP. THE NATO NATIONS WERE NOT FULLY  BOUGHT INTO THIS THREAT. THEY ARE FULLY BOUGHT IN AT THIS POINT, AND I THINK YOU'RE GOING  TO SEE -- I STILL WORRY ABOUT,  FOR EXAMPLE, IF PUTIN SHUTS DOWN THE POWER IN UKRAINE, DOES THAT  SHUT DOWN THE POWER THERE AS  WELL? >> WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT A  CYBERATTACK? >> CYBERATTACK IS PART OF  AMBIGUITY. IF YOU SEE PEOPLE DIE BECAUSE  THE HOSPITALS GO DOWN, YOU ARE  RAPIDLY APPROACHING AN ARTICLE 5 VIOLATION. >> ARE YOU OPEN TO NATO  EXPANSION? >> I'M OPEN TO IT. THAT ALSO HAS TO BE DONE IN  CONCERT WITH ALL 30 NATO  NATIONS. FRANKLY, NATO WAS RIGHT BY NOT,  DURING PUTIN'S PRESSURE  CAMPAIGN, BY SAYING WE SHOULD  TAKE AWAY THAT RIGHT TO HAVE  UKRAINE JOIN NATO. >> SENATOR PORTMAN, I'M GOING TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT FOR ONE QUICK SUBJECT. THERE IS A SUPREME COURT  NOMINEE. WHAT WOULD IT TAKE FOR YOU TO  VOTE TOR)? CONFIRM HER, SENATOR  PORTMAN? >> I'M GOING TO LOOK AT HER  RECORD AND LOOK AT HER  QUALIFICATIONS AS I THINK PEOPLE WILL IN THIS CASE. I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE AS  PARTISN AS WE'VE SEEN IN THE  PAST, FOR EXAMPLE, AS IT WAS  WITH JUDGE KAVANAUGH WHEN HE WAS NOMINATED. AS YOU KNOW, SHE'LL BE REPLACING ANOTHER LIBERAL IN THE COURT. I THINK THE REST OF US ON THE  REPUBLICAN SIDE WILL BE LOOKING  AT HER RECORD, LOOKING AT HER  QUALIFICATIONS. WE DON'T BELIEVE WE NEED TO  LEGISLATE FROM THE BENCH. WE BELIEVE WE WILL BE FOLLOWING  THE RIGHTS AND THE CONSTITUTION, AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING  FOR. >> SENATOR WARNER AND SENATOR  PORTMAN. KORI -- I ASSUME YOU'RE WITH  HER, SENATOR WARNER? >> BILL AND KORI WILL REQUIRE,  WHEN IT TAKES PLACE, YOU WANT TO MAKE IS STRONGER AND SAFER,  LET'S LOOK AT IT NEXT

subcommittee miss Baldwin the gentlelady from Wisconsin is recognized for two minutes thank you madam Speaker notably absent from the Republican agenda this year are the issues that the American people really care about creating jobs and growing our economy just when we should be pulling together to work on these issues instead Republicans have put forth divisive and extreme legislation that takes away women's ability to make their own important life decisions about their reproductive health this extremist legislation is an unprecedented display of lack of respect for American women and our safety the effect of this bill would be to cut off millions of women from the private care they already have and limit the ability of a woman to get the care she needs even if the result is a serious permanent health condition that could shorten her life so we know no the Republicans real agenda to roll back women's health and rights they have shown their true colors by trying to weaken rape and incest exceptions for abortions it's hard to believe but a majority of the republican house members co-sponsored legislation to give insurance company new authority to decide if a woman had been raped and to deny care to incest victims thanks to the American women who spoke out this dangerous provision was dropped but I think it raises an important question if Republicans are willing to redefine what constitutes rape and incest what are they going to try next enough is enough it is time for the Republican majority to respect women's important life decisions and it is that they start to stand and start to refocus on the priorities of this country right now jobs and growing the economy I urge my colleagues to oppose this extreme and intrusive legislation and I yield back the balance of my time the gentleman reserves the gentleman from Pennsylvania madam Speaker before

how does congressman Don Young feel about Mark Begich taking credit in his ads for Alaska projects well I think you know anybody who serves in a higher office ought to be able to tell what they've really done you know I served with Ted Stevens for forty some odd years and we always did it together we we we we not III when you start saying IIIi think people ought to start looking at then why is someone taking credit for some things he did not do that's what I'm thinking about I think we ought to think as this is a team effort and consequently I don't appreciate the ads that are being run on his behalf right now the road yeah you know let's look at it the Ninus there now the merrill field nine on think so i think that was a a state project i can go on down the line don't take credit for something you did not do and when we do something together say we did it i think it'd be a lot better

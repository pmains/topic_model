mr alice you were ceo of celgene until fairly recently and as my colleague ms presley established celgene makes revlimid a cancer drug do you know what the price of revlimid was when it first hit the market in 2005. i i don't remember the number but it was uh reclaiming my time it was 215 for one pill do you know what the price of revlim was in 2013 i can look it up but i don't recall i don't have it in front of me 412 per pill how about the price let's get into more recent where your memory may be jogged how about 2017. i would say approximately 700 a pill but i again i don't have it in front of me 719 per pill and today revlimid is cost 763 dollars per pill i'm curious did the drug get substantially more effective in that time did cancer patients need fewer pills during that time the uh development of revlimid included six additional indications uh some in lymphoma and the balance in uh patients with different types oh great i i want to be reclaiming my time so mr ellis you discovered more patients who might benefit from paying 763 dollars a pill but being able to use a drug for more patients doesn't necessarily more price is there did the drugs start to work faster were there fewer side effects how did you change the formula or production of revlimid to justify this price increase the indication changes are for subsets of different patients with disease reclaiming my time mr ellis i understand that what i'm trying to understand from you is how did the drug improve if i were to look at a pill and analyze it from 2005 when it cost 215 and i was looked today at when it cost 763 would that pill be the same i understand your question about the pill the pill the manufacturing for it would be the same great thank you so to put that in perspective you hiked the price by 500 when the average orange county senior only has 528 dollars left in their bank account after they've paid their basic monthly expenses the average orange county senior can't even afford one pill and you said recently that nobody pays the list price but that is not correct do uninsured patients sometimes pay the list price i can imagine there are circumstances where underinsured or uninsured patients would be paying close to or at the list price i i don't know of any specific circumstances but i'm reclaiming my time mr hollis i i want to turn to one other number if you would you would help me um do you know what this number is i does it ring any bells i i think you're referring to my compensation in some way yo in some way this was your compensation in 2017 for being ceo of celgene and that's a lot of money it's 200 times the average american's income and 360 times what the average senior gets on social security now of that 13 million about 2.1 million came from your company hitting yearly earning targets and more than half of the bonus formula was based on those targets any increase in the price of revlimid would also increase your bonus by increasing earnings isn't that right mr ellis if revenues increased and expenses did not then earnings would be enhanced thank you mr ellis in fact the oversight committee found that if you hadn't increased the price of revlimid you wouldn't have gotten your bonus mr ellis do you know how much you personally received in bonuses over two years the last two years just because celgene raised the price of this one drug revlimiding i receive very generous compensation but i don't know the exact number that you're referring to in fact you personally received half of them half a million dollars personally just by tripling the price of revlimid so to recap here the drug didn't get any better the cancer patients didn't get any better you just got better at making money you just refined your skills at price gouging and to be clear the taxpayers spent 3.3 billion on revlimid 3.3 medicare 3.3 billion

welcome back to Morning Joe at 22 paths the our live look at the white house lights are on joining us now Democratic senator from Virginia Senator Mark Warner should we'd be nice to him today very nice sir okay we're not gonna we're not going back today we're not gonna get special about to now there's a statue of limitations yeah I think it's a we forgiven you and there's a statute of limitations on calling him out okay the Republican senator from Georgia is here as well senator saxby chambliss both were members of the so-called Gang of Six which recently briefed the debt super committee on their ideas to reduce the deficit because you know that super committee is just going to nail it oh no doubt about it really come together and make it happen so Saxby let's start with what's most important to your constituents that is the fact that the bulldogs finally be a Florida Gator this weekend and I was right there in the middle of where I tweaking the world's largest cocktail party world's largest outdoor cocktail party we work hard up hole at tradition but you you you did and congratulate and you will be pulling for alabama this weekend against LSU right i'm gonna sit back and watch connect every one heck of a football that is all it really is go bigger it sooner warner since you don't play football in virginia let's go and just talk about the budget I'm joking you've got some good teams there so what is the possibility the supercommittee actually doing something and that makes a difference well I think the chances are actually improving I mean if last week you started to see some them offers go back and forth we've now built our group from the so-called Gang of Six to where we've got 45 senators saying to the supercommittee you go big find three trillion dollars in debt reduction well balanced and you know make revenue through tax reform entitlement reform we say we got your back there's now about a hundred House members almost equally divided the business community starting to weigh in I mean let's face it this debt battle has almost become proxy for whether our democratic institutions are up to the job and I think it's really important we get er done it's axeswy you guys are on the inside but for those of us on the outside just looking for for clues I really liked what I heard last week coming from Nancy Pelosi and John Boehner both of them sounded like they were in a giving mood then you know Nancy will usually say no you're not going to touch Social Security Medicare but last week she was like he's going to be on the table we've got to compromise John Boehner said the same thing well reason to be hopeful the fact of the matter is you can't do this with just reducing spending you can't do it with just reforming entitlements and you can't do it just on the revenue side it takes a combination of all three and the more you're involved in it like Pelosi and Boehner had been over the last several weeks the more you realize that so I'm encouraged by what I heard from them I mean these guys have still got a long ways to go on that super committee but they've got power like no committee we've ever seen before I mean they can bypass tell you know I had worked you had to go through the regular order to get something done they can bypass the regular or they've got the power to do that and what we're asking them to do is to go to four trillion over ten years now that's that's pretty good but you have to remember the last three years we've had deficits annually of 1.6 1.5 and probably one point I was going to say five years ago so trillion dollars would be course changing yeah in this case meek it really only stops the bleeding yeah we're going to come back do it and you look at 14 and a half trillion oh we gotta go start driving that debt to GDP ratio into manageable T so if you're looking at four trillion over 10 years these are obviously very hard times and I would think some would even prognosticate that it could get worse before it gets better and it's going to be a long time before unemployment improves what kinds of ways of bringing in revenue will this super committee be able to agree upon actually have both sides agree upon that will be significant enough to also help reboot the economy one of the things that we did was we basically took our effort and built it off a bowles-simpson which was not about raising tax rates was actually in most cases lowering tax rates but taking a lot of the tax expenditures down dramatically simplifying the tax code and we raised a trillion dollars a year in in tax we spend about 1.1 trillion dollars a year in income tax exemptions you can cut everybody tact everybody's taxes in half and actually raise more revenue if you're willing to get rid of all the tax expenditures tax breaks we're not suggesting you do all that but there's a lot of headroom there to be able to generate revenues yes and I in on that room and on the corporate side what we did was we made at revenue neutral but we eliminate again expenditures and credits from corporations who and take that savings from corporations and reduce the rates to historic lows and what corporate CEOs have told us is that you give a certainty in the tax code and we'll take this money that we've got sitting is cash today on our balance sheets and we'll invest it in our companies will create jobs will put people back to work and create jobs for these folks around here protesting today and we will see economic growth like you can never imagine in this country if we will truly reformed the code like frankly we proposed China Helmand I wanna ask you guys a question about about President Obama two related questions one as we go forward right now is there a more constructive role the president can play in this process I know it's in the hands of Congress at this moment but is should he just stay on the sidelines or should he be saying things about this and try to help number one and number two historical question which is just a yes or no was it a huge mistake for him not to endorse simpson-bowles back last December I think without question he he appointed that commission it was his ball game to play in and he should have endorsed it if he'd really felt it in his heart that that was the right direction to go and looking back at it now I got to believe his folks are telling him while we missed an opportunity should he be involved right now hey he is the chief executive of the United States and we're not going to solve this without the involvement of the chief executive now it's up to him politically and otherwise as to what role he decides to play but Congress has ultimately got to make the decision and the ball really is in our court mark and I would simply say when we came out with our gang of six plan he endorsed it that helped in some corners it hurt and others I do think I wish you would have spent those first three months of this year I'm just educating the American people and and all of us about some of these choices some of this is just math in terms of some of the entitlement programs the fact that with some of this on revenues at 70 year low revenue are expending expenditures an all-time high you know twenty five percent versus fifteen percent and whenever there's been a balanced budget we've been around twenty percent on both spending and revenues and this is just logic and you know the one thing you'll be able to see if they're really getting close is if you start seeing the interest groups on both sides start squawkin going that'll be the best indication around if the super committee is getting close to a so sexy you and I came in 94 long with a guy named Tom Coburn Tom and you were both conservative but very different in your approaches tom was with me while we were making small explosives and throwing them at the leadership you tried to work inside the system and yet you and Tom Coburn have both taken what I consider to be a courageous stand and that is to say to our base what you just said we're not going to do this without cutting entitlements cutting spending and generating more revenue and doing that by closing tax loopholes what has been the response in Georgia what's been the response from conservative special interest groups in Washington what's how much pain has it caused you politically they say what time cop√°n was that well obviously you've got folks on the on the right who don't like any change in the tax code unless it's just purely reducing taxes we are reducing tax rates and we're going to stimulate the economy by dunes people did not understand what bowl Simpson did therefore they didn't understand what we were doing in adopting the basic philosophy of boats but your goal is so in more revenue to the federal Gary wasn't Lupo we've got to hear and here's why it's not rocket science based on the year ending September 30 2010 spending relative to GDP was at twenty-five percent revenue relative to GDP he was at 14.5 percent that's a ten and a half percent yeah there that's why you had one and a half trillion dollar deficit that year we've got to close that historically we've had revenues at about eighteen percent spending in about nineteen percent we've been able to manage that one percent deficit and that's why our our debt rose every year but it rose only slightly now we have simply got to get spending down there's no question about it but by the same token you got to get revenues God science to be doing both gentlemen thank you very much Thanks like I charter water and senator chambliss coming up is that

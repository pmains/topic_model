I rise to stand with the Standing Rock Sioux in peace and prayer to halt the desecration of their sacred sites and clean water source this month an independent review concluded that the US Army Corps of Engineers original assessment of the pipeline underestimated the risk of a spill exposing tribal lands to grave risk just this week the Corps announced they will delay an easement for construction of the pipeline encore land under and around Lake Waukee until they conduct further environmental reviews with the Standing Rock Sioux tribe further study and a possible rear out of the pipeline is a welcome the idea but construction continues and there has been no final decision that could conclusively halt the pipeline and protect tribal sacred sites this could be devastating the government must take action to uphold our federal trust responsibility to protect tribal treaties land and resources they must meaningful consult to the truck with the Standing Rock Sioux and all tribes before developing on their or near tribal land they must rescind their permit that was issued without full understanding of potential messiahs and must stop construction are you

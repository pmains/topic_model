the Speaker I rise today to make clear that the dangers of a partisan farm bill that we are considering in the House Agriculture Committee this week bipartisanship is not simply a buzzword bipartisanship is vital for policies to serve the widest range of Americans sadly it's in short supply these days in our Capitol the House Agriculture Committee has for over 40 years traditionally been a very bipartisan committee because our nation's food supply affects everyone rich and poor food farmers and consumers Democrats and Republicans alike our farm bill is America's food bill and it needs to be about feeding all of us I always say it's really a matter of our national security you have the bill we are considering this week is without question a partisan farm bill we see this and how it fails to serve key parts of our nation and abandons many of their food security a partisan farm bills bad policy plain and simple it will not succeed legislatively nor can it be implemented successfully I ask that we put aside these partisan differences do as we've done traditionally and work together to pass a bipartisan farm bill in the house and in the Senate that the president could sign I yield back the balance of my time

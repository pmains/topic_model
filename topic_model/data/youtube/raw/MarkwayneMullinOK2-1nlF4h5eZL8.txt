thank you madam chair um i'm gonna try to be pretty quick here we've been talking about section 230 and the protection that um you know the that these companies seem to seem to hide behind and some of the abuse and and i'm just i'm not trying to play politics here i'm just bringing up you know what has happened just in the last week and underneath section 230 you know it's supposed to be the town square where you can post anything and no one's held responsible for it and and in those parameters you know obviously you can't make a direct threat or a death threat at somebody or or and and these platforms it took a little bit further to show extremist views um but they're they're becoming they're becoming political platforms and we know this and so this is kind of what i wanted to bring about miss frederick as you know google recently prohibited abortion pill reversal advertisement that was supported by pro-life organizations then they turned around and allowed advertisement to continue for medication assisted abortion pills to support pro-life or pro-abortion groups uh when we started talking about section 230 was section 230 was this what it was designed for uh to to limit someone's ability to to voice their opinion uh and allow somebody to to say that it is or isn't i mean we have uh i mean this is what this is what this country does we have opposite views and we have opposite views we air them out we talk about it but completely eliminating one person's view and and just putting stuff that you agree with that doesn't fall within section 230 does it miss federer not at all and this is why the fcc chairman brendan carr says that section 230 right now amounts to a regulatory legal advantage for one set of political actors and we see the disparity between what big tech companies censor coming from the right and then what uh they censor that maybe uh cleaves to a leftist narrative that they approve of if you look at the hypocrisy it's rampant as we talked about just in the national security space iranian officials north korean officials ccp spokespeople uh the taliban all of these people are free to say what they want on these tech companies usually it's a vociferous or even an obstreperous right who says what is going on here this hypocrisy it can't stand and then they maybe think about it they maybe say this is human error and uh redress those issues but but that doesn't happen often and it doesn't happen unless we talk very seriously or at least flag these issues so this is not what section 230 was created for we need to realign it with congress's original intent but it's it's being abused right now i couldn't agree with more i agree with you more on that so with that i yield back thank you

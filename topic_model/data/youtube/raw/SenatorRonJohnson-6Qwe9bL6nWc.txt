can you share any of it with us I mean what have you uncovered if you uncovered anything else has you've been sifting through all of this well as a matter of fact I came into the office today our investigators were working late last night and there are a couple of interesting emails one was November 14 2016 right after the election where Lisa page Tex Stratton says God being here makes me angry lots of highfalutin national security talk meanwhile we have our task ahead of us now our is capitalized I mean are they talking about implementing their plan so that that's in November and then on May 19th again we've got a big gap five-month gap and now the texts begin again this is two days after Mueller Mueller was just appoint a special counsel strike rights they're talking back and forth about their futures the FBI and the recent appointment and Moeller no talking about you know what what they ought to do and it indicates that they're considering joining that Mueller Special Counsel investigations track says quote you and I both know the odds are nothing if I thought it was likely I'd be there no question I hesitate in part because of my gut sense and concern there's no big there there Wow in other words Peter strike who was the FBI deputy assistant director of the counterintelligence division the man who had a plan to do something because he just couldn't abide down from being president he's saying that his gut sense is if there's no big there there when it comes to the Mueller Special Counsel investigation doesn't nobody really wants to join that because he's got senses there's no big there there I think that's kind of jaw drop I would say that's jaw dropping I would say that's pretty huge this is a guy who as you suggest sort of knew the inside of all this and boy that that's really something I'm not quite sure how to react to that the correct reaction is we need to see the five months of missing text because who knows again these are texts between two people holding out the extramarital affair and they are completely unguarded in in their communication and so weird getting an insight to exactly what's happening inside the FBI at the highest levels and who knows who else they may implicate in terms of corruption and could you read again the passage what what has what Peter stocks message there was couple of days after its announcement are going to put together this team again they're wondering we think they're probably considering whether or not they want to join that team in strike says quote you and I both know the odds are nothing if I thought it was likely I'd be there no question I have stayed in part because of my gut sense and concern there's no big there there hmm that seems to be him clearly suggesting there's no reason we should be chasing down this whole Trump Rush occlusion thing and look at what this nation's been put through as results yeah okay I mean we have serious problems and here you've got remember the FBI winding implement a plan and in his gut you guys try nothing there well let's do it anyway and the earlier and then then there's again the earlier reference to our plan this earlier that this this connects with something that he got in the first batch of emails a suggestion that there was some there needed had to be some sort of back-up plan to deal with a president Trump or a trump presidency can't really connect a hundred percent that's why we need to see more of these texts but again meanwhile we have our task ahead of us this is you know six days after the election we have our tasks capitalized our task ahead of us do the same two they're talking about they've got a plan well there was also some vague reference 9 I don't you don't read too much into this this one but it's a they were calling they were referencing a secret society and no one really knows how serious that is what is that some drinking club after work but you also have to get more texts and more emails to put more of this in context and possibly more texts and emails from more than just two people yeah wow that's really something and so you have now if if we had President Obama still in office and you know Loretta Lynch is the head of this DOJ there's no way we would ever find this material we never see the sex we never go anywhere yeah we never we would not have these texts yet no you wouldn't have ever gotten them no we have I think that's that's part of the corruption we're talking about within you know the high/low did the FBI possibly Department of Justice it's just it's just hard to tell yeah but I mean obviously these are these are these are partisans you know hard partisans in these agencies and they're there they're carrying out a political agenda it looks like to me yeah and it speaks to the need of a housecleaning already but with Jeff Sessions in charge now there's a better possibility that we are going to be able to launch a legitimate effort to find more information find some of these lost texts and emails there the other thing about struck and in-page they seem to be texting and e-mailing across several platforms using several phones using several email accounts and and and they they're personally it seems like evading you know putting some of these work-related messages on a platform that is untraceable right I mean you know there's indications of being they were gonna communicate things that couldn't betray us so they're probably again that they can't do that that's just not proper this this is my committee serious

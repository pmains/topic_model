Mr Speaker I rise today in strong support of HR 3 the spending cuts to expired and unnecessary programs Act we must always be careful stewards of the taxpayers hard-earned money that's why I was proud to sign on as an original co-sponsor of president Trump's rescission package as a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee I understand more than most that president Trump's proposal rescinding nearly 15 billion dollars is necessary it's common sense that money sitting in federal coffers and not being spent should be returned to the Treasury this bill is a welcome step to cut wasteful spending and restore fiscal sanity to Washington and portent Lee the recisions package on the floor today no longer rescind abella funding sadly that horrible disease has recently returned to the Democrat puppet Republic of Congo is also no longer rescinds funding for hurricane sandy victims I hope the Senate will pass this bill as soon as possible so the president could sign these historic spending cuts into law and I urge all members to support this common-sense proposal Thank You ty yield back the balance of my time

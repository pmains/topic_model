I'm an engineer by training I like science I believe in innovation I understand that our futures is based on innovation if I think about the last hundred years of innovation in medicine insulin was first used in 1921 in 1928 Fleming discovered penicillin starting a revolution leading the golden age of antibiotics in the 1940s 50s and early 1960s that brought us an extension of life expectancies because infections no longer were a death sentence beginning the 1940s with the first hip replacement was a revolution of biomechanics today the most frequent replacement is hips and knees and what we see is that a broken hip is no longer a sentence to immobility in early death but a bump along the way and uh not it not a prevention for a full and active lifestyle the first monoclonal antibody was approved by the FDA in 1986 opened the door for this next revolution of personalized therapies and in 1990 the first FDA approval of NIH studied invented gene therapy was made sitting here in 2019 we are truly on the cusp of a new frontier in medicine with individualized personalized therapies and cures just on the horizon but and I will start here I'll go here where my colleague from Georgia mr. Lewis started healthcare is a fundamental right it can't be an exclusive privilege of only those who can afford it innovation that is a breakthrough but inaccessible because of its cost is not truly innovation mr. chairman for too long our constituents have suffered from unreasonable and often unjustifiably high cost of prescription drugs last week in our hearing on this bill I told the story of mr. MS jodean Epps Ted a constituent of mine from Zion that despite having drug coverage through Medicare Advantage is rationing her insulin again a drug that was invented in 1921 she is forced to ration her insulin as she waits for her next disability paycheck even though her case is exceptional in many ways Jody sadly is not an exception three in ten adults reported not taking their medicines as prescribed at some point in the past year simply because of the cost Americans are paying four to seven times the multiple supported seven times as much for the same prescription that might be sold in other countries we are the innovation engine of the world in the United States but we're also paying multiples of other nations that's simply not fair something is broken and when a market has failed it is incumbent upon the government to step in and fix it no one on either side of the aisle wants to stifle innovation that is clear there are some truly amazing treatments that are on the horizon but not on the market today but there are others that have already made it to the market new therapies that can cure previously untreatable diseases in a single dose but that doesn't mean that patients can be gouged across the board HR 3 the Elijah Cummings lower drug costs now act of 2019 will correct many of the market failures that plague our current drug pricing system and in doing so will save a substantial amount of money for employers the government and most importantly for patients the legislation then allows much of that money back into our health system improving benefits for Medicare beneficiaries increasing NIH research spending among other provisions I also want to highlight one Medicare improvement that although we won't be marking here today I believe is vitally important to include in HR 3 Medicare beneficiaries are one of the last groups that do not enjoy full pre-existing condition protections Medicare beneficiaries under 65 purchasing a Medigap plan can still pay more for having a pre-existing condition or disability or even be it entirely be denied from a plan the same is true for a beneficiary switching from Medicare Advantage traditional to traditional Medicare my bill the protecting Medicare beneficiaries with pre-existing conditions Act eliminates these inequities the ACA took a major step forward protecting Americans from unfair underwriting it's time we extend those same protections to our seniors and disabled as well I look forward to working with the Committee on this issue we have a clear directive from our constituents to address drug pricing and today our committee is answering these calls I look forward to passing HR 3 out of committee today as well as ensuring this bill passes the House who can get signed into law as soon as possible our constituents have waited long enough thank you again mr. chairman and with that I yield back

hi everyone this is Logan Bharath director of communications at J Street and we are really excited to be joined once again by tal Schneider diplomatic and political correspondent at Globes for an Israeli election update hi it's all thanks for being here sure hi nice to be here again so it's been a busy time for you know the the elections we're now in that mode where we start shifting from the speculation mode into the actual campaign mode as we saw the lists finalized last week so after all the speculation about mergers and partnerships and coalition's we see who's actually going to run together and who's not so you know looking at what happened with the with the formulation of the lists as we pull up on the screen sort of the major blocks that were seeing form and how many seats they won in the last election what was what struck you was really important and interesting here at all you know what were the alliances that form that you think are significant and were there any that did inform that you think are significant hi thanks for having me again yes I think all across the board from all political sides the meaning of the higher threshold the 3.25 percent which is obviously at least four seats in the Knesset the meaning and understanding of that high threshold has finally sat down on the political actors mind they understood that it's a huge gamble to try and get through that threshold if you are a small to even a medium list because even if you're a medium list you can fall down under the threshold so you saw in the in the Arab Society you see all of those four different parties joining together back to the situation they had in 2015 that's obviously the joint list and then on the right wing I go all the way down to the new right in your table it's mentioned as the new right but obviously it's a comp define the number five in the in the 21st Knesset it's actually the by two Houdini home and the Hulu me the national unity those two together roughly pirates and Smotrich are now ministers in Israel government and cabinet they managed to bring in five where has their colleagues Ayelet shaked a naphthalene Bennett from the Amina - the new right stayed out with very close numbers to the threshold so these four leaders again Naftali Bennett aisle educated battle Smotrich and Rafi Perez I know those names doesn't necessarily mean a lot to you but this is the Ministry of Education in the Ministry of Transportation and justice maybe next time they came in together and they had five but according to the polls they may have even ten eleven or twelve six this unification included a smile you did in the last election it smiled it is the coolest car the peoples of the rabbi cahana group that was outlawed in Israel and and was declared as a terror organization in the United States they they were there running under a different name not cough or Kohana they are running under at smiled each number two on that least Ben Ali who is allowed to enter the u.s. because he's part of a terror organization he was disqualified by Israel Supreme Court in in April now he is not running smile you did was trying to be part of this new new write depicting we call it out they call it now the united big right or something like that they were trying to negotiate with him to enter him into the their list Netanyahu was heavily involved in promoting his candidacy it was doing it I I think maybe you all aware of this story was doing it in April I'm talking about the prime minister and he was doing it yet again this time but this time unsuccessfully the reason probably what we heard behind the scene was that actually in a Stella Bennett the former Education Minister did not did didn't want to have him inside the meaning of this you know split is that what's my you did headed by itamar Bank there is still running for the Knesset for the election they may generate I don't know how many maybe one one state or two states between one and two those numbers will not and will not enter the Knesset because you need at least four and therefore the result the result will be a waste of ballots for the right-wing side another car another person another politician from the right wing is the emotion Phegley again with liberal agenda right wing liberal agenda he is running again and this may cause the right thing another another so we don't know yet yesterday there was a story here in the news that Netanyahu is trying to convince him to drop his bid in exchange for a title or a job or maybe in exchange for covering of his big debts that he carries from the first from the first election in 2019 the labor I'm going back to the left the label combined only Levy she's another politician who did not cross the threshold she is the daughter of the former Foreign Affair Minister a social activist very devoted to social issues it's a very nice combination because she's coming she's coming from the right wing and she's joining the labor yet with this joining the labor board numbers in the polls do not show for the forecast the big two parties the code and blue and white so they could have pulled in the finance minister Moshe Castellano Lucia Cochran had his own party in the last two terms the name of the party was : oh he had ten seats and Danny had only four sits he is a good Nick in his regions Netanyahu just brought him back back in so that means there is no social you know in the center of the map there isn't any social party who is you know maybe right-wing moderate right-wing there is only the laid board who is you know social but a bit more to the left so you don't have in the center that and so this is the liquid an important note to to see about this union the Likud had 35 seats like it's written here on the board and Conklin had forced it together it's 39 yet the polling at the moment show around 30 to 31 for daily could the meaning of course is that the people that you know were followers or supporters of Moshe kasher on probably did not follow his steps and enter the liquid at the moment it's yet to be sin blue and white is the obviously there we call it the party of the generals it's the four most former three former IDF JFC alone Bennigan's and Ashkenazi they're running within team they'll appeal they who was already politician since 2012 they joined forces last February they submitted exactly the same list without any additions or changes there is another interesting union on the left side it's here it's called the Democratic Union and four seats but it's actually merits emeriti is now headed by a different politician his name is nitsana orbits and he joined forces with Israeli former Prime Minister heckled Barak who is now at the age of 77 decided to jump right in and he is placed at number 10 on that list the polling the polls are showing between 7 to 8 seats so that means that Barak is not necessarily going to be an MK in the next Knesset so thanks for that overview tell you spoke earlier this week or last week to the New York Times and you talked about how with this election sort of as we saw with the last one when we go to Election Day on September 17th that's sort of only one stage in the real battle because the real battle may actually come after that when you then have the parties negotiating to try to form a government and as we saw in April they weren't able to do so in a way that satisfied Netanyahu at least and so that's why we're in the new elections now and you said you know last time in April on election night both Bibi and many gods gave victory speeches and that if they're smart this time neither of them will give a victory speech on election night so could you say a little bit more about what you mean by that and you know based on the the blocks that you've just laid out what are we likely to see in terms of the negotiations that would come out of an election since it seems very unlikely that anyone would be able to secure an outright majority just for a right-wing block or a left-wing bloc what do you think that you know negotiations period as we stand now is likely to look like okay thank you so first we have to say the election system in Israel it's very different from the United States we do not have a definite winner on election night I know it's hard to understand but we have you know the process is all the way up to the Election Day and then following the election we have another process who is called coalition building it's like in the UK you have to form a coalition from different parties it's a whole mini campaign because it is it's voting but the representative the MKS the member of the Knesset has to negotiate with each other and to reach an agreement and understanding and it has to be a written a written an agreement which will is the foundation for the next government so since you mentioned the victory night or the you know funny speeches night I may also want to remind you about the May 29th night this is the night where this 21st Knesset dissolved itself and I read a tweet or maybe I heard your president President Trump saying something of the sort you know what's going on Netanyahu is the winner I do not understand why he's being drugged dragged into a rerun so please it's not a rerun it's it's not a rerun it's not a second term it's not correction or it's not it's not the same election it's a different election it's a whole new game we do not have a definite winner on election night now on on April 9th actually what was funny is that according to the exit polls that were broadcasted on the TV many guns the chair of Halle ban you know thought he could form a coalition and he went to the to the place today to the you know to the party today to the place where alcohol of Anwar and wife were gathered and he gave a winning speech I think he wanted to give the message to the other party that he is following the government because he has the numbers he was immediately ridiculous I mean on that night and the following days because obviously he did not have 61 I mean we have a 120 MK is 120 members of the Knesset you need at least 61 which is half plus one to go to the president in a week following the election and recommend you to become the next prime minister now Netanyahu had 61 he had more than 61 actually and it announced that immediately after the elections on that night I'm already start to the negotiation process I have 61 and he gave his winning speech so one one party that actually recommended Netanyahu that night and was misleading in the public was the victor Lieberman because he didn't recommend Netanyahu but then you have to understand that after this recommendation process you have to reach an agreement with a big deal Lieberman it's not enough that he recommends you you also have to negotiate with him for a political agreement now Lieberman said I had full intention to recommend Netanyahu but on the negotiation process it was not you know a dream with me on my my terms and I'm allowed I was I was chosen to get you know what I wanted a Israeli public anything elbows ready there so Deborah 17 both aside will be careful unless of course unless of course there will be a landslide if Netanyahu will have had a landslide which means Delhi could just United Torah and unified right if if these four groups will be more than 61 then can be you know it can be declared maybe almost the winner so let's talk a little bit more about a big door Lieberman since he was kind of the key figure after the last election as he just said you know he has sort of been defining himself you know he's a politician who comes from the right and yet he's defined himself heavily in terms of his criticisms of the ultra-orthodox parties and the question over the ultra-orthodox in the draft and he's been pretty critical recently of Netanyahu most recently he's been talking about wanting to push for a unity government after the election the idea that there you know he might try to broker an agreement potentially with Likud and blue and white that would leave out the ultra-orthodox Orthodox parties perhaps um what do you think about that suggestion the idea of a possible unity government what do you think is the role that Lieberman is most likely they're going to want to play you know after September 17th and is there a realistic chance that he could sort of get what he wants here is he ultimately trying to play a bigger role in the next Netanyahu government or do you think he sees a real chance to potentially help broker a new right-of-center government that would leave Bibi out so um a big new Lieberman has been saying lots of things saying lots of things since May 29 that's the day the 21st Knesset dissolve at first he defended himself and said of course I recommended Netanyahu because I'm right wing true true true to the values but then he said the Pannell was not able to negotiate with me so this is the reason I did not enter the government since since May 29th his comments his public comments evolved about two three weeks ago we started to talk about unity government now he says before we go to the President to recommend anyone I will conduct my own many recommendations campaign in which I will ask both Likud and blue and white are you gonna sit together with each other and only the party that will promise me that they will work towards unity this is the party even further to that he said the first leader of the party that will come to me and will promise me that he is going to make unity government this will be the one that I recommend to the president the true meaning of the things is that he may come to the president and recommend Bennigan's this is the way the liquid is now understanding this they keep thrashing him and same suddenly Lieberman is lefty Lieberman is a traitor or and whatever because he is recommending the left many guns so you know I have to also add experienced and well-known politician in Israel and he is not well known for being trustworthy which means he has changed his mind about things in the last decade he said so many things before he became defense minister only to become a defense minister and not fulfilling any one of them it has famous statements declaring a but then doing so you know Israeli voters I think fully aware of of this problem and the level of trustworthiness at the moment for example Netanyahu keeps saying I will never go for a unity government but then just two months ago on May 29 he negotiated with the Labour Lieberman says I will only go for a unity government but then you know according to the to his history it's not something that you can really trust or build from as per glance blue and white people are they're not they're not here longer enough to really understand how many guns and the rest of the group are behaving as politicians because overall people do not believe politicians in Israel if you promise something and then you do not stand for your promises it's not something punishable or in any way so the second part was about about the participation of the ultra ultra drugs personally I think none of the Israel in that this government will exclude them I don't believe Lieberman the tea will sit without ultra-orthodox I think he's just saying it for the campaign if he wants the immunity you can always add in at least one of them probably shots with the sporadic party and you can have them with the unity government if that's the case so let's even if Netanyahu potentially was willing to consider a unity government one of the problems that we see with that often option is that blue and white has indicated in the past they would be may be willing to foreign sit in a government with Li coud but not with Netanyahu as Prime Minister and so that then starts to raise the question of is there any circumstance in which Likud would ever remove Netanyahu who moved to a new leader who might be able to form a new government with blue and white or with others and sort of in response to that question Netanyahu seems to be continually at least a little bit worried about that threat because now we see him pushing his own party members everyone in the Likud slate to agree basically to a loyalty pledge to say you know I will only accept Netanyahu as the leader of my party as the Prime Minister after the next election so what do you make about that the dynamics around that question this unity sort of this loyalty pledge and the idea of whether there might try to be you know some sort of version of a government with Likud - Netanyahu so thank you for the question first the loyalty pledge has no meaning whatsoever it is not legal biting it is just sort of a it's not a hawk's it's really happened I think liberal man was playing with the liquid it was trying to play with the their mind and they just ate the ate the debate debates yeah very quickly you do not need wealthy pledge for the members of your party your party bylaws or the parties Constitution declare that the chairmen of the parties they wouldn't want to be recommended to anyway right and comes to when it comes to raise your hand at the Knesset each Knesset member has his own discretion and you can do whatever we want without any sanction from the liquid leader so if they want to there will be a decision for example to devote nittany off by the liquid members I mean they can do it but they don't want to do it because nothing now is very strong politically so it's not something that unlikely to happen so when blue and white are talking about negotiating with the Likud only and not with Nathaniel it's a huge problem it seems unlikely an unlikely scenario having said that if Bennigan's is coming up with enough recommendations because as we said before maybe Lieberman is is jumping to the other side then Bennigan's and this is again right now it seems like an unlikely scenario because we don't know the number yet but you know let's say terrifically pentagons is the one who is receiving the mandate from the president he can come up to some liquid NYX and say you know join me into my government but if Netanyahu is the one who is getting the mandate then you know I do not see a way forward with this kind of you know letting him go it's not gonna work also please take into account that the recommendation process takes a week so election isn't on September 17 then on 24 or 25 would start the negotiation process then we have Rosh Hashanah the New Year's Eve right it's following in the middle of everything and then on October 2nd when if Nathaniel for example get demanded he has demanded for 28 days I think so 28 days will start counting from September 25th then Rosh Hashana then on October 2nd the Attorney General is conducting the hearing for the prime minister in three criminal cases and after that on October 4th the negotiation supposed to continue this is a very tricky and complicated situation whereas all of your negotiation partners know that you are on lifeline and the Attorney General said it specifically it is not going to postpone this date it's not gonna change and it doesn't care how many election cycles we are into so this is like a fixed date it's not going to change so I want to remind people first of all that they can submit questions via the Q&A function and you'll see towards the bottom of your screen and I want to take a question that we've gotten about some of the movement on the left so you know there's been a lot of speculation about whether merits would form a coalition with labor there was speculation about what a who Barak would do and obviously as you talked about the outcome that we ended up seeing is that you have this new entity with a new merits leader and a who Barak the Democratic Union and then you had labor pairing up with with Orly Levy what are your thoughts on sort of where the left is likely to go now could this be one of the first elections where the the merits block actually ends up getting more seats than the labor bloc which has traditionally been sort of the center you know labor has been the forefront of the center left are there different voter bases that Labor's Alliance and the Democrat Union are trying to appeal to and you know is one of them more likely the future of the left than the other okay first I think there was a you know high expectations from labor and merits to join forces the fact that this did not happen even with Orly levy in there was still a chance for the leg work with Orly levy she's coming from the right wing there was still expectation for for the labor board to join forces with merits because the differences between merits and labor are not not big at all and people thought that with this high threshold those two parties should work together and when Amir Peretz there was now the chair of the labor is a very I think he's the eldest the eldest MKS and he was also the defense minister and it took held many jobs is one of the elders when Amir Peretz refused all together to combine his political network with merits that was a huge disappointment for the entire liberal left camp so right now what you see in the polls and this may also happen in September 17th I think I think what lots of voters are punishing punishing Amir Peretz and the label for not joining forces you seen merits with held Barak and and by the way stubs appeal from the labor she joined them because she fought the unity is important so you see lot of voters are punishing Amir Peretz in the labor for that while trying to give credit for Nixon Horvitz and held Barak exceptional who convinced the public that they were sincere about the unity the unity efforts so so this is one reason labor may fall even even under even under the threshold this is crazy but it's true it may happen if LIBOR falls behind the threshold this is a it's going to be a huge blow for the entire camp you must understand they may come up with 120 thousand ballots which is not enough to enter the Knesset so the meaning is that 120 thousand ballots may be just wasted like you know it happened to the right wing in their first 2009 election 2019 election so right now I think the effort is is to have both merits and labor crossing the threshold and not wasting any ballots and merits with bharat are in a better better position at the moment to maybe come up even above 8 maybe 9 and then and labour is fighting for its life but we are more than i think about six weeks away maybe even seven weeks away from the election a lot of things can happen we think August is kind of a dad you know September 1st so things would pick up from September 1st to September 1st it's all kind of lame and it's not really sure what's going on I see someone here about asked me about about around Bergen Hamid the robbed the auction it's all I mean the lists are closed word in the ocean and maybe other politicians cannot join by now lists were finalized and closed last Thursday so they're not in at the moment they will they will not take part of the 22nd Knesset so another question we received is about a party that we've talked about a bit but in some ways just kind of flown under the radar during this negotiations period which is blue and white they're heading into a couple LaVon under Bennigan's they're heading into the elections with more or less the same alignment that they had in the last election but the question was about you know how is that alignment that alliance of sort of Benny gods and the our IDF chief-of-staff with Yair Lapid and his yesh a tea party how is that holding up recently we saw get your lip heed you know going aggressively and his criticisms of the ultra-orthodox which is a minute he's done before there's a question of whether that's something that might scare off or be you know bothersome to other folks in the party how do you see that sort of Kaholo von alliance holding up and going forward into the elections in September so I think it's true they're having some problems they say having some inner issues you must understand their achievement in April was huge 35 seats this is something that the Israeli left has seen in decades so the achievement was big instead of instead of you know enjoying enjoying this huge achievement and instead of going forward as a strong group now they have discussions and their fall outs and arguments and things are leaking out Lapita in the polls they have polls showing 30 seats or so the same numbers as the Likud but what's causing this this downward way is because Lieberman became really strong within seculars because Lieberman took on the issues of Shabbat and of draught and equal rights for seculars and so on so a lot of blue and white supporters went to Lieberman we see it all over the I mean we talk to people we hear it all the time people are you know happy with him and also people from the left and center one of the most important things for them is just toppling Netanyahu and now they believe that Lieberman will topple Netanyahu and they are supporting himself having said that the party doesn't deal very good with that they're not strong enough they're not relevant we are not hearing them we're not seeing them I think I Allah P decided to put out one of his sort of home eristic videos which was taken by the ultra ultra Ducks as an insult and then God's came up and said I mean it didn't say it out loud by the Sabbath in their conversation that this is against the party agenda and what is their agenda their agenda is to be able to sit in one government with the ultra-orthodox obviously I think no one thinks that the ultra ultra dukes will ever recommend them or will ever want to sit with them there is something that you must understand ultra-orthodox in Israel historically has been how do you say that like we call it Lashon was nine historically they were able to sit with the left or with the right but and and for this for this reason they were considered that the constant players because everybody were courting them but what happened in the last decade is that they identify wholly and totally with the right wing they have no interest whatsoever to be able to form a coalition with the Israeli left or Center so they are only with Netanyahu and Netanyahu giving them his love back so they know they're no longer there it was nine the tipping and and this left of the vacuum in Israel's political map and Lieberman very smartly entered into this vacuum and he said I am the new again I gotta find the word in English for Lashon was nine certified all-weather at the tipping point yeah declared itself has the new balancing act which means that he can go with either side and good for him and Bennigan's is trying to portray an image or reputation of a leader who the ultra-orthodox will embrace in the day following the election this plan may not work for him but at least you want to maintain this kind of integrity and for this reason he did not like what's the Pitt is doing but every day to have this sort of an inner fight the fight is leaking to the press and then they go out to an event and they hug each other and they shoot himself as you know great the great bodies you know it's a lot about game X raise another question as we head towards the end another question we got was about what's happening with the Israeli Arab public one of the seemingly big regrets after the last election was that the joint list that succeeded in 2015 under the leadership of Ayman Oda of uniting sort of the four major Arab parties in 2015 they became the third largest party in the Knesset in the April 2019 election they ran as two separate slaves they did not unify and it seemed like that was one of the reasons why Arab turnout was low the two parties I think combined finished with 10 seats instead of 13 for this election they have now a breach or reform as the joint list what is the general your general sense of their prospects in the election there were continuing to be major concerns about Arab turnout is Arab voter turnout likely to be up now that the joint list has reformed or are there still concerns about a voter boycott or you know voters not turning on the polls obviously as we've talked about with the fine margins in terms of the parties making the threshold or not making the threshold you know a higher vertical turnout could also significantly impact the overall electorate and the composition of the Knesset so what are your thoughts on what we're likely to see with the Israeli Arab vote in September okay so first the border turnout was under 50% whereas the general voter turnout was 68% so so when I say 68% it's also includes all parts of society so obviously if you take apart the Jewish turnout it is more than 68 obviously right so when the Arabs voter turnout is under 50 this is historically low I mean even even for them it's it's just historically low and it was you know one of the big shames I think of the first election in 2019 and I know it's a big question how will their leaders will will fix that I'm not sure it's it's it's fixable on such a short term I want to stress that we also had local elections in 2000 at the end of 2018 and on the local elections the Arab water turnout is between 80% and 90% which ends which means it's not about permanent behavior permanent bolete political behavior it's only about general elections I think you know overall the Israeli Arab minority thinks that voting to the Knesset it doesn't gonna give them anything in return and they're just indifferent to this process and it's something that the society need needs to fix but having said that they could which is the ruling party for the last you know so many years has been busy in what I call voter suppression right it's of course they deny it they claim the liquid is claiming only to have you know a process in which they are worried about counterfeit and about violations and therefore they apply this there they station a lot of instructor or server service they only put observers in Arab villages and our communities they do not worry about counterfeits in the entire Israeli society but only and those our Abdullah jizz this is what happened in the beginning of in the first election we had and another reason like you mentioned for the low turnout was the non unification so the part of the fact that they were running apart so there was a big distraction in the Israeli Arab public so now what what was so the other place have already already United himself so this part is fixed I don't know if it will drive them out as much as they want the other part about the inspector is about the observers we actually have a very very interesting hearing tomorrow morning in Jerusalem - which I plan to go and from which I plan to tweet you may follow my Twitter account I will tweet in English it will start in our morning time but it's going to be very very interesting because you have lots of Israeli activists and civil organizations and parties that are planning to attend tomorrow hearing it's one of the most important events - my opinion of this election because the Supreme Court judge is going to rule whether the behavior of the liquid with stationing their inspectors with putting cameras you know they want to put cameras in their polling stations not behind the curtain but in the general polling station if this if this anti-counterfeit they call it anti-counterfeit or anti violations organisation if this is legal or not lots of Israelis organization think that this goes against the core values of the system which is secretive elections obviously a person who is going into the has his right for privacy and if you put out there someone who is video taking video shots of him this is a you know a severe violation we'll have to see tomorrow for everyone who wants to follow along with tal her Twitter handle is just at tal Schneider and it's some of the best timely coverage that we'll see if Israeli politics so follow along with that tomorrow Tom I don't want to take up too much more of your time so I want to wrap up with the last question which is just moving on from sort of turnout in the Arab community just talk about what is the overall attitude that you're seeing right now in the Israeli public towards this election it's it's very unusual or fairly unusual to have an election so soon after one that just happened to have an election in April and then another general election that campaign in September are the voters paying close attention are we seeing enthusiasm or is there fatigue that has set in with the electoral process I'm after a year of so much politicking yes we never had election in September in the in the country's history election usually take on during November or the winter time this is a first so with respect to borders participation or water's behavior there's a whole you know political science field out there we do not know it's a week before maybe ten days before as I said the beginning of the High Holidays how many people are in the country how many people are planning you know two to stay this September seventeenth Tuesday and not to take on their vacations already how can you campaign during July and August we're literally no one is here the kids are out of school families I think you have you know Israel is about nine million people I think we have at least 1 million people that are out of the country at the moment so I mean I've talked I've interviewed yeah I repeat the number two on blue and white and I asked him how do you is how do you how do you compare he said no house had equality who gave I townhall's but you know they do the tunnels sometimes inside houses of people like like the Iowa caucuses house meetings there is no nobody's here nobody wants to hear the politicians so he goes on the train from Tel Aviv to to echo or from Tel Aviv to the deep south and on the train he's doing his home town home he walks from from one carriage to another when he sits next to the people and he talks to them he goes on the trains over on the buses over there this is so hot at the moment here so everybody are inside the shopping malls where there is a you know heavy heavy air-conditioned so the politicians are just doing their their rounds inside the shopping mall there is no way to meet people on the streets or have big conventions of big gatherings and in on you know in the city in open areas because nobody wants to be out in the open it so hard so I think it's very hard for the politicians at the moment to conduct a campaign and we have to see on September the voter turnout is a big issue I suspect lots of people will not will not participate this time around this is not beneficial for the left or for the it's it's crucial for the left because they're big you know voting chunk is in the big cities it's inside Haifa or inside Tel Aviv whereas Jerusalem in Beersheba are mostly more right-wing but tel aviv is the biggest city if Tel Aviv is not voting on September 17th so probably blue and white and other liberal groups are just you know they're done I mean they need to have you know a good voter turnout we believe we think that voter turnout on the ultra-orthodox for example is fixed it's gonna be high anyways so it can give them it can give the right wing a benefit moment so we'll have to see yeah well it's gonna be fascinating to see and I just want to remind everyone that you know the timing of how this is likely to play out by the time the election actually happens and the negotiations happen between the parties will be towards the end of October which is when the J Street conference will be taking place in Washington DC if you haven't yet registered for the conference from October 26th to 29th I'm sure one of the many topics we'll be talking about in addition to how we continue to push back on the foreign policy of the Trump administration and prepare for our own election in 2020 is talking about the aftermath of you know this September Israeli election what could be maybe the end of the Netanyahu era or a continuation or something that we just can't prepare for so it's going to be a really exciting an important time to be gathering to discuss all this and talk about what's next but I'm sure we'll also have opportunities to check in again with tall before then so thanks to all Schneider so much for joining us and folks follow along on Twitter and we'll talk to you again soon bye

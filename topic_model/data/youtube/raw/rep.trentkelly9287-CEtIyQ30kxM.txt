you know as we just saw our president do in North Korea it's okay to have a meeting and to walk away with that meeting if your objectives are not achieved it's not okay not to ever have a meeting because I can tell you you can never reach consensus if you're not talking and so I think we have a lot of opportunity I'm skeptical just like everyone else general Votel but I'll notice we also have who's Becca Stan involved in that I know Pakistan's involved in that I know there are a lot of people involved in the peace process there and I'm quite confident that our president and our military and our State Department will walk away if we don't get the conditions met that we need to for peace but we have to talk to get to peace and if you can comment very briefly mr. Wilborn sure I'll just briefly say look long-term insurgencies mostly need to end by reconciliation that's sort of the history of these kind of conflicts and I also agree that the military is both both US military but in conjunction with our partners on the ground we will continue the military pressure during these talks yeah I completely agree with mr. Kelly's assessment that we do need to talk so the only way to get there

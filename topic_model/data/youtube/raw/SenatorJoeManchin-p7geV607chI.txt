uh secretary you know i've talked a lot about the clarksburg situation how horrific and i know that both the senator and the ranking uh member uh have heard me talk about this before but you know that's still the glaring thing that happened in our va is that they were getting passing grades they were uh the joint commission uh that which accredits the va facilities were saying that everything was good consistently passing as you remember and we found out the oig report was completely different give me a little update on what you've been able to do to change that from the uh the joint commission versus the oig to see if they're in sync well so we're you know we obviously we we um continue to be subject to that uh regular joint commission investigation um but we have also had obviously very aggressive ig participation on the ground in clarksburg including most recently as you and i have discussed uh and importantly we're also uh have our office of accountability and western border protection is taking a hard look at at um clarksburg so um that's uh from the accountability on some of the other va's too are they is this was this inherently uh a problem problematic throughout the va system we you know you and i talked at length about whether what what are the lessons that we can apply from clarksburg among the things we did after i went up there and visited with you and then after we after the trial and everything is uh va vha did a system-wide stand down on patient safe safety and accountability so the entire enterprise dedicated time expressly to these questions raised by virtue of the experience in clarksburg so what i can tell you now is that we've looked across the system we don't see this as uh endemic to the system i think this is a was a particular uh challenge with this uh nurse and some of the oversight uh of performance in clarksburg but we're continuing to stay on top of it and we'll apply whatever lessons we need to there last point we also continue to apply new blood to the system and i just got an update on clarksburg last night we have what i heard last night is that the contract teams that we have including on the awards in question that you and i have discussed report increased morale uh improved performance and improved outcomes we've been able to do anything on and i think we all talked about this the people that basically that would be under suspicion for allowing this type of egregious acts to happen they retired and they're getting full pensions full benefits for everything i understand were we able to reach back at all find any of them not negligent not yet can't do it um are we looking at okay the assets cost of maintaining updating critical infrastructure va you know a lot of money being talked about and how we're going to spend it you have the strategic capital investment planning program yes from 2010 the skip skip yep and then you have the air which is the asset infrastructure review yes are those two going to conflict with each other they're overlapping or it's going to one slow one down yeah so uh they're completely different so the air the asset infrastructure review commission was enacted by statute by you all um i i've been saying and and i think our teams have talked i've urged you all and your teams to look closely at what we call the market assessments there's been market assessments going on since 2019 in 96 markets around the country where we're making some assessments about what are the care needs today and what will the care needs be for veterans in the future and we'll make then some recommendations we'll give those to the air commission itself which is an independent commission the president appoints some members of that commission senator schumer senator mcconnell mr mccarthy and speaker pelosi make some recommendations that commission right now we have seven commissioners ready to go two are still not done so we don't even have a commission yet and they still have to come before you to be confirmed so you'll be able to ask them some of these questions that so that is an aspirational look at our entire footprint what's going to be needed what therefore is not needed over the next two and a half decades the skip process is the process through which we make decisions based on the resources we get from you all on a year-to-year basis and then where do we allocate those resources so the the skip process should surely inform [Music] what we're thinking about on air over time and then air and form skip over time but this is the skip is a much more uh nuts and bolts dollars and cents air commission much more aspirational and by the way right now i'm kind of concerned since we don't have the two remaining commissioners we can't even submit them for you all's consider

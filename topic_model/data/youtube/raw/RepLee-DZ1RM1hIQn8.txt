it and back in Washington there is growing outrage over the budget prompting pump ting leading Democrats and their supporters to rally on Capitol Hill in the next hour in protest of that budget plan among them is congresswoman barbara Lee of California she joins me now congresswoman thank you very much first of all i reck'n ate your twitter you tweeted something that said you're fasting in solidarity with the children and families who will go hungry if the president cuts to food and aid are enacted fasting and solidarity talk to me about your message first of all let me just play this budget is a disaster as cruel as heartless specifically with regard to food assistance the president comes 190 billion dollars from 47 percent of those receiving SNAP benefits are children it's outrageous that he would come forward with this type of alleged he eliminates the food for Peace program our international food assistance program also let me just say why another reason why I think this is such a cruel budget he actually zeroes out all of our programs as it relates to the special olympics for disabled children he cuts the meals on wheels they eliminate after-school programs this is really terrible that's why we're holding the rally hands off because this really erodes the basic standard of living for so many Americans congressman the President's budget is the wish list there are going to be negotiations about it what have you been hearing some first year Democratic colleagues and then secondly your Republican colleagues about where there could be some middle ground and where they could push back against some of these proposal we held a hearing today with the Office of Management and Budget director mr. Mulvaney and I'm on the Budget Committee and we leave you needs at this point if the Democrats are fighting against these deep deep cuts the Republicans the summers land that they're concerned about some aspects of the budget but senator Payne said that it was dead on arrival in the Senate I was in a hearing with secretary DeVoe Secretary of Education and it was outrageous some of the responses that she had for example there's a 13 percent cut in public education within the Department of Education how do young people our most vulnerable kids our disabled children how do they go to school and receive us a quality education so at this point Democrats are fighting very hard we're resisting we're saying hands off and we're saying that many of these budget cuts most of them actually are promises broken the president said he was going to create jobs he wasn't going to touch Social Security and here he's cutting Social Security disability payments today the White House says that this plan is based off this idea that the economy will grow by 3 percent it will start people get people working again it'll get people hiring again and there's you're not going to need these these programs any longer because more people will be making money that the country will be making more money do you think that's feasible is that is that logical it's not logical in that doesn't make any sense the White House needs to really be clean and come clean and tell us how this budget got developed I suspect it was Steve ban and remember he said that he wanted to deconstruct the administrative state this budget decimates all of our federal agencies it decimates all of our public sector as it relates to the federal government and so I suspect this is their way of just eliminating the majority of the public sector so that millionaires and billionaires can make more money and receive huge tax cuts congresswoman barbara Lee thank you very much now you got to go vote

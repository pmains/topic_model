president because he has said he is going to follow the law and follow the constitution how dare the president who led a campaign on law and order and is going to talk about antifa and black lives matter i have never seen i've been here 10 years and i don't even understand how the public is on the steps of the capitol where they are never allowed this is just shocking yeah you can't understand how it happened that's what a lot of people are wondering at this point have you been given any information as we see now others trying to climb that fence as well you've been getting given any indication of how the situation is going to be gotten under control we know the capitol police can't do it alone do you expect the leadership is going to have to call in for more reinforcements perhaps the national guard absolutely i i can't imagine how the capitol police can deal with the situation now because they are absolutely outnumbered it probably will be needed to bring in the national guard to secure the capitol because the president has instigated a riot unbelievable we do have karen bass joining us on the phone now thank you so much for joining us i'm not sure where you're at at this point and what you've been able to see well i'm in a secure location that's all that i can say and uh i will tell you that watching the proceedings uh earlier everything was peaceful this is just absolutely positively outrageous the idea that the president of the united states would have incited this level of violence is just shocking this is a sad day in u.s history i have been on the capitol for 10 years i have never ever seen the public on the steps of the capitol in the manner like this this is the group that wanted to yell and scream about antifa and black lives matter and look at the reckless behavior that they are carrying out now this is an attempted coup by the president of the united states and to see this uh representative to know that people were able to get inside using fire extinguishers and that house members being told to get under their chairs and and get the mask that are there for tear gas i was saying earlier to jessica levinson professor that this feels like something out of a movie this does not seem like it could be real in the united states of america well well absolutely but then the last four years have not seemed like it could be real in the united states of america either i mean this is this is just such a sad day in history so there's a lot of vitriol right now for vice president pence because he refused to break the law what have we come to this president who essentially has a cult following that would go to any kind of extreme i saw interviews with some of the protesters who have said that they believe that the president has something special in store for them so they actually still think that he is going to continue to be the president after january 20th all i have to say is heaven help us get to january 20th so we can turn this page in our history the question will be will he continue to incite violence even after he is evicted from the white house well that's certainly a concern and as we have seen that uh you know these protesters have been able to breach the capital you wonder what could happen on january 20th and we do know that president trump has tweeted he's asked these people to uh be peaceful and but has not asked them to leave well he i mean he has a heck of a lot of nerve asking them to be peaceful when he spent two hours rambling on and fighting violence you know after you incite violence after you tell tens of thousands of people to march and storm the capital then why are you surprised at what you get i do have to say though that i'm just so shocked that they were able to breach the capital because to me this is one of the most secure places in the country obviously it's not somebody had to have let these people in the general public has not been in the capitol since march nobody period these halls have been empty since march why did this breach happen today and who is responsible for it and frankly all those people that they have on camera who were in the house chamber they sure better arrest them just like they go and seek out arrest people who protest police violence those folks need to be arrested they breached the capitol they've committed a crime and they need to be they need to pay for it check in with congresswoman karen bass a democratic member from los angeles a chair of the congressional black caucus one of the most prominent members of the united states house of representative congresswoman good to know you are okay and at a safe location but um sort of walk us through the images that you have seen yourself today and your reaction to to what you are seeing now well i am just absolutely shocked i mean what what is this not the united states the idea that this problem is riot is just shocking you know that this building has been completely closed since march because of the pandemic and how did all of these people get inside the capitol they have um vandalized the building all throughout people are sheltering in place members and staff this is just such a sad day in american history when it's actually one of the days that the world looks to us for because this was the beginning of the peaceful transfer of power and we have a president that still refuses to admit that he lost an election this isn't normal i went through swat officer school with the capitol hill police officers that create their containment and emergency response teams that are there they saw this rally of forty to fifty thousand people as almost like a high school group from iowa coming to visit the place there was a lot of fighting on the western side of the capital the western steps but what happened on the east side was almost like a picnic they left them up on the steps and then this force used mass to come through and then some officers obviously according to the video let them come up there what they did not do is they did not take the breach of this building as a national security crisis which should have had multiple agencies if it wasn't for the secret service calling in the fbi strike teams mike pence and kamala harris might not have gotten out of there as safely as they did and it really enraged me because i could only imagine what would have happened had it been a black lives matter protest or had the majority of the protesters been uh african-american that was domestic terrorism they found molotov cocktails people were armed they found i don't know if they were fake or they were just bombs that didn't go off i mean just imagine that watching people catapult on the capitol using ropes you know uh vandalizing pelosi's office standing on statues it was just unbelievable and how on earth did that happen you know it reminded me of kyle rittenhouse after the kenosha wisconsin after the shooting of jacob blake he walks down the street with a rifle in his hand after having killed two people shot one person the police officers giving water and send him on his way the disparity that exists in this country when it comes to policing the fbi said last week that it had no intelligence suggesting the pro-trump rally on january 6 would be anything more than a lawful demonstration but the washington post has as you heard earlier come up with a series of damning reports pointing to the contrary it says that three days before the insurrection quote an internal capital police intelligence report warned of a violent scenario which congress itself could be a target of angry trump supporters it's not unknown by the way whether that report was shared with other law enforcement agencies the post also reports that the fbi knew dozens of people who were on the agency's terrorist watch list who came to d.c that day and participated in the riot further reporting found that an fbi field office had picked up direct online threats made against the capital quote go there ready for war we get our president or we die nothing else will achieve this goal end quote somehow democrats even suggested they're fearful that the rioters were abetted by their far right congressional colleagues members of congress more than 30 democrats are requesting a probe from both acting sergeants at arms at the capitol hill one of them is from the house one of them is from the senate they want investigated quote suspicious behavior and access given to visitors to the capitol complex on tuesday january the 5th 2021 the day before the capital attacks yesterday capitol police announced an investigation into that alleged tour this also comes as a different investigation is underway looking into the removal of all panic buttons from the office of the massachusetts representative ayanna presley joining me now is malcolm nance he's an nbc news terrorism and analyst and executive director of the terror asymmetrics project on strategy tactics and radical ideologies malcolm is also the author of the plot to betray america how team trump embraced our enemies compromised our security and how we can fix it malcolm uh a lot of the stuff i just said for the last couple of minutes reminds me of 911 right there were different agencies responsible for different things that had different information and somehow it didn't get shared now we're still in early days we don't know if that's actually the truth but the bottom line is that's the situation here you got capital police you got dc police you got fbi you got secret service you got all sorts of people involved in security around here and it seems that a few of them knew something right well unlike 911 911 was a clandestine operation which only 19 people were involved operating in total secrecy across three continents what happened here in terms of failures was something was widely seen i i myself actually warned about the potential for an insurrection and insurgency uh in late november what we saw while monitoring right-wing extremist communications throughout all december was everything was focusing on january 6th after the january uh the december 14th certification of the election came out donald trump himself uh said that he wanted people to come to the capitol it's going to be wild anyone who was in the intelligence community who had anything to do with domestic intelligence would know that all of his most rabid supporters would be showing up we had already received a template from the state of michigan for the the indictment of the six men who were going to kidnap the governor of michigan most people don't realize in that indictment there was a plan b and plan b was that they were going to take the capital the breach at the capitol is raising giant security questions today and there's also new pressure on law enforcement to bring more of the rioters to justice the fbi yesterday posting this notice encouraging people to send in photos or videos of people involved in the capital insurrection my next guest tweeted out found one you see it right there with a photo of president trump democratic congresswoman karen bess joins me now live congresswoman it is good to see you and i hope you are safe and well after the harrowing experience of yesterday uh you tweet the photo of the president there you also tweeted and i can ask our control room to put them up on the screen a string i believe it numbered up to 10 at the end of people involved in this you're saying okay fbi you want help arrest this man arrest this man and you go on and on arrest all the people in these pictures as it went on um what have you been told about how this happened you're supposed to be in one of the most secure buildings in the world i was here in town in 1998 when gunman killed two capitol police office bursting into that building first of all thank you for raising the issue i think that that there has to be an absolute thorough investigation the only information i have is anecdotal from talking to members of the capitol police and others that were around at the time and basically they just described as being overwhelmed the question is why were they overwhelmed everyone knew this was going to happen why weren't they tracking social media why frankly why weren't the protesters rioters terrorists why weren't they infiltrated why wasn't there undercover police officers that were there this is the kind of thing that happens with other types of street protests so i think there needs to be a thorough investigation joining us now terrorism analyst and author of the plot to betray america malcolm nance malcolm good morning to you thanks for joining us what does this reporting mean for the prosecution of those involved what it means is you're going to be seeing a lot more prosecutions than we've seen thus far i think the fbi's brought up cases for about 150 people there was some concern that about 800 cases would overwhelm the system but you know this last year uh the justice department and in various jurisdictions bought over ten thousand cases against black lives matter protesters so the fbi appears to be committing itself to going after this insurrection with with everything that they have congresswoman are you do you have any concern that by this vote to impeach president trump a second time that you run the risk of further inflaming many of his supporters even some of his supporters who basically think that democrats are out to get the president and they're doing they're doing this in the final days of his time in office no i mean i think what inflames his supporters frankly they will use lots of excuses what we are doing here is critical there is a chance that he could be convicted in the senate and i think what is most important is to end any possibility of president trump running for reelection or continuing in some other public office we have to state unequivocally as a nation that he is unfit to be the president and he should never be in public office again otherwise what i'm concerned about is he launches his reelection campaign and uses that to go around the country stoking division stoking racism and fomenting violence [Music] good evening and thank you for joining tonight's event january 6th is a day that i will remember forever what i thought would be a normal routine work day we mark in history as the day the president of the united states of america whipped up a mob and encouraged them to storm the capitol in order to stop the electoral vote count and certification of the 2020 election that morning my family friends and new watching acquaintances asked me are you really going to work today they seen the coverage predicting that thousands of angry people fed lies for months planned to use force to defend what they saw as the correct outcome of the election i told my people of course i'm going to work because i knew that the capital complex was very well protected i assumed that i would be in the safest place in washington d.c but boy was i wrong thousands gathered on the ellipse next to the white house all morning but i was told if i went from 63 million which we had four years ago to 66 billion there was no chance of losing well we didn't go to 66 we went to 75 million and they say we lost we didn't lose [Music] and by the way does anybody believe that joe had 80 million votes does anybody believe he had 80 million computer votes it's a disgrace there's never been anything like that you could take third world countries just take a look take third world countries their elections are more honest than what we've been going through in this country it's a disgrace it's a disgrace their rallying cry was stopped to steal reform to the president's grand lie that he won that democrats has stolen the election and we're going to seal the deal by certifying joe biden as the 46th president of united states of america he told the crowd they needed to march to the capitol that he would march with them he said and we fight we fight like hell and if you don't fight like hell you're not going to have a country anymore they march to the capitol carrying banners waving confederate flags and wearing clothes with racist and inflammatory slogans like never concede stormed the capital and mega civil war january 6 20 21 now at this time lawmakers gathered to do their legal duty and the joint session of congress convened provided over by vice president pence all of the nation's highest leaders were in that building except trump who was in the white house watching it all unfold on tv the crowd of thousands assembled outside the capitol building and breached the lightly guarded perimeter shortly after that they stormed the majestic stairs that faced the national mall scaled the lower walls and surrounded the building suspicious packages later identified as pipe bombs were discovered at the republican national committee headquarters and democratic national committee headquarters across the street from the house member offices real bombs that fortunately did not explode the fbi believes the pipe bombs were diversions so police would be drawn away from the mob as the crowd began to attack the capital the process to certify the election was temporary halton as ms bass and her personal office were on lockdown and a safe and secure location the riders continued to threaten elected leaders terrorize staff to face the building and attack officers one losing his life a woman was shot by officers defending a barricaded room and four members of the crowd also died two capitol police officers committed suicide within days of these traumatic events hours later the insurrectionists were ushered out of the building peacefully with only a handful of arrests made that day how is it that riders were able to leave peacefully after such violent acts shortly after that with the capital secured congress reconvened to fulfill its obligation to recognize what the voters had decided and certify the presidential election this constitutional duty is a vital step in maintaining our most sheriff's heritage the peaceful transfer of power remaining in session deep into the night house members and senators finally concluded their debate in the accounting of electoral votes at 3 42 a.m the session ended with mike pence officially infirming the election results and congresswoman bass and her colleagues voting to recognize joe biden as the president-elect joseph r biden jr of the state of delaware has received 306 votes donald j trump of the state of florida has received 232 votes the wild mob that attacked our democracy included organized white supremacist militia groups some of the same people were at the charlottesville unite the right rally chanting jews would not replace us many of the members of these groups who trump previously referred to as very fine people were active former and retired members of the military and law enforcement how do we get here what is happening in our country how did a president who compulsively lied for five straight years developed a cult-like following and convinced thousands of people to storm the capital and would amounted to an attempted coup false claims about stolen elections and exciting body mobs to keep a loser in office is a common strategy of tyrants around the world trump attempted to be a tyrant but he failed he tried to interfere and destroy our democracy he failed but we must ask the question how great is the danger from an organized white supremacist element in our country how dangerous is that this element appears willing to sacrifice our democracy rather than face the prospect that in a few short decades the us will be a majority minority nation white militias existed in our country for many years some have organized paramilitary training camps in rural parts of our country these events beg some questions is there actually an element in our country that truly wants to see a second civil war and if so what is their goal did they truly believe that they could take over and keep donald trump in office were the mobs actually hunting members of congress planning to kidnap and kill speaker pelosi and vice president pence would our democracy continue to be under attack from a violent extreme right wing during dividing administration and most importantly what must we do to defend our nation and bring to life our national motto e pluribus unum out of many one this is the first in a series of discussions to examine this moment in our nation's history and now congresswoman karen bass and terrorism expert malcolm nance would examine what happened in our capital on january 6 and explore where we might go from here malcolm nance it is good to see you again it is so great to be here and to see you and i'm glad we're having another town hall it's been too long exactly well i remember when i first met you the town hall we did was so popular people still talk about it and we did that town hall because it was an opportunity for people to learn you remember it was the beginning of the trump administration we called it from trump we called it from nixon to trump and really wanted to have you go into depth about what you knew because we were so concerned about russia and all of that at the time and it all turned out to be true everything we discussed all of your predictions turned out to be true god i wish i wasn't so good at this you are an amazing author you are a former intellic naval intelligence officer officer and foreign policy analyst you founded terror asymmetrics project on strategy tactics and radical ideologies a new york based think tank which is perfect for our discussion today i can't think of a more perfect organization than that so i'm so glad that you're here with us today and our goal is to really provide the audience everyone who watches this with an in-depth understanding of what the heck is happening here we've known we've been on a wild ride for the last four years with the trump administration we've seen parts of our country move radically to the right and it culminated in an insurrection in the nation's capital for the first time in us history and so i think it's important that we spend some time and really get to the bottom from your perspective of what you think happened here so that's what we hope to accomplish today well i i hope i can be helpful well i know you can so why don't we start well you know when we had this discussion back in 2017 the the undercurrents of what we saw happen on january 6 were already being laid you know we we saw that the american public there was a small segment of the american public that to themselves to their own impression really did not like the idea of what they called politically correctness right political correctness which you and i call common decency right they just hated the whole idea that they had to be beholden to the way things are done that the the way that they behaved uh was being seen with a probium you know that people were looking down on them and that they found their tribal chief in donald trump the man who would uphold their beliefs that there was a segment of the american public who were the real rulers of this country and would always be the rulers of this country no matter what the demographics are and he tapped into a vein of americans that he claimed he was going to represent right and he was going to bring them up and by the time the election was done and the way that they were behaving in the transition what i call a masters of the universe attitude we won we own everything we can do whatever we want right we'll just do foreign policy behind the back of the president of the united states at that time and we don't care what he thinks we'll call the russians and tell them don't listen to this guy we'll do whatever we want right we don't care if it breaks laws we are the laws that was the attitude now this was turning into a crescendo and his supporters put him in office right donald trump moved into the into the white house and it only got worse from there right there was no time that things went quietly or smoothly and this was part of their strategy to elevate the the most crude of his most base supporters to elevate them into a position where the average one of them uh it goes it harkens back to that old saying that that they said about slavery if you can convince the poorest white man to believe that he is better than the best educated or richest black man or woman right then they will not only give you money they will empty their pockets to you we saw it in practice here that is so so sad let me so talking about january 6 yeah the mob we know that it was a mob but we also know that within that mob there were organized elements and so i have heard of several organizations and i'd love if you could tell me who are these people a name like the boogaloo boys the proud boys the oath keepers the three percenters the traditionalist workers party the neo-confederates the holocaust deniers so you could see the mob coming but there were clearly people in full military gear who are these groups are they white supremacists are they do they have international ties who are they this is what makes the basis of of a domestic violent extremist group middle class actually most there's quite a a number of people from the middle class and upper middle class who support trump right one of the stereotypes is that they're uneducated no they're not all uneducated i believe that there was a there was a statistic that the median income was between 100 and 150 000 these guys who have they may have a small business and a boat you know or you know a bass boat and two or three franchises right you know these are average americans but within them they saw in donald trump someone who would never allow demographics to put them out of power and the statistics of that by 2050 the united states will be a you know the average america white american will be a minority 49 percent of the population terrified them trump bought their fears to washington and said i will fight to ensure that there is always dominance what do they think they're going to lose well they think they're going to lose what they were saying they they came here to stop they were going to lose america america is about to be taken away from us no what they fear is democracy right so let me go back on the characters where this all came from when charlottesville happened you saw a multitude of groups come together in an organized rally called unite the right yes and people kept saying to me where did that come from how did these people form well they were forming because the right wing or what we called at that time the alt-right right were being empowered through donald trump's presidency they saw themselves now able to rise the ku klux klan yeah david duke former grand wizard of the klu klux klan openly telling people to vote for donald trump and that he we have a person in the white house all of these guys have an affinity for guns right i'm a gun collector i do too but for them it was like a fundamental belief in life that the second amendment right was was given to them with the purpose of overthrowing tyrannical government which is what it wasn't about at all those people came together in this in this how can i put it a conglomeration of all of their grievances tearing down confederate statues right the belief that though that the south was robbed at the end of the civil war that blacks uh are mine are inferior people and whites are always superior people well do you what about the t during the time of obama and the tea party didn't this actually didn't those fears actually arise there the same people same they're just a different name at that time their anger of giving people health care to save their lives it didn't mean you were going to get health care it meant i was going to get health care and i don't want minorities or brown people or women to have health care you saw another spike in tribalism trump brought them all together like the vikings right and all into one tribe i i make that reference to the vikings because at charlottesville they got they had shields with runic symbols on them right norse mythological symbols on them so these guys all came together but you know people constantly ask me in the intelligence community even well how did they get organized and as a matter of fact they were actually communicating on a game server called discord it's a it's a communication structure where you can do live chat live voice all these things and during the charlottesville rally they were giving you know instruction and and tippers and what to do how do you build those shields do they communicate through games as a way of hiding their communication so yeah it's a form of tradecraft so these disparate groups all got brought together in charlottesville and then you saw them do the tiki torch you know baby nazi march right where they went around and show not replace us but charlottesville was designed to be a coming out party for the american right-wing extremist or what we would call now dve domestic violent extremists and they were there to show america that with trump in the oval office we are the civilian paramilitary right the underground against liberalism and against progressivism and technically against everyone who is not one of them in the united states so when the president said there were very fine people on both sides right and the uproar that went through that almost to the point where people were calling on trump to resign most people thought that that broke up the alt-right it didn't they went underground quietly for a couple of years and what they did do was this they started subtly preparing themselves to be essentially a political paramilitary associated with the trump campaign so you had the proud boys which started as sort of this racist chauvinist street gang that wanted to go against liberals in literal fist fights they would literally go around to cities and start fights right and they moved on to weaponizing themselves and they went all over the country to do this they were proud their are probably chapters in practically every city about how how big is it about how many people do you think you know the proud boys is a nebulous group because you know you could say that you're a proud boy and boom you're right they watched how the trump administration ran things remember when i said how the trump administration ruled like they were masters of the universe they didn't care about the majority they only cared about that 45 to 40 percent that supported donald trump that's right all policies were oriented to the 40 to 45 percent that voted for donald trump and they also didn't care about the law so they had no problem with violations i don't care about the law remember masters of the universe they own the law that was the whole point about packing the courts with trump appointees that was the whole thing about getting some people in the supreme court so that you could have a conservative america no matter even if 75 percent of the country voted for something that was progressing let me tell you how i describe it and you tell me if this this is correct that uh the fear the terror over the demographic shift led them let parts of our country to figure out how to establish minority rule right well we have three branches of government the executive branch the legislative branch the judiciary the judiciary is the only branch where you have lifetime appointments right if you have lifetime appointments there and the other two branches change whatever laws you pass you can just overturn it in the court absolutely i had a really i i knew an fbi officer who was a highly accomplished fbi officer loved talking to this guy you know loved being around this guy and in 2016 i said why did you vote for trump he goes supreme court oh and i go really he goes we control the supreme court we control the laws and i go in defiance of the rest of the united states right you know well you voted for these people they you know many of them have a very mistaken belief that the united states of what the definition of a republic is right a republic is a democracy in which the rights of the minority are protected they the rest of that part the you know rights of the minority thing they don't they don't they don't agree with that at all unless it's them right in the minority right then they think that they can dominate the majority then the militia movement in the united states every state has militias militias are these self-styled people who have bought into that corrupt nra theory that the militias are formed to fight against government so the militia movement is has expanded dramatically in the united states and it has been around for a long time so some of my colleagues that represent uh districts in rural georgia alabama et cetera have described that there's like training camps and that people were preparing in case the election didn't go the right way is that something you're still doing it yeah still doing it and i have people on both sides of the aisle black and white coming and asking me should i buy a gun and i always say no jesus buy you know start voting right regularly you just showed real power in this last election let me ask you going back to january 6 where was u.s intelligence you know why didn't they know i mean you know it has been said that the capitol police actually did get the information they did know but trump made several moves in his last couple of months changing leadership at the pentagon etc and so what what happened there what was the connection our relationship to trump's moves in the last couple of months switching positions and what we saw well i've got some bad news for you first off most of the u.s intelligence community does not feed into domestic intelligence so we're talking about going after militiamen in in michigan who may have a training camp in southern wisconsin right uh we are not using you to you know uh intelligence collection systems and army intelligence collection systems against americans the fbi no well there is the fbi the department of homeland security the joint terrorism task force that the fbi has established around the united states to feed in information from local law enforcement that is where the information should and was coming the capitol police as i understand it their intelligence division did receive and generate an intelligence report somewhere around 96 40 to 48 hours before the event saying this was going to be a mass event the possibility of them coming to the building is being discussed amongst them we saw this intelligence i was collecting it real time from my house along with a team that i had all over the united states and we saw the banners storm the capital they were selling t-shirts on etsy that said this january 6 donald trump was january 6. so what so supposedly i don't know if they made the request to the pentagon because in order to get the national guard to come to the capitol they needed permission from the pentagon right this is where acting secretary of defense chris miller comes in and i suspect that when there's a national commission on this and he's hauled before the spotlights to testify before the nation as to why i mean this is a guy was in the job as pentagon chief for about three weeks many weeks he was a former special forces colonel he was assigned to the national counterterrorism center and he was jumped above everyone in the united states government into the acting secretary of defense well i it's suspected because secretary esper uh was not going to do the bidding of the president and apparently it based on reporting the bidding was is that he would not put resources between this protest and this building and so there's a memo that's out that has been verified as a pentagon memo where he directed the dc national guard not to bring and not to have a quick reaction force no helmets no riot gear for this protest because this protest was supposed to be trump voters who were white who were coming here and that they were not going to upset these people and that's why the entire national security apparatus disarmed itself you know i think all of these people need to be held to account they need to come in and explain themselves i would like to see secretary miller say why did you disarm the dc national guard some very fundamental things could have could have occurred as a matter of general process that would have protected the campus of the capitol hill allowing the dc national guard to do what they normally do in case of protest all we have to do is look back at the protests in june and july right at lafayette square to see what the full measure of the united states government can do i mean the attorney general brought in riot police from federal prisons to lafayette square that was the black lives matter right for the black lives matter protest but not only bought in the national guard used national guard aviation elements used every federal law enforcement officer fbi hostage rescue team all of these groups here which which to be honest at the sitting of the the certification on january 6th you were only missing two elements for that to have been the state of the union the president and the supreme court so why was that not declared a national a special national security event right at that time you had the the the house of representatives and the senate in joint session with the vice president of the united states vice president-elect of the united states the speaker of the house of the united states had it gone wrong that day had people been god forbid i don't even like saying it killed or incapacitated or injured it would have left you know if mike pence had been incapacitated or the you know or the speaker of the house or the president of the senate pro tem it would have left donald trump as the sole person in the united states government wow did you not think about that no no no what if you had all been tear gas right for the length of time no one would have been able to swear anybody in if someone had been killed or injured so it but it still leaves me to the point okay even if that had happened and and i don't mean the massacre yeah please so they delayed it it was inevitable and that upset them the most you know that was what i monitor their chats i mean i'm up at three every morning monitoring their telegram channels their parlor channels you know what upset them the most about the stop the steel rally what that you came back that same day and executed since the certification of the other what did they think you're going to come back the next day so how did we get there i mean especially with that i i remember the scene in the capitol of these uh men going through the desk right looking for evidence i don't know what they were looking for and then one walks away and says well senator cruz ted cruz ted cruz what would [Music] in approve [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Applause] [Music] what were they possibly looking for another scene where they were looking for the ballots like they were going to steal them and then that was going to stop the whole process so we came back that night for weeks this had been fed to them that they could stop this and what and what stop the counting sorry i'm doing this town hall and install a dictatorship okay and that was their goal was to establish donald trump as the winner of that election and that through people power they would install him as a dictator you know let me just say that i know one thing that has changed in the past and by pass i mean just a few weeks ago my republican colleagues were concerned about being primary were concerned about being attacked politically you know trump would tweet now i've heard them express they're concerned about being physically harmed physically harmed and and it does seem to have taken on you know a a whole nother level they should they should fear that i mean you saw what happened to lindsey graham at the airport right right usually you know if lindsey graham's at the airport you get a couple of people with selfies they attacked him they literally i mean you had literally had to have you know tsa and airport police you know protect him and they have been denied something they had been promised for four years that the government of the united states would always be in their power so i've also heard a number of news stories that after biden was actually sworn in joe biden kamala harris became the leadership of the country that a lot of the q anon followers now i i don't know where where they go because he was supposed to have taken over they feel betrayed by him so what do you think now don't don't forget that the basis of the q anon conspiracy theory also included donald trump as this golden hero um interestingly enough i really think that the origins of that came from during the election campaign there was a painting done in russia that showed donald trump vladimir putin and marine le pen the leader of the french front national their right-wing extremist group all in armor like joan of arc right they were all in armor next to each other and they were supposed to be like uh these these heroes bringing what i call you know what we now see is neo-fascism but what i called at the time in one of my books an axis of autocracy to the west and that putin was backing these rich oligarchs these american and french oligarchs to knock down western liberal democracy and to do that the best way to destroy democracy vote it out using democracy right vote autocracy in vote dictatorship and oligarchy in and that almost happened it's just for four years donald trump had been promising them blood sport he had been promising that he would take it to the lips right own the lips the media world that they had so the most virulent amongst them had delved into this fantasy that he was this hero in armor you know long flowing hair and that he was going to destroy liberalism liberalism itself and i mean small l liberalism right anyone that wasn't trump is a liberal progressive as they call him now commie you know chinese-backed communists so you don't think that the q anon because biden is now president you don't think that a big element of that falls away because that key component of trump as the knight in shining arbor armor was supposed to be bringing back the rise of white culturalism and white supremacy in america and to do it they believed in a thing called the storm and the storm was supposed to be donald trump using all elements of u.s government power to arrest take to guantanamo try for treason and execute all democrats hollywood elites and anyone in the news media who opposed donald trump so by the time black lives matter flared up these groups we thought had gone underground and were breaking up after charlottesville the alt-right every one of them popped up right militiamen going into michigan to attack the governor and seize they seized the governor i mean to the to the state house because she asked them to wear masks right right they but the other component of it was their their belief that they were taking over government wasn't happening and that they would have to affect it and what had gone was the you know the phrase alt-right had disappeared and it had broken down to proud boys boogaloo boys militia men uh you know three percenters oath keepers all of these paramilitary groups had one thing in common by summer of 2020. they all wore the make america great again hat so let's talk now about the involvement of the military right a rather i'm sorry let me say the other way around this these groups involvement in the military because they said uh quite a number of them were either active former retired military and police right so to what extent do you go into the military and get radicalized or are you a radical going into the military for training do you are you the same thing with the police department you know i i went through this whole evolution when timothy mcveigh blew up the murrah building timothy mcveigh was timothy mcveigh was the the right-wing extremist terrorism who in 19 i believe is 1985 put up set off a multi-thousand pound car bomb in oklahoma city that killed 168 people that immediately after that bombing they were sure it was an arab a person of arabic i myself as a middle east counter-terrorism professional overseas in europe on a submarine thought somehow somebody got through the southern border built a bomb and it was a middle eastern terrorist interestingly enough we never thought it would be an american that would carry out a weapon of mass destruction attack on that scale but timothy mcveigh was he radicalized in the military unbeknownst to the military i met the state trooper that pulled him over it was a fascinating conversation he said when he approached the car he knew something was wrong with it was an old beater you know cadillac or something and he said no license plate and he had just received right wing extremist training and he saw you know like a gadsden flag a don't tread on me thing and when he looked in the car he saw a kid wearing a military style jacket and he was very cooperative and he said um where you coming from he goes oklahoma city and he said son are you armed and mcvay reaches over opens his jack and goes yes i am like i'm in on it with you i'm one of you we i did this thing i'm i'm part of your system so mcveigh the cop said i have my man this guy thinks i'm with him and that's the whole thing they think white policemen white sheriffs white soldiers are all part of their network due to their ethnicity not due to the loyalty to the oath of the constitution of the united states so well one i i surely wonder what they must think now that the secretary of defense is an african-american person oh well that's that's the cabal putting the putting the fix in on the military right but what does it say i mean still are people radicalized in the military and if that's the case what the heck is going on in our military that doesn't see the development of white supremacy well here you know we've been really busy fighting wars for the last 20 some odd years um usually things that crop up in the armed forces are because someone within their their peer group sees it i mean when i went through in the military in the 80s i had some very open racism even in the intelligence community but usually things were seen at a very low level i suspect that in the era of trump it's sort of like the age of bush we had a lot of violations of of civil liberties and human rights in the armed forces in abu ghraib prison because the the the feeling coming from the white house was was do whatever you need to do to these people and that's why abuses occurred in the era of trump i i think that it was pretty well under control for a while but people in the armed forces come from every aspect of american life right right so you're going to have right-wing extremists you know people who are extremely political but i feel that when the trump administration came in it empowered again the lowest person in any organization to feel that they had a megaphone in the white house and i don't know i'm i mean i haven't been in the armed forces in almost two decades but i live my life like i'm in the armed forces every day and there was just an incident a few days ago where a black sailor had a noose left on his bed on a ship and i wrote to the chief of naval operations and the master chief petty officer of the navy because at the rank that i was in a navy chief this would never have happened in my world all right you know um because but it happened what made it happen what made that sailor think he could get away with it even if it was a joke right right he should have been in mortal terror right of his division chiefs right i was listening to an interview the other day and a former retired military officer said well you know i mean people have freedom of speech in the military and we know those you know elements are there but there's nothing we can do about it yeah like there's i i don't understand that no all right somebody needs to be bought before congress there is something you can do about look when i came when i was in the navy in the mid 80s we had the the great tail hook scandal where navy officers were sexually assaulting harassing and raping women at a conference at the top gun conference of all the navy pilots um in las vegas if i'm not mistaken and that revolutionized what kind of training we received in the navy non-stop for years sexual assault sexual harassment equal opportunity is there any training about white supremacy about any of that not about white supremacy but equal opportunity and we got an extensive amount of equal opportunity yeah this to me this is an equal opportunity white well right wing extremism no there was none and you know i know general austin are now secretary of defense austin former general yes has said that he is going to make this a top priority there's going to be a 30-day stand down to where you know they did this with with islamic terrorism right in the military you know they were looking for you know what we call the insider threat people who were would self-radicalize by watching videos and then would take guns like you know hassan muslims who were in the military who often feel discriminated muslims are in the military since the american revolution and yes they were discriminated against i mentored a young sailor who they literally told him they would not allow him to do any duties because they thought he was a terrorist and they were like bringing ncis onto the ship every week and he was like all i want to do is my job let him do their job the question is what are you reading what are you saying to your shipmates if you're hiding it it's going to out itself at some point like making a noose and putting it on someone's bed and if you're deployed overseas we read your text messages we read your in your emails all right to make sure that you're not spilling operational secrets you know and if you're talking to somebody who's on the fbi watch list there needs to be a fusion cell for that whether you know osi ncis dodge racist communication well we're not really paying attention to that because that's not yeah you know you described yeah well those thoughts all while protected by freedom of speech are also violations of the uniform code of military jobs because they're not protected by freedom of speech in the military right oh we don't have freedom of speech we have freedom to follow orders exactly you know but no jokingly all jokes aside you know we do have to root out extremists and we also need to make it very clear at every rank in the armed forces what general milley did last year after the election which was put out a memo saying we don't serve a man we serve a nation every person is valuable i don't care what their job is i was known as a really hardcore chief when i was in i still have people that hate me from my time in the military you know why because my philosophy my dad was a master chief in the navy he joined the navy at 15 to go to world war ii right and rose to the rank of master chief and served in three wars and he had one philosophy his philosophy was this and i use this all the time get to work right i don't care what you look like all right so long as you're in standards i don't care what you think think i don't care what you do i'm going to see that you do the mission of the armed forces now what if we have people in there who are using the armed forces as a gateway to violence and radicalism right that too can be detected based on their their email associations and you know the military is very flexible about what they can and cannot monitor and we'll see what the secretary of defense does but i the culture of every person in this armed force is equal and is as good as the effort that they put out that's it if there's an officer that believes in the philosophy of q anon you are not fit to serve in the armed forces of the united states if there is a junior sailor who comes in and believes that women are not up to the job that person needs to be out of this game it's as simple as that now now uh some accounts on some stations have said well maybe they weren't trump supporters maybe they were actually antifa so we we've just spent um time talking about these organizations proud boys oath keepers all of that the right wing who is antifa what type of threat are they okay this is i'm doing this pro forma antifa is a generic term for anyone who is an anti-fascist right like there was a joke a couple of years ago when the term when the alt-right was going out and calling themselves you know pro-fascists and all this stuff and the term antifa came up and the commanding general of the 82nd i think was the 82nd airborne or the 101st airborne put out a tweet that said the 101st airborne has a long his a long storied history of anti-fascist activity and it showed these guys at d-day holding a nazi flag after jumping into normandy right and i was like massive troll you know that's the way you do it there are two elements that i think people have mistaken as an organized group there's this group called black block anarchist and black black are these white relatively young anarchists who go to just about every protest in the world no matter what it is and they break and they smash things they used to be famous here in dc for going to like uh the world uh the world bank every time there would be a g7 summit or a world bank summit they would go down to k street and they would smash windows right they put on all black they'd do this stuff when the black lives matter protest started um in the sun in this summer of 2020 these people came to these protests and were leading edge smashers and people starting fires uh there's a famous video in santa monica where two white young white women are spray planing black lives matter you know you know f the police on the side of a starbucks and a black woman from black lives matter comes over goes who are you and why are you putting this stuff here you're not with us why are you writing black lives matter you're white and they were like we're on your side we're on your side and they start smashing windows right black lives matter was not out there destroying things and smashing windows when you start a riot people are going to riot right i'm from philadelphia see what happens when we win the super bowl right they have to literally grease the poles so that they don't tear down 100 000 light fixtures they will riot what you saw here in the capitol was not riot what you saw here was an organized insurrection well you know there were there is this uh scene of the mob you know lunging forward and a group in formation holding the back holding the back of their hands yeah that was an oath keepers group and we saw numerous of them i'm part of a group that is trying to identify military members through the photographs by the equi and what kind of equipment they have i asked at one point uh why aren't you arresting people on the ground hands over your head cross your legs and what they told me is is that well there's just too many of them and i was like law enforcement the enforcement of law collapsed right that day every one of them will tell you that right right some places were self you know you you one the one officer who said when they were trying to grab his pistol and he was appealing to them through his humanity he said if i i only got like 16 rounds and you know they were taking his other magazines and he goes it would have been a bloodbath there it would have been a bloodbath we would have had the massacre on the capitol let me ask you where do we go from here where do we go from here many people that sent in questions wanted to know what to do with their family members that are involved in q anon their family members who believe that it was antifa in disguise and not trump supporters the way it's being characterized on tv in some stations is well i mean it was a riot and you know trump's had a million rallies and that's the first one where there was any violence and you know at least no businesses were harmed and i mean what's the difference between that and what happened in milwaukee and what's happening in portland so what can you do what can you do as an individual when you're in a stage one insurgency which is what we're in where you have a political organization agitating that the current government is powerless and can really do nothing when you have an incident like this insurrection call into doubt their belief system constantly ask do you believe that do you believe that right you cannot be a loyal american patriot and think that this building should have burned or that democracy should have been stopped or that you want to put in a dictator do you believe donald trump should be a sole dictator yes or no but what you have to do is you as the citizen have to bring them into us you have to say hey man or one what you said does not meet any of the values i always confront people with e pluribus unum do you not believe in this well you know do you not know what it means for many one it's literally the motto of the united states from many one i love seeing that first i love seeing the statue of colombia yes which was designed by an african-american woman yes so we are a nation of many people whether you want it or not there will be no dominant tribe and you cannot fight your way to dominance we are a nation of many people men and women who will defend the values that are enshrined in this building and that sit in a case down pennsylvania avenue i love coming to the city and seeing these things we all have the chance to help make america better you might have to talk to your neighbors whether you agree with them or not but let them know that you're an american a true american and patriots the word patriot is not owned by a political group patriot is someone who's loved or a tribe well thank you thank you thank you thank you for this time this was really really important and uh we are at a crossroads in our country and we cannot rest until we get a handle on this and i am hopeful i'm very hopeful that the new administration is actually going to investigate this but i hope that you'll continue to talk with us because the folks in the los angeles area in the 37th congressional district really like to hear from you thank you thank you for spending this time with congresswoman karen bass and our special guest terrorism expert malcolm nance as we seek a way forward after the attack on our capital please let us know your feedback and your suggestions of other experts and topics you might like the congresswoman to explore stay in touch and please wear mask stay distant and stay safe until we can gather together again in person

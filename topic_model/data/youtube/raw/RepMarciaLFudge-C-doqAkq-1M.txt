thank you very much mr. chairman thank you all for being here today mr. Room before I give you the balance of my time to respond to mr. McDonald who just shared with us a communication between he and his lawyers that has now said that you're an outlier in your thought process and to address the question that was just asked by my colleague of course we know the lawyers get paid I mean this is ridiculous but let me just make a couple of comments and I'm going to turn over my time to you sir first we have heard at nauseam about the decision and browning-ferris as my colleague said we've had 35 hearings about this it is interesting that every time my colleagues across the aisle don't like a law they call it uncertain ambiguous unsustainable just because you don't like it doesn't mean you don't understand it and they clearly understand it and I just want to remind our chairwoman Fox that intent is a standard that has been accepted in American jurisprudence for generations it did not start here and lastly I just have to say this I am trying to figure out for the life of me what tim scott has to do with what we are talking about today so he worked at chick-fil-a so what I mean did he bring it up because he's black did he bring it up because he thinks Tim Scott might support his position I take great offense to using a u.s. senator who happens to be my friend in something so ridiculous my time is now yours mr. Reuben thank you in response to the questions about uncertainty first a bit of background I try to be well-versed in the law before I started practicing I was a clerk for a Supreme Court justice I try to be well-versed in the facts because my job is a litigator is to discover and know the facts and apply the facts and I try to understand cases like the browning-ferris decision and the freshy advice memorandum by actually looking to see what's written in those opinions what standards are applied you start with the browning-ferris decision it actually simply reiterates the standard that I quoted before about sharing the essential terms and control over the terms and conditions the standard itself is not objectionable what people seem to be complaining about mr. McDonald and others miss Kennedy is that they have been advised that there's some uncertainty but in each of the instances they've described to me there's no way a litigator would pursue their case on a clap on a joint employer basis which is why of the 9,000 FLSA cases only a handful were ever pursued under joint employer basis what were the facts in BFI we have to focus on them BFI owned the plant it set the shifts it sold the employees where to work it capped their wages it decided when they would have to work overtime it decided how many workers would be working overtime it decided when to stop the assembly line for breaks it controlled the line speed it had the rights of veto any wage hike or wage change that lead point offered it trained the workers it had the power to fire and in fact it did terminate two workers that it didn't want and it had the power to fire the entire workforce those are the facts of browning-ferris and any lawyer looking objectively at those facts under the standard that has been part of the National Labor Relations Act would conclude that that party should participate in collective bargaining browning-ferris that is because it had the right to affect terms and conditions of employment and certainly we haven't talked a whole lot about the Fair Labor Standards Act but the Fair Labor Standards Act mr. Rubin if I could just interrupt you one moment I really would like to yield the last of my time to our ranking member if you would allow me to do that sir

congressman thanks for joining us and first if I could I want to make you get your thoughts on the president's remarks that we played coming into our segment you know what's so interesting about what the president is saying and what Republicans are saying is it's the same thing we've been saying for months there's nothing impeachable here this is a witch-hunt but when you look at the other side Democrats are changing their tune as this goes at first it was a quid pro quo then it's bribery then it's extortion and what's interesting to me also walking through the halls of Congress is Republicans are saying the same thing publicly that we're saying privately our message is not changing Democrats on the other hand publicly they're saying this is about the Constitution this is about what's doing what this is about doing what's right privately they're saying what's the polling show how are we going to convince the American people you shouldn't be having to convince the American people that impeaching the president is the right thing to do they should follow the facts and Democrats are realizing that the polling numbers are not supporting them they're also battling Thanksgiving and Christmas people just aren't in the mood for this at this time of the year so congressman I'm sure people do want a break from from politics around the holidays but I do want to ask you you you said that this although this may not this an inquiry so far may not have discovered anything that's impeachable but has anything been uncovered that concerns you in terms of behavior by the President of the United States why does that even matter the question is should the president be impeached for breaking the law me as a member of Congress first of all the answer your question is no nothing concerns me I think the president's doing a great job that says that question I'm part of Congress but it's not my job to approve or disapprove it's my job to make sure the Constitution is being followed and enforced the Constitution that's what my oath was and what we and Congress are doing right now should be making sure that laws are being followed and that the president is following those laws the president absolutely is what Democrats are talking about what the media loves to harp on is do you approve is what he said right is should he have said that that's not the question here's a question is breaking the law which the president has not done okay so Democrats is you know gonna put the full-court press on drumming up support for articles of impeachment what defense are you and fellow Republican lawmakers planning well first of all the onus the the the pressure is on the Democrats the Democrats have to make this case to the American people the president is innocent until proven guilty they have not come up with that smoking gun that they've been looking for that's why they're so worried about the polls another huge issue for them is this is going from Adam Schiff committee to Jerry Nadler committee say what you want to say about Adam Schiff but the criticism that you have not heard is that Adam Schiff is unable to properly run his committee he is very competent he knows what he's doing I disagree with most of what he does but at least he's competent move over to Jerry Nadler his committee was run just all over the place this summer there was no plan he was saying things that Nancy Pelosi's that one thing to say same I don't actually I expect this to go off the rails I think Democrats are very worried about this going into Jerry Nadler committee I think there is concern that he's incompetent and he's unable to run the actual impeachment process and I think Nancy Pelosi is talking to her lieutenant saying this isn't going to go well if it's managed by Jerry Nadler and very conserved with Howard in they don't have an implant congressman moving forward if a judge impels former White House Counsel Don McCann to testify before the House Judiciary Committee or if not McGann our Republican lawmakers concerned about any potential witnesses who might make it difficult to defend the president to the end in this impeachment process we're not concerned because we know the facts the facts are the president has done nothing wrong there are people that criticize him they don't like some of the things he says for the last four and a half years since he's been running for office this president has been controversial whether you're for him or against him the one thing that everyone can agree on is that he says things that are sometimes extreme and people don't like them some people love them I personally think he's doing a great job and I love his message but Republicans are not worried about what may or may not come out because we know what happened and that is the president is doing a great job he's enforcing the law he's not broken any law he hasn't committed any impeachable events and this is going to prove to be a win for Republicans and the neck election cycle congressman Goodman we good and we have to get to some breaking news so I have to leave it there thank you for your time sir thank you and that great

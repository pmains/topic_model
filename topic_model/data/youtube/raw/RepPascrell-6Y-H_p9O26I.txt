to the point with congressman bill pasgrell focusing on the concerns and issues facing the families of new jersey's ninth congressional district hello i'm congressman bill pascara and i would like to welcome you to this latest edition of to the point reports from local athletic fields and communities across the country indicate that traumatic brain injuries are a growing epidemic according to the u.s centers for disease control each year u.s emergency departments treat an estimated 173 thousand sports and recreation related mild traumatic brain injuries including concussions among children and adolescents from birth to 19 years many of these injuries are suffered by middle and high school students participating in athletics but many schools do not have the resources to adequately diagnose and treat these injuries as a result studies have shown that as many as 41 percent of the high school athletes return to the field before their brain has had an opportunity to heal from a previous concussion they put them in jeopardy of sustaining an even more serious injury or even putting their lives at risk so with me today our three individuals have a great deal of respect for who are working to protect the youngest athletes from the devastating effects of sports related concussions to discuss what we can do to improve their safety on the playing field nikki papier did i pronounce it correctly is a former high school athlete from marvel new jersey who doctors estimate has sustained more than a dozen concussions now a senior at monmouth university she volunteers as an advocate to raise awareness of the dangers of sports concussions nikki was with me when we introduced the contact act which deals with this over four years ago dr rob rayberg as professor and coordinator of athletic training clinical education at william patterson university's department of kinesiology he is also co-founder and executive director of sports safety international an organization working to promote safe participation in sports and physical activity through education and dr steth stahler is the neurology chief for the concussion center at the atlantic neuroscience institute at overlook hospital and summit he actively works with the american academy of neurology sports neurology section on development of awareness and concussion and traumatic brain injury he is also part of new jersey neurological specialists and is a neurologist with the kessler institute of rehabilitation's traumatic brain injury unit and thank you all for being here today it's really a pleasure we've got a lot of stuff to cover we have a very short period of time nikki you've done this before with me not quite in this kind of a setting you were down in washington we brought you there and uh it's important because folks that listen to you made a big difference you made a great impact on their lives as to what you've gone through you're in the seventh grade okay you got your first concussion how did that happen very briefly tell us how it happened um i was going uh going to grab a loose ball and i either collided with someone's head or shoulder and i mean at that time no one really knew what concussions were so i remember getting off the court feeling lousy one of the fathers said your eyes look weird maybe you should go to the hospital did you i went to the hospital where they cleared me to play to return to play in one to two days they did they did did you have a concussion i it's unclear what they ruled it but i did return to play and then a week later something happened where i went up for a loose ball or went for a layup and fell and hit my head on the rolled up wrestling mats at the end of the court so my first two were eight days apart which if now everything is different all the information is different so i feel like they would they wouldn't have returned me to play so soon yeah and uh you had how many concussions in your sports career seven in my sports career you had seven altogether and how many concussions you have out of sports it's hard to say because when i went to my neuropsychologist she went back and looked at everything so because my brain was so susceptible to them every hit in the head we kind of ruled a concussion but it wasn't the number is hard to see we're talking about concussions with national football league football players real hunks you know yeah yeah but we got to understand when we're talking about sports concussions at t-vi we're going across the sports realm right we're going to every sport and most of the time you don't have good prevention you don't have you you don't have the training uh you don't have the equipment to offset a concu a hit to the head and that this is what we're dealing with right now and you're making folks aware now i understand that you're making folks aware of what's going on right now how you do that i talk to people through facebook and different forms of social media i've been people reach out to me i reach out to them even people from my college who gets concussions i sit and talk to them one of my roommates she had a bad one i would sit and talk to her and like let her know that it's normal to feel the way she feels doc rayburg you've heard this you heard the story where are we since this happened and where we are are now as far as you're concerned in terms of taking care of our young athletes from my perspective i think we've uh we've come leaps and bounds uh from from when nikki first had her injury um i there's still a lot of room for improvement and there are a lot of areas and a lot of situations not only in new jersey but nationwide where schools don't have the resources or coaches uh who may see it first or parents even don't have the education to recognize and identify concussion but we certainly are a lot further in understanding um and getting people to understand what they need to be looking for well we're starting to test students before they go out on the basketball court or in the hockey rink or boxing or football or any of the sports just as the nfl is attempting to do and the nba is attempting to etcetera but that test doesn't mean much unless there is something to compare with isn't there that's right uh you have to have a baseline and then if you do have a baseline is the first test right they'll take that before any time they before they're injured before the season begins and that way we have what the brain or a snapshot of it's kind of like the dashboard of your car you know looking at the temperature and the gas gauge and the rpms and all that but it's for your brain and so we look at it what it looks like when the brain is functioning normally and then if they do have an episode where we suspect a concussion we'll have them complete a post test and we'll compare those two measures it took our military just within the last four or five years to begin the process of testing before you go into theater and of course the military did not follow through as we asked in the law which we passed in 2007 through the brain injury task force which is now a robust organization in the congress we started out with as i said before to you off camera a few people you could fit us in a phone booth now everybody wants a part of this because they realize there's millions and millions of people out there who don't have to go to war get a brain injury to get a concussion but it's a whole different situation now but if you don't test after the battle after the sports event what good is it if you get hurt if you get a head injury you have to be tested again in order to make a comparison correct well yeah the some of the programs that are out there can use a set of normative data that's um that's available for the demographic for instance if you have a 16 year old athlete who's injured you don't have a baseline test it will give you information based in general on an athlete of the same size sport age and whatnot it's not perfect but and that's why we really would like to have a baseline test um and more scores are doing this though more schools are testing before you go out there i don't know if you've noticed this nikki the schools i don't know if the high school you went to marble high school i don't know if they test before you go on and they do they do that now yeah they do that now i mean we're lucky enough to have that in place but i know all schools don't yeah and it costs a few bucks but it's well worth it it's worth it and it's also important though that not only that you do the baseline test but that it's interpreted appropriately by a health care provider who understands how to interpret the test both for the baseline and for the price test we wanted to in the contact act which i have in the house and senator menendez has in the senate we would have professionals set up the protocol and and then there would be this baseline and then there would be a follow-up and want to provide some grant money to the schools not not much but to get them going in order to test their athletes because this is carried out you saw what happened in the nfl they swept everything under the rug for 40 50 years and then they had wound up with 45 year old vegetables i've seen them i've been with them i've talked with them and they realize that they can't do this any longer you cannot just sweep it away it's not going away and it is our kids these are own children for sure we don't want to do that doctor what's your what's your take on all of this you're you're into neurology you're into neuroscience uh which everybody's going to say on the listening and watching audience no what about what am i watching here but this is important to their kids their youngsters who want to play athlete i mean you you're you've never do you have kids yes i do how old are you three and one three one would you think were you gonna let your three-year-old play football i probably will but i will educate him prior and have his coaches educate him on proper technique and have the coaches educated and that's the most imperative thing of this is that the education has skyrocketed in the last 10 years probably the last three to four years is when we've had an exponential gain and even the practitioner education has expanded dramatically as a neurologist during residency i had absolutely no training on concussion i did have it on traumatic brain injury you had none no i had traumatic brain injury did i do that now i had to go outside of my residency to learn it i thankfully worked at the veterans hospital in new york so we saw a major tbc why do you think no one uh no one really took took care uh to really care for the youngsters or playing sports out there getting knocked in ahead just as many times as anybody else uh playing sports not that you had to play sports to get a concussion as nikki points out i mean it could happen i fell off a motorcycle 30 years ago and taught me a lesson you know but the point of the matter is this happens people fall off roof off ladders or if anything and most of them just trying to brush it off and never never have a look it's an unfortunate attitude that that's taken amongst you know workers athletes and you know just the average american that well i'll get better i'll get better and by and large the mantra prior to this was rest a little bit and then just get back into things and we're seeing more and more that there's more more complicated steps that need to be taken in order to rehabilitate our athletes and workers in order to get them back into their arenas and that's why education is so important because i think two factors really come into play here one is a lot of people don't realize symptoms that they may be experiencing or their child are experiencing have anything to do with concussion and the second is the fact that it's an invisible injury if i've always said and nick you've heard me say this before if your head suddenly turned green when you had a concussion and it stayed green the entire time you had a concussion there wouldn't be a concussion well we we pay a lot of attention to physical injuries when something you can't see it's difficult to get people to to pay attention to this is just as important and significant could be more significant right nikki exactly i mean there's no crutches or bandages or casts so you're looking at me and i look completely fine but really i have a headache i don't feel good and that was the hardest part but also i think i kind of misled doctors and i mean i misled myself and wasn't completely honest and i think that's the biggest thing that you didn't want to come out of the game of course i was an athlete i wanted to play basketball i didn't want to miss a gamer season or any time off and we all know about ryan doherty and montclair high school student just back in when we met 2008 when you were still at marlborough right and ryan played football for montclair high school got a concussion in one game went back two days two weeks later too soon obviously played got another concussion and died so who knows now we're going to take a minute break we're going to come right back what a fantastic group of people we have with us today and we're talking about traumatic brain injury and concussions and your kids have to concern themselves about this and as parents you better also we'll be right back we're back here discussing traumatic brain injury and sports our kids are out there middle school high school and these little torps that are running around playing they got to know what they're getting into and the parents got to know the coaches got to know we've learned a lot from the military we bring it over to the civilian some good came out of iraq and afghanistan believe it or not besides all the bereavery of our troops and we're learning a lot about the brain right doctor what's neurology neurology is the medicine and science of the brain so how we treat things with regards to concussion what's important about it is concussion when cumulative or occasionally even an individual concussion one time can have long lasting effects on the brain regards to memory performance on a daily level and headaches unfortunately give us some hope about the future about folks like nikki who's sure looks terrifically normal to me uh give us some hope to those people and those players in the nfl and those soldiers who got these blast suffering from these blasts out there in in wartime give us some hope for them i mean what what kinds of things are we looking at to make it easier to get back to somewhat of a normal life or totally normal life sure as research on rehabilitation improves as research on therapies for concussion and most importantly as we educate our practitioners there's a big variance in expertise amongst practitioners amongst the state and the nation in concussion and treating it so as we improve that as well as the public's awareness we're able to protect our athletes our soldiers and our average joes who have concussions on the job on how to recover recuperate and with research eventually to get those therapies in in play vicky anything ring a bell there of course um i think for me the best thing that happened was to obviously stop playing so the time that i stopped till now without having a concussion that helped me get to where i am today how hurtful was that not to be able to get out there with your i went i went through a lot i mean i couldn't really get out of bed i always had a headache 24 7 it wouldn't go away i was always dizzy every time i sat up did you take anything for the headache or just some tylenol did that help um not not really um i mean i was always nauseous i just was in a fog and you're a good student i was and i think that's the worst part of it i went from being a decent student to falling down not not being able to get the grades i want to i mean now i'm okay physically but i still struggle to get the decent grades i get i work i think i work twice as hard to be able to be moderate can you concentrate for a period of time no that's that's hard still um the concentration is the toughest part um sitting down and reading my notes sitting focusing on what the teacher is saying that's the toughest you know you sound like uh to a small degree i'm thinking about these football players that are getting clunk just about every other play i've spoken to them and some are in vegetative states believe me when i tell you it's not an exaggeration i'm not using hyperbole here we don't want our kids there we don't want adults there because this is going to cut down on your lifespan and your quality of life in the first place how would you say your quality of life is now compared to five years ago um well when it all started i was in bed i couldn't move now i'm so much better so much better and i think it's the time and then you're going to a neurologist yes i am and has she been helpful um he has yeah um i'm of course i was on medicine and everything but now i'm i'm okay you got away from the medicine yes great yes great great what are we going to think what do you i saw you not in your head rob what do you think about this well i think that now that we know a lot more uh both clinically and and and know we need to educate our parents athletes and coaches about um nikki's experience for a lot of athletes now if they have a situation like yours is going to be a lot shorter because we know that we're not going to let them uh sustain the second or third or hopefully first we're going to try to prevent it from happening because we want nikki gals and the guys to have the proper equipment to play this sport whichever they choose to play so there's no need to keep your kids out of sports if they're well equipped and are knowledgeable about what has to happen now you know the nfl is changing its rules about how much contact to the head particularly on kickoffs etcetera etcetera etcetera we don't want to make a game out of it but we want to make human beings human beings yeah that's more important than being being called a technique in sports especially football and other contact sports and rule changes may lead the way in prevention concussions will happen it's an accident it's not an intentional injury on the other hand what we do to teach and educate our athletes as well as our coaches on preventing poor technique with tackling in specific and football can help not only prevent concussions as well as spinal cord injuries you know in sports it's bravado too yeah you know you wanna i'm not gonna get out of here i got my clock ring but i'm not i'm staying in but like our soldiers our bravest citizens our soldiers and you know i've talked to many of these guys and gals they never wanted admitted something might be wrong they had symptoms similar to you they're dizzy at times they got tremendous headaches nothing nothing now these people leave the service without the service knowing about their condition or trying to find out about the community it works both ways then they go into society they go back to their families they go back to their job then we have real problems don't we doctor that's true there's things that can happen that are psychologic and unfortunately psychiatric from concussions and multiple concussions especially post-traumatic stress disorder and things like that what's post-traumatic stress disorder unfortunately it's a psychiatric condition which develops from one or more traumas to the head and not necessarily and i'm using that in a concussive stance post traumatic stress disorder can happen from non-concussive injuries obviously but in this context that's where it connects 98 of the soldiers that i saw in i've seen in germany uh whether the and and those here bethesda or fort belvoir 98 post-traumatic stress disorder and it's a and it's a horrible condition it can affect family life it can affect obviously personal life and professional life and when you have all of those things affected by our veterans it's hard for them to function and integrate well talk about the athlete here yes well if the athlete that can happen as well and on a young student athlete such as yourself it can affect your long-term development thankfully you've overcome it and you're you're really a miracle and how well you've developed and progressed from this but someone to have 12 concussions is a lot i know and i think another getting back to the post um traumatic stress i mean i know i was depressed for a while because i mean we're seventh and eighth grade all my friends decided to move on obviously why wouldn't they and i'm still here trying to rebuild my life and i think that was another well you're doing a good job thank you what are you doing at william patterson along these lines tell us very briefly what kind of work you're doing well william patterson on the front lines i and the coordinator clinical education for the athletic training education program and athletic trainers are the primary care health care providers that work in high schools in colleges now more and more in youth sports we make sure that before they leave before they graduate they all not are just have a baseline awareness or concussion but they are well aware of the symptoms know how to educate parents athletes and coaches and know where to get the correct help if they do see that an athlete does does need additional help for concussion so you've been out william patterson for how long uh for 10 years now so have you seen what's the major difference you've seen from day one you stepped down to the campus and now with regard to all of our athletes day one concussion when it comes to concussion education there was none for athletes and concussion for health care providers was at least for athletic trainers a page or two maybe on the 500th page what about now now their entire textbooks their education programs in new jersey in particular for athletic trainers you can't renew your license to practice unless you've taken concussion education say that again say that again you can't renew your license to practice athletic training unless you can demonstrate you've completed concussion education every two years there aren't too many doctors that i knew beyond 10 years ago that ever even discussed this that's true why it's not part of our educational uh protocols when we're in residency when we're in that about over 3 million americans get a concussion traumatic brain injury every year so many within the sports realm somebody outside the sports realm you wouldn't think that this wouldn't become a specialty thankfully now it has and in in my discipline in the american academy of neurology in the past three years we've really established a sports neurology section there's actually fellowships that are finally implemented so we're getting there we're making progress but when i was in medical school years ago we didn't have a single lecture on concussion when i was in residency like lawyers not having any discussions on ethics in college on law school which up until 2010 15 years ago was the case not in all schools but most law schools anyway who cares about ethics who cares about the brain you know the fascinating thing the more the more i read about what we're doing uh to zero in on how we can improve people's lives soldiers lives we had a soldier come up from florida up to the kessler institute uh three years ago a marine was wounded very severely couldn't even move his fingers come up here the kessler had taught him to he could move his fingers he had made such tremendous strides and then his parents told me he had come up with him uh they resided in florida they have to he has to we have to send him back now they told us that he's had enough up here you know we've got to find out more and more about the brain we got to find out more and more how we can develop those parts that are still intact to help them and as i said mapping the brain and and one of the things we were talking about the other day to watch the brain in action so that you can fix the damage you think we can fix the damage most times well it's it's difficult it's difficult to repair a damaged brain unfortunately many times the brain is irrevocably damaged when it occurs but we can compensate we can compensate there's thankfully a big area in the brain that can compensate unfortunately when damage does occur it can be permanent with concussion that's not most often the case but with a multiple multiple events that can can happen well president obama wants this to be the new frontier it's like going into the space uh going into the ocean okay now we're talking about how about our brains and they control so much of our body uh and they control so much of our being and we don't know very little about it we know very little about it in the past five years has been more research and i couldn't believe this until i checked it over and over again more research and more progress in the past 500 years with the brain just in five years i mean we are on the threshold now people want this is one of the areas people are going to find jobs in doing but this one in the area where we're going to break through to get people not maybe whole again but close to it and this is why it's so critical to protect that organ it's something we're learning more and more about and over time can we repair damaged brain hopefully we will get to that point you know it really gets me kicked off these companies that have put out these fraudulent helmets for different sports con artists con artists and uh thank god the nfl has you know gotten serious about this and putting on the right equipment what is the right there's never a perfect helmet yeah i mean unless you want to make robots out of what's going on out there and we don't want to do that but you could certainly have great protection we did it with shoulder pads knee pads we didn't do it with the helmet and a lot of the female sports a lot of look young ladies are the last ones to put on gear for the sports why is that i mean i don't know i know in girls lacrosse like there's certain rules where you can't get hit um there's no real protection for basketball i mean i don't know exactly how much a helmet would help i mean for me it wouldn't because my brain was so hurt already yes but you would have had one before or some kind of protection we're going to have to think about that nikki thank you so much uh yeah dr rayberg thank you so much and uh dr uh stuller thank you so much also what a great little discussion sorry we didn't have a lot of time but you got in knowledge education is what people need they're asking themselves what president obama asked if i had a son i don't know if i'd want him to play football and we wanted to play football if he wants to play football by the way but he needs to have protection and as a parent we ought to know what the heck is going on so we can help them out there the school can be helpful the coach can be helpful and what protocol do you have should you have a physician at every sports event that that becomes a pretty expensive proposition well what can we do at least we're going in the right direction thank you for all of your work i was very proud to talk to three of you thank you for coming on the show and i want to thank you for watching this edition of to the point you've heard our thoughts uh i'd like to hear what you think about today's show if you have any comments concerns or questions stay tuned the address phone number website address will appear in a moment thank you you

well thank you Andrea it's good to be with you I don't want I don't want to bury the lead here have you are are you what are you guys hearing about this second round of documents well I'll tell you what the first round was very concerning and now that we've seen a second round I'm uh gonna be asking the FBI hey uh why aren't you executing a search warrant to find the third Trove of documents you because I'll tell you this is absolutely unacceptable you have a double standard here you have a raid on President Trump now mind you this really isn't the same thing you have a president and you have a vice president the president has the authority to declassify documents the vice president does not so there is no way under any circumstances that classified documents should be in the hands in the possession of a vice president after they have left office and yet what we find out is that these the first Trove of documents is in the Penn Biden Center in in Biden's private office locked in a closet and his attorneys are the ones that actually uh find these records and give these records up and President Biden or vice president at the time were uh former vice president at the time was there from 2018 through 2020 three years so how many more documents are they you know where is Nara in this the National Archives and Records Administration obviously their statement is false they say that that they have all of the classified documents from the Obama Biden Administration obviously they don't so where are the rest of them why is the FBI not engaged this is not a question uh as to whether or not Biden's lawyers currently did the right thing it sounds like they did the question is why were the documents there in the first place and how did they get there who signed them out where's the chain of custody how did this happen and what what's in these documents you're exactly correct and just be reminded these documents are special compartmented information that means it's got to be top secret top secret information how in the world did they get there you're exactly right and the oversight committee is going to figure out going to find out we're going to investigate what in the world is going on here uh our our chairman sent a letter yesterday to Nara to find out what in the world they know the communications that's gone on between them and the Department of Justice and the White House regarding these documents now you've got just reporting a second Trove of documents um you know this is not good this is not good for the president of the United States because the real question is here you know who made significant donations to the Penn Biden Center that's the Chinese Anonymous donations in excess of 15 million dollars so is the you know how compromise is Biden you know what are they getting for their 15 million dollars let me move on to this grounding of seven thousand uh flights I mean we were in a panic when a pipeline was shut down by an alleged hacking now we've got no information when do we get the truth as to whether or not this is a hack by Russia or China or North Korea I'm very skeptical that this is simply a failure of a computer system uh it I don't think that's really going to be the case here I think we're going to find out that there's some nefarious work going on that's just my gut feeling I have uh you know nothing to back that up other than the fact that this is massive and across the board how in the world can can a simple computer system fail like this and ground all flights across the country obviously our transportation secretary has no answers President Biden has no answers um we got a problem here in leadership let me tell you something on my radio program on SiriusXM Patriot I had one call after another from pilots from air traffic controllers from FAA employees now this is all Anonymous I can't verify anything that they're saying they're saying they don't spend the budget on upkeep of systems they're spending more time on diversity and woke programs so look again this is just people sounding off on the phone anonymously on my radio program but if Chuck Schumer comes along and says see this is why we need a bigger budget is it that you need a bigger budget or is the question what have you been doing with the budget all this time you're absolutely correct and uh and I'm thankful that I will have some input into that process into the monies that will be uh given to the executive branch to execute in in these areas that are necessary for the United States transportation system to continue on uh and I think that it needs to be looked at very critically where are the 51 former members of the intelligence community that told us that the hunter Biden laptop story was Russian disinformation by now the 9-1-1 system also shut down across the state of Michigan if somebody was doing a test run for a serious hack of our of our electronic infrastructure uh I think we ought to know oh I think that's a great Point uh and I think that uh it's up to us to figure out uh what's going on here uh the oversight committee I think is going to be doing its investigations but the executive branch better hurry up and get this right because the country is not going to put up with this we have to have our transportation secure we have to be able to to take off and land airplanes safely and uh you mentioned uh Amtrak trains we you know the entire transportation system has to maintain has to be maintained secure in this country and I think we see failure after leadership after failure after leadership here one minute left I know Alejandro mayorgas is facing uh the articles of impeachment from your colleague representative Pat Fallon but where's he on this this is the essence of Homeland Security oh absolutely and I mean secretary mayorkas has shown time and time again that he is another example of failed leadership so I'm looking forward to uh the impeachment resolution coming forward in the house of being debated uh I'm I think it'll be done in judiciary I'm really uh I mean the country needs to hold majorca's responsible uh for his uh lack of um of enforcing our laws so I'm looking forward to that in the house I think the country is too we need a change in leadership representative Andrew Clay thanks so much for joining us I'm out of time thank you Andrew

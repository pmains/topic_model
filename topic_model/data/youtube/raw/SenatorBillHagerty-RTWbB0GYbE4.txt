okay senator bill haggerty is with me republican from tennessee he's at bill hagerty tn on twitter senator it's great to have you on i've got a number of really big topics to get to with you today and i guess i'll start with uh what we spoke about last um which was i think back in august uh when you were with me but most recently we talked about our dependence on china and trying to get america off of our china addiction and one of the most unbelievably stunning stories of the this week is watching the secretary of state tony blanken and the national security adviser mr sullivan uh really getting a torched by the chinese in anchorage on american soil and embarrassed i think and it was something that is it was humorous for a right-wing audience like mine but it is not really that humorous it's really kind of scary it doesn't feel like the object administration uh has a grasp on the fact that china is our adversaries and we're so intertwined with them it seems very hard to disentangle uh where are we at on this what can we be doing at this moment well alex i share your concern and again thank you for having me back on with you and your listeners today the um what we saw in in in the open i think was very concerning to most americans frankly i wouldn't have agreed to have an open forum like that because the chinese only going to use that to pump propaganda back to their home country correct that was a show and um what they really should be doing is understanding that china is our strategic adversary uh that's that's a term that i want to continue using alex they're our strategic adversary and the byte administration has been backsliding ever since they came into office if you think about it they rejoined the world health organization pumping millions and millions of dollars back into that organization that you know was highly influenced by china they rejoined the paris climate accord which china has no obligations under for decades to come yet we're going to be putting ourselves at a disadvantage immediately and i think even more obvious is cancelling the keystone xl pipeline if that oil is not coming to america i can tell you where it's going to go alex it's going to get piped straight to china they're going to have the advantage of low-cost oil and when we turn to try to make new jobs in the green energy sector well where are we going to get the turbines where are we going to get the solar panels they're all made in china so again china is lapping all the way to the bank on this one and it's embarrassment i have been i've been optimistic though china did step up um and increase the activity uh with the virtual meeting of the quad nations uh you know president trump really tried to strengthen and expand the quad i worked on this very much when i served as ambassador of japan but for our listeners the quad is not only america but japan india and australia and we do significant naval operations in the area we need to strengthen our economic ties for those countries because we all have a unified interest in dealing with china in a straightforward manner and pushing back on china as they continue their their you know aggressive activity in the region uh you know the couple things there that i think we should expand on briefly and noting that the bind administration did help whether advert or inadvertent uh create propaganda for china and we've been documenting this at breitbart they're uh their media which is all propaganda arms of their communist party there has been just doing victory lap after victory lap for days and so they really did use that as a propaganda coup and but it's not just our limited to our government a lot of american media outlets are working to give china propaganda victories again this is rarely discussed in uh in american media at all that we are aiding china so often with the way we behave and our companies do the same thing too you know they'll speak out loudly against any injustice but they won't say a word in china um you know you think about the nba you think about you know large companies that are very vocal here in america but the china market is too attractive for them to speak up over there you know the silence on hong kong um the the silence on genocide is is really uh really amazing i mean even president president biden you know after he spoke on the phone with president xi talked up china's genocide to quote different cultural norms no that's not right genocide is genocide you should call it what it is and we've got to quit you know walking so gently around china china again is our strategic adversary and what they understand is power and strength we need to stand up to them the same way president trump did yeah and it's such a scary thought that it's the corporations too and you're correct to note that gas prices you also mentioned i filled up over the weekend and was absolutely stunned this is all a tax on working middle class americans and lower class americans because just everyone that they tend to need more gas because they commute longer and they cannot work remote and do jobs from their computers as often and again where is the media on this one where are they pointing out the blind administration policies are penalizing lower middle class americans right now you were absolutely right on this alex that pain is very much felt in tennessee you know our population commutes much further than you know northeastern corridor folks who are able to ride a train or you know may live in walking distance to their office this is a this is a just as you say another hidden tax that the by the administration because of their knee-jerk decision to just undo everything president trump did has put ourselves in a weaker economic position they're putting us in a far weaker strategic position if you think about it under the trump administration we finally got to a point of energy independence we actually became a net exporter of energy and i worked very hard as u.s ambassador to japan to get the japanese to import more united states energy they put billions of dollars of investment into place to do just that and my view was we were not only exporting energy we were exporting freedom because we were removing their reliance on countries like russia like iran you know those countries that don't necessarily have the strategic interest of our allies at heart we should be strengthening our relationships to our energy capabilities rather than weakening ourselves and again what we've done by killing projects like the keystone pipeline and stopping you know stopping federal leasing federal land leasing and allowing people to access you know energy there what we're doing is making ourselves again more dependent on countries like china because we have to go there to get these alternate uh alternate sources like wind like solar sure let me ask you about tennessee i was i don't have any data to back this up but i'll just tell you anecdotally as people are trying to leave the cities and i think a lot of people who are consider themselves conservative americans are trying to move out of blue states and and into purple and red states and anecdotally i'm seeing a lot of people going to florida a lot of people going to texas and a lot of people go into tennessee are you seeing that and if so are you seeing the demographics changing because some of this is scary to me because i i don't want all the liberals to move from from the states they ruined and then go ruin the the red and purple states so i'm kind of fearful that a little bit but what are you seeing indeed alex now i i we we are certainly seeing the phenomena of more and more people moving to our state i think the reason is because we've had strong solid conservative policies in place we've had the benefit of a conservative legislature for years we've got one of the best business climates in america we don't have a state income tax which is very attractive you're sitting in california or new york illinois states like that that are putting all their problems on the backs of the taxpayers we've been very conservative in terms of managing our state and we balance our budget i think what has been you know particularly offensive to us is to see what the democrats did jamming through this 1.9 trillion dollar quote pandemic relief package that had less than 10 percent to do with the pandemic and it was hugely a bailout of blue states and blue cities that have mismanaged their operations so again they're not being held to account in these blue states and blue cities their bad policies will continue because they've been bailed out yet again by the federal government and i think the people that can and have the means to do it are seeing the writing on the wall and they're bailing out as they move to states like tennessee i hope they appreciate the reason that we are doing it well is because of our conservative policies and i hope that they're not going to try to import a liberal perspective when that in fact has failed them in the states that they're fleeing from um i want to turn our focus to the border which is a crisis it's an invasion it's whatever you want to call it but the problem is is that we don't really know exactly what's going on because the body administration is not being open with the public why aren't they being open with the public well we know the answer to that because it will make the buy administration look very bad if they are open with the public you've written a letter in this regard what's in the letter and what do we need to know well i asked some very simple questions i mean i asked the biden administration since president biden took office how many of these migrants have been released in the united states by the border patrol by ice i want to know how many of them are in tennessee right i want to know how many of these children have spent more than 72 hours awaiting transfer to a health and human services facility they won't answer that what percentage of the migrants that have been apprehended at the border have actually been tested for covet 19 and how many have been tested positive you know we've been expected to lock down our communities we've been expected to shut our kids out of school yet biden has opened the border for these folks and and let you know let them move in i i presume the answer is that they aren't testing them they certainly aren't getting them all tested and i'd like to know how many have tested positive i've heard some numbers they're very very concerning and you know i really want to know why did they remove the stay in mexico policy the the the migrant protection protocol that had a dramatic impact of keeping the people that were seeking asylum you know south of the border the mexican government was even protecting the border now they went straight to catch and release they opened the door and it's a flood gate right now it's been an open invitation and when you offer stimulus checks the illegal immigrants i mean what sort of incentive is that alex it's it's all the wrong incentives and that's why they've got a crisis of their own making on their hands right now and it's really threatening the safety and security of states like mine we're seeing an increase in drug trafficking right now i've talked to several sheriffs yeah and in human trafficking it's terrible it's it's just the stories are horrible and that so so here's the next question senator and here's the next question and this is one that i've been asking all the politicians who've been on the show and elected leaders because it is so frustrating for audiences like mine at this moment because just noting that biden is ruining the country it's not a very satisfying thing to talk about every morning for three hours on talk radio so so what what can we be doing right now what is our recourse because these policies are so disastrous and they're taking such rapid effect what should we be doing right now well you know we we've had a number of uh a number of delegations moving to the border right now one thing that we're trying to do on the republican side is shine light on this again you know i i've tried to get answers from the biden administration and they've not been forthcoming whatsoever but i'm going to continue pushing this and i think the fact that you are talking about it alex will make a difference right now they're trying to hide this they're trying to act like it's not a crisis i mean when i watch jin saki say that they don't want to call it you know they don't want to give a name to it or whatever right they're trying to hide from this crisis and the american public is waking up to what uh biden is is bringing forth to us if we think about just just the exposure to covet that's coming across the border absolutely and how how different the treatment is for someone who's not a citizen versus the treatment that our own citizens and our own school children are going through i think this is going to create a groundswell that's going to force the administration into action yeah and it just it's so the dominoes just are there's so many of them um and you noted this on your twitter about how much fentanyl has been seized coming over the border uh we've already in fiscal year 2021 which is i guess that starts for whatever reason in october november what is the math on that senator someone's got to figure that out i'm going to run for office just to make fiscal year start in january with the normal year that's going to be my platform but we've already surpassed fiscal year 2020 in five months i mean this is just so devastating and again a responsible media we'd be talking about this constantly and you know going back to our original discussion about china you know where the fentanyl is being manufactured of course you know where it's coming from and and the chinese are coming to mexico and they're coming up we were there in november 2019 we did a huge documentary down there and senator and and we saw we witnessed chinese nationals illegally immigrating crossing the rio grande we were there we watched it app on their own two eyes bingo alex i mean you're putting you're putting your finger right on it they won't talk about it in the media but that border is a huge problem and people just focus on the migration aspects of it but the drug trafficking and human trafficking all of the illegal activity with folks that are on you know various watch lists uh that should not be gaining admission to this country all they have to do is go to mexico and and then they walk it's a huge problem and china is pumping this fentanyl into mexico again where it's manufactured and used as a proponent of drugs that are that are coming in and killing our kids in tennessee um let me let's change gears i've got a minute or so left i'm sure you you've been i've been very generous with your time you also noted on your twitter that this is the i guess the 11th anniversary of obamacare i had a very strange experience trying to help a friend of mine get uh health care and she's lower income and though not ultra low but pretty low income and the we're so uh makes too much money for for government assistance so she goes on to the exchanges and i mean we're talking a week and a half's worth of pay for to be underinsured on the obamacare exchanges i it's such a disaster and i do fear it's going to lead us to eventually a purely socialized medical system where are we at 11 years after obamacare uh we're not in a good place alex i mean that program is so complex there's so much social engineering going on in the program too that you almost need a graduate degree to be able to decipher various plans the the cost of it is exorbitant because they keep adding on all of these things again back to social engineering that very few people need and want but they're being forced to pay for uh it really is uh designed poorly too again the incentives aren't aligned properly so people can opt in if you know if and as they need it as opposed to to being um to being in the system the whole time and properly you know properly creating an insurance pool they're much better private options but those options have been priced out of existence and regulated out of existence so people are not allowed to get the type of program they want and they need for their family they've got to have yet another one-size-fits-all solution from washington that's far too expensive unfortunately you're correct in all this senator bill hagerty i really appreciate it come back whenever you like it's great to be back on with you thank you so much yeah we appreciate it so much

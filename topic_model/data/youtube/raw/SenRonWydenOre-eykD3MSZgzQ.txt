thank you madam chair and thank you madam chair and Senator Cantwell for your leadership we of course have the fire borrowing language on the books I think that is going to be helpful for the long term Ms Christensen we look forward to getting the plan at the end of June on how you're gonna deal with the backlog on hazardous fuels reductions that's what we talked about here in this committee and I very much appreciated the fact that you've been in discussions with us about how you're gonna be attacking that and I look forward to that as well I think the country very much wants to know what the game plan is for reducing those hazardous fuels for the country and sometimes it feels like all of us as individual senators are running weather Bureau's because our citizens are so concerned about this for the country may is the ominous month for the fire season and that really traditionally gives you a sense of where things are and like many of my colleagues it looks like we're gonna have some real challenges in Oregon this summer and by the way our friend senator Heinrich is Exhibit A for this proposition the reason he is not with us today is because he's in New Mexico where he's dealing with with fire so this is not some kind of abstract theory so let me if I might talk to you about this air tanker issue in my state as was the case in many places they felt they didn't have enough tankers last summer so I think a lot of people are gonna listen to this and say well are they playing a shell game back in DC they're gonna have this kind of tank or they're gonna have that kind of tanker I know that is not your intentions so let me ask it this way you've got this plan let's say there are not enough tankers period lives are on the line lives that sometimes can be affected by hours not even days what do you do in that kind of situation well senator you know we really appreciate the concern of the citizens and I would be delighted if we could have a little window into the intelligence the predictive services and the 24-hour decision-making that is done at the at the geographical area and at the national area so when we are in those high preparedness levels we call them preparedness level four and five where nationally we have to prioritize the resources each geographic area and for Senator Cantwell and and you it's the North the Pacific Northwest geographical area the executives and their key fire leadership are meeting hourly and updating the situation and that feeds into the National Interagency Fire Center where the national group right there I think that's very constructive and it's also in English because so much of what goes on and fire is hard to comprehend to people I believe what you've just said is you use your predictive services and then on an ongoing basis really hourly are then able to deploy the assets you have what if you don't have enough assets in other words you make as judgment that you just don't have enough assets which has been the case over the years or even the best planning I mean people's intentions right you don't have enough assets what do you do then yes so it's a it's a prioritization that's what I was getting it's a tiered prioritization of the most critical threats to humans and communities first generally critical watersheds and the like and then we do have additional surge capacity that we can bring on where does the surge capacity come from these just tankers that are somewhere else yeah that aren't part of the two categories you told senator Cantwell about but this is kind of a third category yes surge category that you can bring in if you just don't have enough yes where do they come from the Department of Defense the mobile aviation units the modular you know many of them are there we have seven yeah seven seven of those and then generally by the time we are in the significant part of the fire year we can we say fire year in the West we can bring our partners down from Canada are two additional surge capacities and then we are putting out additional call when needed and later in the summer well we anticipate having at least five more call when needed so up to thirty I am over my time and I just want to close by saying I think you're working very hard at this and your plan offense and that is really the key and I would just like it if you could also furnish to the committee through Senator Murkowski and Senator Cantwell a written answer to what I just asked about when there aren't enough tankers I had never really heard a whole lot about this sort of surge capacity group of tankers and I knew a little bit about defense and I was chair of the committee Senator Murkowski and I used to talk about this so you could get that to it and writing but I wanted understood I think you're working very hard at this and your relations with keeping us informed has been very constructive we appreciate it thank you madam chair thank you

. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: HOW   MUCH TIME. MR. NEAL: TWO MINUTES. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE   GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED FOR TWO  MINUTES. MR. WELCH: MR. SPEAKER, I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHORS OF THIS BILL. WHAT DO YOU HAVE AGAINST   STUDENTS?  YOU'RE IMPOSING AN OPPORTUNITY   TAX. A YOUNG VERMONTER WHO WANTS A  CERTIFICATE IN WELDING OR A  DEGREE FROM COMMUNITY COLLEGE  AND GETS TUITION ASSISTANCE FROM AN EMPLOYER HAVE TO PAY TAXES ON THAT.  IF THEY BORROW MONEY FROM THE  VERMONT STUDENT ASSISTANCE   CORPORATION THEY HAVE TO PAY   MORE BECAUSE THEY CAN'T DEDUCT   THAT INTEREST. AND BY THE WAY THE VERMONT   STUDENT ASSISTANCE CORPORATION   HAS TO CHARGE HIGHER INTEREST  BECAUSE WE'RE ELIMINATING  PRIVATE ACTIVITY BONDS AND THEY  DON'T GET THE BENEFIT OF THE   MUNICIPAL BOND RATES.  AND ANOTHER QUESTION, WHAT HAVE  YOU GOT AGAINST TEACHERS?  THEY REACH IN THEIR POCKET AT  THE BEGINNING OF SCHOOL TO BUY   SCHOOL SUPPLIES AND THEY LOSE  THE DEDUCTION. AND ANOTHER QUESTION, WHAT DO  YOU HAVE AGAINST PEOPLE WHO HAVE A LOVED ONE WITH ALZHEIMER'S   THEY CAN'T DEDUCT THE COST OF  MEDICAL CARE.  THAT WAS THE RETIREMENT THEY   WERE HOPING TO SEND ON.  THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: MEMBERS ARE REMINDED TO ADDRESS THEIR  COMMENTS TO THE CHAIR. MR. WELCH SPB I HAVE ANOTHER   QUESTION, I ASK IT OF THE  LEADERSHIP, WHAT HAPPENED TO   DEMOCRACY. WE WERE PROMISED AN OPEN   PROCESS. AND THERE WAS A MODEL FOR THIS.  IT WAS PRESIDENT REAGAN AND DAN  ROSTENKOWSKI.  MONTHS OF HEARINGS, WITNESSES  TESTIFYING ABOUT THE BILL, THIS  WAS WRITTEN IN SECRET. AND BY THE WAY NEW YORK  AMENDMENTS.  WE COULD ASK 435 MEMBERS OF  CONGRESS WHETHER WE SHOULD STICK IT TO THE STUDENTS LIKE WE'RE  DOING IN THIS BILL AND 435 OF US WOULD ALL STAND UP FOR THE   STUDENTS.  BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, NOT A SINGLE  ONE OF US IS GIVEN THE TUNT TO   ASK THE QUESTION DO WE WANT TO   STICK IT TO OUR STUDENTS WHO   WANT TO GET A WELDING DEGREE OR  A COLLEGE DEGREE?  THAT'S DISGRACEFUL AND IT'S  INEXCUSABLE AND IT'S WITHIN THE  CONTROL OF THE MAJORITY AND  THEY'RE DENYING US THE   OPPORTUNITY. HERE'S THE BIG DEAL THAT WE  KNOW.  THIS BILL WAS WRITTEN BY AND FOR THE DONOR CLASS. THAT HAVE FLOODED AND  CONTAMINATED THIS POLITICAL  PROCESS WITH BILLION OF DOLLARS  IN OUR CAMPAIGNS.  I SAYING MR. SPEAKER, DEFEAT   THIS BIL

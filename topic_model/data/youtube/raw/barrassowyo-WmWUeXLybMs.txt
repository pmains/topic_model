Wyoming Senator John brass who is Chairman of the Senate Republican conference and ranking member of the Senate energy and natural resources committee joins us now great to see you thanks for being here so I don't know is this a president that's showing that he means business when it when it comes to Bringing Down oil and gas prices in this country senator no this is all about affordable energy that's what the American people are concerned about and I've been traveling all around the state of Wyoming and continuing to run into people who were too many who are living with this nightmare of having to choose gas they can't afford groceries they can't afford heating their homes which they can't afford gas is a dollar fifty a gallon more today than it was the day that Joe Biden came into office but when you take a look at this radical climate agenda that Joe Biden and every Democrat is for if they're allowed to continue in control in in Washington we're all going to be left cold in the dark and hungry so people are suffering they're falling further and further behind in this uh in this Joe Biden economy and what we just need to do is to make sure come election day we get the Republicans in the house and the Republicans in the Senate if we want energy that is Affordable available and reliable the Democrats are against that they like to see the price of energy up forces more people to electric vehicles okay so uh that was the president earlier this morning uh vowing consequences on Saudi Arabia but I want to play this of President Biden in a brand new interview it aired yesterday also promising consequences listen there's going to be some consequences for what they've done with Russia what kind of consequences Menendez says suspend all arms sales is that something you'd consider I'm not going to get into what I'd consider and what I have in mind but there will be there will be consequences okay so that's the president I don't know um we'll see uh he's got members of his own party Dick Durbin saying the Saudis can't be trusted he says I would just advise the president if he asked that we've all learned a lesson from Saudi Arabia in the last week or so uh that they cannot be trusted he tried his best to reach out to him and it didn't work said Dick Durbin I think he's having second thoughts about a relationship and I certainly am too I think bottom line the question is why are we turning to Saudi Arabia in this capacity when we have so many of our own resources right here at home you you are a hundred percent right it's not Saudi Arabia that's holding a gun to our head or OPEC it is Joe Biden who's holding a gun to the head of the American people when it comes to energy we can never expect OPEC to provide us energy that is Affordable available or reliable we have it here in the ground Sandra today we're producing two million barrels a day less than we should be and it's because the Democrat policies which are not allowing us to explore for that energy not allowing us to use the infrastructure and when OPEC came up with their decision and the White House was so panicked as you said it wasn't because they were going to cut it's because they were going to do it now and the elections are coming they didn't say don't cut they said hey wait a month to make the decision because they knew it was going to drive up prices and this group OPEC plus the plus is Russia that means Russia's in the Huddle when they get together and call the plays the president was once again no surprise to your viewers caught flat-footed you know and the Democrat from California was on with us earlier on this program and we thank him for coming on but it's hard it's hard to see the constant blame everywhere but the White House policies that are driving these Energy prices higher in fact I wrote it down as he said it because he plays blame on Saudi Arabia the Federal Reserve and Vladimir Putin but not the current White House policies let's listen to to rokana first I blame the Saudis I mean they are totally outrageous and ungrateful in cutting production I do blame the FED they were buying back corporate bonds and mortgages for way too long and I blame Putin's War which has aggravated Supply chains and of course the pandemic which did that so I guess my question is if we have an Administration that can't acknowledge what got us here how can we expect them to fix it well you're right the Democrats have ignored the fundamental truth that we are better and stronger as a nation if we are selling our energy to our friends than having to buy it from our enemies but that's the position the Democrats have put us in by basically taking us from energy dominance that we were before Joe Biden came into office to energy dependence today and American families are suffering when they go to the gas station and try to pay for guests and I think the prices are going to continue to go up all the way through elections and you're right we need to be using American Energy we have it here we have the know-how to how to how to get it how to use it that will bring down the prices for us here at home and make others around the world less dependent upon the bad guys which is where we are now all right we all keep covering it Senator thank you very much for joining us on that thanks Andrew Mike

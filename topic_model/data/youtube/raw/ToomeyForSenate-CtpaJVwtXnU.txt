good morning how are you dude oh just a fantabulous what did you think about about last night's shot heard round the world yeah well it really was wasn't it mm-hmm no I you know I i think that the American people are just continuing to speak very very loudly and clearly about their opposition to the excesses of one-party rule when it's completely captivated by the the left wing of that of that party and we we saw it in Virginia in the gubernatorial election we saw it in New Jersey in the gubernatorial election we saw it when in Pennsylvania six out of seven statewide judicial candidates were Republicans who were elected and then last night to watch the seat formerly occupied by Ted Kennedy notice I didn't say Ted Kennedy see that way occupied we'll see well exactly right and it is the people feed and and you know there was I think a fence on the part of some of the Democrats in Massachusetts that they're entitled to this after all it's been actually within the Kennedy family for 50 years literally so so this is I think just an incredibly encouraging and healthy reaction that says wait a minute these guys are just trying to go too far too fast too far to the left we don't need to have the government take over health care and spend over a trillion dollars of money we don't have with all kinds of tax increases and all kinds of mandates and forcing people to do this and that and that we don't need that we need reforms but not that we don't need a 1.4 trillion dollar deficit last year another 1.4 trillion this year and by the way they want to launch new stimulus bills we didn't need to be bailing out every failing company and and they're proposing more so what I see happening across the country and certainly very much yesterday is it the American people say whole wait a minute you you know yet we voted for a change in 2008 but this is not what we had in mind let's focus on what really matters focus on growing our economy let's get the economy back on track let's make some sensible reforms that help make health care more affordable and more accessible but we don't need to turn the whole system upside down and I really think that's what I'm hearing across Pennsylvania that's what I think that people were saying in Massachusetts yesterday no you're a small business guy and you've been involved in the club for growth we I just had a lengthy conversation before you came on the air with a small business owner who before this guy that you just heard who said that when the Republicans were in charge they didn't do squat for small businesses that true well I don't think that's true although I think there's a lot of Republicans did wrong when they were in charge and I was very critical I thought all the spending was terribly excessive the deficits were too high gear marks were a terrible abuse of the system and I opposed those things when I was in the house and I've imposed them on the campaign trail so certainly there were things the Republicans did that you know I think was a big mistake I think lowering taxes uh was very helpful for small business lowering marginal income taxes you know most small businesses are organized as what we call subchapter S which means they don't pay corporate income taxes their tax burden flows directly to the owners and and so when you lower marginal income tax rates you lower taxes on small businesses and that makes it that makes it possible for people to expand their business and it makes makes it more viable to take a risk with your savings and open up a new business or expand an existing one is that enough that really isn't enough to what more would know known as more and and you know your most recent caller I caught about a little bit of what he was talking about in terms of the escalating cost of health insurance which is a huge problem for small business but about tax deduction but so why is it that a loaf of bread doesn't cost ten bucks why isn't that a gallon of gas doesn't cost fifty dollars there's a simple reason it's competition right if somebody tried to sell you a gallon of gas for fifty bucks you'd never buy it because you can go next door and buy it for about two dollars and seventy-five cents right so so it's competition that makes this a whole economy work and it gives us choices and it gives us low prices and good quality services and products we choose by virtue of our laws not to have competition and health insurance this is crazy we should take down those barriers and force these insurance companies to earn our business to compete against each other and there should be hundreds of choices for any small business owner in Pennsylvania or any family in pence or any individual in Pennsylvania hundreds of choices of firms competing for their business and if we had that kind of competition we would see lower costs we'd see more flexibility in structuring the product and we'd find insurance companies much more responsive but we choose to have a law that doesn't and the Democrats refuse to change that law in my view is you know you can buy car insurance from a little green lizard but you can't buy health insurance from a guy from Ohio and that just doesn't make any sense to me I agree with you on that one I think competition would be healthy I think in Pennsylvania most of us have the choice between maybe two providers that I can think of off the top entirety typical so buying insurance across state line so to speak we have to talk to somebody up in Massachusetts today who said that the the folks of Massachusetts did what they did on their own and they're not interested in having a giant federal government solution is it possible that states states can make their own calls on these situations oh absolutely absolutely look Massachusetts has its own universal health care plan I happen to have real doubts about the the Massachusetts plan but I I would certainly defend Massachusetts right to establish it if that's what they choose to do within their state but it's actually much healthier to have these kinds of reforms done at the state level where you know this is one of the great strengths of America we have the states are the great laboratories of democracy right you can try things you find what works and then other states catch on i mean a great case in point was the dramatic welfare reform of the 1990s that began in wisconsin it was tommy Thompson in one state and one state government that decided you know what this idea of permanently being on welfare isn't good for the people on welfare it's not good for the taxpayers and let's fundamentally change the system and make it temporary put in a work requirement and a lifetime limit and and let's change the nature of it it took years before the rest of the country caught on but it did largely because of this one enormously successful experiment in one state where they took eventually took ninety percent of the people off welfare and got them to work now I just like that as an example of the power of the the freedom of individual states and this federal government of course is trying to do through in trying to expand in all directions and diminish the freedom of skeets to find solutions that work within their own States it's very unhealthy for the state to tell me healthy for our country Pat Toomey is our guest this morning on wlk he's running for United States Senate this is joe from tonk addict who wants to ask a question I Joe are you doing great speak up how you doing sir good morning joe how are you very good hey I do wish you the best and I will support you in your election and I will not forgive Rick Santorum what you did to you when you add a last time but my question is this I'm sorry no that's our guy on my question is this and this is the question I called Chris Carney's office and our two senators what's the incentive to work anymore and that's my question you I mean I know you're running again I know it's a rhetorical question but no one has an answer for because of this program a lot of these program that's being passed if the government's going to take care from cradle to grave what's the incentive for me to work it's a kind of pretty much break my pack for people who don't want help themselves well you know what you're touching on is a very very important idea that i think is lost on so many these people in Washington in part because you know most of these guys in Cana about most certainly many of the members of Congress and including in the leadership and the administration they've never worked in the private sector for a day in their life I mean never mind not having run a business they've never worked for a business so I don't understand that incentives matter and I think that's what Joe is referring to you know if the government is going to put incredibly onerous rules and regulations on everything that we do and then charge enormously high taxes to pay for this huge welfare state then you know it's hard to justify take an entrepreneurial risk working hard trying to get ahead if the government is always holding you back so I it's a very important point incentives matter and we ought to be looking for ways to relieve the burden that government imposes on people not increasing holy cow you're the first person I know that answer that well oh crap I'm a guy that I'm a guy that came from the small business world so I understand that there you go thanks Joe Patchi up to runner you want to hang out for a little bit more it's up to you I got a couple more minutes alright sepetu me with us running for United States Senate day and now it looks like Pennsylvania is in play I saw that last night on of all places MSNBC 10 23 @ w IL k we are pleased to have pat toomey on our show today running for United States Senate on the Republican side I have some callers for you packed are you ready I'm ready here's bill from exeter township i bill I through the morning are you one boring Pat morning bill match a long time ago up and mountaintop at a little coffee hatch up there okay and I believe it was the first you're one of the first times but uh more like main questions you've had a su knows how I feel about it is that uh we know your your opponent this time if he's successful getting through uh his primary always but was able to reach out the grassroots people and uh it seems like our GOP party even though they have their headquarters and so on there's still the I'll column the big money into the big dealers and there's the grassroots people you have any certain plan to reaching out and I'm saying us meeting myself and all the groups that I'm involved with well I i we are reaching out very aggressively to grassroots organizations as well as really you know building our own network all across the Commonwealth for instance in every single County we have a whole team that we're in the process of putting together in most counties we already have a County coordinator somebody who will be overseeing our volunteer efforts and then we'll have various people for forming other functions for the campaign everything from you know distributing petitions to distributing yard signs when the time comes and making turns out the vote phone calls and then I I go out and speak to two groups all the time groups from from all different walks of life the only challenge of course is it such a big state in with 67 counties felt that it's tough to you know it's tough because you end up having to turn down quite a lot of invitations but but it's a very aggressive effort on our part to reach out and build a strong grassroots now well the groups that uh well as you said you there's already coordinators and people in the different areas i'll be truthful with you pat i haven't heard of one in luzerne county yet and i do and i would i say successfully worked with candidates with both parties because i believe in having the right person in the right place and i know that in some instances adverse our party's choice but if you're looking for the right candidate and you have supported the grassroots people it makes the movement a heck of a lot easier they proved that up in Massachusetts hey Pat you have anybody in Luzerne County yeah you know I don't have the list right here with me but I'm sure we have people helping us on the ground in Luzerne County of bill if you would be kind of to call my campaign office we will put you in touch with the team that we have and it's probably still in formation and we'd love to have your help alright this is wayne from Berwick on w IL Kay hi Wayne hi re on this morning great good how are you win not too bad I had a quick question for you I mean a lot of the problems that we have today stem from government interference in our lives what are you going to do to loosen those restricting hands of big government from round two people and our businesses so that we can try to have a better prosperity I know i I've heard your opponent peg luksus peak a couple times this year and I like a lot what you had to say but haven't been able to hear what you've had to say well you know I well my entire record in public life has been to defend the freedom of people that I represented in the people of our country I think the federal government has grown too big it's too intrusive it's way too expensive it's spending our money wildly and irresponsibly and I have a long record in Congress I you know I I fought against the Republicans when I thought they were spending too much money which they did in fact I led a filibuster on the House floor filibuster by amendment against an appropriation bills when I thought the Republican bills were just out of control with their spending now I've been a very vigorous opponent of all the bailouts this is the this is very bad policy it's not fair to taxpayers it's bad economics it leads the strings being attached and further bailouts and I was opposed to them from the very very beginning I continue to be this stimulus bill likewise very very badly conceived in the first place badly designed badly implemented I mean the idea that we can borrow and spend our way to prosperity is just ridiculous I I think I have a very solid grasp of where prosperity comes from in part because of my work in the private sector might being a small business entrepreneur restaurant owner prosperity all comes from the private sector you're done come from government Pat Toomey thank you we'll talk again dude thanks for having me

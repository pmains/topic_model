especially thank ms nas and ups uh not only for your important uh presence in the commonwealth of kentucky but for all the great work the ups has done on vaccine delivery delivering over 93 million doses to more than 46 countries our thanks to you and it's a reminder of the very valuable contributions of the private sector in the fight against cobit 19 not just the pharmaceutical industry but ups has another great example i do want to focus on the world health organization issue for any of our witnesses that the house china task force on which i was proud to serve found that the who was a co-conspirator in covering up the kobe 19 outbreak in wuhan parroting the ccp propaganda and disinformation leading to millions of deaths worldwide last year secretary pompeo stated that the leadership of the who was corrupt and that the pandemic was a direct result of the chinese communist party covering up and doing it with a complicit world health organization uh now mr sherman has seemed to excuse the who from this status that's a co-conspirator on the on the grounds that they don't have an intelligence arm i would simply submit that any organization any international body that disregards the untrustworthiness of the ccp and blindly accepts their propaganda is either incompetent or more likely a participant in the malfeasance we have seen the who fold to pressure by the ccp before you what uh if i could just get this question out mr sherman what reforms do do you all think are necessary at the who because i think mr sherman this gets it what we all should be focused on and that is what reforms do you think are necessary at the who to make sure a cover-up like the coronavirus uh never happens again any any of the witnesses i i would look forward thank you for the great question ranking member i would put forward several and i would also commend you uh the council on foreign relations where i work recently convened a task force to look at these very issues uh the thing i would point out with regard to the world health organization in china is uh in terms of the assessment in the our report china was clearly uh or the world health organization rather is clearly too credulous of the claims china was making and they were a week late in declaring a public health emergency of international concerns the world health organization is a member state organization uh its tendency to defer to countries in crisis is not particular to china we saw similar patterns in west africa and the democratic republic of congo what we need is threefold first is a surveillance system hospital-based sentinel surveillance system that is not dependent on the transparency and self-reporting of directly affected member states we need a reform to the emergency committee that forms as part of the process of declaring a public health emergency so that is more transparent and rigorous and last we need more clarity as to what the international health regulations require in terms of information sharing because that lack of clarity has led to numerous nations not china just china to turn over uh to be slow to turn over information well on a related related point um i am worried about um china's vaccine diplomacy as many of the witnesses also pointed out and it's i think part of china's belt and road initiative uh and i think it's um i think their their vaccine distribution uh efforts um with substandard vaccines um when they haven't even addressed their own population um could be a very have a very negative impact my question is what is the effect on the fight against the virus if china engages in vaccine diplomacy with vaccines developed in secret and not accepted by the larger international community and how are we going to make sure that the who doesn't give their stamp of approval on a vaccine we do not know is safe let me let me try uh this congressman a couple of things some first of all i think it's incredibly important that these vaccines go through a regulatory approval kind of the same kind of rigorousness of the european medicine agency the u.s fda and and i have encouraged countries around the world to not just take clinical data from us from a study that might have been published in a journal but to make sure that these vaccines are rigorously evaluated who has a list of regulatory agencies uh that should be doing a careful evaluation of these vaccines i think that's important um i worry a lot about the about the vaccines that we've seen so far from china they're clearly much lower efficacy i don't know how safe they are i suspect they're safe but suspect is not evident so we need a lot more openness and data and i have encouraged countries to make sure that these things go through a proper regulatory evaluation dean thank you very much for your testimony i yield back thank

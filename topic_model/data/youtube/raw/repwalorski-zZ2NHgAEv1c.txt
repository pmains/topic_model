miss wallarsky it's all yours thanks mr chairman and thanks to you ms collins for being with us today i'm grateful for the work that you and your taxpayer advocate service provides to my constituents with complicated tax matters i do feel like a broken record though once again i find myself before the subcommittee raising the backlog of the millions upon millions of original and amended tax returns that the irs is currently facing what's more concerning is that there appears to be no end in sight even as we move into the 2022 tax season almost every day my staff and i hear constituents who are caught in the backlog it's hoosiers from all kinds of families individuals small business you name it many many of whom have specific financial struggles and can hardly afford more delays these hoosiers need results and they need the refunds that the irs owes them the taxpayer advocate can't take over the irs's role in processing returns but they play a significant role in expediting what has been an infuriating process for many of my constituents so ms collins my question is the taxpayer advocate having conversations with the irs on how they're categorizing and prioritizing the outstanding amended returns does the relative amount of a refund claim or the relative delay in processing factor factor into a returns prioritization are returns with refunds that require joint committee approval lagging meaningfully behind other amended returns in the processing time in essence what we're currently doing with the irs is part of the surge team we're working with our our counterparts in the service center as we are going to have taz cases are going to be assigned to a particular area within the service center and we're going to have priority for the taz cases to make sure those are through the system so taxpayers are dealing with hardships and other challenges we should be prioritizing that work on a go forward basis and can you outline your office's position on working with affected individuals how do you instruct your advocates to prioritize their case work and what's the response time and frequency of communication you're targeting to provide our constituents and congressional staff with the status updates on active cases yeah this has been a tough year for not only taxpayers but also irs employees and taz employees are no different we've had a very difficult last two years as well our case inventory has increased and with respect to congressional referrals it's increased six-fold what we are trying to do is to have our contact at a minimum of once a month and some of the offices are able to do it more frequently either weekly or by bi-weekly to give you updates on particular cases we do look for hardship if the hardship of taxpayers experience a particular hardship we try and prioritize that above some of the other work so as i said we're scrambling but we are doing the best we can and our employees are working really hard and and i'll give them a shout out right now because you know not only irs employees working hard but our taz folks are really trying to do the best they can to help all taxpayers including your constituents i gotta i just have one more question do you have suggestions on how my office and this committee can work with you and the irs to expedite some of these returns happy to take it offline and and explore suggestions or ideas i mean that is essence what taz does is you know we work with your offices uh for hardship and taxpayers and issues and again happy to open up that door or phone and let's have a future dialogue i appreciate it mr chairman i yield back

first though we want to talk about the opening around the country and what that is going to mean as well as other issues with our next guest that is representative Tom Malinowski Democrat of New Jersey congressman thank you for joining us I do want to talk to China talk about China with you in just a moment the first since you're in New Jersey I have to ask you about the lifting of the stay at home order there on the part of Governor Phil Murphy and whether you are concerned about seeing any kind of resurgence in New Jersey like we have seen in other states like Texas in California I I am concerned I I think we we played it very very carefully in New Jersey we were the state that was per capita the hardest hit in the country governor Murphy our state governor took very decisive decisions to enforce a lockdown to shut down the economy and it worked we've gotten our numbers way down in terms of daily cases hospital admissions transmission of coronavirus we've gotten our testing numbers way up we were the state a couple of months ago with the highest percentage of people being tested testing positive we're now well below 10% so you know where would were not were Texas and Arkansas and Georgia and Arizona are where were ahead of it herb and I think it is correct that we now gradually consciously begin to clear out of this we got to be vigilant we have to stay concerned I'm representative when you say be vigilant stay concerned what do you say to your colleagues on the other side of the aisle who it's pandemic related and we're seeing spikes in states that like Texas but the the the federal government's financial respondents to all of this is falling along political lines with conservatives saying we don't want to bail out allegedly you know liberal states and and there's this this animosity that's going on so how do you close that gap so that people in Texas might get the federal funding they desperately need as the spike now goes there yeah well you know I don't think the American people are divided on this question there's a stupid debate in Washington particularly in the United States Senate where Mitch McConnell is still kind of saying that the assistance to state and local governments is somehow a blue state bailout that's just nonsense mayor's County officials state legislators all across this country are facing exactly the same difficulties right now revenue is drying up because we lock down the economy they all need help to be able to pay their local first responders they're firefighters they're police officers you know who voted to defund the police it was Republicans in the House and out of the Senate who voted against the heroes Act which we passed in the house precisely to enable our state and local governments to pay for our heroes including our police officers that's that's got to change not just for New Jersey we desperately need it but for Texas for Kentucky for Arkansas for Illinois all across this country states are facing the same trouble congressman we could spend this whole interview talking about police and whether we should defund but I do want to turn to China because you have been quite vocal and passionate on that issue writing in a recent op-ed that we do need to be tough on China in terms of its human rights record for example but we need to do so by making more of a coalition with other nations um what do you think needs to happen for that to happen and in other words is a President Joe Biden for example someone who is going to follow that path he said he would and look we have to be realistic that the China does pose under the rule of the Communist Party under this regime it does pose a big challenge to us that the Chinese Communist Party wants a world in which big countries can bully small countries in which they can steal our commercial secrets in in which the rules on human rights and corruption don't apply to them and they're trying to spread that way of thinking to other kind so yeah we got it we got to be up to the challenge but but this is a great power and if we want to do it effectively we do need to be in coalition with allies this is not rocket science we have strong allies in Asia for example South Korea Japan the Trump administration even as they posture trying to sound tough on China is simultaneously threatening to pull our troops out of South Korea and Japan unless those countries basically pay us extortion at rates to keep our troops there that makes Beijing very very happy we are instead of fighting Chinese influence in the United Nations at the World Health Organization for example we're just pulling out we're just seeding the the territory so that the Chinese can step in and have more influence human Rick Newman here if Joe Biden were to become president do you think he should repeal the Trump tariffs on Chinese imports and basically start over and if he were to do that would that it would it be coherent or smart thing to do to rejoin the what's the now the new version of the trans-pacific partnership I look I think that the trans-pacific Pacific Partnership wasn't perfect but I think it was a historic mistake to just pull out without even making an effort to address some of the legitimate concerns about the TPP once again we seeded power and influence to China when we did that on trade the big mistake look I actually agree with President Trump that we needed to take on the Chinese on trade but to do it alone while simultaneously sanctioning our European allies in Canada going after Australia and South Korea was just beyond incompetent this is a serious fight against a powerful adversary we have to have our allies on our side we should be using the World Trade Organization we should be organizing if we're going to be imposing sanctions on China we should be organizing our European and other allies to go in with us and we can't do that if we are simultaneously going after them so you're a you're a Biden supporter you're endorsing mr. Biden as has been pointed out what are you hearing from the campaign about what they will do on day one if he should win to bring about a different policy towards China or will it not look different than what we're seeing now you know day one is only twenty four hours my list of things Joe Biden has to do on day one would probably take a year given how much needs to be fixed we're voting China but in terms of China that look I would the best thing we can do to address China is to address our allies first to repair our broken security and economic alliances with democracies in Asia and in Europe that's what I would do on day one that is what China fears the most that we actually start coordinating with our allies again and I you know having done that then I think you need to build a a coalition against China's unfair trade practices the structural problems currency manipulation for example the the stealing of America's intellectual property what I hear from the Trump administration is just please buy some of our American wheat and all is forgiven so you know I actually would be tougher and hope that Joe Biden would be tougher in insisting on structural changes to Chinese practices but doing it in coalition with allies so that we can actually be effective and of course we can't really talk about or think about the protests here in the US without kind of drawing the comparison to the demonstrations that we did see in places like Hong Kong when you think about the turmoil and the sort of conscious uncoupling that's been happening steadily with Hong Kong what is your stance there do you feel as though Hong Kong should be treated as a democratic entity should Hong Kong folks be able to come to America and see the US as a place of refuge yeah so again speaking very broadly and then we'll know back down to Hong Kong if we want to win a contest for the Chinese Communist Party one of the first things we need to do is to show the world that we are in every way different from the Chinese Communist Party we we don't need tanks and armored personnel carriers and and the US military policing dissent on America's streets oh my god does the Chinese Communist Party's love to see that because they get to say we're no different from them we need to be a shining city on a hill that welcomes refugees from around the world again just as we did when we were taking on the Soviet Union during the Cold War and with respect to Hong Kong that the strongest the toughest thing we can do in support of the protesters in Hong Kong is to say to the Chinese government that if you suffocate Hong Kong if you crush Hong Kong we will allow the people of Khan Khan to rebuild their experiment in capitalism and democracy in the United States we will open our doors to refugees from Hong Kong to business owners from Hong Kong to students and talented people from Hong Kong scientists engineers writers and you know I don't think they want to leave Hong Kong they love it it's the city but the knowledge that they have that option may be the most important deterrent that we can put into place against increased Chinese repression there congressman thank you so much for your time today Congressman Tom Malinowski is Democrat from New Jersey thank you again sir and be well Thank You Julie

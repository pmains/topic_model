i rise to discuss this debate we the Iran deal we've not had a national security issue during my time in the Senate that has received so much attention on the floor and committees and on the floor of this body as this and that's appropriate the debate has been and will continue to be thorough and vigorous I respect the views of my colleagues regardless of how they will vote on this matter I want to spend a few minutes recapping why support the deal I did speak on it on the floor early in August since that time a number of leaders have come out in support of the deal former senators John Warner Richard Lugar Sam Nunn and Carl Levin general Brent Scowcroft General Colin Powell today former head of the Israeli Atomic Energy Commission Uzi eilam and after I talk about my reasons for support I want to address three final points 1 the the Republican argument on the floor today that it's wrong to have a 60-vote threshold for a vote on a resolution of disapproval to the arguments that Vice President Cheney made against the deal yesterday and finally the the place of vigorous diplomacy in the as a tool of American strength so first quickly to recap why support the deal I support it because it's better than the status quo for 15 to 25 years I don't compare it with a hypothetical alternative you can create a hypothetical to justify your position let's just talk about the status quo before diplomacy started Iran had rocketed ahead in 19,000 centrifuges in 12,000 kilograms of enriched uranium a plutonium reprocessing facility under construction and we had very few inspections the system was very opaque that was the status quo the best description of the Iranian status quo was the description that Prime Minister Netanyahu made to the UN in September of 2012 that was a speech known because he drew a bomb dialogue and that that sort of cartoon was known but if you go into the guts of the speech he gave the description of where the Iranian program was and then he concluded and he said this I want to thank the international community because the sanctions you have imposed together have hurt the Iranian economy but and here is the quote we have to face the truth the sanctions have not stopped the Iranian nuclear program there's a pretty good argument that the sanctions accelerated the program and so if we go back to the status quo it's an accelerated program with 19,000 centrifuges and enough enriched uranium for multiple weapons what we get with this deal for 15 years disabling two-thirds of the centrifuges for 15 years rolling back in rich uranium's to 300 kilograms not even enough for one weapon for fifth for permanently disabling the plutonium facility for 25 years enhanced inspections more than any nation has to comply with we get in this deal much better than we would have with the status quo that existed before diplomacy and that's why I support it second point the argument about the 60-vote threshold I I am surprised to hear arguments on the floor that it's somehow wrong to use a 60-vote threshold on this bill when I was in my first two years in the Senate and in majority the 60-vote threshold was used on everything immigration minimum wage turning off the sequester sometimes we exceeded the 60-vote threshold many times we exceeded 50 votes but we couldn't get to 60 on minimum wage we couldn't get to 60 on turning off the threshold but there was an insistence we need to get to 60 votes I can't think of a single issue of importance in my first two years in the Senate where the 60-vote threshold wasn't invoked as my ranking member senator Cardin mentioned I was one of the co-authors of the review act under which we are now proceeding and the act is clear and it was understood by all that action in the Senate to pass either a motion of approval or emotion of disapproval either one would be by a 60-vote threshold we talked about this explicitly in committee we talked about it before the vote on the floor and we voted in favor of the act by a 98 to 1 margin and and I think the majority party the current majority party understood that as was indicated in the letter of 47 to the leadership of Iran it was stated very plainly we would understand this to be a three-fifths 60-vote that's what happens in the center so it shouldn't we shouldn't change the rules now the debates been full vigorous and fair we've spent a lot of time on this one we're going to spend more and that's appropriate there is now complete accountability because all 100 have declared exactly where they are in the position we should stick with the agreement that we made just a few months ago and treat this resolution of disapproval under a 60-vote rule point three the vice president's argument yesterday and I respond to them because I think Vice President Cheney basically made two arguments and they're the two arguments that had been repeated in different ways on the floor let me address us two main arguments number one we can't trust Iran I agree I think everyone on the Democratic side agrees and there's nothing about this deal that involves trust that's why we've insisted that Iran subject itself too intrusive respect inspections by the IAEA for 25 years and then following that to the Additional Protocol inspections required of all NPT members the IAEA inspections 130 plus inspectors in the country will enable us to catch irani and cheating and give us the Intel that will be incredibly helpful if we ever need to take military action against them it's that inspections Intel that caused to our two former colleagues senators John Warner and Carl Levin chairs of the Armed Services Committee to write an article recently why Hawks should support the Iran deal it's because inspections give us Intel which increase the credibility of our military threat now the vice president's response to this interestingly enough is wait we can't trust IAEA inspections they're going to do it wrong they have the wrong protocol so we can't trust them folks that argument has been made in this body before by the Vice President and others the Vice President Cheney promoted that we go to a war with Iraq and he repeatedly made the case in 2002 in 2003 that we had to do that to stop iraq's nuclear weapons program two weeks before the war began in early March the IAEA issued a report indicating quote we have to date found no evidence or plausible indication of the revival of a nuclear weapons program in Iraq the vice president then went to the airwaves with others and let a campaign to trash the credibility of the IAEA to say that neither the integrity of their inspections or their accuracy could be trusted and after that we entered into war against Iraq saying that the IAEA was wrong and what did we find what we found was that the inspectors and investigators and engineers and scientists of the IAEA were right and Vice President Cheney and others were wrong we've been down the path before of trying to trash the IAEA and said they couldn't be trusted and it was a horrible disservice to America and the world that we didn't give those inspections a chance we shouldn't go down that path again the vice president made a second argument yesterday here's a different and better strategy for dealing with Iran the same strategy that the previous administration followed heavy sanctions threats of military force no diplomacy but the Cheney doctrine didn't work with Iran under that strategy the Iranian nuclear program rocketed ahead centrifuges enrich uranium growing by the day the Prime Minister of Israel Prime Minister Netanyahu acknowledged this before the UN in September of 2012 and when the Vice President was confronted by this by chris wallace over the weekend on television he had no answer for it he couldn't answer for because the fact of the advance of the Iranian program under that Cheney doctrine cannot be disputed I was interested in this speech yesterday would he try to justify that that strategy had worked when they tried it and again he ignored it so if we go back to the preferred doctrine of no diplomacy sanctions and military threat were likely to get what we just got before and that's an acceleration of the Iranian nuclear program and we should not go back down that path let me conclude with the story about my favorite President Harry Truman Truman was a bold and courageous wartime president he fought in world war one as a captain he made tough decisions to use the atomic weapons in Japan he came back to a war-weary Congress and said give military support to Greece against Soviet bloc expansion he came to a war-weary Congress and said we got to put troops into North Korea nobody will say Harry Truman was a softy he had military bona fides Truman also was the president that made sure that America was the first nation to recognize the State of Israel and he always held that as of his proudest accomplishments and it's one of the reasons that he's my favorite president well 70 years ago next month october 1945 President Truman did something that seems minor but was really important he called reporters into his office at the white house and he said I got something to show you and he unveiled that he had redesigned the seal of the presidency of the United States the seal is the eagle the seal has the arrows of war in one hand and the olive branches of diplomacy in the other hand and Truman had redesigned the seal so that the eagle was now turned to face the olive branches of diplomacy before the arrows of war this wartime president and he explained look I'm a wartime president and I'll used military force but American values are such that we should always prefer diplomacy before the military we've got the strongest military in the world and as over Virginia I'm so proud of it we use it when needed I have voted twice in two and a half years in the Senate as a member or the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to use military force on when I cast that vote it's a very personal one for my state and for me and my family these votes are the hardest votes we take but Truman believed and I believe that it is fundamentally a part of our values that we prefer diplomacy first and before we use military action we've got to be engaged in vigorous diplomacy with allies and adversaries if we can see a path to possibly create a more peaceful world other presidents have reached the same conclusion not only president truman president kennedy and negotiating the nuclear test ban treaty with the soviet union president nixon and going to china when china was supporting the north vietnamese against us President Reagan negotiating against the evil empire the Soviet Union over their nuclear program and now President Obama our great presidents have realized that diplomacy isn't just for friends diplomacy is important even and especially with adversaries if you can see a path a possibility to a more peaceful world and mr. president here's something that's fascinating just as a strong military arey enhances diplomacy strong diplomacy enhances our military might and that's true in this case if we do a deal we get an Iranian pledge that they will never pursue developer acquire nuclear weapons caps on their program for 15 years and inspections forever these tools will increase our intelligence they will increase our legal justification to take military action if they break the pledge that's in paragraph one of the agreement and it will also increase the likelihood that America will have global support if military action is necessary but what if we walk away from diplomacy now we lose the military intelligence that inspections will give us we give up a clear legal justification for military action if God forbid we should need it and we weaken the likelihood that other nations will support military action if it's necessary in this case diplomacy strengthens not weakens the American credibility of our military threat trying diplomacy here will keep the world's attention on Iranian behavior walking away from diplomacy here we'll put the world's attention on American negotiating tactics and why we decided that we would rather go it alone I believe the article one branch should send the message that we value diplomacy as a first option just as President Truman did 70 years ago

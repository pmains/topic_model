so mayor tell me a little bit about how all this came about yeah about five years ago a group of folks came to me and said hey mayor we want to build this huge network of trails right behind city park but we only had 10 acres so we went to the Meeks family Thor and his father and family and asked them about a partnership and you all said what I mean I said let's rock and roll you know early on it was it took a little bit of convincing obviously you know through the years having a substantial amount of acreage there a lot of people wanted to do recreational activities hunt walk it do whatever it may be so when they first came we said yeah let's see what happens I was a little bit you know spectacle about it and then we saw things happening one person turned into two building a trail two turned into four four turned in the eight it was amazing the community support that we had so we're now we have 26 miles almost over 26 miles now with 100 Community involvement on building the trails it's been a phenomenal feat that we've been able to accomplish with uh with zero outlay of cash and 26 smallest Trails so it's a something we can really be proud of and I'll mention the economic impact has been tremendous you know we're seeing people from other states come here other communities come here you know they travel to come here we have big events here 5Ks 10ks we had 100K race just a month or so ago and 13 states were represented so we're seeing in Putnam County a huge economic impact people are already calling this the jewel of Putnam County and I firmly believe that this is the jewel of Putnam County you know for healthy you know just go out and walk just to be healthy people go out and walk our Trails they they bike our Trails they run our Trails they hike the trails it's a multi-use trail system that is like no other let me just say this it shows you exactly when you have the public and private working for the best interest of the citizens and the people that they represent and you live with good things can happen I understand the greatest challenge you have right now we've got to get a tunnel yes we got to get a tunnel under the train tracks to make it safe for all pedestrians so we're going to get and help you get in contact with CSX see if we can work something out to make that happen sooner than later we appreciate that thanks thank you very much that will add to this tremendously thank you

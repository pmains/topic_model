thank you for the time mr. Speaker I rise to reflect on the importance of the disaster supplemental bill we are considering today in Nebraska we continue our work to recover from the storm which hit our state at the end of February the storm brought with it blizzard conditions and large amounts of rain followed rapidly by destructive flooding the impact of this storm continues to be felled across our state particularly by our AG producers in the West the extreme blizzard conditions compounded an already hard winter leading to severe cattle losses in the East store grain was actually washed away or damaged by the floods an extensive salting of fields has impeded planting season as the season is now underway I particularly appreciate both this bill and the most recent Senate package including language to ensure our disaster programs can address the losses of stored grain while crop insurance covers producers from planting and including coverage for prevented planting up through harvest it does not provide coverage for harvest grain which is stored and has not yet been sold our producers need this relief I realize this bill is not perfect and there are a number of issues I hope we can address moving forward I would prefer to be considering legislation which addresses the concerns of some senators and the president and would be signed into law this bill does not and I hope negotiations will get us there soon I've long advocated for disaster packages to be paid for this package is not and my amendment to cover the cost was unfortunately made not made in order we have traditionally extended a number of tax relief provisions to families and businesses in disaster areas I've introduced legislation to do this and I hope we can act on this relief soon as well mr. speaker Nebraskans need relief considering this bill moves us closer to providing them relief and for that reason I do support it and I yield back the balance of my time

okay yet another credible report that we've received in circulating is the critical race training material called white privilege unpacking the invisible knapsack by peggy mcintosh so according to this report this is actually being circulated to service members at socom that's the special operations command so think about it you're getting ready to go out on a mission you got your rucksack you got your uh rolled up solar panel that kamala harris wants you to carry now you got your white privileged training manual all set but seriously the people at socom actually have important things to do like kill terrorists and yet some officials think it's more important to talk about white privilege if you've never heard about this white privilege manual it's this it's all about acknowledging your privilege in every circumstance acknowledging racism in every instance in the kicker it was written in 1989 it's decades old and yet we're still trying to teach this stuff here's some of the things that it teaches people about their white and male privilege quote i can speak in public to a powerful male group without putting my race on trial end quote quote i can do well in a challenging situation without being called a credit to my race if my day week or year is going badly i need not ask of each negative episode or situation whether it has racial overtones spoiler you don't have to ask that another quote i can trust in a second hand close or not answer letters without having people attribute these choices to the bad morals the poverty or the illiteracy of my race again spoiler you don't have to do that so is any of this important to the people at socom or anywhere else in the military so this is the conclusion of this particular manual the author writes seems to me that obliviousness about white advantage like obliviousness about male advantage is kept strongly enculturated in the united states so as to maintain the myth of meritocracy the myth that all democratic choice is equally available to all that's the kicker this is the whole point to the woke who are infecting our military that there is no meritocracy that's what they want you to believe there is no advancing based on your talent or your intelligence you're a victim there's only racism and privilege and if you cannot see that then that just proves that you are racist and you're privileged it's divisive and it's wrong but that's what's being circulated in our military

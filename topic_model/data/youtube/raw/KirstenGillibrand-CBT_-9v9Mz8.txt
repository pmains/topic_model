what I want to do under full employment which was Martin Luther King Junior's idea pushed along by Coretta Scott King was that anyone who's underemployed which is really the crux right and unemployed can get the job training they need to get a higher paying job so they could earn their way into the middle class one of the reasons why president Trump one is people all across the country felt disillusioned left behind that the American Dream wasn't actually for them and what I've heard by trout because when Trump want I traveled New York and I listened I listened really hard about what was going on because off state New York was read on election days so what parts of Long Island it was a very red state Hillary won the popular vote of course but there was a lot of people who voted for Trump and so they feel like they have no way to get there and so I recognized really early that we're already doing this important work in our community colleges in our state schools in our apprenticeship programs and in our not-for-profits and I'll give you one example okay Sopris cola and not-for-profit in the Bronx said a lot of young people don't have access to stem so there they went to every tech company in New York City and said what jobs are open what skills are needed and then they built that coursework so computer engineering building fixing computers cybersecurity and coding they've already trained to place eight hundred workers so I think the federal government should actually decide and we need a president to do this which is why I'm running to have the vision the strong enough vision to say under employments our problem we got to go right at the heart of why people feel so disillusioned and then offer this training no matter what to anyone who feels underemployed or unemployed it's federal training not a federal guarantee of it and it becomes a guarantee because you're guaranteeing the training into a job

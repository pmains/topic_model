mr. speaker one of my favorite pastimes is playing video games with my 13 year olds son just as I Kiana Jefferson was doing with her 8 year old nephew when she was murdered by a police officer in front of him in Fort Worth Texas this past weekend I rise today to commemorate the legacy of AI tiana also known as aunt a by her 8 year old nephew and call on our law enforcement to stop these killings now it only took three seconds three seconds before a police officer fatally shot this woman in front of her 8 year old nephew while they were playing video games she didn't even have a chance to show her hands the reality for many black and brown people in this country is that this is our America this is the America that we live in every day it doesn't matter what neighborhood we live in or how much money we make this is what we face and until law enforcement reforms their culture of rogue police and that has led to the slaughtering of so many people in this country justice cannot fully be served nothing's going to bring out the aana back or all of those that have been unjustly killed back but we have to do better we have to hold our law enforcement accountable and fix the systemic failures that have brought us here today until then our communities cannot have full confidence and those that are tasked and protecting all of us mr. speaker

all right folks time to talk about the race for randy nagabower's job in congress with house district 19 candidate jody arrington first off thank you so much for making time to join us here today i'm glad to be here jason thanks for having me well we're glad to have you walk us through this you're a former bush advisor texas tech vice chancellor now the president of scott laboratories is that right that's correct walk me through that last bit what is your current role exactly so scott laboratories is the holding company for grace health system you got grace clinic you got the hospital and one of the my main focus there is is this nutella health initiative where we're trying to bring access to specialty doctors in rural west texas that's one aspect of telemedicine the other is we're trying to bend the cost curve i mean health care is the biggest cost it's become almost a third of the cost of our state budget and some of that is wrapped up in over utilizing health care resources so one of the aspects of telemedicine is is working to provide care managed care for the sickest population around the state and monitor and manage that care from their home so that they don't have to go to the emergency room unnecessarily very cool so so that's quite a spectrum there you know going from a presidential advisor now you're you're president of a company here how does a congressional run fit into all of that i think it fits in perfectly actually i mean i've been blessed i've had a great experience a breadth of experiences from being in an ag community and an ag family growing up in plainview to being vice chancellor and at a at a major national research university and now being in healthcare i just mentioned three of the drivers of this economy so to understand the unique aspects of those sectors of this economy to understand the unique challenges and opportunities i think are absolutely critical for the person who's going to represent district 19. on top of that um i think being able to operate in that very dysfunctional environment of washington and not just operate but but but deliver results that are going to make our country stronger and can ensure that the future of west texas is on the right path of growth and prosperity so you're getting into it already but i want to ask you you know no democratic candidates in this race which is good and bad because good obviously no one against you there but bad because you really have to differentiate yourself and your own party here what does separate you from the other republican candidates in this race i think it's two things i think it's the breadth of experience of again agriculture higher ed and and healthcare and not just being in those but being in a leadership role whether it's vice chancellor or president of a health care company i think i think the most important uh question for the voters is not just are these candidates conservative and and what are their conservative values because i think you're going to find that the messaging and the policy positions will be very similar the question is who's going to be able to convert those conservative values to conservative results and i think what's what what there is no other candidate in this race who's been to washington d.c i worked with a republican uh president a west texan fellow west texans and george w bush and while i was there i actually converted those values and principles to cutting budgets of federal agencies reducing regulatory burden for small businesses and and helping pass legislation that strengthen community banks which which are a big part of our local and regional economy i was going to be my next question was what you took from that so let me ask the the follow-up there brian brian asks every candidate we have on here you know you i read that you went to plainview high school is that right that's correct and then your tech grad also worked at tech living here in lubbock area that's correct perfect for this area but this seat represents a lot more than just the lubbock area in plainview as well so so what are you going to do to make sure that those folks also know about you and what you represent i i think it's imperative that the person representing district 19 understands rural west texas not just lubbock or abilene but the 27 other counties that make up 40 of the vote but they don't just make up 40 of the vote i mean this is just the principle of you you represent the interests of the people you serve and in america today i'd say that that rural communities do not have a voice i'd say agriculture has very few champions and we need to add to the warriors for farmers and and agriculture like mike conaway who is a fellow west texan and is currently the chairman of the house ag committee so i think um i've already invested a lot of time and and i've made agriculture the ag industry and rural west texas a priority for mine for me as a candidate and and and it's personal for me i mean i grew up like you said i went to plainview high school go bulldogs right i'm a west texan i'm a rural west texan am i and i'm a product of a dad that sold tractors for a living for over 40 years so um i'm excited about the prospect to put on the west texas jersey and fight for the future of our country and for my three children but also to uh to fight for the farmer because again they're not thinking about us in washington and um i want to tell that story because it's a great story it's a great story of of not just 24 million jobs for our country it's about the food and fiber independence that that that contributes to our national security so well i can hear the passion in your answer there last question here what's the best way people can get some information about you if they're interested well then go on our website at jodyarrington.com and thanks again to jodi arrington for coming in

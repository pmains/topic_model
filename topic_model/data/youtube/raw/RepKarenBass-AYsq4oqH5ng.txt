it's I know you're a Democrat he's sort of I guess he calls himself a Republican I'm not sure what he is but this indecency this inability to express national for our country is a representative of our country in the world inability to say that guy used my name in his manifesto and I don't want anything to do with that crumb he's a killer he's a bad human being he's a murderer a mass murderer probably sick but who knows but I don't anything to do with that guy he doesn't seem to have that gut sense of I've got to get this guy separated for me well I don't think if you look back to the beginning of his campaign he has never separated himself from white supremacist remember he didn't you know David Duke he wouldn't even disavow that what he needs to do is make a speech to the nation and now unfortunately the world he needs to completely denounce white supremacy he needs to attack anyone that it was would associate him with it but I think anybody that has been favorable to him no matter who they are or what they believe he will never come out against them it was so sad that he could not say the word Muslim he couldn't express any empathy to the people that had actually been killed but he has been consistent about this and he's a consistent narcissist because you just defined his small revolves around him as you put it

q let's talk about all of this with Democratic congressman Bennie Thompson of Mississippi he's the ranking member of the House Homeland Security Committee congressman thanks very much for coming in I spoke earlier today with a friend of yours friend of mine Jim Clyburn South Carolina the congressman he pointed out to be something I didn't know the state of Mississippi your state you're the only African American a representative from Mississippi you won't fly that mississippi state flag in your congressional office or outside your congressional office is that right that's correct basically because as an African American I resent what the flag implies I am NOT one to promote hate or hostility I don't see it as heritage and I personally take offense to it because we are better than that and I'm convinced that the only way you can solve it is by not displaying 40% nearly 40% of the people who live in your state of Mississippi are African Americans at the highest percentage of any state in the United States but it seems like the political clout of African Americans in Mississippi might be limited right well it is and just started a history had it not been for the Voting Rights Act I wouldn't be here in Congress no a lot of the other officials so it's always taken a federal oversight to make things happen the flag I agree is a local issue but if you're going to make this country the country that we know it can be we're going to have to put these symbols into museums where they belong and not front and center and try to defend actions that will basically meant to enslave you see in South Carolina they're moving to get rid of the flag from the state grounds in the capitol what's happening in Mississippi because all of a sudden some people in the legislate people in Mississippi inclusion Republicans are saying maybe it's time to change the state flag well I'm happy to see the Speaker of the Mississippi House of Representative makeup Republican Republican make a full right statement say that you know he's a Christian he's looked at this thing and he's convinced that we need to revisit it and by revisiting it I hoping that we will move it out of the capital make it not the state flag that symbol has been a symbol of repression and hate to a lot of right thinking people in this country and I think in my state we would do better by changing the flag coming with something new that represents the new Mississippi and not the old missus is this a partisan issue in Mississippi whereby the Democrats want to get rid of that symbol in the flag the Republicans want to keep it is that what has been historically true well I think it's a it's a power struggle it's it's the old guard trying to defend the past this flag represents the pass and it's an effort to keep it so no matter what you do this flag represents a step backward and as a state with 40 percent African American population but with more African American officials than any other state we can do better the image of who we are can be enhanced with the difference right we have some hope if this is about to change is that right or is that going too far look we gonna work going it hope springs eternal I'm convinced that there are good people in my state who want to see a better view of us they gotta admit it was pretty impressive yesterday to see the Republican governor of South Carolina the two Republican senators of South Carolina say let's move that flag away from the state capitol grounds you want to fly it your private property that's fine but off the public property well you know that flag represents everything that's wrong and for someone to fan the flag as heritage or something that's right it's an insult we know it's not it's divisive in the community let's put it in a museum where it belong and let's get on with the business of developing our community what do you think of all of these retailers Walmart for example Sears Amazon eBay deciding they're no longer going to sell the Confederate flag paraphernalia it's a strong statement and believe me they elected leaders in those states they see the economics Walmart is one of the largest employers in my dish to take that kind of stand is very positive more people who step forward with this the greater the possibility that change will come up anytime soon stand by I want to continue our conversation just ahead I'll also speak with the mayor of Charleston South Carolina about the new momentum behind the effort to remove the Confederate battle flag

joining us now from Capitol Hill Democratic senator Katherine Cortez on masta of Nevada senator thanks so much for joining us and let me get your immediate reaction to the words we just heard from the President of the United States going after Debra Ramirez the second the second accuser hi wolf it's good to talk with you listen these are serious allegations and that's why I think many of my colleagues and I have been very clear what we need to finish the background investigation that means the FBI needs to reopen it go through and take a look at these allegations put that information together and then provide it to the senator so that then we can have a fair and open hearing and have all of this information before us have you already announced by the way how you're going to vote on judge Cavanaugh's confirmation I have so you know like the previous confirmation I take my advise and consent role here in the Senate very seriously so I want an opportunity to review his court rulings and some of his writings I wanted to actually see how he responded to the questioning in the Senate Judiciary Committee I'm not on that committee and then I wanted to take the time to go into the committee confidential documents which I think were inappropriately identified as committee confidential but spend some time to go through that the only thing I did not get an opportunity to do was sit and meet with judge Kavanagh but I will tell you based on the information that I've seen I just I disagree with his judicial philosophy I think it's extreme particularly if you just look at the Garza case I he is unfortunately I have concerns he's gonna roll back Roe versus Wade and really my fight has always been for reproductive rights for women the freedom for reproductive rights and I have concerns where he's going to take the court as you know Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee are planning to have a female outside counsel actually do their questioning of Cavanagh of Cavanaugh's initial accuser Christine Blasi four of the California professor but professor Ford wants the Senators on the committee to handle the questioning in a letter to the Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley a lawyer for Ford says this this is not a criminal trial for which the involvement of an experienced sex crimes prosecutor would be appropriate neither dr. Blasi Ford nor Judge Cavanaugh is on trial the goal should be to develop the relevant facts not try a case what do you think of the decision of the Republicans not to question professor Ford directly but they have an outside female counsel do that well apparently only in this Senate is one place where you can have somebody come in and do the job for you and I disagree with that I think this is a senator's role and we should be asking the question I absolutely agree that there's this conflation between somehow this being a criminal trial and we are tires of fact we are not we are not determining guilt what we are determining is where there judge Cavanaugh is fit to sit on the highest court of the land in a lifetime appointment that means all of his work background his background his character his fitness to sit on the bench that's open and we should be asking those questions to make that determination of whether or supporting him or not and you know that's why I go back to this we need to finish the background investigation and then we have that fair and open hearing at the end of the day I think many of my colleagues are looking for that but it is our role to ask the questions and it is our role - at the end of the day make a determination whether he should fail not whether he's guilty but whether he should be sitting on the highest court of the land and do you think the judiciary committee should also invite Deborah Ramirez the second woman the Yale student who was at Yale with judge Kavanagh that she should come forward and testify as well well wolf I think that's one of the reasons why I am open to this background investigation the FBI finishing it I think the FBI by going in and talking to you to the individuals who have come forward is so important listen I was a prosecutor for 10 years I fought for victims rights I know that part of and key to us and getting the information we need a senators to make an informed decision is a full investigation of background check which is always done always done on these nominees and particularly for judges who are going to sit for lifetime appointments and that shouldn't there should be no difference here one final question senator before I let you go did you see the interview that Judge Cavanaugh and his wife did on Fox News last night and if you did I'd like to get your thoughts I did not actually I was doing a town hall last night a telephone town hall so I did not have the opportunity to watch it senator we'll continue this conversation I'm sure down the road i senator Katherine Cortez master thanks so much for joining us thank you wolf

please be sure to reach out to my office if you need any further assistance with irs or sba questions have a great workshop thank you congresswoman good evening everyone my name is jasmine thank you all for joining us tonight i am um the director of constituent services for congresswoman robin kelly um and i'm happy to be joined today um by staff from senator dick durbin's office um as well as as some wonderful representatives from the irs and the sba small business administration special shout out to andrew and susan and robert for joining us tonight in the interest of time tonight we won't be going over any individual cases um however we're hopeful that this presentation will address any issues that you might have um and there will be some time at the end for some uh a question and answer session if you have any questions throughout the presentation you may feel free to type it into the q a section at the bottom of the screen and with that i'll go ahead and start my screen sharing and start the presentation from the irs thank you jasmine and thank you everyone for being here tonight i really appreciate the opportunity to share irs information with you all so on the next slide um you'll see us list of the topics i plan to cover this evening i'll start by discussing how you can get help with filing taxes if you haven't filed yet i'll go over some tax filing tips some scenarios for after you file and then i will conclude with information on how to access your tax records and then i'll turn it over to my colleague andrew van single to discuss the taxpayer advocate service so on the next slide you may be wondering how you can get help filing your tax return if you haven't already filed so if you have internet access and your income is below seventy three thousand dollars you can use irs free file if you have i'm sorry if the irs free file program is a public-private partnership between the irs and many tax preparation and tax software industry leaders who provide their brand name products for free or maybe you need personal assistance helping you to file your tax return there's also options available for that if your income is under 58 000 you can use our volunteer income tax assistance locator options to find free tax return assistance or if your income is above the amounts i just mentioned or maybe you have a more complex return or business return you can actually use our choosing a tax professional tool to help you find the right tax return preparer to help you and on the next slide the tax filing due date for most 2021 individual federal income tax returns is april the 18th and when you get ready to file we ask that you make sure that you file a complete and accurate tax return we also highly recommend that you file electronically to avoid refund delays paper returns are taking a significant amount of time to process right now and not only is electronic filing the safest and most accurate way to file a tax return electronically filed tax returns actually have fewer errors which means fewer delays we also want to encourage you to get your tax refund electronically by requesting direct deposit filing electronically and selecting direct deposit remains the fastest and safest way to file an accurate tax return and receive your refund and when you're entering that direct deposit information we do recommend that you triple check those numbers check those account numbers and the routing numbers to make sure you're entered and you have entered that information correctly because if you don't then your refund may end up in someone else's bank account and speaking of refunds most refunds are sent in less than 21 days although some tax returns will take longer to process for many reasons including if your tax return has errors or if your tax return is incomplete or that could be because you didn't include all of your income or maybe you didn't correctly reconcile your stimulus payment or your advanced child tax credit payments um sometimes they take longer because you've been affected by identity theft or fraud and sometimes tax returns just take additional time in general because the irs needs to perform an additional review it's important to note that the irs will contact you by mail if we need additional information to process your tax return and the where's my refund tool on irs.gov remains the best source for information on the status of your refund that tool is updated once a day and that update usually occurs overnight on the next slide and of course the opposite of getting a refund is when you owe taxes now you should file your tax return by april 18th even if you cannot fully pay the amount that you owe if you need more time to file your tax return you can submit a form 4868 that 4868 is a request for an extension and it will give you until october 17th to file your tax return however i need to mention that an extension of time to file is not an extension of time to pay all payments are still due on april 18th and anything not paid by that date will accrue interest and penalties so if you believe you may have trouble paying your tax bill by the april 18 due date i want to suggest that you do not panic you file your tax return even if you're unable to pay it however you should try to pay as much as you can by the 18th in order to minimize the amount of penalties and interest that will accrue after the due date filing the tax return on time is especially important because the late filing penalty and the late penalty payment penalty on unpaid taxes can add up quickly but if you can't afford to pay it there are options available to you you can request a short term extension to pay you can request an extended payment plan for a longer period of time the irs has something called an offering compromise where you can settle the taxes that you owe for less than full amount if you qualify or if you cannot afford to pay anything at all right now you can request that the irs temporarily delay the collection process until your financial situation improves you can find more information about all of your payment options on the irs website by going to irs.gov forward slash payments in the next slide now i want to talk about um irs account information how to get access to your tax records so first you can use an irs online account to securely access the latest tax information available about your federal tax account and see information from your most recently filed tax return on irs.gov if you haven't already set up an online account you can create an account to view your tax information online the irs has a publication 5533 that provides more information about how to set up your online account if you have an online account you can view the amount of your economic impact payments maybe you didn't get that letter 64.75 that tells you how much your stimulus payment was and you need to know that dollar amount in order to file your tax return or you can see the amount of your advanced child tax credit payments received in 2021. you if maybe you didn't get the letter 6419 that tells you how much those payments were and you need the dollar amount to file your tax return and reconcile that with the 2021 child tax credit other information you can find online is your most recent tax return additional records such as your transcripts if you have a payment plan you can build view the details of your payment plan you can actually see five years of payment history and any pending or schedule payments you may have but some people either can't set up an online account for some reason or they don't want to set up an online account there's still options to get your tax records you can order your transcripts over the phone by calling an automated system you put in a few key details and it will the system will automatically mail your transcripts to you you can on that same web page listed you can click a button and say mail them to me at my address of record put in a few key pieces of information and the system will automatically mail them to you or on that page you'll also find a form 4506 t that's a form you can fill out by hand and mail to the irs or fax to the irs all of these options get your transcripts to you within seven to ten workdays there's more information on the webpage listed but i do want to note accessing your online account or requesting your transcripts can answer many of the questions that you may otherwise need to call the irs for our irs assisters when you call them have to pull up your tax account to see what's going on to answer your questions so by obtaining your transcripts or requesting your transcripts you'll be able to see what they're seeing and maybe help you avoid that phone call all right now i want to turn it over to my colleague andrew van single he's the local taxpayer advocate in chicago and andrew is going to talk about the taxpayer advocate service andrew thank you susie so just a couple of quick things to talk about taxpayer advocate and how we work cases in our office so as the slide here um indicates taz is an independent agency um operated through the irs we're here to help protect i'm sorry protect your rights as a taxpayer and really get involved when the system breaks down or doesn't work as intended you can read more about our web our information about what we do on our website which is listed um on the slide in front of you or you can call if you need a case open you can call our centralized intake line and someone can help you with your tax matter next slide one of the unique features of taxpayer advocate is that when you come to taxpayer advocate you're going to get a case advocate that's going to work with you from start to finish so in the past you may have had to call the irs five different times and you heard from five different people that's really not the experience you're gonna get a taxpayer advocate you're gonna have one person work on your case from start to finish they'll help educate you as to um what caused the issue and um that's really kind of a unique feature that we have within taxpayer advocate um i will say though that a lot of the issues that we work on in taxpayer advocate are issues where the taxpayer filed an incorrect tax return we really do work on a whole wide range of cases not just individual we work with you know individual taxpayers corporations families single parents students um again just a wide variety but a lot of the case work that we do is for people who would file tax returns and there's some sort of issue with the return and that's causing delayed processing so susie kind of talked about really the importance of getting it right the first time with the backlog and all the delays that the irs has faced over the last couple years problems that normally took a couple of weeks or a couple months to get resolved are now going on you know six to 12 months to get resolved so it really is imperative that you know if you work somewhere only for a couple of weeks you got to wait for that w-2 and make sure you put it on the tax return taxes are increasingly complicated if you're getting health coverage through the affordable care act you're going to get a 1095-a if you're buying and selling stocks and bonds maybe through you know account like hood you're going to get a statement for that and that has to show up on your tax return if you're buying and selling crypto that's something that needs to be reported on tax return um kind of because of the downturn in the economy back in 2020 a lot of people either got laid off um or or just left work and kind of have gone and started their own small businesses so those are again all things that need to really be reported on a tax return and when you don't do that that's really when you get issues on the tax return next slide when you go to taxpayer advocate i always say you're not we're not the first phone call you'll make but hopefully the last one to get a case into taz generally it's going to require an immediate economic hardship so if something doesn't happen quickly the you know you're going to have a irreparable harm or you're going to have a significant expense and whatever the delay is in getting the issue resolved or there's a systemic delay and that means that it has gone on or you've been waiting for more than the prescribed periods that it takes to get the issue resolved those are generally when we we can get involved on those types of cases taxpayer advocate also administers the low-income taxpayer clinic program and so the clinics there's about i think 130 clinics across the country i think there's four or five in the chicago area and they help people who are low to moderate income with tax controversy matters so those are matters that essentially is everything except for filing a tax return so they can help you with if you get a letter from the irs or you get an exam audit if you have to go to tax court for cases and appeals they can really help you with any type of tax matter even though it is low to moderate income they do have some discretion to go over their income guidelines so don't let that be a you know a barrier to reaching out to them and there's no income eligibility requirements for them to give you advice so if you're just outside of their acceptance criteria they can still provide you with uh advice on your matter taz also administers the taxpayer advocacy panel and this is a member of i think 75 members across the country and they do outreach and talk to taxpayers and try to make improvements um within the irs next slide uh taxpayer advocate is very active on social media we have accounts on twitter facebook linkedin youtube and they put out a lot of good content the national taxpayer advocate that's my boss she puts out some good um information via her blog usually twice a month um and it's again it's really good information to have you can get more information on our website uh taxpayer advocate and irs in general is also doing a lot of hiring we were waiting to get a full year budget which was just signed i think last week or two weeks ago and so we're going to have a lot more job postings across the agency so be sure to check out usajobs if you're looking for a career in government service all of our hiring is done through usajobs and i think that rounds us out i think we can go back to to beau to talk about sba thank you andrew and susie we will now turn it over to robert hey thank you jasmine and hi everybody uh great to be on a panel with andrew and susan and i finally see andrew for the first time in a video conference so that's that's kind of nice um as as jasmine mentioned my name is bo steiner i'm the district director from the small business administration here in illinois and given that it is tax season and many small business owners took advantage of programs that were administered by the sba through the cares act and other legislation that afforded businesses with either loans forgiven forgiven loans grants we did or even payments we did want to talk a little bit about the tax implications of those programs now i do want to caveat this with i am not a tax advisor so you know i'm going to cover these things broadly for your unique situation if you if you have one you would definitely want to engage with uh somebody either a tax advisor accountant or i'm sure many of the systems that are available through many of the online providers who support you know filing your tax returns have implemented kind of the wizard to help with these kinds of things but but what i really want to do and only take a few minutes is just talk through the various programs and discuss how they will impact you and your your tax situation so first i'll touch on the paycheck protection program which was a loan program but the loan could be forgiven as long as the proceeds were used an appropriate way now normally a forgiven loan is considered the same as income so but the legislation through congress signed by the president basically said look any for any amount of forgiveness will not be considered taxable income per the rules of this program so so that's uh number one forgiven loan through the ppp program uh should not be a taxable event for you as as an organization now if you have a ppp loan and you have not yet filed for give forgiveness and you intend to really encourage you to do so so you can get that loan off the books it can affect you as you seek other capital down the road so just uh encouragement there second program i'm gonna touch on is the economic injury disaster loan program so loans generally are not taxable events so when you receive a loan you're going to repay it that's not something that would impact your taxes but i just want to make sure that's clear because that could there could be some confusion along the way the economic injury disaster loan idle for shorthand is not a forgiven it's not a program where you can seek forgiveness for that loan but again it's long-term low interest and there is no taxable event in that case turning to the restaurant revitalization fund program that was more or less very similar to a grant program where funds were distributed directly to business entities in the food beverage people convening space again congress made sure to to uh in the legislation to categorize that those funds as non-taxable for purposes of your federal tax returns as was the shutter venue operators grant again another grant program uh that made those funds available so in both of those cases both those programs no taxable impact there um and then finally there were in 2020 the targeted advanced uh economic injury disaster loan advance and the supplemental targeted advance these were funds that went to businesses in low-income communities met certain other criteria related to their business again congress made sure that those funds would not be taxable per the attack per the the legislation that was signed into law so um i think the big picture here is most of the programs that sba provided through the cares act and other legislation should not impact your your have an adverse tax impact on your tax returns um as you go ahead and file again you want to touch base with your your tax professional to make sure that's the case but um but that's what uh congress legislated also note that as a small business owner when you're looking at your profit and loss statements uh your account may show those funds as income but they'll be separated out typically so that they aren't included in your general revenue that you drive through the day-to-day operations of of your business so hopefully that's helpful on that front um and then i would since we are you know talking about irs and sba i do just want to put a plug in you know for those of you that are still in the process of working through the economic injury disaster loan program we do have a number of people that have applied and are waiting for decisions one of the key elements that we need is a irs form 4506t which allows sba to pull your tax transcript from the irs so if you are asked to provide that as part of the process i just ask that you really look at the instructions or some very detailed guidelines that we need in order to have those 4506 t's accepted by the irs so that we can get your transcripts which we need in order to approve and disperse the loan so um again any questions that come up either now we can we can try and answer or in the future you can always reach out to sba at the illinois district here at illinois dot d o at sba.gov so uh you know we're here to help and we can we can take a look you know if you're having trouble with 4506t or you have other questions about these programs happy to answer any of those questions that's the best way to reach us awesome thank you bo um once again thank you to susie andrew and beau for your awesome presentations we will now move into the q a section of our workshop so if any of our participants have a question you can type it into the q a box at the bottom of your screen otherwise you can ask your question out loud by using the raise hand feature okay so it seems as joyetta hope i'm saying that right has a question toyetta i'm gonna go ahead and allow you on the screen joyetta if you can please unmute yourself and ask the question okay now you can hear me yes ma'am uh i'm wondering because i'm i had been doing my taxes myself but i noticed there's a uh forum for senior seniors when i say senior seniors i mean those of us over 75. i think you're julietta i think you're referring to the form 1040 sr and that is a a form that's available for seniors to use to file it's very similar to the regular form 1040 however it does list on the form itself your standard deduction amount for being over 65 or if you're married and both you and your spouse are over 65 those numbers are listed directly on the forum rather than having to dig through the 134 page instruction booklet to find those numbers so the 1040 sr is specifically out there for for senior 65 and older yes okay the other thing i have a problem with i notice all the forms now are online uh they used to have them at the library or i would go over to arlen and pick them up in the office over there but there doesn't seem to be a way to get them for those of us who maybe not have a computer or we have to borrow somebody else's and they say okay enough of this borrowing yes the irs can mail you forms there's a 800 number you can call it's very easy to remember it's one eight zero zero tax form or one eight zero zero eight two nine three six seven six and i'll type that in the chat too for you okay thank you i have it thank you yes thank you very much you're very welcome would add to that as well um filing i i know a lot of people just prefer to file a paper return and i would encourage you or anyone to file electronically i know if you have access to a computer might be an issue there's also vita programs across the state vita is volunteer income tax assistance and susie i think you had that in one of your slides i don't know the the look up to there's an online look up tool but there's also a phone number you can call um to to find more information about that um tce tax counseling for the elderly is is done through aarp and they have sites that focus on preparing returns for senior citizens uh again in my remarks i talked about issues with the irs a lot of times are are because of um you know i say self-inflicted wounds those are returns that are prepared incorrectly we notice a lot of paper filed returns because you're kind of manually entering that information have a higher likelihood of having issues down the road because of you know maybe transposing a number doing the math wrong or whatever it is the software does make it uh very easy i know that's not accessible to anyone but to the extent it is i would really encourage you to to file electronically yes i will go to the library but i'm kind of old school when i think about security and privacy just old school if you're over 70 75 you're a little bit more apprehensive about certain things we just haven't got with technology but we're trying i understand thank you for all for your help and the information is most helpful thank you thank you joyetta so now we have a question from c.b lewis c.b if you can go ahead and unmute yourself and ask away yes good evening um i'm going to frame the question is to the irs and representative i um timely filed my my tax return as well as my mom's tax return for 2020 and have been waiting ever since and in the process my mom has since passed away and so i then filed the necessary forms to act on her behalf to let them know i called irs immediately that was last year and i'm still waiting i never get anybody on the phone that could give me information it's like pieces oh your mother's deceased you have to send this and i send that in i've sent everything in to say i'm the next of kin i am the you know person that is in the power of attorney position so i'm just have my wits in i was going to file um a congressional with a representative kelly's office but then this came this invite came and so i thought this would be a perfect opportunity to just get some direction she had a large refund due and um unfortunately she passed away in july of 2021. so mike my condolences about your mother i would say you're on the right track i would um follow up with the congresswoman's office and that case will get routed over to us into the chicago office and we'll but we'll oversee that we'll probably it sounds like you may have two separate cases one for um your own individual issue and then one for your deceased mother no no no it's just for my mom my taxes were i owed and i paid that's not the issue it was her taxes that i found we both filed at the same time and uh my mom was 89 so you know i was i was her power of attorney and i filed her taxes properly as i had it every year but because it was taking so long and i called to report that she passed and then i sent in all the paperworks as the person acted as a proxy in her passing and all of that nothing and i'd never get anybody on the phone so yeah even frustrating you know just want some closure yeah absolutely so the the head of my agency erin collins she's the national taxpayer advocate and every year in january and february she issues what's called the annual report to congress and she highlights a lot of the struggles that the irs has had and recognizes some of the victories that they've had as well and they've they've been under um unsurmountable just odds and and success was never really um a likelihood and so at the beginning of the year they had six million individual returns that were in their backlog and they've been just desperately trying to get caught up on that and so we had um there was a period in time in which we couldn't take those cases because there really wasn't much that we could do if the irs if it was somewhere between your mailbox and in the hands of an irs employee there really wasn't much we could do because if the case comes to taxpayer advocate we say hey process this return the irs doesn't have anything and that's been the biggest challenge because once the return gets mailed to the irs it goes through a long process to get before it even gets scanned in and a record is is created in which we can you know go and pull the digital copy of that and that's been a big source of frustration a lot of taxpayers have been sending in a second return and that's causing processing issues because they may process that second return as a duplicate return or it may put a freeze on the refund and so again it kind of creates more issues down the road the commissioner has resourced people from all different areas within the irs if they have any technical ability or have in the past process returns they've pulled them from all of those functions which is good because now that's getting those people to help with that backlog but that's furthering the kind of the the personnel crisis that we have is that they're doing important work as well and so now um those workflows are taking longer as well so um i would say to anyone hearing this you know by mid-march which you know it's it's mid-march right now if you filed a return on time last year and it hasn't been processed you should really contact taxpayer advocate or congresswoman kelly's office because it's you know it's really almost going on a year and um you know that's something that we would certainly want to look at and also too i would say a lot of times you know people hear that taxpayer advocate can help and a lot of times we can but it's really important to try to get it resolved on your own especially if it's for a case like an identity verification sometimes those issues can be resolved over the phone and i know it's so difficult to get a hold of anyone on the phone so a lot of times people give up those cases because the way we work them it might take several weeks or several months and if you can just get through to somebody on the phone it's possible that you could get that resolved in that one phone call or you could make an appointment to go to a taxpayer assistance center and they can verify your identity for you as opposed to usually going to taxpayer advocates going to be the quickest route but sometimes there are other options that could be a little bit quicker okay so i appreciate all the information and i got them some options and hopefully i'll get some resolution to that so thank you this was very beneficial to to me um and i'll get on the first thing so i guess jasmine you'll be hearing from me or somebody from uh her office i'll be in contact absolutely and um tas is wonderful to work with they're always so helpful to our office so they post the number or anything i'm sorry for cutting you off did they post a number or something where you know who to contact is that in the chat information it was in the presentation i can also copy it into the chat um and additionally um we can assist with the case um so i did share our office's number as well as um a link to our digital privacy release form but i'll go ahead and share the task number right now once i find it in the presentation okay i've got a jasmine i'll put it in the chat okay thank you susie okay thank you guys appreciate it thank you for your question um we'll give a couple more seconds again if you do have a question at the bottom of your screen you will see a q a box

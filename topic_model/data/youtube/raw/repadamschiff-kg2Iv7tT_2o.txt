   ♪♪  >>> LET'S BRING IN A MEMBER OF  THE SELECT COMMITTEE  INVESTIGATING THE JANUARY 6th  ATTACK ON THE CAPITOL,  DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN ADAM  SCHIFF OF CALIFORNIA, HE IS  CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE  INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE. CONGRESSMAN, GOOD TO HAVE YOU  WITH US THIS MORNING. LET'S START WITH HOUSEKEEPING. THE HEARING DELAYED TO A DATE TO BE DETERMINED. WE HEARD FROM CONGRESSWOMAN  LOFGREN IT WAS OVER A VIDEO  MATTER. YOU ALL HAVE SEEM TO HAVE BEEN  WELL ORGANIZED IN YOUR  PRESENTATIONS SO FAR. IS THAT ALL THIS IS ABOUT? >> IT'S JUST A LOGISTICS REALLY. IT'S NOT ABOUT ANY WITNESS  DIFFICULTIES OR ANY DIVISION IN  THE COMMITTEE. WE'RE JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE  THAT WE PROCEED IN THE MOST  ORDERLY WAY THAT WE HAVE THE  MOST PROFESSIONAL HEARINGS  POSSIBLE AND SO WE'RE MAKING  ADJUSTMENTS. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO LEARN NEW  INFORMATION, BUT MOSTLY THIS IS  A LOGISTICAL MATTER.  >> SO LET'S LOOK AHEAD TO  TOMORROW'S HEARING THEN AS  SCHEDULED, WHICH WILL FOCUS ON  THE PRESSURE THAT WAS APPLIED TO VICE PRESIDENT -- THEN VICE  PRESIDENT PENCE IN THE LEAD UP  TO JANUARY 6th AND ON THE DAY OF JANUARY 6th. WHAT CAN PEOPLE EXPECT TO SEE  AND HEAR THAT WE DON'T KNOW  ALREADY? >> WELL, YOU KNOW, WHILE I CAN'T GET INTO TOO MANY SPECIFICS LIKE THE HEARINGS YOU SEE BEFORE, IT  WILL BE A MIX OF THINGS THAT THE PUBLIC KNOWS, NEW INFORMATION  ABOUT THE PRESSURE CAMPAIGN, NEW IMAGE, NEW DEPOSITION TESTIMONY. YOU KNOW, INTERWOVEN IN A WAY  THAT TELLS THE STORY BECAUSE I  THINK AMONG MOST IMPORTANT  THINGS WE'RE DOING IN THE  HEARINGS, IS WE'RE SHOWING HOW  ONE THING RELATED TO ANOTHER,  HOW ONE PRESSURE CAMPAIGN  RELATED TO ANOTHER, HOW THIS  EFFORT BUILT AND BUILT UNTIL  THERE WAS THIS LAST-DITCH EFFORT TO STOP THE COUNTING ON JANUARY  6th THAT LED TO VIOLENCE. THE PRESSURE CAMPAIGN AGAINST  THE VICE PRESIDENT IS A VERY  INTEGRAL PART OF THAT. THERE ARE MULTIPLE LINES OF  EFFORT TO OVERTURN THE ELECTION. ANY ONE OF THEM COULD HAVE  FAILED, WHICH WOULD HAVE  RESULTED IN A REAL  CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS. YOU CAN EXPECT TO SEE STUFF YOU  HAVEN'T SEEN BEFORE, INTERWOVEN  WITH THINGS YOU HAVE, BUT TO  TELL THE STORY IN, I HOPE, A  COMPELLING WAY.  >> CONGRESSMAN SCHIFF, GOOD  MORNING. JONATHAN LEMIRE. IN THE LAST HEARING WE HEARD THE COMICAL RANTINGS OF RUDY  GIULIANI. IN THE SHOW WE TALKED ABOUT THE  DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND THE  FORMER PRESIDENT'S EFFORTS TO  USE DOJ INAPPROPRIATELY TO THROW OUT ELECTION RESULTS, CLAIM  THEIR INVESTIGATIONS AND USE  THAT AS AN IMPETUS TO CONTINUE  HIS HOLD ON POWER. TALK TO US ABOUT DOJ, BECAUSE  THAT'S THE SUBJECT OF AN  UPCOMING HEARING, BUT MORE  BROADLY, WHAT THE COMMITTEE HAS  FOUND ABOUT THE FORMER  PRESIDENT'S EFFORTS TO USE THE  LEVERS OF GOVERNMENT ITSELF TO  TRY TO STAY IN POWER? >> WELL, I THINK THIS IS GOING  TO BE A VERY IMPORTANT HEARING  NEXT WEEK. THAT IS, THAT, YOU KNOW, WE SAW  AT THE VERY END A PATTERN WE HAD SEEN THROUGHOUT MUCH OF THE  TRUMP PRESIDENCY, WHEN HE DIDN'T GET THE ANSWERS HE WANTED, HE  WOULD SACK PEOPLE WHO WOULD  STAND UP TO HIM, WHO WOULD DO  THE RIGHT THING. IN THIS CASE THERE WAS AN EFFORT TO DECAPITATE THE LEADERSHIP OF  THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT THAT  WOULDN'T GO ALONG WITH THIS  EFFORT TO OVERTURN THE ELECTION, WOULDN'T ESSENTIALLY PUSH OUT TO THE STATES FALSE CLAIMS OF  MASSIVE FRAUD, WOULDN'T QUESTION THE ELECTION THE WAY DONALD  TRUMP WANTED, BUT THERE WAS NO  EVIDENTIARY BASIS FOR, AND YET,  ALSO PART OF THE STORY IS  JEFFREY CLARK AND THERE SEEMS TO BE JEFFREY CLARK AT MULTIPLE  POINTS IN THIS PLOT, PEOPLE  WILLING TO DO ANYTHING TO SEIZE  POWER, HOLD POWER, ADVANCE  THEMSELVES OR THEIR CAREER. I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT PART  OF THE STORY. THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS  SUPPOSED TO STAND FOR JUSTICE  AND HERE THERE WAS AN EFFORT, AT THE VERY TOP FROM THE PRESIDENT  ON DOWN, TO USE THAT DEPARTMENT  TO DEFY THE INTEREST OF JUSTICE. >> CONGRESSMAN, IT'S SAM STEIN  HERE. THERE'S -- IT STRIKES ME THERE'S TWO PARALLEL STORY LINES GOING  ON AROUND JANUARY 6th. ONE IS THE WORK THAT YOU AND THE REST OF THE COMMITTEE ARE DOING  RIGHT NOW AND THE SECOND IS  HAPPENING ACROSS THE COUNTRY  WITH THE ELECTION OF A LOT OF  REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES WHO  BELIEVE THE BIG LIE, NOT ONLY  THAT, HAVE SAID THEY WOULD NOT  HAVE CERTIFIED THE 2020  ELECTIONS. I'M WONDERING, HOW IS THAT  INFORMING THE WORK YOU DO? AND ALSO, DO YOU THINK THAT YOU  MAY HAVE MOVED TOO SLOWLY IN  GETTING THIS STUFF OUT TO THE  PUBLIC, IN THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE WINNING CRITICAL OFFICES THAT  WILL OVERSEE THE NEXT ELECTION? >> ON THE FIRST POINT IT SHOWS  THE ENDURING IMPORTANCE OF THE  WORK WE'RE DOING, THAT THE BIG  LIE DIDN'T END ON JANUARY 6th,  THAT THE BIG LIE IS PROMOTED TO  THIS DAY AND, THEREFORE, THE  PARTS OF THE HEARINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN DEMONSTRATING WHERE WE SHOW THAT IT IS A LIE, THERE WAS NO  MASSIVE FRAUD, THAT JOE BIDEN  DID WIN THE ELECTION, THAT  DONALD TRUMP KNEW THAT HE LOST,  HE PUSHED THESE CLAIMS ANYWAY,  AND THAT THEY PUSHES THEM TO  THIS DAY, I THINK IT SHOWS MORE  IMPORTANT THAN EVER WE GET THAT  GOOD INFORMATION OUT. I ALSO THINK, IN TERMS OF DID WE WAIT TOO LONG, NO, THE  INVESTIGATIONS HAVE A PACE OF  THEIR OWN. IT TAKES YOU TIME TO ACCUMULATE  THE EVIDENCE WE'VE CUMULATED AND WE DIDN'T WANT TO PRESENT IT  UNTIL WE KNEW IF NOT ALL OF THE  FACTS, ENOUGH OF THE FACTS, TO  SHOW THE COUNTRY THE CONCLUSIONS WE'RE REACHING ABOUT THE  PRESIDENT'S ROLE IN THIS PLOT. BUT WE ARE -- AND THIS TO ME IS  A FUNDAMENTAL POINT -- OUR  DEMOCRACY TODAY IS MORE  VULNERABLE THAN IT WAS ON  JANUARY 6th BECAUSE OF THE LIE  THAT BROUGHT ABOUT THAT VIOLENCE CONTINUES TO PROLIFERATE AROUND  THE COUNTRY IN JUST THE MANNER  THAT YOU DESCRIBED. >> ALL RIGHT. ADAM SCHIFF, MEMBER OF THE  JA

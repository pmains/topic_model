hello I'm congressman Jim Costa today I joined the Armenian community in commemorating the hundred and fourth anniversary of the Armenian Genocide on April 24th 1915 the Ottoman Empire began to systematically deport one and a half million innocent Armenians sending them to their death the first genocide in the 20th century today we stand here more than a century later and this atrocity still has not been recognized by the United States Congress it pains me to say the Republic of Turkey shamefully continues to ignore the voices of survivors and their descendants around the world recognizing the Armenian Genocide is not something to be debated it's sadly a historical fact the time for recognition is now let's call for what it was genocide the first genocide as I said in the 20th century in my hometown of Fresno California I grew up hearing stories of my friends and neighbors the COS Ariens Abraham ian's and the Cashion's the Armenian community whose families experienced horrors and atrocities at the hands of the Ottoman Empire survivors and their descendants many of whom settled in the San Joaquin Valley have become incredible examples of the American dream the Armenian people around the world have shown great resilience in rebuilding their lives in the years following the genocide during their Diaspora also enduring years of brutal Soviet rule in their native homeland of Armenia and more recently the ongoing conflict in Artsakh but they continue to persevere and make their mark in our minyan communities around the world a shining example occurred just last year again in Fresno place I call home but when I tell people that I come from the land of William Saroyan they know I'm from Fresno through the work of numerous community members and generous benefactors the William Saroyan house museum was unveiled in August 2018 the home were the award-winning international writer spent the last two decades of his life is now an interactive museum and it's wonderful it's open for members of our community to enjoy and all who visit as history is showing the Armenian people are stronger than any attack even this horrific genocide I stand with the Armenian people to commemorate this hundred and fourth anniversary of the Armenian Genocide but more importantly to celebrate their incredible spirit their tenacity their love for their culture and their land and for America as we move forward we must never ever forget and that's why it's important that we commemorate a hundred and fourth anniversary of the first genocide in the 20th century thank you very much

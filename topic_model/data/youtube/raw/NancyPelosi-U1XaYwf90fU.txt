rise to sing the praises of our democratic members on the house budget committee led by the gentleman from Maryland mr. Van Hollen thank you for bringing us about a balanced budget to the floor balanced option on how we go forward there to the floor yes we know we have to make our cuts that we have to increase revenue but most of all we have to increase jobs growth is what is important and what's the difference between these two budgets the budget the mr. Van Hollen is proposing and the Ryan Republican budget is that the Ryan Republican budget loses jobs the Van Hollen budget the Democratic budget is a job creator it's a job creator it also invests in education think of it if you're a student and you have a student loan into law in July first your interest rate will double from three point four percent six to six point eight percent Ryan Republican budget says that's just fine the house Democratic budget prevents that from happening and if you're a senior the Ryan budget takes you depth where the Medicare guarantee is cut you may have to spend 36 thousand dollars or more for less in terms of benefits all the while well not protecting our students while not creating jobs while not protecting our seniors and their Medicare the Ryan budget gives over 300,000 dollars tax break to people making over a million dollars a year how can that be how can that be the more people know about that budget the more they know that it hurts them in their lives the budget that is put forth by the House Democrats is a positive one for economic growth for investment in our small businesses for honoring the entrepreneurial spirit of America for strengthening the middle class for building letters of opportunity for people want to work hard play by the rules take responsibility for them to succeed as we reignite the American dream so I thank you mr. Van Hollen for your leadership in putting a budget for that is responsible but honors our commitment to future generations that reduces the deficit in a positive way as opposed to mr. Ryan's Republican budget doesn't even get to a deficit reduction and ending that until close to 2040 I mean the contrast could not be greater the impact on America's families could not let bit make be greater just think seniors k six thousand dollars more for fewer benefits in Medicare while the gift they give sick to three hundred thousand dollar tax cut to the wealthiest people in our country you be the judge is that a budget that is a statement of art of your values vote YES on the Van Hollen budget vote no on the Ryan Republican budget I yield back the balance of my time Chelios back gentleman from Maryland has 15 seconds remaining gentleman from Wisconsin has two painting

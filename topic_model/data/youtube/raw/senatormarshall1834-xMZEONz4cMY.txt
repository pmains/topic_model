as an obstetrician i had the honor of delivering more than 5 000 babies because of these wonderful moments and experiences i believe life begins at conception in fact this is why today's historic decision signals a new beginning for millions of unborn american children in many states this monumental ruling will trigger protections for the well-being of moms and guard the sanctity of life for their sons and daughters hopefully today begins healing the wounds the pro-abortion junior ripped open on american society almost 50 years ago as we all know radical unethical judicial staff tried to stop this decision by leaking it to a complicit media and don't forget please don't ever forget the democrat majority leader himself threatened supreme court justices with harm and called on his followers to inflict the whirlwind of pain if the justices dare touch his party's hallowed anti-democratic pro-abortion addicted thank goodness for american democracy the conspirators failed and justice has prevailed their disgraceful legacy will be the irreparable damage they cause to the legitimacy and reputation of our nation's highest court i hope you all will join me as we applaud the courageous justices who defied the far left's mob style intimidation tactics and the threats on their lives and let us not forget to emphasize and thank their families who continue to endure stress and too many anxious days and nights we're proud of these justices who fulfilled their oath by boldly standing for the constitution and protecting the sanctity and blessings of life all this being said i want to remind everyone that putting an end to roe versus wade simply places this emotion-filled issue into the hands of the citizens of this country and their elected state officials as opposed to unelected members of the federal judiciary nothing more nothing less while the democrat majority leader called for violence during a pro-abortion rally speech on the steps of the supreme court we as a nation are better than this i urge all americans to remain peaceful and respectful during the protest of this decision justice cannot and will not be served under the threat of mod violence so help us god

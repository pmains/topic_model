ladies and gentlemen please welcome the president of J Street Jeremy ben-ami [Applause] [Music] [Applause] good evening good evening and welcome to Jays roots 2018 national conference a voice for today and a vision for tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow April 15th marks 10 years to the day since the official launch of Jay Street on the one hand I can't believe how quickly the years have flown by and on the other I'm amazed by all that we've achieved in so short a time first and foremost we have established that without a doubt there is more than one way to be pro-israel we have established we have established a voice for those who believe that loving and supporting Israel doesn't mean you have to always agree with whatever the government of Israel says and does it's a voice that says we can be pro-israel and Pro Palestinians and we are tired and we have had enough of being told it's an either/or choice it's a voice for the majority of our community that supports two States and diplomacy and opposes occupation and demolitions and creeping annexation it is a voice for 200,000 people 200,000 people in chapters all over the country including thousands of students and over 850 rabbis and Cantor's it is a voice that speaks through the largest pro-israel PAC in this country that this year will support 150 candidates for the House and Senate and raise over 4 million dollars it's a voice it's a voice that is earned respect and garnered power my friends after only ten years we should be very proud that today our voice is being heard and at this incredible milestone for us I want to recognize those who made what we have achieved possible so I'd like to open the conference with a huge thank you to the incredible Jay Street staff who not only not only have they worked so hard to put this conference together but they have built this organization from scratch so I'd like to ask all those who work for J Street and everybody who's ever worked for J Street to please stand up let's go and I like the rest of you to join me in a round of applause of appreciation [Applause] next I want to thank the board of directors of J Street and the incredible leaders from all over the country who volunteer their time their energy and their wisdom and who donate their resources to make J streets work possible I also want to thank in particular the 1200 students who are with us here today J Street you chase me you pushes us every day to focus on what's right to focus on what's best for the State of Israel for the Jewish and Palestinian people's and for the American Jewish community thank you our tenth anniversary coincides with the 70th birthday of the State of Israel yah Matsumoto will be celebrated this week and may 15th will mark 70 years since Israel's Declaration of Independence we're really really proud to celebrate the miracle of Israel's rebirth the realization of a 2000 year dream of the Jewish people to again be a free people in our own land what our parents and our grandparents built and fought for we honor and we celebrate and we pledge not just to help preserve it but to help strengthen and improve it milestones like J Street's tenth and Israel's 70th our points of time for celebration but there are also times to take stock of the challenges that lie ahead and my friends the dangers of this present moment are deadly serious when it comes to Israel the starkest challenge is that the one-state reality is fast becoming a true one state nightmare we may be marking 70 years of Independence this year but let's not forget that last year we marked 50 years of occupation Israel is without a doubt at a fork in the road where it either must take the two-state path and remain both Jewish and democratic or head down the one-state path where it has to choose to be one or the other this status quo isn't simply unsustainable it is cruel as the suffering and violence in Gaza of the past few weeks demonstrate [Music] a solution that meets the needs of both peoples is urgently needed and it is the only way out of the cycle of violence that plagues not only the people of Gaza but those in Israel who live on its borders what's needed are not provocations like next month's moves of the US Embassy to Jerusalem or more demolitions and land confiscations on the West Bank the challenges to Israel they go beyond the conflict to the very nature of the state itself whether or not it's going to respect all forms of practice of Judaism will it allow in refugees and asylum-seekers will it protect key institutions of democracy like a free media and independent judiciary or our good friends at NGOs like the new Israel fund and here in the United States I don't think that any of us in this room needs to be reminded of the threats we face under this president to the very heart of our democracy the demagoguery the racism the fear-mongering the assault on the media on key institutions of our democracy this is a moment of real challenge and let me add a word about last night's military attack in Syria we are horrified by the crimes against humanity that have been committed by the Assad regime in Syria the world cannot stand idly by as a leader uses chemical weapons against his own people and killed hundreds of thousands of people with his own hands last night's strike it was limited in scope and it was targeted on sites that were directly tied to the gas attack outside Damascus and it did have the support of a number of our allies but a limited tactical strike does not form the basis of a strategy nor does the legitimacy of the targets alone establish the legality of the Constitution of the United States vests war-making Authority in the Congress of the United States and Congress needs to assert its authority Congress needs to act we will be calling on them on Tuesday to act to restrain this president in the coming weeks so that this president must get the necessary legal authority for any further military action he must place such action in the context of a larger political and diplomatic strategy and he must build broader international support for that strategy we would be wrong to think that the dangers that we face at this moment in history are limited to Israel and the United States all across the globe liberal democracy is in retreat J Street proudly opposes these trends and we couldn't be clearer in warning of the dangers that President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu posed to their respective countries but ours is not and should not be a movement built simply on opposition we must offer a vision for tomorrow for Israel for Israel our vision is of a thriving secure state that hasn't had to choose between being Jewish and democratic precisely because it has ended occupation and realized the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination in a state of their own it's a vision of a future in which the children and grandchildren of Israelis and Palestinians alike avoid the violence bloodshed and tears that have plagued their parents and grandparents for generations it is a vision of an Israel that lives out the values of the prophets outlined in the Declaration of Independence most notably a commitment to freedom and justice and peace we have a vision as well for the United States that vision is grounded in an unyielding belief in the amazing democratic system that was established by our founders and in the importance of the individual rights that they guaranteed it's of the United States that is a strong and respected world leader it plays a vital role in resolving conflicts through diplomacy and negotiations not causing conflicts it's a vision of the United States that sees the agreement preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon as a good deal and a model for addressing global conflicts through international cooperation and it's a vision firmly rooted in the values that are the bedrock of J Street of this country and of our people as a people who have been refugees and strangers in the lands of others we understand in our bones the importance of offering safety to those in danger and of guaranteeing equality to all regardless of race religion gender or sexual orientation that's why that's why we fight for immigrants and against racism and we battle Islamophobia as we battle anti-semitism it is these values it is these values and that vision on which we have built J Street over the past ten years our challenge now is to bring that vision to life and for that we need to take political power because it is not enough to lead the opposition we have to lead the way J streets number-one task for the next seven months is to elect members of the House and Senate who share our values and share our vision and you can block that's how we're gonna block in the irrational and incompetent president from leading this country to disaster and it's up to each of you it's up to each of us to contribute the time the energy and the money that you can to ensure that they win our partners in Israel in Palestine they too must work to bring in new leaders who will show the courage of those who've ended conflicts like Sadat and beggin like Mandela and de Klerk and like the signatories of the Good Friday Accords in Ireland that are marking their 20th anniversary this weekend only when there are leaders ready to take the tough steps necessary to end their conflict will there be an end to occupation an end to the siege of Gaza and an end to the threat of terror and violence [Music] the road ahead is not easy and I know that many here despair in the face of the challenges that we face but complaining and hopelessness gets us nowhere throwing up our hands and walking away only means that our opponents win if we want things to change it is on us to bring that change it is on us to organize and mobilize every challenge and every obstacle can be overcome by good people fighting together for a better future tonight we're gonna meet some of those people Israeli Palestinian and American Jewish Christian and Muslim all of them working on the ground in Israel in Palestine right here at home to shape that better future we draw strength from their example and their determination and as important they draw strength from us knowing that there are Americans working alongside them to change the course of history it may not be 2020 yet but tonight we have 20/20 vision we can see you like that we can see a clear path ahead we know what we must do in our second decade we must do our part in this country to get American policy back on track to support Israelis and Palestinians who seek to end their conflict we must do our part in this country to get American politics back on track and elect those who share our values and vision and we must do our part in this country to get our American Jewish communal institutions and leaders to speak out and act on the values we hold dear United United by our values inspired by our vision J Street is ready to help lift the darkness that is perfect providing our politics today and build a better tomorrow for the generations to come so let's roll up our sleeves let's raise our voices it is time to get to work thank you for all that you do and I'm looking forward to a great conference thank you

difficult not to be filled with frustration disheartened and angered by the violence the recriminations and lack of progress towards peace we scan the horizon for glimmers of hope although the

honored and delighted to be with you so many of you at the opening of J Street an anniversary conference I along with Abbott Alma Brown my friend to a percent women wage peace a movement began began three and a half years ago just by a handful of women after the last war in Gaza the protective age saying enough is enough today [Applause] so today we number now and now 35,000 registered members form a course the spectrum is of Israeli civil society that number in proportion to the USA population would be the equivalent of 2 million people not a negligible amount during my time as a Knesset member representing the secular party Shin we I served on the security and Foreign Affairs Committee one of only two women among 15 male generals how did I get to be a member of this committee a very prestigious committee Tamila paid who will then the leader of my party asked me when I came to the Knesset which committee I would like to join in the Knesset I immediately answered security and foreign affairs there was silent on the other side of the phone and then a long laugh what do you know about security in my dear friend 80 he asked me and what do you know I answered he hang up the phone the next day I became a member of the committee [Applause] I believe it is crucial to have civilians especially women involved in security decision when women influence decision about war and peace we can break the endless cycles of violence and bloodshed like the tragic escalation we are saying now on the Gaza border my involvement in politics especially on behalf of women and peace taught me that achieving real lasting agreement bringing - security to Israeli and Palestinians would require a broad movement because Israel in order to build support from the ground up and hold our leaders accountable to finding a sustainable solution so several friends and myself we began to envision such a movement a womb a women's movement for peace we knew that to be effective where to emphasize a lot of quality we cherish inclusiveness compassion looking at the need of the others and the fact that all of us are mothers all mothers are all side free the same about their children we consciously decided we would leave behind the burdens of history as well as the blame game we started to talk to more women all kinds of women women we would never encountered in our day-to-day lives women whom I previously had no real opportunity to meet women I never thought I would consider sisters in a movement for peace I met Donna from Damona and Yael forms the road both for my Hakan in right-wing backgrounds the Dick's and up Winkies were so different for mine but they like me are mothers who just want the children to be safe and are open to looking for different solutions i met me harlan tomorrow religious women from the settlements whom i thought would be opposed to what i believe in only to discover that they too long for first solution I'm ed Goodell animal brave Arab women citizens of Israel who were not only willing to join a group of mostly Jewish women but who are also already an able to act as an important bridge to Palestinian women in order to advance an acceptable agreement today I work with a team of women which piece member to convince political leader at all level that yes peace is possible and that they already have the support of tens of thousands of diverse Israeli women who want them to take immediate step towards negotiation our team is now supplemented with 5,200 women who come to Jerusalem every week the Knesset is in session to discuss one-on-one with Knesset member the connection between peace security and Israel future indeed every MK now recognized the persistent tireless women of women wage peace during the Knesset Monday plenum MK is often waved to us from the speaker's podium as women bridge piece sits together in the gallery in solidarity women who have traveled from all over the country some with the herd covered in heads or scarves other than hijab other bareheaded all wearing white turquoise like me MK is from across the political spectrum have expressed the gratitude allowed for our having returned the word peace to the national conversation here is what I can tell you for sure after three and a half years of activism with women which piece we Israeli women are learning to collaborate in the struggle to find a way to peace I know that what we have in common is greater than what separates us this realization has transformed me it has made me more tolerant attentive and open to new possibilities we can work i believe i totally believe that we can work together to achieve a peaceful outcome and a better future thank you [Applause] good evening J Street my name is avatar Brown and I'm a co-founder of a management training company for the high-tech sector many for projects involves connecting Israeli and Palestinian companies unlike a tea politics never interested me I thought I could live my life quietly pursue my career raise my children but the 2014 war in Gaza woke me up or rather shook me up I had two sons and a son-in-law and on the frontline in Gaza I can't even begin to tell you what I was going through luckily they all returned home safely but I then realized that this scenario might be a ritual I would have to go through every two or three years I then said enough as an Israeli patriot as a Zionist I said no more there must be another way this endless fighting does not make sense it doesn't get us anywhere as the war ended and I heard there were women who decided to get off the couch and bring an end to the cycle of madness a thousand women put on a white shirt a turquoise scarf and boarded the train to the road near the Gaza border on that train we launched a new kind of women's movement women wage peace three and a half years later not only my entire wardrobe had changed to white but my whole life has changed as well I have become an activist and have vowed not to stop until there is an agreement with the Palestinians today I serve as the co coordinator of the movement strategy team so I can tell you firsthand that our theory of change involves the strategy that no Israeli piece group has yet proposed we believe that the need for peace and security does not belong and cannot be monopolized by only one sector we understand that people from across the political spectrum must join together and together compel our decision maker makers to end the conflict by mobilize more of the political center and right we can more successfully influence elected officials on all levels from the Knesset to the security cabinet to local government we have adopted the new language of radical inclusivity focusing on the existential necessity of reaching a political agreement rather than advocating for any one specific plan we work together Jewish and Arab women religious and secular women women from tel-aviv and the periphery veterans and newcomers and yes even women from the West Bank settlements as you can imagine this diversity is challenging but we are learning how to stash away even our most scared ideological position at times for the sake of our common goal a political agreement to end the israeli-palestinian conflict with equal representation of women in every phase of the negotiations can women wage peace you might be right you convinced me you might be surprised to hear of the ongoing dialogue between secular left-wing women from the kyboot same up north and women from the settlements in the West Bank this interaction began when a right-wing a right-wing settler rabbi so women wage peace standing at every traffic intersection he passed holding signs and pictures of begging Sadat and Carter declaring this was achieved in the past it can be achieved again he stopped ask questions and ended up inviting women many of whom have never crossed the green line before to visit and speak with settlers women from the heart about the meaning of home security and peace and the dialogue continues okay so you might be thinking dialogue is nice but can women wage peace last October during our massive journey to peace thousands of Israeli women gathered with 3,000 Palestinian women from the West Bank in a huge tent we constructed in the desert near Jericho we called it the tent of Sarah in hagatha the mothers of Isaac and Ishmael we their daughters walked out of that tent vowing to changed our long and painful history we their daughters vow to take responsibility for the kind of world we are living our children without to make this region safe and prosperous for all of us the viral video you are about to watch pray of the mothers was filmed two years ago during our march of Hope in it you will also see who de aborto be the next speaker tonight a Palestinian partner and mentor so woman can women wage peace we are encouraged by what Nelson Mandela noticed about a nature of social change it always seems impossible until it's done we invite you to join us in doing the impossible thank you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] ladies and gentlemen please welcome Hooda Abu r-cube from the Alliance for Middle East peace [Applause] [Music] by fun here now myself here Salaam alaikum first of all thank you J Street for hosting us as a civil society and shining a spotlight on those working every day on the ground to transform the israeli-palestinian conflict a special thank you to the women Leadership Forum for their ongoing support of inclusive feminist political activism my name is Hoda Barkov and I'm the regional director of the Alliance for Middle East peace and to those who don't know all map it's an network of over 100 groups working every day in every sector of the society to break out the vicious cycle that separates us and rehumanize the lost generation of the past 20 years today the Alliance for Middle East peace has three flag ship efforts first advocate for the and make visible the efforts of the civil society and remove the barriers to the funding of our efforts to establish an International Fund for israeli-palestinian peace just remember that that will provide not only millions of dollars to expand and scale the people-to-people world but we create a formal structure for achieving peace on ground where politics has failed finally and the mission that is closest to my heart as the original director of the Alliance for Middle East peace is to support all of our members until we rise as the undeniable voice and collective civil society movement for peace as well as being the regional director of all may I stand here tonight as a proud liberated free Palestinian woman and it's not coming from vacuum I've seen the power of my father taking leaps of faith in humanity in a situation where his house was taken over by Israeli soldier engaging them in an attempt to create a human connection as an equal I heard for years a story of my grandfather taking a road trip with his Jewish Palestinian neighbor and his Christian Palestinian colleague to Haifa Beirut Damascus and a man then back to Hebron when I was not allowed to leave Hebron or Palestine freely I was raised by a socialist mom who refused to teach in Saudi Arabia and that's a big deal why women are not free I also was raised by two strong grandmothers who challenged political and social realities to secure quality education for their daughters firmly believing that this will contribute to the liberation of the people of Palestine thank you I read books in dark nights by candlelight I still do that to educate myself about a world that is truly free and supports justice for all I cried all night hugging for the first time the Palestinian flag that I was not allowed to embrace as part of my identity I watched a cousin with special needs leave his house to buy cigarettes ending up with 18 bullets in his body left bleeding for hours to his death in a town under 24-hour military curfew I heard my cousin's cry out when their father was arrested in the middle of the night I myself have escaped life-threatening situation time and time again while trying to get to my school or to take my mom to the hospital yes I found 28 reasons not to give up on peace my 28 nieces and nephews that I am blessed to have they are the reason why I get up every morning and find a reason to crash to cross the checkpoint to seek partners for peace on the other side of the Green Line I simply want to do my best [Music] I simply wanted to take responsibility and do my best so they don't have to go through what I have gone through to survive and maintain my humanity because that's what's a mistake though many can't see past of the media's perverted image of the humans the holy people who live in the holy land I see hope daily in the midst of darkness why I see thousands of Palestinians using self-restraint while crossing humilating and dehumanizing checkpoints to get to work in Israel each one of them has arisen to be angry and hateful yet do not give an end for those who seek again D in Palestine I see hope in Israelis who break the law to come and stand for justice in south hills of Hebron yes I see it in Palestinians and Israelis with whom I work who seek an honest open dialogue internally to sort out the emotional mental and political wounds that prevent them from reaching their utmost potential as free liberated human beings I see Palestinian and Israeli bereaved mothers who transcend over pain to build a stronger front against war hate and violence if Palestinians and Israelis who witness death and loss on a daily basis can melt down walls of oppressive systems and still manage to keep their human dignity then the world has to step up its game to left them rather than fail them once again yes we live in a leaderless world not just in her region by the way but across the world should we give give up on people should we of course not we the people find ways to liberate ourselves from fear hate and anger free people know how to create a reason to live and let others to live free people know how to reconcile and coexist how long must we wait for the right time to give the people of Palestine and Israel a chance to claim their liberty and humanity I think the time is now in in such in the darkest moments ever now is the time for feminist inclusive political activism championed by girls of creativity for peace and women of women which peace now the time is to tap into the human potential that lies within the graduates of dozens of peace building programs left alone creep creating a critical mass that live and act in support of freedom dignity justice and peace now is the time to scale our efforts to move beyond the belief that our work just is just a nice afterthought it's not we're nice bye though we were very nice but we are in the business of creating resilience and that's not to be taken for granted come come we have to create communities in which our heroes are not will not have medals of death but champions of life I am here I am here to tell you to hold on to our hope on to hold on to your hope in us please do because we don't have the luxury of losing hope that's not something that we can afford in a conflict zone our path may be just a narrow bridge but we shall not fear we shall not fear our deep commitment to him humanity and justice is confirmed daily by women and men who refused to be victims and refused to be enemies we're not each other's victims were not each other's enemies I invite you and implore you to join the children of Jerusalem who stayed loudly and clearly clearly and proudly that peace begins with me as a child born in Jerusalem raised up our community our voices our stories and become part of will love us and be partners to us and finally to the Jewish American community it's time for you to follow the steps of Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel and March for justice and peace with today Martin Luther King's thank you and Salaam [Applause] [Music] ladies and gentlemen please welcome Ohio hollow and Sally's Ahmed from our generation speaks I'm pleased to be here today with you to address J Street an organization that has accomplished much in support of Israel and the Jewish people and I don't care what I say you can be pro-israel and pro Palestine at the same time I know it because I am I addressed you today as the founder and CEO of our generation speaks a program which began in 2015 and is dedicated to the proposition that Israelis and Palestinians can work together to create a more peaceful and prosperous future how did this happen my military service introduced me firsthand to the complexities of a region when I started my studies at Brandeis in 2013 when I started my studies at Brandeis in 2013 you have to cheer again I personally witnessed the incredible dedication of much of the American Jewish community to a safe peaceful and democratic Israel I couldn't stand moved I realized that I had very little knowledge of Palestinians and new opportunities to interact with them unless in uniform I knew that nothing would change unless we created an infrastructure of Hope and infrastructure of understanding on both sides only then could we build trust and finally cooperation I resolved to do something about it with the support of Brandeis and former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick we created a program that brings Israel in Palestine entrepreneurs to Boston for three months each summer they live together and they learn about each other's lives and narratives the study entrepreneurship the four teams and they create businesses since its inception we have launched seven ventures and graduated 46 alumni all dedicated to working together to change the dynamic in a region one venture provides highly trained Palestinian software engineers to Israeli high tech companies scrambling for such help another startup does genetic education and testing of Israeli Bedouins to reduce the incidence of genetic diseases a third venture brings solar technology to areas in a region that have limited electric power including Gaza today our companies have raised more than 1 million dollars and we've made preparations to launch 9 new companies this year [Applause] now beyond financial success our generation speaks demonstrates that when people have common goals when they rely upon each other to feed their families when their actual partners when they work together every single day they can't help but know each other and when you truly know another person hope can replace hate as the saying goes the best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago the second best time is today much has changed in a region in the past 20 years yet too much remains the same Israel has the same government in power still lacking a vision a vision for a short future Palestinians still don't have an airport a passport or estate and the Middle East remains the playground of self-interested sub superpowers we now have greater concerns I look around me and I can't see many trees grounded in hope and Trust planted by past generations what have they been doing it's time for young Israelis and young Palestinians to take matters into their own hands [Applause] ladies and gentlemen we will plant these trees we are planting these trees and now just a few we need to grow forests young people and the Vietnam War young people will end the gun laws insanity in this country and as we like to say in our region inshallah young people will put an end to the israeli-palestinian conflict as well to solve the conflict between us calls for honesty and it calls for our engagements it calls for a realization that the situation is not working for either side yet this conflict is more burdensome on the daily lives of Palestinians at the same time it is more dangerous in the long term for Israel's future as a democratic state with a Jewish majority [Applause] if we want to think about solving this conflict we need to remember new old thinking and values Abrahamic values of compassion and empathy in the last 60 years older generations have failed us Israelis and Palestinians alike now is the time for our generation to step forward and to speak up I've seen the determination of my generation to turn our dreadful situation around it's a long road the road for sure trust but we are not afraid of long roads and we know we can count on your support let us be sick [Applause] let us be successful where others have failed our future demands it thank you all so very much [Applause] [Music] we're living in bubbles and in our generalization stereotypes and labels we place people in buckets bucket after bucket so we stop seeing people as people and we start seeing them as groups we do it ourselves we do it to our enemies and we do it to people who we perceive as our enemies but no two people are the same as human beings we have a common experience in the world in terms of being human of being conscious but we have very particular experiences that give each of us annonced perspective on the world and it's on us it's on our generation to diagnose what experiences make a certain person's life choices more convenient and help them see themselves out of it see the best way to learn isn't by reading books or sitting in lectures the most important knowledge I believe is gained through human interactions through real experiences this is why I co-founded yellow talk with an Israeli at OTS to bridge the gap between or even beyond Palestine in Israel the language barrier that prevents us from understanding the other our on-demand user-friendly mobile application keeps you connected with native speakers across the world in just one click through interactive and personalized conversations you don't just learn few words here and there instead you grasp the origin of the phrase you're able to understand culture other people's point of views the way they think their habits of norms phonology tone syntax you name it all through our human interactive experience it isn't a simple task to build bridges it takes effort time and most importantly hope hope in each other you see young Palestinians hold the majority within the Palestinian people and their narrative is overwhelmed with frustration and absent of hope implications from decades of military occupation has imposed Geographic restrictions social fragmentation and an overall marginalization that has effectively extinguished the prospect of a life that is deemed normal UNICEF reports that adolescent are becoming more prone to aggression rebellion risk-taking behavior frustration hopelessness and withdrawal hopelessness they are or more like we are overwhelmingly dissatisfied with our life and our future is dependent on a positive mentality a positive outlook is what is missing hope is what is missing and I'm sure everyone here has lost hope at some point I know I have I lost hope that one day I can fly out from Tel Aviv Airport or one day I can walk the streets or drive my car through cities without having to carry a permit but most importantly I lost hope in the system but the real question here is when everybody lets you down will you still make the decision to lift someone else up my message here today is be Ariella talk beta tester start learning Arabic of course and give us your feedback but more generally my message here today is not to ostracize the other but rather emphasize empathize realizing that empathy isn't about putting on someone else's shoe instead putting on someone else's wet socks and taking a really long walk this kind of empathy allows us to maintain our dignity even when the belligerent berate us this kind of empathy breeds hope enemies hell-bent on our severe UNS will become one of our bestest of friends because their animus will only make us more compassionate what empathy really does is allow us to see each other as human before we are terrorists or freedom fighters were humans before will celtics or wizards before we're moderate liberal or conservative and it's that humanism that enables us to excavate what's left of hate and in the eliminate its excessive waste it's that humanism that Edward cites so eloquently put as the only or final resistance against the inhuman practices and end justices that disfigure humans history so let's make this practical with three simple items because people tend to think in threes the three pyramids the three musketeers past present future Father Son and Holy Spirit you name it so three action items and power ideas by raising awareness about the program be aureola talk beta tester and share your feedback visit the other side not once for tourism but twice for the experience don't just spend the day strolling down my streets and instead step so far out of your bubble or your comfort zone so that one day the world will look at you and me creating our own bubble and it doesn't matter what we call this bubble as long as we're in it together because we're human before we're Palestinians or Israelis because we're human before were Christians Muslims or Jews this will be our narrative this will be our solution to the palestinian-israeli conflict we're not here to restore faith in humanity we're here to restore humanity in faith thank you so much [Applause] [Music] ladies and gentlemen please welcome merits Party chairwoman tomorrow's Enberg hi everyone good evening nan Shalom being here tonight is a real honor Thank You Jeremy ben-ami president of J Street motel Kareem in the J Street Board J Street leadership and J Street you my friend yeah my friends being at the J Street National Conference feels like home and not just because this is not my first time here it feels like home because the things that I care about and the people that I fight alongside weed are always present in this room I'm talking for example about the brave women of the world who are not just fighting for their rights but also teach Israelis like me about the many wonderful faces of Judaism the richness of which goes way beyond what our schoolbooks and religious parties ever presented I'm talking about the inspiring students of J Street Q let's hear you again you guys promote accountability and transparency in your own communities so the Jewish donors from Cincinnati or Boston can now tell whether the money is used for settlement activities I'm talking about the many friends from the new Israel fund yeah who stand these very days against the most ridiculous nevertheless dangerous incitement from no other but the Prime Minister of Israel just because they support those in the front line of the battle against the deportation of thousands of people seeking asylum from Sudan and Eritrea friends in the NIF you are truly the guardians of Israeli democracy social justice equality and human rights I see here also veterans from the peace movement and young anti-occupation activists I see civil rights professionals Jewish feminists I see Jewish LGBT activists I see my friends my people their friends coming to the US and especially to this conference at this time feels like home in another not so very pleasant way in both our countries we see these days the same contempt for civil rights xenophobia racism and chauvinism and politics of fear all starting at the highest level of government there is a clear alliance between the right-wing camps in Israel and in the u.s. they sponsor and legitimize each other both pardoning and even embracing American and European anti-semites and extreme right-wing populists s-- it's a lie it's an alliance that has had and continues to have ever more dangerous consequences for both our countries these days it seemed Israeli Prime Minister and the American administration are joining forces in trying to destroy the Iran deal against the repeated warnings of many among both the American and Israeli military leadership 15 years ago it was the den merit leader your sister Reid who stood alone in saying that the war in Iraq will be bad for Israel today as the new leader of merits I come here with a clear message abandoning the Iran deal would move us closer to a nuclear Iran instead of further away which would pose a grave danger to the State of Israel the region and the world [Applause] in the same time we cannot accept military presence of Iran the only country in the world the threatens to destroy Israel on our northern border every Israeli like any man and woman around the world is horrified that the Assad regime uses chemical weapons against its own civilians just short hundred kilometers north of Kiryat Shmona last night we saw a clear message that the United States the United Kingdom and France cannot accept that either dear friends I grew up with a feeling that peace is just around the corner it was in the 90s only to find out that now it feels further away than ever I grew up thinking that the struggle for civil rights belongs to the past only to find out that the notion that all men and women are created equal is just the first step in the journey to equality I grew up as a young girl knowing that when I grow up I could be and do whatever I choose only to find out that some people be the rabbi's or politicians still think they can decide for me I thought about that yesterday as I was walking down the halls of the wonderful National Museum of african-american history and culture after slavery Liberty was not fully achieved the brave when men and women fighting for their rights tackled segregation then came the civil rights movement and then black lives matter in short in short we find out that history isn't always a straight line sometimes it has curves sometimes even u-turns the arc of a moral universe is long taught us Martin Luther King murdered 50 years ago this month but it bends towards justice dear friends there is a battle between the ideas of democracy civil rights and liberalism versus a new form of authoritarian thinking fueled by populist anger all over the world the idea of liberal democracy is under challenge sometimes under attack it's a struggle that takes place in Tel Aviv and in Charlottesville in Washington DC and in the West Bank and none of us can win it on our own every year we meet weather here at the Jays with the J Street Conference or in Israel in one of the J Street missions and we talk about our mutual support and help for one another today we are not just supporting each other today we are standing together today we are in an unprecedented political moment when the very things we need to change about Israel have become the same ones you resist and fight for here in the u.s. today it's clear that the battle against occupation and the battle for racial equality are the same fights today it's clear that the fight against forced deportation in the US and in tel-aviv is the same fight [Applause] today it's clear that the quality for people of color in America and for Palestinian citizens and Mizrahi Jews in Israel derives from the same principles [Music] today it's clear that we have a shared interest in a healthy sustainable environment and natural resources and also in maintaining our social media Democratic and our privacy protected the fight for democracy in Washington and in Jerusalem is the same fight Netanyahu and Trump they both try to call us and patriotic here is what they are missing true patriotism is not in their hands but true patriotism is here in this room tonight when the alt-right embraces Israel that is not about that is a badge of shame not a badge of honor dear friends the fight for peace and against occupation is true patriotism feminism is the true love of Israel this is the true love at Israel civil rights is the true love of people is the true but a damn like we say in Hebrew friends in the past 15 years Israeli progressives were told and again and again that if we want if we just move a little bit to the right we can return to power and when that didn't work perhaps a little bit more I know this is the same the same case with progressive politics here as well and I Dow we suffer defeat after defeat some of our friends in the opposition still think this is the right way even today they think that the voters moved to the right and if we want to win them we have to go right after them here is what they are missing they did not move to the right they are waiting for our alternative they are waiting for our leadership with a clear loud crowd truth not a pale imitation we represent not a small and weak minority we represent a vast majority both in Israel and in the US friends most Israelis support the two-state solution most Israelis support civil marriage and LGBT adoption rights most Israelis would like to see just allocation of resources in a strong and effective health education and welfare systems most Israelis oppose the asylum seekers deportation and stood together against it only last week following the attack against the new Israel fund Israelis donated a million shekels to show their support this is an historic change there is nothing more patriotic than a joint struggle for our democracies and this is what we are doing here tonight together in the last three Friday's Israelis have followed the events around the border with the Gaza Strip worried that it might deteriorate to another round of violence like we experienced five times in the last decade I visited that thousand part of Israel twice in these three weeks our message is not only to act with restraint and according to the law during the events but also that it is both our interest in our moral duty to lift the siege over Gaza and to end the occupation on Palestinian people [Applause] this is not just a security or a demographic issue it's a moral affront to everything we should stand for it corrupts our institutions and makes our public discourse cynical violent and dehumanizing dear friends I stand here tonight representing a broad political camp in Israel I have no fear only hope we are going to clean we are going to be clear on our principles and influential on our politics we will fight for a center-left coalition that will replace Netanyahu and his extreme government [Applause] if if labor oriented leaders have a chance to form a decent government we will support them moreover we would lead the progressive camp in Israel so it will be it will be possible for them to form such a government this is a moment in history when we march from the protests in the streets into the halls of power and make our vision into a new reality I was elected to be the chair of merits to do just that we will be the pillar at the front of the camp we will pioneer our way from political marginalization to influence and innovation we will move back to the heart of Israeli politics because saying the right things isn't enough we will transform massive support for our values into a mass movement to the polls on Election Day this is our job we deserve friends we deserve a government that we can be proud of we deserve a government that will represent our values we deserve a government that will end the occupation and promote peace we deserve a government that will make Israel a true home for every Jew around the world and a true home for every Palestinian citizen we deserve a government that we can be proud of and we are the ones that are going to make it happen thank you and have a very successful [Music] ladies and gentlemen please welcome the J

our voices to tell our communities and our elected officials that young pro-israel pro-palestinian pro-peace Americans demand bold leadership and bold action to build a better future for Israelis and Palestinians and to end the occupation [Applause] as the future leaders of our community and of our country were making clear that we refuse to accept bigotry and hate or to stay silent in the face of attacks on democracy were making clear that we refuse to accept American leadership that abandons the two-state solution empowers the extreme right and promotes conflicts over diplomacy we're building a powerful network that is ready to stand with leaders who fight for our values and ready to make sure that the American Jewish and pro-israel communities stand on the right side of history we're so

[Applause] ladies and gentlemen please welcome the president of the American Federation of Teachers Randi Weingarten so the good news is there's not a million speakers after me so you're wondering why I'm here tonight for me it's an honor to be here I've been here all night the speakers have been awesome the activists who represent a new generation who are not afraid to pursue justice and peace and speaking of justice the 2018 elections have taken on an urgency I have never experienced in my lifetime is that simply a fight for fairness or justice or the policies we champion for working folks and their families we must be a check and balance for our democracy and for a society that is safe welcoming and sane we must fight the anti-democratic native istic racist incompetent oligarchical authoritarianism and cruel instincts and actions of a president and his cronies and associates who simply want an intolerant divisive society it returns to the Gilded Age this is whether you are in J Street or the FT Oh which side are you on moment now that statement which I happen to write on Martin Luther King's birthday weekend it's plastered to the door in my office and it's a sentiment that guides my head and my heart and Friends I suspect from the reaction I just got is now you know why this American labor leader is on the J Street stage tonight because in large part the fight in America is the fight in Israel and while the words I just said may be different the sentiment is similar to everyone who is engaged in J Street we believe in America and we believe in Israel but democratic norms and institutions are under fierce attack in both countries we love and one of the struggles that binds us a struggle that gets more difficult by the day is how to maintain the idea the dream of peace and justice for Israelis and Palestinians for an Israel and a Palestine that exist side-by-side two states for two people let me talk to the Israelis in the moon for a moment because you are the activists and the voices for justice and peace for economic justice for racial justice and we I am in awe of your energy and for all of these years for not completely giving in to despair for maintaining a sense of humor and patience for doing the work you do every day to make things better even while the rest of the world ignores you sometimes our progressive allies condemn you I was so pleased to hear the new leader of merits member of Knesset to Mars and oak and I promise you we didn't compare speeches may your social justice lens guide you through your years of activism and then there were the grassroots activist yeah we can clap for her and then there were the glass grassroots activists in the previous panels who work tirelessly against tremendous odds to create a nation in a place in the world where we see our values reflected in a reality from the Israeli Jews in the Palestinian women from women wage peace to the activists trying to stop Israelis to stop Israel from destroying Palestinian vision Palestinian villages - frankly those awesome students who we just saw I try never never never to miss a J Street conference but it is the activists that we saw on this stage tonight they are the frontline and we owe them a debt of gratitude and speaking of someone else we owe a debt of gratitude - that is Jeremy ben-ami and Jeremy he will hate that I said this about him he leads us in righteous battle always finding the path and I who have had to be in many battles I take great comfort to work side-by-side with him in these tumultuous times because make no mistake my friends we are in a global battle for justice for the values we believe in we are here to call out and to change a right-wing populist government with a leader who thrives on hatred and division who mocks and attacks the press who sees the strangers among us as a danger to be feared and mistreated not as fellow humans hmm which country am i speaking about the truth is Israel beat us to it with a right-wing leadership years before we had done a trump before right-wing populist captured leadership in Europe but here we are and the similarities are abundant and frankly I'm not sure when it comes to Bibi Netanyahu and Donald Trump I don't know who's imitating who we all know Trump's Twitter habits but what about Bibi using social media to tap to attack organizations like the new Israel fund or to promote the same xenophobic anti-immigrant attacks we see Trump launched to keep his face happy and I don't know about you but after Netanyahu's many attacks on the new Israel fund my partner now wife Sharon Klein bomb we decided to double down on our support for NIF and frankly we designated them as one of the organizations we asked our friends and families to support on the occasion of our marriage yes the labour met leader did marry the rabbi but the ways American Jews can support progressive values in Israel is to support the groups that support these values the group's you saw on this stage tonight Plus but sillim breaking silence a creek J Street that is what we can do and just think about this how is it that Israel is carrying out the same anti-immigrant policies attacking asylum seekers with venom that we see now in Hungary and Poland Israel the state that was born out of the Holocaust the state that next week will celebrate its 70th anniversary anniversary yes Israel is a young state it's a state with growing pains but that is what we need to do to provide the accountability that means never again means never again for all of us and now as we meet the tensions between Israel and Gaza have entered their third week and let me be clear while Israel has a right to defend itself on its southern border it must do everything in its power to ensure that unarmed peaceful protesters be they Israelis or Palestinians are not harmed the people of Gaza need a just solution the status quo can't continue there must be returned to a serious two-state negotiation something that may seem out of reach at this moment but we must never stop reaching so how my friends does that happen yes we can pray we can advocate but clearly there's no magic wand what we can do what is crucial is to strengthen our cross continental and cross generational coalition that promotes social justice across the US and Israel and that is what the AFT has tried to do to strengthen the ties between my Union and social justice activists and workers in Israel our strategy I know this may surprise you has been to support progressives in their work in Israel just like we do in the United States to strengthen our bonds with our broader communities to enlarge the tent as I say I said so we fight against polarization and hate at the same time we build relationships and community that is why we fell in love with a hand-in-hand schools in Israel hand and hands mission is to create an inclusive Israel through a network of integrated bilingual schools with Jewish and Arab students and staff throughout six schools in the country we partner on teacher training and support we focus under respect we strive for us teach children parents and teachers whether they be in Puerto Rico San Antonio in New York City the same respect that every school child must have respect for culture for identity for learning and think for one second right now just how much those teacher walkouts have shown that public support for public education in the United States is alive and well and in Israel as well as the United States all children whether Jewish Arab black white native Hispanic desert classrooms with all the opportunities afforded by public education without prejudice or preference teacher to teach your child to child aft keeps working with the hand-in-hand schools so that they can help make Israel more equal just society and that's not our only connection we've also developed cross union trainings with the activists at the social economic academy and i want to give a shout out to omar sector who is here who is an organizer for the israeli medical residents union Omar where are you I know you're here somewhere the Israel medical residents union was part of a delegation last year where the AFT esier and community organizers shared strategies together learning together how to promote economic justice because Israel and America happen to share another distinction the Bleak distinction of being two of the most unequal societies in the world the u.s. is number three amongst osed countries Israel is number five efforts to erode Israel's once-proud social democratic economy have resulted in a society of the very rich and those who struggle to get by and this severe gap in income in Israel is one of the reasons why politicians like Bibi Netanyahu helped by his pal Sheldon Adelson uses polarization and fear to try to further divide working families turning Israel into a tribal nation secular Jews against the radom Mizrahi against Ashkenazi Tel Aviv against the periphery and Bibi thinks it's just fine to educate against Arab citizen who comprised 21% of the nation these fierce divides are hard to bridge but we must we must look for those bridges we must look for those openings we must reach out and frankly it ain't so different I know my English teachers would have hated I said that from what the Koch brothers the DeVos family and what Shelly Adelson does in the United States pitting red states against blue states new workers against seniors new immigrants against not so new immigrants gay versus straight anti-muslim fear-mongering the fear of the other to attack voting rights public education labor rights to try to eviscerate the movements that create a better life and why are we in the United States have a lot to learn from our Israeli colleagues something is changing in this country we have become a rallying nation and I am hopeful that the age of passive resignation is over despair is not a strategy as Ruth Messinger often teaches us from the streets to the schools to the ballot box Americans are joining together in the largest surge of collective courage idle ism and condemned condemnation of injustice in my lifetime in recent weeks hundreds of thousands of students around the country have protested gun violence dreamers in Texas and Washington DC have stood against deportation from the only country they know school employees in West Virginia and Oklahoma and graduate workers in Illinois have weighed successful work out walkouts force resources and for pay civil rights activists went back to Memphis after ordering or for the 50th anniversary of the assassination of MLK to once again say we need to fight for justice and we need to fight for voting I can go on and on and on Democrat Connor lamb want to see in a long time ruby-red Republican congressional district in western Pennsylvania proudly crediting his support from unions as he said that is the fight for basic dignity and social justice this my friends is what democracy looks like when our president and our Congress failed to make our schools or communities safer when they govern for the wealthy when they govern for the few it is we the people particularly young people who are getting up and stepping out and that is what we need to do this November [Applause] I love it like the union movement never again 55 strong black lives matter United We Dream and times up they are bringing people together to do what we can't achieve alone they're confronting formidable adversaries groups like the National Rifle Association which attacks which attacks any and all common-sense gun safety measures and frankly which is now going after the AFT and me personally and I wear it as a badge of honor oops funded by the Pokes the divorces and other right-wing billionaires who want to gut public education public services and the labor movement it's no exaggeration to say that we are fighting for the souls of two nations Israel and the United States we are fighting to defend democracy against tyrants who though elected in a democratic process have little regard for democracy and who aim to solidify their personal gain at the expense at the expense of public welfare in the last decades we have seen a change in how authoritarian regimes typically replace Democratic ones not by military coup but rather through a democratic process so my friends whether our democracy survive here and in Israel whether our fundamental values of pluralism and tolerance and the rule of law survive it depends on us so I leave you with this we must repair our democracies we must engage in elections we must fight for a better world we must promote diversity and tolerance no one no one can sit on the sidelines we cannot shrink from this critical moment these November 2018 elections are the most important in our lifetimes they will impact democracy at home and abroad they will influence US domestic and international priorities and if you care about Israel orient care about anything in the u.s. you must vote and make your voices heard as Martin Luther King said he preached our weapon is our vote so whether you believe in Israel whether you believe in the United States whether you believe in justice in peace in a future we need to be there voting in November we must not give up hope justice is at our side go from a rallying nation to a voting nation and we will turn this around are you ready James straight are you ready J straight are you ready [Applause] [Music] under the powerful influence of the settlement movement the Israeli government has stepped up a process of creeping annexation in the West Bank this process is entrenching occupation by expanding settlements and demolishing Palestinian communities that stand in their way these demolitions severely undermined the two-state solution Prime Minister Netanyahu fully supports this policy and the Trump administration has condoned it by looking the other way in the face of this crisis the student leaders of J Street you refused to stay silent to stand up for our values and a better future we launched a major campaign stop demolitions build peace across the country J Street youth students are raising awareness about the devastating human and political costs of demolitions each of J Street used six regions has partnered directly with a different Palestinian community under the threat of demolition striving to raise awareness of the challenges faced by the residents of places like sucia O'Connell Omar and amel care as they fear the destruction of their homes schools and clinics by holding educational events hosting Palestinian activists raising funds for local projects and calling on members of Congress to take action we've begun to mobilize an exciting new movement advocating for a two-state solution and against occupation the campaign is already making waves on a growing number of campuses College Democrat chapters and a diverse coalition of progressive groups have formed exciting new coalition's with J Street you to oppose demolitions and champion peace the Stop demolitions build peace campaign has helped the pro-israel pro-peace movement put the issue of demolitions on the map for elected officials and Jewish communal leaders our leaders are listening prominent members of Congress have echoed our call on the Israeli government to bring an end to creeping annexation and stop undermining the two-state solution just left sucia and I have to tell you that before that trip I never even used the word occupation it really sunk in when I saw on the ground what it means and I am so grateful to all of the students that are trying to bring to the attention of Americans of the world how unfair this is how unjust how inhuman it is communities are in danger and Israel's Jewish and democratic future is at stake we're stepping up our work and we need your help join us today in our fight to stand up to the settlement movement stop demolitions and help build a peaceful future for Israelis and Palestinians [Music] ladies and gentlemen please welcome J Street you

demolitions build peace campaign a new campaign to defend a two-state solution oppose creeping annexation by the Israeli settlement movement and stand with vulnerable Palestinian communities in the West Bank the Israeli government's ongoing demolition and eviction of Palestinian towns in the West Bank destroys communities and in dangers israel's democratic and Jewish future led by G Street u this initiative is rallying the American Jewish community and our elected leaders to push back against the demolitions in order to grow our campaign we have built partnerships between J Street u regions and West baked communities that are under threat of demolition my region the southwest has partnered the Palestinian Bedouins community of umma fair residents there have communicated to us that they need increased international awareness and attention and so and so the village often has international organizations that stay overnight to protect it which has helped it remain standing in an effort to bring attention to their situation my chapter J Street u Chapman organized series of sleep ins and our ecology colleges humanities Hall during the sleep ends we taught student and faculty attendees about our campaign and about the situation in uma fair we also invited a lead activists and artists from the village Edith lien to participate in a speaking tour throughout the southwestt IDI who's actually joining us this weekend in DC visited our schools to share his experiences with us this past week being able to hear from him firsthand deeply moved students and faculty and has encouraged them to continue supporting our effort we are grateful to partner with these communities in order to support their right to remain in their homes and to raise awareness about how demolitions and creeping annexation are undermining the prospects for peace [Applause] my name is Matt Anuradha Neiman and I am a mid-atlantic regional co-chair for J Street u when I arrived on campus this fall to start my first year at Haverford I was distraught with Trump in the White House and a peaceful resolution to the israeli-palestinian conflict seemingly very far out of reach I was both helpless and hopeless but thanks to the stop demolitions build peace campaign I can see a clear role for myself and other students like me to oppose the dangerous politics of demolitions and creeping annexation and preserve the future of a two-state solution in the first year in the first year of our chapters existence we've created meaningful change on Haverford's campus including by building a coalition with the Haverford College Democrats over the past few months Jayce Ryu chapters across the country have created these types of partnerships with other progressive organizations on an even larger scale to statewide college Democrats of California Illinois and Washington state my home state have endorsed and partnered with our campaign these endorse these endorsements have made clear to our members of Congress and our community leaders that we want them to act in defense of vulnerable communities facing demolition and we have seen some important action in November 10 US senators led by Dianne Feinstein and Bernie Sanders sent a groundbreaking letter to Prime Minister Netanyahu which J Street and j3u proudly advocated for stating their opposition to demolition and creeping annexation this week a similar letter to the Prime Minister was circulated in the United States House of Representatives by congresswoman jan Schakowsky and Congressman John Yarmuth on Tuesday at our national advocacy day our movement will be on Capitol Hill urging our members of Congress to add their names to the letter one of the communities mentioned in these congressional letters is sucia

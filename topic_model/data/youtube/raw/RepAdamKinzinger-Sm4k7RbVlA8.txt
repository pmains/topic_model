we go now to illinois republican congressman adam kinzinger he's a member of the panel investigating the january 6th attack on the capitol and he's in houston this morning congressman welcome thank you good to be with you let's start before we go to the january 6 committee let's start with ukraine president zielinski called for more planes and tanks from nato as you heard us just discussed he said i've talked to the defenders of maripo today if only those who have been thinking for 31 days on how to handle hand over dozens of jets and tanks had one percent of their courage you have advocated for a no-fly zone what's your feeling about giving planes and tanks to the ukrainians look i mean i've talked to uh ukrainian members of parliament those out you know advocating for what's needed on the ground as well and they say they need these i mean we can have the pentagon all they want say well we don't think they have the pilots for the migs they do they have pilots trained and waiting we can have the pentagon say well we think this is escalatory well if you don't think you know javelins that are killing thousands of russian soldiers are escalatory but then sending an airplane you know when frankly ukraine has already flown some airplanes is the like escalatory thing that's just wrong and i think it's sending the wrong message we have to give them everything they need to win this war because we've made it clear we're not going to intervene directly and i don't think we should at this point all right we're going to move on congressman to the january 6 committee uh bob costa and bob woodward who are both on with me a little bit later reported on text to the committee this uh that the committee has from the wife of clarence thomas and i just want to read a little excerpts of them they are to the white house chief of staff mark meadows urging efforts to overthrow the election mr thomas wrote do not concede and then in another she wrote the majority knows biden on the left is attempting the greatest heist of our history why are these significant well look i can't as a member of the committee confirm deny the existence of those i'll tell you that we have thousands of text messages from lots of people we have a lot of documents and we are going to in a methodical fact-driven way get to the answers here we'll we'll call in whoever we need to call in i think the bottom line for the committee is this was there an effort to overturn the legitimate election of the united states what was january 6 in relation to that and what is the rot in our system that led to that and does it still exist today um you know with conspiracy theories as we've seen you know reported this idea of releasing the kraken or that the cia would attack the dod or was attacked by the dod in germany john like half of the country at one point believed some of that stuff and this is a road map for how to overturn a legitimately elected government so this is important we're going to get to the bottom of this and as we're seeing in ukraine people are willing to die for democracy we at least have to be willing to put careers on the line for the same cause so no one's disputing the authenticity of these texts which leads the question will the committee subpoena mrs thomas and uh questioner look i think again we want to make sure that this isn't driven even though it's in the political realm it's not driven by a political motivation it's driven by facts so when it comes to any potential future calling in of miss thomas we'll we'll take a look at at what the evidence is we'll make a decision you all will know as soon as we do what i don't want to do is get into speculating too much because i think it is important that we have answers to the american people in a factual way here you talked about rot in the system does the rot reach the supreme court uh look again i'm not going to say that i'm not going to say that it does or doesn't we're just going to present the american people what the answer is and the supreme court handles their own ethics they handle their own internal stuff but what we need to do is present to the american people where they've been lied to where they've believed lies where there are bad actors out there for instance that are sympathetic to vladimir putin that kind of stuff is very important so that in five or ten years when kids are reading in the history books about january 6 they're not buying into any of these conspiracies they're getting the truth what is wrong with uh you said the supreme court has its own ethics so we'll let them handle that why can't a private citizen send texts as zany as they may be to the white house chief of staff what's what's wrong with that well again uh we're in a position where we're not confirming or denying you know what's been reported uh by costa and woodward uh but if they're you know look in any case if a private citizen has a conversation of course we have a freedom of speech speech in this country the question what that for the committee is this or any exchange was there a conspiracy or an attempt to come up with a reason or how close did we get to overturn an election look we are not as the committee out to uh you know to throw people in jail we can have criminal referrals like we do against mark meadows because he has denied legitimate requests from congress to come in repeatedly so that's in doj our job is just to get answers to the american people and then they can decide before uh these texts drop off they go away in december and january given the passion with which mrs thomas was texting do you are you confident that meadows has handed over all of his texts i'm not confident that meadows has handed over everything at all i mean he was cooperating with us for a little bit and then in an attempt to make donald trump happy he stopped cooperating we gave him plenty of space to come back to resume that he has not and in fact he's waived executive privilege you know a thousand times by by presenting us what he already has so no i'm not convinced he's handed over everything to us and that's why it's in the doj's hands now uh whether to prosecute him for contempt he has contempt not just for congress for his old institution of congress and thereby for the american people i hope doj does the right thing and i hope we get all the information that not it's not congress that the american people deserve john the american people deserve these answers all right congressman kenzinger thank you so much for being with us we'll see you again

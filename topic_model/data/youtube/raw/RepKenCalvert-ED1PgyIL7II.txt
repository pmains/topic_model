caliber Thank You mr. chairman getting back to the this issue that that I think it's important to address and I know mr. secretary this has been of interest of you and this is acquisition and it's a mess in the Department of Defense from A to Z I don't know where to start what it's on the major acquisition programs I remember general Casey sitting where you were at talking about a replacement vehicle for the Humvee that if we're optimistic it would take seven years before we can get a replacement vehicle coming across the assembly line we've had significant problems with the Joint Strike Fighter with a tanker replacement for the Air Force certainly the Navy's had its issues with just a number of programs we never seem to be able to estimate the cost of these programs accurately certainly not within the Department of Defense i know the Cape has been much more accurate in the past developing accurate cost estimates for these programs certainly the time and I can't imagine the cost billions and billions and billions of dollars have been wasted in the acquisition process for the United States Department of Defense over the last number of years and in this budget era that we're in the sequestration I can't tell you what is good I you know all of us didn't appreciate what we're having to go through but I can't tell you I don't think you know or anyone knows whether this is going to last for one year or ten years and so we're going to have to make some significant changes that issue 1 and 2 on civilian workforce issues within the Pentagon as I understand it is the forces are coming down both Army Navy Marine Corps the civilian workforce numbers are going down very little relative to that and and the reasons for that or numerous I understand that I understand you have a number of people I think up to 50,000 are eligible for retirement the Department of Defense and the retirement programs for early retirement are not modernized to help encourage people to retire and to come out with a more efficient civilian workforce bringing down those costs but in this environment we're going to have to start doing all that your former business guy i'm a former business guy there's ways that we can bring down some costs without I think impacting readiness and these are things that we need to seriously get involved in in the coming months if we're going to get a hold of this issue I appreciate your response mr. secretary congressman thank you i'll respond here very quickly to each of your points them and ask the comptroller to specifically address the civilian workforce issue because that workforce is is coming down the projections as well for reasons here that the comptroller will address but acquisitions the GAO recently released a report that was assessing our acquisition of programs and processes which is actually pretty favorable to the efforts and work that is being done and has been done we have a long way to go we recognize that for the reasons that you noted something at the current Deputy Secretary of Defense ash Carter started when he was the undersecretary for acquisitions bestbuy program he actually initiated a number of programs that the current undersecretary Frank Kendall is expanding on which have put us in a in a much stronger position for analysis and prioritization and the fact is as you know that the budgets are smaller the resources are fewer the uncertainty is hanging over us so we don't have a choice and that's a reality that we are dealing with that actually is not all bad either for so there's not a higher priority here than to get this right for the reasons you know I mean that's a third of our budget when you look at acquisitions procurement research testing development so on so I I think that we're on the right track you're a long way to go more more to do much more to do on the furlough issue first we've not made a final decision on this we let our people know which in the Congress no because by law we have to inform the Congress that we're considering any furloughs and we've done that we are we're having to we're going to do everything we could protect that that element of our budget but readiness is is our key responsibilities and and so everything has to revolve around that will probably be in a position in two or three weeks to have a better sense of what's going to happen or whether we're going to be required to the furlough or not but there's some good news there it's coming down what we originally thought might be the case 21 days now to 14 we'll see let me in the interest of time ask our Comptroller to address your specific point on civilian workforce we have worked hard to restructure our civilian workforce mr. Calvert and it will be coming down about five to six percent between fiscal 13 and physical 18 pretty much in proportion to the reductions are seeing on the military side i will say those reductions are contingent on being able to consolidate infrastructure and also to restructure our military treatment facilities so we will need background in order to achieve those cuts because that's where they work and if we're going to cut civilians without hurting readiness we need to do some efficiencies but we are on track to achieve a five to six percent cut in 13 2 718

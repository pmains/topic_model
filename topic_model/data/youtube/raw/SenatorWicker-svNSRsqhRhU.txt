now thank you very much uh John and um well said this is a a delegation that I think is well positioned to go back to Washington and actually help make some changes at the legislative level that can can be of uh of service I want to particularly uh single out my colleague John cornyn uh who's a great Senator the senior senator from Texas and has been a steady clear-eyed advocate for uh for sane uh sensible effective policies about the border and uh and I do appreciate the fact that he brings delegations down here is nothing like seeing it in person and really this should be a bipartisan issue uh and and I hope we'll see uh more than just the trickle of our Democratic colleagues coming down and seeing for themselves um we saw a lot um we were out last night I guess till uh um 12 30 or 1 uh seeing um would-be getaways captured and being apprehended right there at the wall we uh we talked to both state local and federal officials hearing from them what we need to do uh we went to a stash house today that had just been raided and and in fact uh it it turned out to be an effective raid and arrests were made and and uh so we were able to see these officials actually doing what they do best and what they want to do and what they want to do is be out here on the ground uh representing the American taxpayer and stopping uh illegal immigration rather than doing administrative work and desk work that they've been asked to do uh let me say this the statistics do not lie and we see what is happening this year 2023 and we see what happened during the year 2022 and there has to be a reason for the strong uptick the Biden Administration could not have created a more serious border crisis than we have if they had tried the signal was absolutely sent out to anyone who wanted to hear that people should come to the border and yes it's not only folks from from our neighboring Mexico um and uh in in Central and South America but from all over the world we saw a number of Asians today so if the worldwide signal has been heard and the world is responding because they're wanting to come here illegally they don't get across without help it's uh it's definitely a border that is policed on one side of the border and that's by the cartels everything from gun running to drugs to the most poisonous fatal drugs to human trafficking and prostitution it is a shame and a crisis in an avoidable um self-inflicted wound on this country so uh thank you all for being here we appreciate you giving us a chance to express our views to the public and and send information back home and once again John cornyn thank you very much for your really strong and effective leadership on this foreign

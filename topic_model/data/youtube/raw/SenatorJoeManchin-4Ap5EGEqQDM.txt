Start early. That's the biggest thing. So just be - it's a complicated process. So reach out to your blue
and gold officer. They're going to know exactly
what's going on. I would recommend taking your standardized
test scores very early. I took the ACT four times, and each time it went up,
which was super, super valuable. I know that those played a huge part in that. Just make sure that you have
tangible things that you can show on your application
that show that you're invested in that moral, mental
and physical mission. But yeah, working
ahead of the clock is is huge because that is a very long
and thorough application. More so than any other institution
that I really know of.

MR. SHERMAN: I THANK THE   GENTLEMAN FOR YIELDING.  THE LAST AMENDMENT DEALT WITH  THE ACTUAL SALE OF THE PLANES. THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL, THE   JCPOA, DOES PROVIDE THAT WE  SHOULD LICENSE THOSE PLANES IF   WE'RE SURE THEY'RE GOING TO BE   USED FOR CIVILIAN PURPOSES.  SO THERE'S AT LEAST SOME   ARGUMENT ABOUT WHAT IRAN IS  SUPPOSED TO GET UNDER THE  JCPOA. .  THIS DEALS WITH WHETHER WE   FINANCE AIRPLANES, WHAT WE'RE  GOING TO LET OUR BANKS FINANCE.  THIS AMENDMENT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE JCPOA THE IRAN NUCLEAR  DEAL.  NOTHING IN THAT AGREEMENT  PROMISES, HINTS, EVEN DISCUSSES  THE POSSIBILITY THAT WE WOULD GO SO FAR AS TO LEND MONEY TO ONE   OF THE STATE SPONSORS OF   TERRORISM. AND I KNOW THERE'S CONCERN, DO   WE WANT TO BOYCOTT EVERYBODY IN  THE WORLD? THERE ARE ONLY THREE COUNTRIES   THAT ARE STATE SPONSORS OF   TERRORISM, AND TWO OF THEM,  SYRIA AND SUDAN, NO BANK WOULD   LEND MONEY TO. SO THIS IS ONE COUNTRY THAT WE   HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT'S A STATE SPONSOR OF TERRORISM THAT MIGHT  BORROW MONEY.  WHY SHOULDN'T WE ALLOW IT? FIRST BECAUSE WE SHOULDN'T ALLOW OUR BANKS TO ENDANGER THEIR  DEPOSITORS' MONEY WITH LOANS TO  IRAN.  SECOND BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT   MAJOR BANKS LOBBYING THIS  CONGRESS AND SAYING OH, MY GOD,  YOU'VE GOT TO BE NICE TO THE   IRANIANS OR WE WON'T GET PAID  BACK AND THEN WE MIGHT FAIL AND  YOU'D HAVE TO BAIL US OUT. WE DON'T NEED WALL STREET TO   BECOME A LOBBYIST FOR IRAN.  FINALLY, BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES   TO FAIRNESS UNDER THE IRAN DEAL, SOME SAY THE IRANIANS HAVE   VIOLATED IT. SOME SAY THEY'RE BARELY  TECHNICALLY COMPLINING.  BUT EVERYONE AGREES THEY ARE NOT OVERPERFORMING.  THEY'RE NOT ERRING IN THE  DIRECTION OF BEING CONSISTENT  WITH THE OVERALL PURPOSES OF THE DEAL THERE IS NO REASON WE   SHOULD MASSIVELY OVERPERFORM AND PROVIDE FINANCING WE NEED EVEN   HINT WE MIGHT DO.  FINALLY, KEEP IN MIND WHAT WE  WOULD BE FINANCING IF WE   FINANCED THESE PLANES. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF SYRIANS HAVE BEEN KILLED.  MOST OF THE COUNTRY IS EITHER IN INTERNAL EXILE OR IS FLEEING THE COUNTRY. BODIES WASH UP ON THE BEACHES OF GREEK ISLANDS. FROM PEOPLE WHO RISK THEIR LIVES TO ESCAPE AN ASSAD REGIME THAT   IS KEPT IN POWER BY THE THUGS,   THE MONEY, AND THE WEAPONS   CARRIED TO DAMASCUS BY IRAN. SO WE DON'T HAVE TO FINANCE THIS TERRORISM, WE'RE NOT OBLIGATED   TO DO SO, EVEN IF WE'RE GOING TO BE IN THE STRICTEST COMPLIANCE   WITH THE JCPOA, WE SHOULDN'T   EXPOSE OUR BANKS TO THAT RISK,   AND I YIELD

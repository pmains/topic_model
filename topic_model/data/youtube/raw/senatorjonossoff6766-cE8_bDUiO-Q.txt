and i'd like to ask you a couple of questions regarding your responsibilities should you be confirmed to lead the civil rights division i don't believe that the state should be in the business of killing its own citizens that's why i am an opponent of the death penalty and when the killing of citizens is extra judicial in my view that is an egregious form of violence and an act of tyranny this week yet again the nation is grappling with the reality that in particular unarmed black men are subjected to violence at the hands of the state another young black man shot to death by a law enforcement officer how will you use the power of this office to end extrajudicial killings of american citizens by law enforcement thank you senator um the civil rights division has been empowered by congress to investigate unconstitutional conduct by law enforcement and we know that this is a real and ongoing challenge that we face the division has the ability to open pattern and practice investigations into police departments jails or other institutions that may be engaged in unconstitutional conduct there's 18 usc 242 which is one tool that can be used to promote accountability of law and fos law enforcement officers who use force without basis and in an unconstitutional way but attorney general garland has talked about the other tools in the division's arsenal and i agree that in addition we have to think about training and technical assistance and grant making as other tools to help promote improvements in this incredibly important area the

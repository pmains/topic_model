take a look at the economy right now businesses across the country are struggling to hire workers as they fight to stay open during the pandemic joining us now is someone who is pushing congress to get americans back to work at work not at home indiana congresswoman jackie walorski is here congresswoman good morning good morning rob it's great to see you yeah it's nice to see you as well over the past year millions have been unemployed because of the coronavirus but despite uh vice president kamala harris saying that she's confident the american jobs plan is going to create a lot of jobs for people that are home there's almost 10 million people that are still out of work take a listen to what she had to say yesterday as nearly 10 million americans remain unemployed more than 250 000 right here in north carolina the american jobs plan will create millions of jobs it will be the largest jobs investment our country has made since world war ii all right so congressman woman if you look at the the stock market right now or maybe even the unemployment rate which has been going down and down you might think that we're getting closer to what life was like before the pandemic but when it comes to the economy and people working that's just not the case is it you know rob it really isn't and you know i sit on the ways and means committee and i go back to my district every weekend in indiana and what i hear in indiana is totally different than what i hear out here in the beltway there is a great divide between what people are talking about out here and what's actually happening in the real world resonating with the people i represent which are double income households so you know one of the things that i hear every time i go back home is this unemployment issue i've got companies that have signs in every single window as you drive through the highways and the roads and streets in my district they can't hire they can't even get people to respond to an interview because in indiana with the unemployment rate at being 400 a week plus a supplemental unemployment and another 300 a week you know 700 per week 2800 a month they're not going to work our unemployment rate is below 4 and if there's anything to get people out of the house back to work that's the only thing that will spur this economy i don't even see where they're talking about additional jobs if they don't stop paying people to stay home nobody will be working and those supply chains that have been absolutely severed and paralyzed are not going to come back by next year because there's nobody to fill the jobs to fix the supply chain so we're headed for some pretty hard times based upon the spending of what the president and the vice president are doing yeah and that could the economy what you just said you know maybe a year down the road or beyond that but it's interesting i think when the pandemic first hit us uh 13 months ago everybody knew somebody i knew somebody that was making more money not working than they were when they were working and that became commonplace in many respects there are still 10 million americans that we know about by the way that are unemployed right now uh and these are not just restaurant workers and people that work in the tourism industry is there a labor shortage crisis right now in america well there is and i can tell you there's a labor shortage in the indiana second district in the south bend area in northern indiana you know we produce the majority of the rvs boats trailers huge huge production manufacturing in our district and you know they're looking at literally not being able to have anybody else come in the door there is nobody left and so if we don't stop what we're doing and just just allow america to come back open our states up you know get coronavirus in the back near here so that we can move forward in our country bring our economy back and then for those that are pursuing their share of the american dream it's there and they can do that they can't do this with the president vice president and these liberal-left policies on their back it can't recover with them they have to change their policies you know one of the things that i proposed on the ways and means committee was pay people to go back to work instead of paying them to stay home give them a back to work bonus so they could actually take that money infuse it in their family and go back to a productive job and get back on their feet so that we can all recover and move forward congresswoman just about 30 seconds left but the report that you're citing here so it says that restaurants hotels travel those industries can't find people to fill the jobs is it strictly because they're making more money sitting on the couch at home 99 of the reason is because people will just tell you if i can stay home and make that much money why in the world would i go to work and i can tell you rob the other thing that's coming around the corner really really quickly is all prices are going up around the country gas ground beef eggs milk that will hit my district in their left pocket and their right pocket and at the end of the day they might be talking about you know total recovery out here but in the real place where we all live they're going to be taxed out of every pocket they have if these guys continue to pour on the spending congresswoman thank you so much for coming on with us uh thanks rob really enjoyed the conversation yeah thank you we've got

you know i actually took the train down today from um new york city i was in manhattan in lower manhattan at the uh where the world trade center is with uh some firefighters who were there that day we'd been planning this for a long time uh in preparation for the 20th anniversary and it's important that people understand what guys like him what gold star families what veterans feel from all this there's no elation that the quote-unquote war has ended the war has not ended they know especially gold star families had a i had a meeting with a bunch of gold star families from the seal teams uh last week and the goal of that meeting was to kind of see where everybody's at how are you guys feeling and uh it turned out there was no existential questions about whether their son or their husband had died in vain that was the worry that people feel like our sacrifices were made in vain but nobody actually had that opinion everybody knew no what did we get for 20 years well we got no more 911s we got no attacks on the homeland from this threat that caused 911 in 2001. and it's worth noting we were not at war on september 10th 2001. we weren't at war when the uss cole was bombed in 2000 we were in a war in 1998 when our embassies were bombed born at war in 1993 when the world trade center was bombed but somebody was at war with us we were just pretending like they weren't and after september 11th we stopped pretending and unfortunately today we began pretending again we began pretending like we ended a war and i hope nobody's writing a headline that says we ended america's longest war we ended no wars we didn't lose a war we didn't end a war but we did give up a strategic position in that war in that fight it will now be extremely difficult to deter or deny terrorist safe havens we just can't do it we don't have airfields nearby we don't have the resources taliban will most likely close off cellular cellular networks and internet making it impossible to target we don't have eyes and ears on the ground anymore and the homeland is now at more risk than it has been in 20 years and don't take my word for it you can take the intel community's word for it and i think what's more frustrating even is what jim had alluded to the intel community told this administration this would happen whether it was two days or two months or six months they said it will fall to the taliban so knowing this why keep going with a terrible plan why keep going with a plan that has no no evacuation plan no plan for the equipment left behind why on earth would they do that because they love the slogan no more endless wars that's why we made foreign policy based on an emotional slogan and it has made america less safe not more safe and then they dare to blame the military for it they say they say well you know the general said we can't keep bagram we don't need it the general said we can't keep kabul secure we don't need to that's not the full story see the dod is given a mission and that mission was get our troops down to zero and keep some security on the embassy that was their mission now if they had been given the option of 2500 more troops they could have kept bagram see that was actually the suggestion of the department of defense so do not let this administration lie to the american people and say that the dod suggested that we leave bagram that we leave kabul it's just not true the dod was put in a position where they had to make that choice and that and that should be on the record and as we and as we find out who is culpable for this for this complete disaster i think those are some of the avenues that will be going down thank you mr leader

but this bill does little to expedite or encourage getting our kids safely back in the classroom now as one of three physicians in the room actually actually i remind everybody that that youth suicide has doubled our youth mental health has never been worse but today the issue of getting our kids back in school feels more like parents versus the teachers juden and it should not be this is my my concern is when we asked when we asked the teachers union when we asked the administration if if we get the teachers vaccinated then would you go back to school and there's still no commitment from the administration that that's the right thing to do we need leadership we need leadership to get our kids back in school and like the people standing beside me i'd give the shirt off my back to get our kids back in school any day of the week give me a good teacher and a chalkboard and an eraser over a zoom call

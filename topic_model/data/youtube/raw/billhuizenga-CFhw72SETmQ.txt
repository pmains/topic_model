hi this is congressman bill heisenga right after the president's state of the union address you can actually still see the media scrum happening over my shoulder where national and local media is all over i been a chance to have a reaction back on a number of the radio and television stations but glad you're tuning in here a little frustrated uh with with the president from the sense that i think actions speak louder than words and the president was talking about security for our energy and making sure that we've got a strong domestic and friendly source of that yet just last week he put the gabash on the keystone pipeline project which would be 20 000 jobs directly in the united states plus many many more up to a hundred thousand additional jobs uh because of that project and i think there's an inconsistency there i also think everybody's looking for real and authentic genuine solutions to the job situation in the united states and it's not just taxation it's also the regulation that this administration has put on our economy and i think that we've got to be very careful about that moving forward so the only other thing would be the fact that it's been today 1 000 days 1 000 days since the senate has passed the budget uh that is absolutely ridiculous not acceptable we've got 30 job creating bills that have passed the house of representatives that are sitting over in the senate waiting for action i wish the president had called on the senate uh to uh to get going on that uh on those very important bills so hey thanks again for tuning in and we'll see you soon

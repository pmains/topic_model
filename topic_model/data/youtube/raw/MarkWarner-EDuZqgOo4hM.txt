listen I think it's very important that we all find a way to work together to avoid these defense cuts and it's going to take both sides it's going to take you folks being recognizing that we've got to raise some more revenues folks recognize when I have to change some of our entitlement programs these cuts were put in place because Congress failed to act a year ago on the so-called supercommittee as I think you know Laurie and a lot of the folks in Hampton Roads know I've been ever since i got the Congress trying to fight this what I think is our most important issue ending the 16 trillion dollars of debt four billion dollars a day we add to that I've been part of the bipartisan efforts around the Gang of Six and other efforts and you know if this means more senators are going to step up and join the fight I say that's the only way we're going to get this problem fixed it's the political season but end of the day we got to fix this problem into the day these kind of cuts would be very damaging so let's try to not just kick the can down the road that's one of the things that concerns me people who say let's just take a portion of this problem and fix it let's put out a comprehensive plan I've done that I've laid out a four trillion dollar plan bipartisan that raises additional revenues changes our entitlement programs makes cuts including a defense but not at these kind of draconian levels I think the more we can get the public and members of Congress in both parties to work together on a comprehensive effort the better now the actions today I'll let your viewers be the judge of whether that's politics or not but at the end of the day we're going to need folks to kind of check their Democrat and Republican hats and put our country first put our men and women in the military first and that means avoiding these cuts but it means avoiding them in a comprehensive bipartisan approach when is the Senate going to bring something up because the house in their mind they brought this we're going to stop sequestration build they passed it and they say that the Democrats all but although I understand the house but they've done is they simply said give us a plan it's a little ironic that the very same house leadership that created sequestration as a consequence around the debt ceiling debacle and now says you know let's punt I want to avoid these so this is not the right way to do it we need a comprehensive approach you know I can't speak to win the republican or democratic senate leadership is going to bring something forward i can tell you this much the Gang of Six it built upon the simpson-bowles plan I still think it's the best approach out there I would welcome not only these visiting senators but I would welcome folks from both parties to join us in this kind of effort and that will generate some additional revenues that will change some of our entitlement programs so Medicare and Social Security can be there so that we don't have these kind of immediate cuts that will I think have a undo effect

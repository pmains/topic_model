the title of our discussion today is state and local cyber security defending our communities from cyber threats amid covet 19. in preparing for this hearing it's become clear to me that good cyber security practices require a near constant struggle to stay ahead of events and the real danger lies in getting complacent effective cyber security is an ongoing everyday line of effort the threat the threat landscape is diverse the best practices are constantly changing the information you get may not always be reliable the maintenance task can seem overwhelming and most importantly the stakes are high and in this context i have often found myself thinking effective cyber security cannot move at quote the speed of government by that i mean cyber security is a 21st century public policy problem just as not solvable or really even manageable by 20th century government means regulation mandates and centralized action in general these approaches are inadequate to match the pace of change that we have witnessed in cyber security realm in recent years congress needs to make sure that the government's role in detecting and responding to cyber attacks is clearly defined that they are focused first and foremost on the security of federal information networks today we'll hear from the department of homeland security and their cyber security work how it is evolving about their approach to this complex range of threats with respect to individual actors in industries that are at their greatest risk of cyber attack health health care education financial services retail critical infrastructure the proliferation of ransomware attacks over the past several months and years have made clear that these entities have to take on this responsibility themselves on a day-to-day minute-by-minute basis irrespective of what the government is or is not doing all cyber security is essentially local and so today we'll hear from experts in state government the health care sector public education on their experience with cyber threats and incidents and see the state of cyber security in these industries fortunately for both government and the private sector the marketplace for cyber security services is continuing to grow and mature we'll hear today from one such firm uh cover that consults with private and public entities on cyber security and works with them to respond to cyber incidents i'd like to thank ranking member hassan for suggesting this hearing and i look forward to hearing from our panelists senator hassan

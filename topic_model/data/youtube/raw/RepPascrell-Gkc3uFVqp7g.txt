thank you gentlemen and I appreciate my colleagues words here tonight this there's not a whole lot left really to cover whether it was the gentleman from Pittsburgh or the jump aderson or the gentleman from east hartford of the gentleman from Somerville in Boston area and also the gentleman from upstate New York we've seen but cover many of the issues here they've been broken down I would just like to maybe touch on a point or two a lot of members have come to this floor and on the on all the TV shows they talk a lot about we got to pay our bills we got to pay our bills I think everybody here agrees that we've got to pay our bills it's important for us to remember the bills that were racked up that we have to go out and pay those appropriations bills off budget many times we're to fund two wars went right on Uncle Sam's credit card both of them not paid for and many of our colleagues on the other side never came to this floor and said oh my god how are we going to pay for all this economist after economist would come back and say this is going to be it may be a hundred 200 300 400 500 billion today we factor in all the veterans that are coming back these wars are going to be two to three to four trillion dollars when it's all said and done and I don't remember being here watching a member come up on the other side of the aisle getting the well and make an argument that we need to pay for these wars if we're going to go not one and now today they want to talk about being responsible they want to talk about us meeting our obligation now they want to say oh yeah we ran up those credit cards we we swiped them and we kept swiping I'm in caps away then we doubled down we need a surge let's double down let's run that credit card one more time and now today they're saying we're not going to pay the bills we're going to default unless you repeal the Affordable Care Act then we'll have a conversation so it's the height of irresponsibility another thing that I find humorous is how over the past few years we've been lectured to by many members of the Tea Party about the Constitution of the United States and how they're the only Americans this 20 25 maybe 30 percent these are the only Americans who have read the Constitution and they're the only ones that adhere to the Constitution but yet when we talk about the political process that we need to work through as mr. Capuano is just saying hey you can have a reasonable position you don't like it go to the ballot box win the election but yet those very same members are now funding their nose at the political process that the founding fathers set up for us to adhere to we were here during the Iraq war I was I wasn't for it campaigned against it in my first campaign guess what I didn't win didn't win the argument 2002 2003 then when it in 2004-2005 came to this floor night after night after night we finally won the house back 2006 won the House and Senate we tried to stop the war we didn't do it but we took it to the people we won the house in the Senate back 2007-2008 we took it back to the street won the presidency and then longer than any of us wanted we finally started winding things down we went to that we went through the political process we didn't shut the government down we didn't say we're going to default on the credit card bills that previous Congress's ran up even though we disagreed with how they spent the money what's happening is radical these are radical acts here in the house chamber and they say we're here to negotiate if you get rid of the Affordable Care Act is ludicrous doesn't make any sense have the guts to go to the American people and make the argument I think for life me I can't figure out why you wouldn't let the Affordable Care Act get set up it's so awful right if it's so bad set it up let it go president Obama has his fingerprints all over it the Democrats have their fingerprints all over it if it fails you'll win the Senate in 2014 and if it's so bad you'll win the president see in 2016 then defund it then dismantle it and put 30 40 million people out of the health care system make sure you can get denied health care for having a pre-existing condition and put the insurance companies between the doctor and a patient fine you won the elections perfectly capable of doing that have the guts to go to the street and make the argument seventy percent of americans are saying do not shut the government down to try to end the Affordable Care Act I will say what I think is happening here I think the house leadership on the Republican side I think they have Stockholm Syndrome I think they have started to identify themselves with their captors the Tea Party has now convinced the leadership in the House of Representatives that they should have sympathy and empathy towards their captors and so the whole country at this point is being shut down of this lastly let me say that the only successful moments in politics that our friends on the other side have had is when they divide the American people who's in the Union who's not in a union who's in a public sector union versus who's in a private sector union who's black who's white who's gay who straight divide divide divide divide and here we are in 2013 a divided nation that is uncover nabol at this point because of the power that is held by the Tea Party in the United States House of Representatives I just want to say that there is a future waiting to be taken for this country investments back in the United States into our infrastructure into our research into renewable energies into expanding the grid and making it smarter into making sure everyone has access to the latest technologies three-dimensional printers in schools robotics Legos get kids excited about learning we only have 313 million people in the United States we're competing against 1.4 billion people in China and we're sitting on our hands we're not making the investments we need to be making and there are colleges and universities and schools that need the investment and every day that goes by mr. Garamendi every day that goes by we see one more two more five more ten more situations where investments were made collectively by the public that benefit our country and we need to end this lockout that's happening right now and I thank the gentleman for his leadership

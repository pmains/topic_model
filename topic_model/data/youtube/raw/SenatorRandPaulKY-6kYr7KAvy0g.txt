senator thank you so much for joining me thanks for having me all right senator as i just mentioned you are joining in on the criticism aimed at wyoming representative liz cheney who you also believe is stepping out of line in her criticism of the president and this isn't the first time you've disagreed with her we know that in the past cheney has also praised dr anthony fauci while you have challenged fauci about his comments about during the pandemic so senator explain to our viewers your criticism of cheney i think it's safe to say that myself and our family have a lot of differences with the cheneys the cheneys have been big advocates of war uh the iraq war first the afghan war as well but also the perpetuation of these wars and i'm a big fan of president trump's viewpoint on this president trump said in the state of the union the last time around he said that great nations don't fight perpetual wars and i think we've long been passed our military mission in afghanistan i've got three nephews who've served in the military i talk to soldiers all the time and to a person they think we've been there long enough and that there's not really a military mission there liz cheney though continues to cheer cheer on for staying in afghanistan permanently what we're doing in afghanistan now is really just flushing money down a toilet we spend 50 billion dollars a year there both the president and i are upset that that money is being spent building roads and schools in afghanistan and not building roads and schools in our country so we need to get get rid of the nation building and i just don't like liz cheney out there beating the president up on trying to bring some of the troops home from germany but also trying to end the war in afghanistan and so i think the president's right i think she's wrong and if she wants to be supportive of the president she needs to keep those thoughts to herself yes senator and other gop lawmakers as well such as matt gates also saying house republicans deserve better as the conference chair but switching gears now to the topic of mask mandates there's a model which was published by the institute for health metrics and evaluation saying if 95 of people in the u.s wore mass while in public spaces the model predicts approximately 40 000 lives would be saved and we know that president trump has recently expressed support for the latest face mass mandates imposed by several states saying that wearing one it may be a very patriotic thing to do what is your take on this well you know if we banned uh driving cars i think we could save several hundred thousand lives so if we banned eating at fast food restaurants i think we can save another couple hundred thousand lives so really it gets down to whether you want to live in a free society or you want to live in an authoritarian society look i'm not saying don't wear a mask i'm just saying the government's got no business telling you you have to wear a mask if you're 80 something years old i would avoid big crowds and i'd wear a mask when you have to be indoors with a crowd if you're 18 years old the mortality is one in a million you make your own choice and so i think we need to allow some freedom to occur in this and not have a blanket one size fits all look we have hundreds of thousands of people currently in the united states who are immunosuppressed they're taking cancer treatment but we don't say to everybody well you could make them sick so you need to wear a mask if you're around your loved one you may well want to wear a mask and if you're around somebody who has that those people also wear masks but we don't make the whole country wear masks because a hundred thousand people are sick with cancer so i think that we have to remember that we live in a free country and not just completely throw the baby out with about with the bad water and just say oh well we have this virus we have to do everything so we're just going to give away our freedom you know churches should we ban people going to churches because we might save lives no i think the first amendment's important doesn't mean you should go to church if you're older and there's a lot of virus in your community maybe you shouldn't go but the government has no business telling you you can't go so there's a difference between taking good advice and actually allowing the government to mandate your behavior all right so your take senators government has no business telling you to wear mass and that we live in a free country but senator finally before i let you go i just want to ask you very quickly president trump he's about to make an announcement this hour as part of operation legend what is your take on the federal crackdown of rioters and cities that continue to see ongoing violence you know i think our cities are a disaster and it's important to remember that our cities have been run by democrats since the early 1970s louisville and my state hasn't had a republican mayor since 1972. minneapolis where we had the problem riots fires the terrible police brutality all those things they're happening under democrat watches but if we ask how we're going to fix it the people who live in those cities need to elect better people i'm not really for sending federal police or the army into our cities because it's very difficult to be a policeman or a policewoman they have a tough job and i really admire what they try to do but policemen have to recognize the right to protest the first amendment and they have to stop mayhem from happening but i don't think our army is necessarily prepared to do that it's a difficult job that a policeman has and i just don't want to see look i'm a big fan of the presidents but i don't want to see federal officers in our cities chicago is an utter disaster 14 people shot at a uh at a funeral this weekend but really that's because chicago's got terrible people running the city people who live there need to get rid of those people but we can't simply say because chicago is so terrible running their city that we're going to send federal troops in there there's a danger that what happens is that people get hauled off the street who some of them may well just be protesting and i don't want the to see unmarked people in camouflage carrying semi-automatic weapons yanking people off the streets it just doesn't look good and it doesn't look like you know what america is supposed to stand for so you're saying senator it is a question of leadership in those cities and as i mentioned president trump he is expected to make an announcement of an expansion of operation operation legend coming up in just a few moments senator rand paul thank you so much for your time thank you

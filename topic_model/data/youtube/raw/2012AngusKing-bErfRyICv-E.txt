alright well thank you so much for coming we got get your attention really appreciate you coming just so that you understand where you are this is the Oxford networks data center my name is Matt Jacobson I'm a executive vice president of sales for Oxford networks i'm also a co-chair of Angus his campaign so I'm thrilled to be here and I'm thrilled that you're here to join us this building up to about four months ago was or four months 18 months ago was a very secure NATO communications facility and we're in the process of turning it into the most secure commercially available data center anyone so that's what that's what we're doing here and here's what we're doing here real quickly I'd like to go through some of the ground rules this is live we're going out on the internet marks in the back with with all that gear wave mark we're taking questions online audience members may answer ask questions at the podiums we're going to break it down into these categories over my left shoulder please hold your question on a topic until that topic comes up we're going to get to all of them and if we don't get the topic there might be a little time afterwards we'll do our best to answer some questions online after the event we're going to try to get to as many questions as we can and we've got to be out of here by eight o'clock so that's the that's the rules I'd like to introduce Charlene amuka who is a experience ite executive she's been in Silicon Valley and spent some time with IBM and you're helping us tonight she'll be handling the online questions for us and it is my great pleasure to introduce my friend in the next senator from me Angus k thanks man Oh the first thing I want to say before we start talking about technology as if there's anybody online from any large technology companies the the name you want to remember is Brunswick landing this facility is fantastic Oxford networks has gotten first dibs on this data center but there's about a million square feet of buildings here with tremendous of fiber capacity and and security and all the things that are necessary so I had to put in a little little promotion for Steve leveque so what we're going to try to do today is talk really about technology and a series of issues as you see and I'm going to share sort of where I'm thinking on these things and we'll take some questions because technology is the future of this country and how the government interacts with with technology is a very important part of our economic social and cultural future so Matt you're going to you're going to start a little question I'm gonna be Ryan Seacrest tonight yes the first step first question is really much talk a little bit about row broadband why you think that's important why you've made that such a centerpiece so far well it again the best way to answer that is to come back with a question would you buy a house where you walked in and they said I'm sorry but you can never have any electricity in this house you wouldn't do it and broadband to me is the electricity of the 21st century and particularly in rural areas and I started hearing almost from the time I announce from people in some very rural areas and some not so rural areas saying I can't get decent broadband and it's killing me and really the issue is economics a business can't locate a place where they can't operate broadband is just it's a it's an economic death sentence for rural America so I started thinking about it and I went back and did some research about franklin d roosevelt and rural electrification when Roosevelt proposed rural electrification in the 30s it's very it's not unlike this situation ninety percent of the people in the urban centers of america had electricity ten percent of the rural people had electricity so there was this vast discrepancy now it's not quite so bad in the US now it's about 85 or 90 percent have broadband access in the urban areas about fifty percent in the rural areas but it's still that that's something we really have to do something about not only about businesses but many people won't buy a house I've talked to Realtors who said you know I tour around the house and say oh by the way you can't get broadband here and the buyer says well no thanks I'm going to live somewhere else and that's a recipe for out-migration which is not something main needs so that's why I think it's such a such an important issue and that we I and by the way an amendment just passed today in the US Senate by Senator Warner of Virginia that has a rural broadband initiative as part of the farm bill and the bill went through this afternoon survived a filibuster threat and so that's that's a piece of good news it is good and I and from just a personal perspective Oxford networks of course we run a pretty big fiber company as well as here in Maine a regional fiber company and so one of the concerns we have is we would love to be able provide more services to more rural parts of Maine we get nervous when when folks talk about all we're going to duplicate our services we've already got you know fiber in the ground we've spent a lot of capital what would you say to to fix to have that concern well I don't I don't have I guess first thing i should say is i don't think the government should be choosing winners and losers and i don't think they should even be choosing which technology is the right technology I think what chase they should do is look for results and the results should be the highest speed now how about this the highest speed now obtainable by an ordinary citizen in Romania believe it or not believe it or not that's a lot better than me or you know in other words what's that what's the mercial adequate speed around the world that's what we should be shooting for not if we put you know ten megabytes in the statute that's that will become the floor and I don't think we should be doing that so as far as people like Oxford if if you're if you've already done it then I don't see any reason the government should come in and say we're going to pay somebody else to do it but there may be a section a part of maine there may be places where the carriers can do it there may also be places using again the rural electrification model where their local coops that do it local people get together because the cable company or whoever says the houses are too far apart we can't do it we don't want to do it it doesn't make economic sense so maybe it's a it's a local group like you know the the the downeast electrical co-op up in Washington County I mean that that's that's what worked in the 30 so i think it's got to be a variety of solutions okay do we have any questions from the audience on on this top we have one yes sir angus or just to follow up on that and just wrote it down so I could make sure I got covered all the points and to bring this make this just a more local why is broadband access and adoption so important to rural areas of the country especially for main one of the most rural of states and how it improved broadband access and adoption to benefit the lives of Mainers well it it gives us a fighting chance to have an economic future I mean if if we don't if you don't have broadband access in my view within the next five to eight years in all areas those areas are written off they're not going to have an economic future and it's I don't think it's an I don't think this is a nice to have deal I think this is a must tab deal and then the other piece is the cultural piece it's how people are connected these days it's how people communicate with each other and it's it's as if we we had a system where we said okay we're going to have this thing called the US Postal Service but all you guys aren't going to have you know you're not going to have mailboxes you're not going to be able to get your mail you're not even going to be able to go down in the post office and get your mail I mean that how ridiculous it would be if we had to if there's a there's an echo in here that's that's technology that's technology for you a lot of latency though huh that's not bad latency though you know what's the ping rate on that but Phil I I think it's I think it's critical and and it's it it's like building roads and the problem is now in May and we have for example we have the three ring binder which is a terrific fiber backbone that goes throughout the state but we don't have the connections outwards it's like building if it's as if the interstate went all the way up but there were no feeder roads so we can't get to it so that's the the last mile problem is I think what we really really have to work on but I I've you know I've been interested in technology for a long time and just as I was thinking it through it just occurred to me this this rural broadband in Maine as well as rural areas around the country is it's just critical otherwise otherwise all the Commerce is going to be concentrated and we're going to lose a lot of creativity and economic opportunity thanks Charlene has one from the web Ashley Hayes this is our first live chat somebody responded well you were talking and they've got a question this is from Bob Higgins in Portland and his question is why do you think the USA is behind other countries in their internet connection speeds and how do you think that can be changed I think I think probably we're behind in part because of complacency I think people think what we've got is really good and they don't realize that in other parts of the world I mentioned Romania France Scandinavia I think Costa Rica maybe there are a lot of places that are that are way ahead of us and I think we just haven't really focused on it I think frankly the other problem is that the elites if you will the political and media elites are in places that have pretty good access and they don't realize the extent of this of this a lack of good connectivity once you get outside of the the major population center so it's I've often felt that if if Congress would meet in a few places that are really hurting economically maybe there'd be more activity about economic development but they're meeting in a place that's doing okay it's a question of out of sight out of mind and and I think that explains part of the part of the problem okay last call for a real axis one more I can hear you you can stand up just know you so instead of like like honey in places that already do having an image but like new limited but they only have a one Tommy right um would you like support more competitiveness because wait my parents um they like the confidence that is linked in that area that provides like internet for them they have to have internet in order for there so then um for their phone like they have to pay for I have to get both yeah they have to get both of the pump and they aren't can use out of the phone well Philly they want more often competition and options are generally better yeah okay that but but there are places where I'd settle for one provider I mean we've got a lot of places that you know you just can't can't get it at all but generally if you can for example you can have in in Brunswick we have competition you can get dsl or you can get from the cable company or if you or you could get satellite so there you know you have options but in lots of places as you say you don't more options are better competition generally brings down prices and at one point that you you touch on that I ought to mention is I don't think the government should be talking about what the right solution is in other words is it fiber to the home or is it wireless is it you know or something is it des l in my experience if government chooses the the technology by the time the ink is dry on the law there's a new technology and I just don't think again I think that we ought to be talking about results and it may be that Wireless is the right answer in some places and fiber to the home is the right answer somewhere else and it'll depend on the topography and the region and the distances and all those kinds of things okay well why don't we move on to economic development and I know that to do our experience that that's a subject during your you and I have done that what's the twice a while um how do you how do you view technology in high tech as though is a route towards towards economic development especially in may well main historically has been geographically challenged you know when I grew up and you looked at the map of the US where was main the upper right-hand corner around it was all white now we know that's called Canada but but geography has always been a limiting factor I remember trying to get harley-davidson to move an engine factory domain and their response was no it needs to be nearer the geographic center of the country where we can ship these big heavy pieces around and and shipping costs are important the technology eliminates largely that kind of issue where you know we can't build big heavy engines but we can do software we can do commerce we can do ecommerce and all of those things so particularly for a rural state technology is is more important than it would be anywhere else because it's the way it enables it levels the playing field Geographic it deals with this Geographic problem that that a rural particularly a rural state that's in the upper corner has so that's why I think the three-ring binder project that's a that's a broadband backbone that's been just completed in the last few months is very important to Maine but now we have to go the next piece and finish the wiring up you're not going to be surprised that I'm going to say I think digital devices in the hands of students is an important economic development tool and notice I said digital devices it may not the next generation may not be laptops it may be a an iPad or some kind of Android tablet or something that that's cheaper lighter more powerful and and does all those things but I've always felt that the society that is more technologically literate has a real advantage in the in the 21st century whoever has the most well-trained April able people is who's going to win Matt and I have had experience Matt used to be the head of something called Maine and company which was a private sector economic development entity and we went on trips together to recruit businesses and those kinds of things it'll surprises a lot of people that when you ask a business to come to Maine or come anywhere the first question they ask is do you have the qualified people that's that's the number one criteria it's not taxes it's not regulation it's do you have the qualified people to fill my jobs and that's why the combination of a really good technological infrastructure and a solid educational system is in the long run the answer to economic development there's no by the way there's no silver bullet to economic development we've learned that as my friend Lori lachance says there's no silver bullet there silver buckshot which is really the right image if you think about it there's a there are a lot of solutions and you never know what's going to be important for economic development I had a guy in my office who brought a business up here and I said how did you happen to come to Maine and he sort of shuffled and looked at his feet and and finally he said well to be honest I ride a Harley and it was because main didn't have a helmet law we who would have ever thought the lack of a helmet law was an economic development strategy but the point is you never know what's going to work but I'll tell you what without the technological underpinning without the bandwidth we're song I need you have one from the odd yeah I just want to see we are streaming this live so if you do have a question from the audience a few people emailed us and are actually here and wanted to ask a few questions so if you do have a question you actually have to stand in front of the mic just just so you know because people on the internet are listening so just wanted to let people are now fix okay do we have any questions from the eyes first one of the microphone wins thank you up I suppose I've invested interested in since on section chair for the institute of electrical electronic engineers in Maine oh the other half of economic development from my perspective is bringing technology businesses to Maine these are businesses that you know the starting salaries for college grads are 75 and up I'll take any salaries for college grads these days well true but okay so what do we do to you know encourage things like well Corky Ellis is kept where or Tyler down in Falmouth you know a couple that come to mind these aren't research e-types things these are real development right types of things which we can hopefully support somehow and it's all about but we got to have the basic infrastructure it's like it's the other way we need the infrastructure I think though in ways we're getting that we need the last mile desperately yeah especially where I am I'm with you but but beyond that then we can begin to bring some of these businesses in with high paying job so what do we do how do we do it we start you start with the infrastructure that's that that's number one and you know this will this but this answer may surprise you a little bit but one of the things we do is maintain the quality of life that we have here because that's if people can if people can work anywhere they're going to choose the nice places so we have to be careful that we don't compromise what we all find wonderful about Maine in the name of economic development because the the quality of life in Maine is one of our major economic development assets thank you sir hello hi um I work for Texas sentiments formerly national semiconductors so are you here in the main plant yes am at South Portland cool so we owe a lot to you you were personally involved in I'd be talking with a southern accent right now because our plant our planet our plant would have been put in Texas so thank you thank you my question is ninety percent of Texas Instruments electronics revenues come from sales outside the US as a senator what policies would you propose to further open global trade so that the the vast portfolio of Technology IP developed in the US can better sell into markets around the world first I have to tell you a funny story about your plant and how it how it came we had a whole we were being sort of tested by national semiconductor and they brought all these big shots from California and we had a meeting with our with all the commissioners and one of the detective one of the national semiconductor guy said how long will it take to get our permits and I looked at Ned Sullivan who was the head of the DEP in the front row and I said mr. Sullivan how long will it take to get our to get the permits he said he stood up and said sooner than 90 days governor we had rehearsed this and and it turned out it was 29 days and we didn't we didn't cut any rules we didn't short cut anything but it was you know pre-engineering to get to get that done so that was a I feel real positive about that in terms of trade I believe in an open trade between countries I don't think the US has done a very good job of negotiating with other countries who want access to our markets because in effect when we signed a free trade agreement it's as if that country becomes a state for the purposes of trade and we haven't done enough to require them to meet some of our standards they don't have to have exactly what we have but some kind of labor protections some kind of environmental protections and some kind of IP protections so if everybody in the world wants to sell into this market and I don't think we've done an adequate job of extracting from them some concessions on how they're going to act in order to open their markets up a friend of mine got mad at me for using this analogy but my experience with NAFTA and Canada is that it's like a funnel with the big end in Canada and the little end here and it's real easy for Canadian stuff to come this way but it's a little harder for us to thread that small end and get it out into the other other end and I think it's you know everybody's in favor of free trade but I don't think we've been very good negotiators and particularly for a company like yours you know it's it's all about IP protection and I think if somebody is not doing IP we should talk about okay you can't have the full and complete access to our market that you want great thank you so we have another one online on this topic Charlie this is another online chat that just came in this one's from Nolan how Winthrop Maine and they asked what how do you think technology in the hands of students is going to help the economy well it starts technology in the hands of students which creates young people with a high level of technological skills will be a huge help to the economy for the very reason that I said because employers look for skilled workers well you offered networks wants people who are adept at the use of technology and if you've got kids that started in the seventh grade and that laptop is an extension of their arm they're going to be better at now you know I used to say you know Michael Jordan didn't get good at basketball going to basketball lab 40 minutes a week you know he got good at it by do it every day and the same thing goes with the with the technology in the hands of the kids now here's one of the things we've learned though with 10 years of experience now in Maine the effectiveness of the laptop project depends enormously on the preparation of the teacher if you just hand out laptops it doesn't work and if you have a principal and teachers who are into it and who are well prepared and who had good solid professional development it's fantastic if it's just a hardware project it's not it's not going to be that effective and in fact a round main it's uneven their places where it just sings and there are places where it's not it's not as good because the teachers either don't use it or don't want to use it or nobody they haven't really had the opportunity to get the necessary professional development but that's that's the this is the laptop project is not a technology project it's a learning project and it's simply putting the tools into the hands of kids that are useful and necessary for functioning in the in the 21st century the laptop is the 21st century pencil and I don't think anybody would argue that the way to handle pencils in the classroom is to have a pencil lab one day a week and three pencils in the classroom for all the kids to share every now that it just doesn't work but in terms of economic development it's a question of if we have the most technologically literate society on earth we win and the way to start that is in the schools so we're going to move on now I think we got another al yeah yeah we're going to get to education into into alright alright we get to education will go there alright I'm back time on point a so right now we're going to talk about government efficiency and openness and had technology affects fix this next well the tonight is a kind of test of some of that we're all here but there are also people anywhere in the world who are watching listening commenting sending questions and and and that's you know that was never possible before relatively recently now you can listen to maine the maine legislature hearings online live streaming but there you can go even beyond that i mean i understand for example somewhere maybe it's in boston there's this crowd source thing where if you drive over a pothole you hit a nap and the and and it notifies people who can go and then fix the pothole you don't have to necessarily send you know a lot of people do come now ignore you online yeah they get online but it enables we're just scratching the surface of this it enables a connectivity between people and between people and their government that was just never possible before I mean you know the I get a email once a week or so from once every two weeks from olympia snowe the snow report and it's an email and it's it's good it's it's it's effective way to communicate but you can do it you can go to the next level and you can you can talk to people you can have a chat you can you can be in Maine and share what's going on in Washington so I think it the people now are frustrated and field they feel disconnected from their government and and it seems to me that the technology allows us a way to be connected where I think we're going to talk about facebook at some point but it's a tremendous opportunity to connect with people how many yeah how about from the audience on on government use of technology well I don't mean just one more well you got to remember when I came into office there was no internet I mean I remember announcing in February of 1995 the state's first website and I didn't know what I was announcing you know I said going out and announce this governor you know and here's what it is but and for example here's a sound it sounds silly today but being able to reregister your car online that's huge instead of having to go and and go through what I used to call the the the Secretary of State's treasure hunt you know where you go from the dealership to the track you know to the motor vehicles to somewhere else the DMV treasure hunt the other thing is being able to get a hunting license for fishing license online in the middle of the night llbean figured that out a hundred years ago you know that's why ll bean is open 24 hours a day so hunters and fishermen could come in at 4am on their way to the lake and buy a fishing license well a hundred years later now you could do it in Maine in terms of getting getting your license by the way when we were the second state in the country to be able to get hunting and fishing licenses online and I said to inland fisheries and wildlife we're going to do it and I want it done by my State of the State address on in January and I found out later the way they did it was you went online and you typed in your application and when it got to their office it turned into a fax went to somebody you know somebody picked it up and carried it over but by golly you got your license you know so but I think we were the second state after Georgia but those kinds of things just to to make the interactions time is one of our most valuable commodities and to the extent you don't have to drive someplace parks it in line that's a tremendous improvement in the way people can interact interact with their government certainly it's got one online I think this is just along the lines of what you were starting to talk about but the question is how would you use technology to reduce the cost of government and make it more open and participatory well in fact we did do my first year in office we had a budget we walked into a budget problem and one of the ways we dealt with it was by basically a top-to-bottom analysis of state government and how we're where we had personnel and where we could use technology to more efficiently administer the state government and we did find i can't remember i think it was 45 million dollars worth of savings by using technology as a Productivity enhancer so to the extent you can you can automate some of these functions it saves personnel costs and it makes government about both faster more efficient and less expensive and you know industry has revolutionized its processes in terms of use of technology and government and education is one of the and healthcare I have to say or one of the last areas to really fully integrate it into their processes to make them more efficient and and and frankly less expensive question was you know how do you think you would engage the citizens to make use of these online tools well the first thing is you got to tell them about it you got to make make it clear that they have these this this option and in communication and publicity frankly and and just making people aware of what's out there having a sign at the town clerk's office you don't have to come in here next year you can do it online at you know main gov or you know those those kinds of things and and just making being sure that the that the portals are friendly that they're easy to use that they're not frustrating it we forget now most of us use the internet and ordered by things when when ecommerce first began in the you know around two thousand or so or late 90s something like sixty five percent of the of the transactions never happened people gave up in the middle you know they'd start you've all had that experience and then it you get you type in your you're wrong p.o box and the whole thing in races and stuff there now we're much better at doing those things so part of it is to make sure as a as a user it's a good experience I used to do a thing occasionally where I would call 800 numbers at the state 800 numbers you know and k called it scaring the troops but you know to pretend that you're a customer and I remember once calling i called the tourism thing and I said well I want to take a vacation in maine and and they said oh that'll be great and we'd love to have you and everything we had a nice conversation and then at the end I said well so can you send me some materials you said yes you will have them within three weeks well we fixed that but part of it is just to you know to use the facilities I always loved the MBNA motto overall the door some of you may have seen it said think of yourself as the customer and I think that's a great way that government should think of itself thank you so we're going to move to education so you might want to move towards the podium al so so let's talk about education other two area that you particular interest when you were governor and in light of technology how do you see you know the new technology interacting to make our education system work a little better well I think we need to take it to the next level frankly and the laptops were the were the right product at the time ironically we're now talking about you're talking about the cloud 12 years ago when we first started talking about the laptops we started talking about what are called thin clients which was a device that hooks into the the cloud and you don't have to have so much computing power in the device everything of this that everything's stored on the network the only trouble was in nineteen in 1999 it didn't work we have the bandwidth yeah we didn't have the bandwidth remember Duke that was thought thin clients but but now that may be a solution that would give you a much less expensive device and frankly you have a little bit more control about of it in terms of the student views and and you know I don't know where it's going to go I think that's that's one of the one of the opportunities the other thing is to free teachers from the drudgery so they can do the fun part of teacher I've been teaching at Bowden in Bates the last eight years I hate grading exams I like teaching but if you can do for example online homework the kids do it online they answer the questions it goes into the school's computer the next morning the teacher comes in they're all scored they can see how everybody's doing they can see oh yeah all my kids got the mat that got the subtraction problems but they miss the multiplication problem so let's spend some more time on multiplication you can target your teaching much more effectively then now when you're sort of intuitive doesn't you give a test you take them home and grade them they get the test back ten days later by that time you're on another unit the test should be a diagnostic tool instead of just an assessment too so that you can use it and integrate it into into your teaching so I think there's a huge opportunity the other thing is to allow the computers to do the drudgery part a great teacher should not be teaching the multiplication tables a great teacher should be teaching how to use the multiplication tables in a way to solve problems but let the let the computer do the the rope start the wrote part so I think those are some ways that I've like I say I think we're just we're just scratching the surface and and I've seen a lot of I see teachers pretty regularly who say you know I thought you were crazy but now I can't imagine ever going back to teaching without these devices in the kids hands arms well thank you the innovative industry in this country is in dire need of highly technically highly educated people so from your perspective what do you think the political leadership could do to encourage or incentivize students to take up disciplines such as technology engineering science math and how would you think the cost of obtaining degrees in disciplines could be lowered one of my favorite quotes from Mark Twain everybody has a mark twain quote but my favorite is history doesn't always repeat itself but it usually rhymes isn't that cool history doesn't always repeat itself but it usually rhymes here's one way that from my own personal history my mother was that both my parents were the first people in their families to ever go to college my mother went to college on a scholarship and the deal on the scholarship was the state of Virginia would pay her tuition if she would agree to teach in Virginia a year each year year for year now why can't we do something like that if we need people for example if we need stem teachers let's forgive their scholarships if they're willing to stay and contribute back into the schools and into the community I mean that's just a one sort of shorthand way that it occurred to me is it and I remember somebody's talking to me about that I know let's maybe we could have this new idea of giving people scholarships in exchange for staying and teaching and I said you know my mother did that 70 years ago so I think that's one possibility the other thing is frankly I don't think we've done a good enough job communicating to young people what what's out there and it's not all not necessarily all about college education I walked into a meeting and Biddeford about a month ago which shocked me i sat down and the and it was with a chamber and a head of the Chamber said we've got a real employment problem down here governor and I thought okay this is what we're you know this is what we always hear and he said no it's not what you think we've got 500 hi highly skilled well-paying technology jobs that we can't fill we can't fill them and then these were in things like machine you know machine tool machining and and metal products and part of that is the kids have all been told you have to go to college and it's not cool to work with your hands and I think we need to be thinking about the fact that you know these are really good jobs maybe they take they do take some level of technical training because they have to run CAD machines and those kinds of things but they don't necessarily require four years of college the other thing is you know I think the society gets what it values and we have to value more these these kinds of disciplines maybe maybe if engineers made more than investment bankers this problem would go away but that that would be that would really happen so we have one more from the internet and then we'll come back back over here we actually have one comment at one question so the first I'll read the comment and it says no name but I'm a fifty-year-old accounting student I'm learning a lot about technology in the business world they said this type of conversation is such a breath of fresh air technology is for older students now as well so I don't think that was my sister but sign your name no nose now and mom now for the question um whoops how does main prevent brain drain or how does main encourage students to stay in Maine rather than seek opportunities elsewhere boy I've thought about that a lot I think the first thing to say and this doesn't make us feel any better but the first thing to say is this is a worldwide problem one of the things Mary and I learned on our RV trip was that a lot of the issues that we think of as as main are happening everywhere Michigan people are coming from the Lower Peninsula to the city's Oregon they're going to portland washington they're going to seattle they're leaving the eastern areas of so it's it's it's a problem everywhere in fact i have a friend that lives in norway and he says you know our biggest problem is all the kids are going to awesome so it's a it's a common problem but that doesn't mean we give up on it I think the first thing is economic opportunity I mean people are going to leave as they have throughout history to find better jobs and if we can develop the kind of economic opportunity with companies like national semiconductor here or Fairchild or I'd X or some of the companies that are growing up in the Bangor area and around the around the state that's the best thing Oxford networks you know my son Matt here's a good lead okay but yes absolutely so keep creating that kind of opportunity the other thing is I'm not sure the problem is as bad as we think because a lot of times the kids come back my oldest son left Maine for ten years but as soon as he started a family he came back and he's here because of the quality of life and because it's a great place to raise kids and so and in fact I remember there were some figures recently that Portland had one of the highest influxes of people between 20 and 30 of any state in the country i mean it was something like that i mean people are are coming back but it's it's a lot about and the other thing it's about oddly enough is amenities we sort of joke about that but having things like you know the the festival on the waterfront in Bangor or you know John John Miller the pirate festival at Eastport he'd kill me if I didn't mention the pirate investor or you know having a having a bulk of a baseball team in a hockey team in a basketball team in Portland those are the kinds of things that make a community livable all right when I came into office I never would have dreamed if you told me the major economic development engine for the mid coast would be an art museum I just said are you nuts but the farnsworth plus him MBNA I have to admit but the farnsworth has become a really important part of the economic development and 2d up in up in Rockland one final example san antonio texas which collects i think about sixty percent of all the tourism money that's spent in texas in this one city and san antonio was going nowhere and then they develop the ladies Garden Society develop something called the River Walk and they've got the Alamo and the River Walk and by the way the ladies had to overcome the all-male City Council that wanted to pave over the river and develop this river walk and it's become one of the leading tourist attractions in San Antonio and and and on top of now with the tourism there's a lot of business that's gone there and it's become just a real tremendous economic driver of that region of Texas so it's like I said before it's silver buckshot is all those pieces together now well thank you for being patient the Riverwalk is a gorgeous place by the way my context as you know I'm with Walsh education and where we're focused on k-12 education so there's been a lot of good discussion about technology and especially it tends to focus on one-to-one interaction between a student and a computer or a device or website it's it's a way to remove drudgery from the teachers day to day job my my concern and my question is what's your perspective on developing and promoting tools to facilitate the student-teacher interaction in a standards-based classroom and to remove some of the drudgery of the teachers every day Walker work removed from the student-teacher simple interaction that we focus on today well if you think about it education is one of the few things that's delivered in almost exactly the same way as it was in 1750 if a if a person who was born in the 1700s wandered into a main classroom they feel right at home desks person sitting at the front lecturing the the technology allows us to change that that picture so that the teacher is no longer the conveyor of the content the content comes from the device the teacher becomes a coach and I've been in lots of internet classrooms where the teacher isn't standing in front but is wandering around between the desks commenting suggesting showing pointing have you thought of this have you thought of that to me that's a more that's what the teacher that's that's the teachers role as opposed to just being the person that stands in the front of the classroom and delivers delivers the content and and the good the exciting classrooms that I've seen that's that's that's what happens and then then the students by this mysterious process take ownership of their own education because ultimately that's what you want is you want students who are who are saying wow that's cool I didn't know that you know and they they touch on the on the picture of the whale and it suddenly comes to life and swims you know it's it's Harry Potter's moving pictures book and and then they're engaged when I talk to teachers who have used the laptop project the most common term the most common word they use is engaged and if you have students who are engaged you can teach them anything if you have students who are looking out the window you could be Thomas Jefferson and and Socrates are not teach them anything and so the engagement is the important part now there's a downside to it kids can wander off and they can get on facebook and you know when I was a kid we didn't go on facebook we had the comic book in the geography text in the back I'm reading so there are you know there are those kinds of issues but I think alda the secret is freeing up the teacher to be the coach instead of doing the you know 2+2 is 4 and that kind of thing and the other thing is this iPad experiment over in Auburn I got to tell you when the superintendent schools called me and said you got to come over we're going to give iPads every kindergartener even I said huh you know five-year-olds but then I went over and saw it and you realize five-year-olds interact with the world through their fingers the ipad was a natural for these kids because they can't really very well hold a pencil or a pen and they were doing the letters with their fingers and tracing them out and mike's understanding is it's been pretty pretty successful very successful and again it's just it's using the tools that we have that's that's the way I see thank you yeah so I don't have a good segue for this so let's go to net neutrality what do you think I'm for it I don't think I don't think people who own the pipe should be able to say who gets to drive faster on the pipes is that does that make any sense in other words if you net neutrality is allowing equal access on a non-discriminatory basis that's how I understand it and if you if you owned a highway and you also happen to be ford motor and you said okay anybody can use my highway but Ford's can go 80 and everybody else has to go 20 that wouldn't do much for innovation it wouldn't do much for broad use of the highway and I think that's the way I feel about net neutrality I mean I think it's I think it's an important it's an important principle it has to be it has to be kept it has to be kept open open so this question came to the website prior to the event and it's from Daniel Kent who is the executive director of net literacy and they're in Indiana and his question was is that while I and my organization that literacy are based in Indiana we're excited this event is taking place and wish we can replicate this event for our own congressman someday because we're in indiana we're going to be joining the Town Hall virtually net neutrality has been a contentious issue what is governor anguses position on it which you've started to talk about and how will that impact the citizens of Maine well I think what it I'll answer the second part cause I think I answered the first part they the impact on the citizens of Maine is it will it'll make equal access it'll-it'll and plus it's also it's not only us as consumers but is somebody in Maine creates a website and wants to start a business I don't think they ought to be discriminated against because they don't have some special deal cut with with verizon or comcast did you see what I mean it becomes and that's what this issue is really all about is is everybody has acts us to the to the whole wide world I mean that's one of the amazing thing about the Internet is the ability to start a business and and and make a success of it without a huge capital investment and and and you can you know you can start it right right here in Maine the guys over to ski depot and Jay mayen who sell skis all over the world on the internet they they were smart enough ten years ago to buy the domain name ray skis.com and you know they're selling skis all over the place out of out of Jamie and I don't know about you but you know well I mean I'm sure you share my view that you think of the great ski centers of the world kitzbuhel Aspen Sugarloaf Jay Wright but here these guys that created this business you know out of their imagination and I don't think the net the people that own the pipe should be able to discriminate or prejudice them because they haven't made some special deal i think it's got a sky that my principle is a common carrier that everybody gets the same access okay so that really leads us into the next conversation around around internet regulation sort of feeds into that what do you wave thoughts about regulating the internet yeah I can do it I can state my position on government regulation of the Internet as follows you get it I don't think government should be in regulating the internet I mean I think it's a now they're you get in some really complicated issues like copyright intellectual property and there's their tensions there but and we've got a you know we've got it we were talking earlier about somebody like texas instruments that has a great value in intellectual property or people that create works of art but i think we have to tread very carefully because in the name of protecting intellectual property we end up you know just casting a wet blanket over the whole deal if you tell a you know i mean facebook probably couldn't function under the next question yeah i mean facebook but I mean a website that that that if the website is liable for a copyright violation that you know a small website would have to hire a compliance officer and I just think we need to be really really careful about about that so my my view is a government should should help to facilitate the building out of the infrastructure but then get out of the way maybe from any from online oh hello governor how what is it specifically about PIPA sis pessoa and acta those types of internet regulation legislations that you are opposed to and how would you as a senator try to stop further bills of that variety coming down the pipeline is this a quiz do I have to tell you what they all say now you do not stop online piracy act as SOPA PIPA is the protection of intellectual property act those are again that's what i was talking about it's it's a legitimate issue I mean somebody spends a hundred million dollars to create a movie and then it's pirated and goes everywhere and and and that i consider that I mean I may be the last person standing who still believes that you know copyright holders have some rights but I think that's a legitimate issue I don't have the solution but I with those bills that you mentioned went too far they they went too far in the in the toward the side they basically shifted the responsibility to the website and said you know you have to you're responsible if copyrighted material is shown and the problem with that I mean this is gets so complicated what if the website is in is in Malaysia you know how do we regulate that or somebody has 50 domain names and you shut down one and it's like when I first started this campaign some guy kept doing fake Twitter's did you remember that and I shut down one and then I gave up because I said this is like cyber whack Amole comes up over here so that points out how hard this is I think my instinct would be to do what I did when I was governor quite often is lock them in a room and tell them to work something out the googles and the facebooks and the and the yahoos of the world and Hollywood and the Recording Industry and see if there isn't a way that they can find where neither one gets everything they want but that we don't really compromise we can't stifle this enormous enormous engine of human creativity in the name of protecting a specialized human creativity I think there's a solution there that can respect both and it may just be that the model for music is going to have to change the model of selling a packet of data maybe it's a different they're going to have to find it figure out a different way to to make money these that you know the Internet is a is an utterly different thing that has ever existed before and things change the buggy whip manufacturers are all out of business so Thank You governor yep let's talk for a minute about social media rounds and do you have a lot of facts about this yeah well I have to admit I was not a big Facebook user until about a year ago I created a Facebook page to go with my book by the way this whole campaign is really I didn't elaborate I am to sell books no i don't think so i think they're cheaper and easier ways to sell boy but we've we've got a we've created a Facebook page for the campaign and I got to tell you it's vent it's an amazing it's an amazing political phenomenon we've now we're closing in on 20,000 likes or fans on our Facebook page and for me what I've seen and of course when I ran before it didn't exist it it's interesting politically for a couple of reasons one is you can interact with people it's like going door-to-door but you don't have to walk between the houses you know you can interact I spend an hour or so a night Mary would if she were here we'd say it was two hours at night just chatting with people you know people write in and ask a question and answer them and there's a connection made it's not as good as in person but it's still a real connection that's number one number two it allows you as a candidate to present yourself in a more human way than just as a guy behind a podium in a suit in other words you know the pictures with your kids and little movies of what's going on and one of the favorite postings we had as I was up in Aroostook County and giving a little report on you know what was going on and I'm standing by the road and and and young men Tyler Dunham is filming any and I'm saying and we've seen lots of potato fields and lots of great people and just that a huge truck went by and you could hear it room and my hair blows and lots of trucks you know and people loved it because it was just sort of real and you know not terribly stage not staged at all so I'm finding it an amazing way to to keep in touch with people and and I think as a as a senator it would be you know it would be a great great way to present present what's going on and you can do the you know it's so easy now to do a film Dora took a picture of matt and i walk again is it on facebook yeah yeah unfortunately I had my finger in my ear but other than that I wish to me that was but it's a it's a it's an amazing phenomenon and I think it's going to change its going to change politics because it's so it it so it reaches so many people and the final reason is that it's it's a personal endorsement if you think about it when you let's say you're going to buy a car and you watch all the TV ads you see an ad for Toyota and an ad for Honda and Edward Chevy and an ad for ford and you know that's information that you think about but then if you sit down at lunchtime and a guy sitting next to you says i just bought a Chevy Silverado and it's the best truck I ever bought that's going to have more weight than those ads on TV and facebook gives you that of an ability to have a kind of personal endorsement from people and i think that's that's one of the ways its most important it's i may be testing how important it is because starting you know in a few I don't know when a few days the people of Maine are going to get a thorough dosing of negative ads about me if you think Godzilla is ugly wait till you see where the way they make me look over the next level and Facebook is a way to be to be able to respond to that you know somebody spends a million dollars or three or whatever it is on on television so it's it's a way of communicating directly with people without necessarily having a filter well it occurs to me if we're going to fix the government we better run it on time and that starts with running this on time and we're out of it we've done it we've got it sir q thank you cool

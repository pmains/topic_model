mr. chairman tomorrow 24 hours from now exactly I'll be in a park in parkland it's it's the same Park that we gathered in one year ago when seventeen people were gunned down at Stoneman Douglas and I only ask that as we debate these issues that we make perfectly clear one thing this is not about whether this legislation is going to bring back any of the 17 beautiful lives that were taken on February 14th 2018 it won't it won't bring back it won't bring back the son of our colleague it won't bring back a single victim of gun violence anywhere in America in the history of our country not one but mr. chairman if this legislation prevents one person who wishes to do harm to others from getting a gun and because of that that person can't use the gun he doesn't have to kill even one person in our country then what we're doing here tonight at eight o'clock 24 hours before tomorrow's memorial service in parkland will be something that we can be proud of I just asked it tomorrow as everyone keeps these families in their thoughts that we not make this legislation about something that could have prevented what happened it happened it's now our responsibility to do everything we can to make sure that it never happens again I go back

our economics finance and investment to do what we love to do which is drive forward to international relations and of course politics of this nation it is a joy to do that often with people that just perhaps weren't weaned as politicians at 22 I think of french hill the great state of Arkansas and in the other building a senator from Louisiana Dr William Cassidy joins us Bill Cassidy here with all that you've done in gastroenterology and of course your lample political career as well I'm in the surveillance timeout chair Senator because I had french hill on the other day of Arkansas as we were having another mass shooting and I was remiss just in the swirl of surveillance of bringing this up is it not about Walmart or about any other institution of America but the challenge that we have from the distance of New York to Baton Rouge guns aren't the same in your Louisiana as they are in urban areas as well where is the Common Ground we have where we can we where's the Common Ground we can search to so you and Senator Schumer can come up with solutions to this horror so Tom the we've actually seen that common ground in the response to Vivaldi that tragic shooting in Texas we came together on a bipartisan basis in a way which protected second amendment rights for people who are law-abiding but at the same time made it easier to screen to prevent those who are non-law abiding who may have a reason not to receive a weapon from obtaining now that law is being implemented now but but I do think that that is one Place Baton Rouge and Manhattan meets but the issue here is the romance of another time and place like a Mossberg 36 and Ithaca 36 rather or a Marlin 22 Rifle the Technologies overtaken America these guys have these these military-like weapons as well how can we constrain their access to these technological weapons well so so you want to constrain the access of people who are prone to violence now it's not the random person I don't expect if you had a a such a weapon that you would be like going out and shooting people you wouldn't because that's not who you are there's kind of a profile of Those who commit these Mass Crimes by the way which sometimes are with handguns so we can't just are sometimes with cars typically it's a male 18 to 25 was a history of mental illness who's got some other marker of isolation oftentimes that mental illness has been recognized but has not been addressed now that's classic uh so in Vivaldi it was a young man who was troubled as an adolescent turns 18 the records are sealed and then he buys a weapon how do you and Senator Schumer find a common ground of the peace and Tranquility of saying Norway or Sweden how do we get to that edge with Republicans and Democrats well so Israel has one of the highest incidences of gun ownership in the war world and one of the lowest incidences of on personal and person sort of violence from Guns so it shows that ultimately it is the person who possesses the weapon who is most at risk going back to the avaldi legislation we gave courts the permission to unseal records of an adolescent gave them seven extra days to review those records to decide whether or not the person should right and that that to give a true life example of how that would have helped the shooting in South Carolina a young man walks into African-American church shoots multiple people there was a typo on his reform they had to issue it within three days if that it had extra time they would have seen the typo he couldn't have purchased the weapons it would have been invented this is a great debate I hope you and the Democrats can continue this debate forward in Washington let me turn to the reality of the future of your Republican party you are one of the leaders here in a complex debate as well how convoluted is path to the first November Tuesday of 2024. and so I think the what the the Republican elephant in the room that you're describing is how do Republicans address the fact that former president Trump has announced you know it's really interesting because if you look at what happened when President Trump was President um we lost first I think the house then the Senate then the presidency and then we've underperformed this last cycle and people have attributed that to president Trump's poor endorsements um you look at that and I see people who are strong supporters of the former president and they say we're about winning and so if we're going to be about winning we've got to do something different I think the more that kind of is understood in our party the Republican party wants to win and we've got to make those changes required to do that so I think that'll have an impact could you touch on this on the Twitter files of the weekend and the worries of tech platforms influencing elections in this country what did you make if that what we heard from Elon Musk um I think it is an appropriate concern that that that the tech industry is pushing Us in One Direction as a republican I see more of that influence pushing us to the left so I think what he's done is a nice corrective the American people can make their judgment whether or not the previous owners of Twitter were responsible or not um but he but he's trusting the American people to take this information to comprehend it and then to hopefully provide some transparency that may not have been there I applaud them for doing all this the senator you still have the former president responded to this about perhaps terminating part of the Constitution your thoughts on that well that's a fantasy and so it's just a fantasy it's just not going to happen and one because you know I love the Constitutional do too so it's not going to happen um um and and you can kind of say it it's a Hail Mary okay so I'm not doing well in other other regards so let me kind of toss that out there I just don't think it should be taken seriously you talk about winning though isn't this individual pretty well set to win the primaries I don't know that um that's kind of a common narrative but I find it in the polls down with Senator I I finally comment I find that political analysts and no offense often fight the last battle but I do think as I mentioned earlier people want to win in the Republican party and folks who are want to win or saying we need to go in a different direction you were kind enough to talk to us about something I wanted to talk about which is this gun war in America you want to talk about what we talk about every day here which is the dearth of investment in hydrocarbons how do we actually jump start investment to make a marginal barrel of hydrocarbons of energy and yet remain true to a climate change path there's multiple answers layers of answers to what you do because you got a minute and a half okay there has to be a better return on investment than there was during the pandemic clearly there's return on investment now there has to be a better regulatory environment in which yes you may give a permit to drill but now you've got to give the permission to build the pipeline to offload the hydrocarbon which is being produced thirdly you have to have concomitantly a strategy to reduce the carbon intensity the Europeans wish to have a lower carbon intense product and so if you can lower the carbon intensity you can address that the bipartisan structure bill made major investments in ccus to offload the carbon produced from oil and gas petrochemical Etc now if you do that you're going to be able to power our economy lower the cost for the homeowner but you're also going to create those jobs but also lower the carbon intensity you do that with permitting reform you've achieved it and we're going to be putting forward a bill that we think my office will that will achieve all these goals how what's the distance of independent oil production from Big Oil what's a dig mean and years ago Midland the Bush family and all that this was a delicious tension what is the tension between oil investment in business in Louisiana in the South I think of the good John Calvin and the Cowan family across the Gulf of Mexico what's the distance of them from Exxon well shoot so the people excellent is investing in offshore old oil wells in order to do ccus from from the the houstonship channel and off the coast of Louisiana so Exxon is making these major Investments oxy is trying to do uh direct air capture at the same time I'm not sure that The Independents are are where the the super majors are in terms of the CC us aspect of it but what we attempted to do with the bipartisan infrastructure bill is to make CC us achievable for the independence so that they can likewise lower their carbon intensity as they continue to produce the products that we need for a modern economy the center of this was great and thanks for being this in New York we appreciate it hey thank you good to be with you Bill Cassidy wide range against you that's I got about three questions for him on the doctor front but I guess we won't go there what does he'd like to bring up I'd like to just are vitamins efficacious like like you know the whole one a day like do I need a vitamin is 6 people in my house are telling me you know I would take a vitamin if I were you not knowing your diet except frankly excuse me you can lose a little weight okay in the control room is that in the highlight reel for 2022 from New York this is Bloomberg

a Carson a member of the permanent Select Committee on Intelligence is still with us the source of a lot of concern right now we're learning more about this in Lowell Ahmad Khan or raha me that he not only visited Afghanistan which is understandable as families from Afghanistan he was born in Afghanistan he's a naturalized US citizen but side trips he then made to Pakistan including one visit for almost a year in Pakistan so he comes back to the United States he has secondary interview is upon re-entry but no flags were raised the question is is that a problem it's something we should look into I mean it's not a crime to to to go to South Asia what is a problem is that you have individuals who feel disillusioned and they need someone to blame this is a tough time for law enforcement and I think the bravery that was shown by the undercover officer the other day exemplifies the need for us to support our law enforcement community they're working diligently along with the intelligence community and trying to make the connections necessary to rid ourselves of this growing terrorist threat the problem is he's we now know he spent almost a year in Pakistan including spending time in areas they're heavily controlled by the Taliban that would raise a lot of red flags at least to me if I were talking to him upon his return it should raid arrays mini flags but we can't jump to conclusions what is clear is that he is responsible for injuring numerous Americans and people like him have to be made an example out of and we're working very hard to do just that his friends and associates have told reporters told us that upon his return he seemed a different kind of person grew a beard seemed to become much more radicalized i guess nobody paid attention or at least enough attention to that a wolf as you know it's not a crime that have a beard no what is unfortunate is that when we start casting aspersions on particular groups IE Muslims Sikhs Hindus and others because of these incidences I think as human beings we tend to place people in boxes and that's unfortunate there are Muslims in our intelligence communities and law enforcement communities I was one of them were intelligent fusion center for Indiana Department of Homeland Security in and wanting to make America in the world a safer place but what it is clear is that Muslim leaders are finding themselves in a position of wanting to speak out in a way and historically you have a great distrust of the government but now's the time to push the administration's countering violent extremism strategy and say enough is enough based on all the information you're getting did he act alone is that the working assumption or were there others helping him helping them build these bombs helping him distribute these bombs where's this investigation as far as you know right now I'm not at liberty to talk about everything but but but but as we speak it seems to be that he is alone he was a lone wolf at as far as we know well do we know if he was inspired by a social media for example by Isis or some other radical group al-qaeda for example again the bomb that was put together is almost identical to a bomb that was outlined in al Qaeda's inspire magazine there were of course some deviations but law enforcement is looking into this matter right now very critically it's a very famous article in this- how to build a bomb our kitchen of your mom so unfortunate I know it's a horrible situation congressman we have more to discuss sir we're getting more breaking news we'll take a quick break we'll be right back

so joining me tonight on all of these big topics Senator Rand Paul who got into it a bit with dr. pouchy in the hearing today also joining me is our own britt hume also tonight congressman Tim Ryan here on the Democrats knew three trillion dollar relief bill and we continue our investigation into why we have lost so many of our nation's veterans took ovid 19 people who have survived so much succumbing to this virus we're gonna speak with a family tonight and they will share their chilling story with us in moments but first Kentucky Senator Rand Paul Senator Paul thank you very much good to have you with us tonight first of all a bit of breaking news as we came to air this evening that Judge Emmett Sullivan says that he's going to open up the decision about whether or not to drop charges against general Flynn two others who might want to comment on it so this process drags on it appears you know I've never heard of someone outside the government bringing charges against someone I think that the government made a big mistake bringing these charges against general Flynn we never should have been listening to his phone call and we shouldn't have been trying to entrap him into or create a crime they never thought he committed any crime they brought him in to try to create a crime and what a terrible travesty of justice and this needs to be done with I thought we were already done with it and I surely hope that we are going to finally be done with it but the ultimate thing for us and the legislature is we should not let these abuses of power happen again and I'm pushing hard to make sure that we take this power away from government so what about the unmasking do you think that it is right to let the American people know who decided to unmask general Flynn from those phone call transcripts absolutely and I don't believe any of this could have happened with President Obama I completely believe that not only did he know and others have already said that he knew about the conversation he knew about trying to go after general Flynn and it was being directed from the White House so I have every expectation that President Obama's in the middle of this but I think it's worse I think you go back to operation crossfire hurricane the whole fake dossier and all the stuff all FISA warrants that were I think improperly and illegally gotten started on the Trump campaign I really strongly believe that President Obama gave specific and direct oversight and direct permission for this think about it we have never allowed a secret court to be used against the presidential cat campaign don't you think that was sensitive enough that it went all the way to the very top so yeah the media have treated President Obama with kid gloves someone needs to ask him directly did you approve a process of operation crossfire hurricane I think the answer is yes so you know I mean to put the shoe on the other foot a lot of these do you have evidence of that you say you're sure that the president the former president was involved in this why are you so sure well we'll find out I'm hoping that a lot of this will be declassified but I have a strong feeling that this was such a sensitive subject he's already admitted or admitted through people that worked for him that the Flyn investigation he knew a lot about and they were asking him his permission on the way out Obama officials were all bragging oh we're gonna save the Republic from this guy Donald Trump by you know sending out information to all the intelligence communities about him and his involvement with Russia they either truly believed it maybe but I think it was directed by President Obama I think that's what we're gonna discover that's one of the questions of course the motivation of all of these individuals they seem in many ways to have you know 100 percent believed that what they were pursuing was actually happening and one thing that we don't know yet is whether it was sort of groupthink that reinforced all those notions or whether or not you know that they were they were basing it on something else there's no evidence that we've seen in these transcripts so far just one other thought on this in two senators senator Graham and Senator Cornyn came out today and said that they don't think it's it's the it's Congress's role to pursue what President Obama knew about this they're gonna they're happy to leave that in the hands of the German vestigation do you agree with your colleagues on that well I'm one of those who doubts centralization of power in the intelligence community so there's two ways you can go after this you could investigate whether president what President Obama knew and when did he know it but you could also say we need to take this power so we're having this big debate over the FISA Court which is supposed to be foreign intelligence court but was used against the Trump campaign I have an amendment that would take Americans out of it I don't think it's constitutional to invest Americans particularly American campaigns with a secret court I think it uses a less than constitutional standard so one way I will go about trying to get the truth and to get justice and to try to make this right is to try to prevent it from ever happening again and I think if my amendment passes no president will ever be investigated my thighs again but I fear that some of the people who don't want to investigate President Obama are also the same people Lindsey Graham who don't want to have real FISA reform because they love the power of the intelligence community to snoop on anyone including Americans well well that's interesting well we'll get his response to that at some point and let him answer to that it's an interesting point so with regard to what happened today and the hearings with the top officials on the corona virus task force here's the exchange between you and dr. pouchy that that got a lot of attention today watch this I think the one size fits all that we're gonna have a national strategy and nobody's gonna go to school is kind of ridiculous we really ought to be doing at school district by school district and as much as I respect you dr. Falchi I don't think you're the end-all I don't think you're the one person that gets to make a decision we have never made myself out to be the end-all and only voice of this I'm a scientist a physician and a public health official I give advice according to the best scientific evidence yeah I want to ask you about the school thing but you know you you said that was you know pointed to say to him you know I don't think you're the end-all do you think he's gotten puffed up or has too much attention or we're leaning on him too much you know I don't question dr. fauci's motives I think he's a good person I think he wants what's best for the country but he's an extremely cautious person and I don't think any of these experts are omniscient I think that they have a basis of knowledge but when you prognosticate about the future and when you advocate for things dramatic and drastic like closing all the schools you should look at all the information so the real question ask him was are you aware of the mortality among children and he is but the mortality is exceedingly low close to zero in the age group 0 to 18 very very low so should we say all of these kids 0 to 18 don't go to school even though their mortality so low no I think we ought to make that part of our decision-making process but we really need to have competition among the experts because we had experts particularly that guy Ferguson over in England say it's gonna be 2 million best case a million well this guy got everything wrong for the last couple of decades he predicted mad cow disease would kill 136 thousand and 177 people died so we have to take with a grain of salt these experts and their prognostications the future is very uncertain but turning down and closing the entire economy has been devastating that's a fact yeah that is the debate of our moment Senator Rand Paul thank you good to see you tonight thank you

mr deutsche florida thank you madam chairman there has been a lot of attention on capitol hill paid to the so-called palestinian martyr payments and we all abhor this practice of incentivizing and rewarding terrorism certainly does nothing to advance the prospects for peace that we all desire i have raised this issue directly with palestinian authority leaders on multiple occasions it has been on the agenda for president trump and his advisors in their meetings with president abbas and other palestinian officials yesterday the senate foreign relations committee held a hearing on the taylor force act the legislation in its current form would borrow aid from all west bank and gaza programs until a certification could be made that these payments have ceased now is clearly the time for action there is momentum in congress and in the administration and many of our allies around the world have joined into crying these payments the witnesses at yesterday's hearing offered a number of suggestions suggested revisions to the legislation that would ensure that we maintain israel's security such as withholding pa debt payments or setting aside the money as incentive for the pa to retrieve it once changes to the practice are made does the department have a view on these potential paths forward so that the united states congress can move ahead with the taylor force act and finally move on legislation aimed at stopping these payments to terrorists thank you congressman and also thank you for your kind words and i've appreciated your visits to my uh to my various embassies and very much appreciate your friendship of course the administration shares congress's commitment to ending the programs that incentivize acts of terrorism president trump has discussed this issue directly with president abbas emphasizing the need to make significant progress on this issue uh and it's in fact we have seen some progress for the first time in the 52 years of the palestinians prisoner payment program the palestinian authority cut funding to 277 hamas-affiliated former prisoners last month now that's not sufficient none of us think that's sufficient but it is a step forward we know they have to do more it is not clear that the taylor force act as currently drafted would help accomplish the objectives that are needed um but we but i agree with you that the hearing yesterday was very constructive some interesting ideas proposed the administration has not yet taken a position on those proposals all right i am i appreciate that i i would urge the administration to to look closely at some of those proposals to see if there's a a way that we can move forward on this quickly

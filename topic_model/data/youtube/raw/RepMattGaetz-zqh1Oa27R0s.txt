as I deliver these remarks the people of Venezuela are without food water medicine and now even electricity and the organizing principle of American policy seems to be the need to drive Maduro from power what if Maduro is not really in power right now what if the people that are really calling the shots in Venezuela are a group of transnational criminal organizations that merely maintain Maduro as a figurehead and what if their entire purpose is to draw the United States into an ill-advised war to create a massive migration of people throughout Latin America eroding borders jeopardizing nation-states and ultimately leading to a permissive environment for more illicit activity to occur these are important questions we have to ask my constituents have to go to Central and South America and fight these wars and certainly as a Congress we need to be very critical in our thinking to not get our nation in another ill-advised war

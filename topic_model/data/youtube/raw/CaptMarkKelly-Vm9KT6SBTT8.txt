most people just think it's an adult on the phone i'm not people have no idea that a 13 year old with autism is calling them my name is tess this is my husband christian and this has been and we all live here in phoenix arizona after the 2016 presidential election is probably when i became interested in politics because i saw the spread of misinformation and how important issues such as health care and the environment are i have a biden's poster and i voted sticker and the sign representing all the things i care about and what my values are i volunteer with mission for arizona of both my parents uh volunteering with vin you know we've made it kind of a family affair uh christian gets on there vin gets on there and i get on there and um you know we sit at the kitchen table and we just start making calls vin is great you know he loves to engage himself on all the issues and it's great that he wants to put in the work of actually connecting the issues with the people that are affected by the issues i don't know if i would be phone banking if it wasn't for him it has helped me with having conversations on the phone and having civil conversations with people i think it has helped me but at the same time it can stress me out occasionally and we will have to take breaks i do have some issues with my autism but i am working on it with the support from my parents and my family vin was diagnosed when he was about two and a half years old tess really is the one who has done the most work in educating herself and educating the family and engaging the family on what to do what are the best therapies and what are the best ways to engage insurance so when i went to work i chose my companies very specifically in order to make sure vin was covered i turned down jobs because they didn't have the insurance that i needed i don't i don't think anybody should have to go through that science data facts mark kelly would be a strong voice for arizona if mark gets into office i expect to have someone that represents arizona more like john mccain not a green light to the president but really looking at what the people of arizona need and want and and and being our representative he knows what it means to serve and i know he knows what it means to lead and i know that he's had experience with a lot of critical things in his his career and i know that he'll do a great job we're doing a lot of phone calls and we want to get involved in other ways to get more people to vote it's really the vote of our lifetime i do think that just because you have a disability it doesn't mean you can't volunteer we need everybody out there because we know we welcome everybody

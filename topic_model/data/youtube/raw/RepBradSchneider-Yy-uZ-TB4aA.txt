in Washington and joining me now is congressman Brad Schneider a Democrat from Illinois congressman appreciate your taking time to chat with me let me just start by getting your reaction the impeachment proceedings will be in your hands next week for a vote Republicans of course say this whole thing is a sham it's a circus Democrats have nothing on the president where do you stand Paul well thanks it's good to be with you you're right the Judiciary Committee today is voting on impeachment within the committee it's supposed to come to the floor next week I will look at the final articles once they're out of the Judiciary Committee what we all know and there are facts that are not in dispute is that the president asked the president of Ukraine prison United States has president pain to intervene within a US election he used congressionally authorized taxpayer-funded military aid for Ukraine as a vehicle to apply pressure as well as a White House visit the questions that are in front of us will be in front of us next week is to the extent that he is threatening our elections the integrity of our elections putting his own personal interests ahead of our national security foreign policy interests and his refusal to cooperate with the US Congress will he be held in contempt of Congress those are articles that should come next week I expect it will pass through the house and then the president will have his day in court he will have a defense team there will be prosecutors from the house and the Senators and service jurors but that's how I see this process about to proceed now of course Republicans say Congress can't walk and chew gum at the same time you can't do anything except this impeachment that's not true because just today you all passed the Elijah Cummings lower drug cost now Act you were a sponsor devil parts of that so first of all congratulations on getting it through and let me ask you about some of those provisions such as the one involving existing conditions yeah this is a big deal so people who have the Medigap coverage if they are under the age of 65 or have Medicare Advantage they could be underwritten for pre-existing conditions they didn't have the same access that folks for example under the Affordable Care Act in the private market have what we passed today with my legislation is a part of it would ensure that these people can get that coverage even if they have a pre-existing condition so they can get the insurance coverage they need access to the medicines they deserve but more broadly with the the bill we passed today the Elijah Cummings lower drug costs now Act does this would allow the Secretary of HHS to negotiate drug prices with the pharmaceutical manufacturers not just within Medicare but those are then be applied those prices would be applied to the private market and it caps the out-of-pocket for seniors at $2,000 these are examples of big steps forward to try to bring down the cost of health care for Americans you also a sponsor provision regarding getting lower-income people more help and also capping the amount of out-of-pocket to $2,000 so let me have you address that as well but I also want to address one of the things because the Trump administration now is fighting in court to have pre-existing conditions as a protected coverage be found to be unconstitutional would that impact you at all well we have to follow what's happening in the court that is a separate path but within the legislation first the Affordable Care Act in the private market said that you cannot be not precluded from getting insurance because of pre-existing conditions that was a big step forward and I think all Americans appreciate that provision we've extended that now to seniors with Medicare Advantage coverage that's part of the progress we've made but also as I mentioned there's the cap of $2,000 the other piece is providing assistance to seniors that low-income seniors to buy into insurance plans that they can't afford and making sure again our goal is that every American regardless of age regardless of income regardless if they live in a city or out in the country everyone in this country should have quality affordable care from doctors they trust when they need it where they are did this get through on a bipartisan basis meaning the Senate might give it some consideration or was it primarily Democrats meaning Mitch McConnell will let it sit well we had two Republicans join us so it is a bipartisan bill we have seen Mitch McConnell let a lot of stuff said so far this year in 2019 this Congress has passed more than 400 bills two-thirds of those bills are bipartisan they have Republican and Democratic support and Mitch McConnell refuses to allow them to go forward the example I was talking about it this afternoon with a group of people that I like to focus on secure act which would help small businesses provide their employees retirement plans it passed the house 417 2/3 that's bipartisan by any measure the Senate should be passing at least considering these bills as I said 400 bills 275 bipartisan they may pass or fail in the Senate but let the Senate have the debate vote on them and what we agree on let's send that to the President to become law so it looks like the u.s. MCA or NAFTA - or some call it will will make its way out of the house a couple of questions about that number one the president of course he will take it incredible victory March when that thing gets through and that thing passes but at the same time Nancy Pelosi made it clear that the Democrats cleaned the White House's clock and I think that's a quote from her on provisions involving the environment and labor and such so who is the real winner when that thing goes through I think the answer the question of who is the real winner is easy the American people are the winner here and it's not a matter NAFTA wandering attitude the original inapt agreement is 25 years old was out of date needed fixes what the president presented to us did not have enough provisions for labor protections for environmental protections and in particular for enforcement I think what we got over the past number of months working with the president's trade ambassador ambassador light Heiser who's been wonderful to work with with our folks in the house is a much better deal for the American people this is for US companies it's win for us workers its win for the American economy and so win for the North American continent and so it shouldn't be keeping score this side or that side Republican Democrat house or president what are we doing to make sure we're moving things forward for the American people and that's what we're focused on it's being suggested that the impeachment vote in the house might be like Tuesday of next week maybe Wednesday and that speaker Pelosi does not want that to be the last thing you guys do before you leave so you can come home and talk about other things you accomplished is is that the timing that you're hearing because others have said oh no the impeachment votes the last thing they'll do at the end of the week what are you hearing I've heard a number of things look none of us ran for office to vote on impeachment this is something that I take very seriously what I want to go home and talk about after this week is over next week and all throughout next year is the things we're doing to help the American people things to grow our economy to create more jobs to make it easier for people to get the education they need to succeed to make it better possibilities for seniors to retire with dignity and security those are the things that we are working on in this Congress that's what I want to be talking about so I don't know what the timing is it could be Tuesday Wednesday or Thursday we have a lot of other bills that we have to focus on in particular I'm hoping that we'll have a vote on the assault bill that passed Ways and Means Committee this week with my help we've been working all year to try to give relief on the cap on the salt deduction it passed the how the Ways and Means Committee yesterday and we should be voting on that next week as well yeah I was going to talk to you about that that repeals that the state and local tax provisions for 20 and 21 2021 and 2020 right it's a temporary band-aid right okay so it the first thing it does in 2019 so for the current tax year is it eliminates the marriage penalty right now with the cap it's $10,000 for a single filer or a married couple this would for 2019 raise that to $20,000 for a couple and then in 2020 and 2021 it would eliminate the cap and the hope is that by the time we get to 2021 and into the following years we can get to the real real tax reform that we need not what passed in 2017 which was a tax cut that is leaving us with a two trillion dollar deficit all right good luck on that you have a lot of blue state people be happy about that finally I have to ask you yeah I've got to ask you the president of course it now seems to be declaring Judaism as a nationality and not as a religion his point is to allow more free speech on campuses and I'm telling you as I search the social world social Internet man it everything's all over there are Jewish people who just say he's the biggest supporter of Israel ever and there's those who say this is a step away from Nazi Germany I mean literally those two perspectives your Judaism is important to you where do you stand on this well and I speak to this as a Jew but also as a representative of the 10th district in a member of the US House of Representatives anti-semitism is a growing problem we see it just this week with the shooting in New Jersey we've had the shooting in Pittsburgh the shooting in California anti-semitism is rising in our country it's rising throughout the world we need to address it I think previous presidents have have used the legislation and said that we're going to treat religious groups ethnic groups under this title 6 categorization as that groups of national origin we need to fight prejudice and anti-semitism everywhere where we can at the same time we need to do it in a way that brings people together the the president has a pattern or a strategy of dividing people we need to unite people the president has a record of using anti-semitic tropes he did just the weekend before last at a speech in Florida I may be in last weekend I don't care if it's from the left or from the right anti-semitism is evil we need to fight against it hate is hate whether it's directed towards Jews Latinos African Americans people of different sexual orientation we are a country that has always said that we are going to lift people up that all people are created equal I believe that too Michael

we need to get rid of betsy devos i've just had it we need a secretary of education who's going to work with teachers and with states and with districts to try to develop reopening plans that actually work and that are based in science instead we've got a secretary of education who's trying to use this pandemic to pull money out of public education and to put it elsewhere to put it into private education i believe that public dollars should stay in public schools and until we get rid of betsy devos we are going to have a problem at the federal level with helping our states and helping our local communities with their schools as much as we need and that is why the election november 3rd is so important it's about donald trump you bet it is but it is also about betsy devos it is about our children it is about our schools it is about our future our kids are our future and playing politics with them saying that uh betsy devos wants to take away money donald trump wants to take away money from our schools unless they do what he wants to do for political reasons regardless of what our medical professionals are telling us that undermines fundamentally the values we live as a people and that is not only to try to take care of each other but most of all to take care of our children in future generations so this one is really important but there are paths for how we can do this we just we just have to be willing to step up and fight the fight to get it done and the next step will happen in congress with this next response to the corona virus and i think we we at least have a chance of getting what we need in there and i hope we can get this done quickly so people can start making plans around school for this fall

Liz alright let's continue our conversation and bring in North Dakota Senator John Hoeven thank you so much for joining us sir good to be with you I want to get your reaction first and foremost we heard your colleague there Senator Lindsey Graham say that Lino lifting sanctions is off the table so it wasn't necessarily responding to this new report but what is is your response and also the fact that we're hearing you know he was trying to make nice with with Vice President Mike Pence after perhaps giving him false information you know looking forward I just want want to hear your input I think the key is we have to find out what happened and as I recalled president Trump said before leaving for Florida that he was going to check into an investigate exactly what had happened what was said both by his security adviser Flynn to the Russian ambassador and then also the conversation with the vice president so I mean first the first step is to find out you know what was discussed before there was something inappropriate if they were talking talking anything about sanctions then what so it it depends what it was what was the discussion but I think the concern that you're seeing from some of the Republican members in the Senate is that we have to take a strong line with Russia they interfered with our election Putin is an adversary we have to be clear-eyed about you know what he's doing and we have to stand up to him and I think that's that's where some of the Republican senators are coming from is we need to have a very strong position in terms of standing up to Vladimir Putin okay I want to shift topics here because there's a couple things I want to talk about with you since you are here obviously another big a big headline was the fact that we may be seeing a new executive order from a president Trump come down as early as Monday when it comes to possible travel bans I want to get your reaction do you want to see a new executive order or do you want to see the one in place challenge do you want to see that go to court well the advantage of a new executive order is you could address some of the shortfalls that or problems that occurred with the initial executive order even the Secretary of Homeland Security General Kelly came out said look this could have been rolled out better and there are some things that should need to be addressed like legal permanent residents so forth that's something that could be addressed in a new executive order well still making sure that we're doing the vetting that needs to be done to keep America safe there's some things that won't change so for example that weren't chair at the challenge the limit on how many refugees can come into the country it was brought down if I'm not mistaken by quite quite a large number is that parts like that you do want to see that stay in place correct well I think what we want to see happen and that serves everybody in America it's about keeping America safe is making sure we can vet anyone that's coming to our country that's the key getting it right doing it within the law not having any kind of religious test but making sure that we can and do that people that come to our country not a not a slow day in the office for you I do want to bring up one more topic to next week we could be seeing perhaps the confirmation hearing for students even mentioned as he goes ahead as a Treasury secretary what's going on behind the scenes because we see so we saw some of the Democrats sitting out of a boycotting his committee hearing last week what's taking place well what happened with the Finance Committee was that the Democrats did not show up to the committee meeting to have the vote I mean they had every opportunity to come and to have a vote but it's part of a delaying process they didn't show up so the committee went ahead and voted him out so he was on the floor this past week he I think got 53 votes I expect he will again and be approved on my week and we foresee a very contentious Monday I don't think so I think it's pretty well cut and dried now we will approve minuchin and then we'll go on to dr. Shulkin the head of the VA we need to get get these people approved and into these positions because remember it's about getting the work done for the Americans I think that's one of my final question you have a lot of people at home who are who are frustrated at the pace that this is moving along what message can you tell them you know are the are the intentions good and there's just a there they're going through all that the the proper you know ways of just slowing down the process I'm sort of that's it look it's about getting the work done that moves our country forward so we've got to find some bipartisanship here and get to work on these important issues whether it's repealing and replacing Obamacare tax reform reducing the regulatory burden all these things are that really make a difference for our country we have a lot on your schedule sir we do and think we thank you for joining us on a Saturday we appreciate it thank you myself

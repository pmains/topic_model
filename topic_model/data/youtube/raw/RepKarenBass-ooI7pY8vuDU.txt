congresswoman karen bass who wrote the house's police reform legislation we got lots of questions on that including this one from natalya she's an 11 year old viewer from l.a after her father actually died in gun violence she became a young activist she's a supporter of your bill here's her question about police reform hello representative karen bass my name is natalie jackson now it is very clear and obvious that there is an issue in american policing what can we do to combat racism from policing and the criminal justice system thank you she's a remarkable young woman um but but to her point we know that this this bill has passed the house this was your bill on thursday the democrats stopped another bill going forward in the senate that was republican tim scott put forward where are we at and are we actually going to see something happen because so often in politics there's all this energy all this movement and then all of a sudden you know people focus on something else exactly exactly and there's always the danger for that but first of all that's a very impressive young lady and to ask such a powerful question i want her to know that i hope she gets involved as a student i hope she gets involved on her campus maybe even running for student council because you're never too young to get involved but let me just say that um the bill that the that was defeated in the senate mimicked a lot of parts of our bill but it didn't have the enforcement it didn't have the teeth and what i feel very passionately is with the hundreds of thousands of people who have been protesting in every state in the country in many countries around the world this is not the time for us to do police reform light this is the time for transformative change so it is part of the process as they say here in washington it's how the sausage is made it's what happens uh behind the scenes so we passed our bill we sent it over to the senate they had their bill their bill failed what we're going to do in the meantime is try to bring as much pressure as possible on the senate to take up our bill now in the meantime we're all talking a number of my republican colleagues came up to me throughout the debate and talked about how they liked different parts of the bill but they couldn't quite get there to vote for it but you know what we did get republican votes we had three republicans to vote that's no small matter because the president tweeted and typically what happens is if the president tweets and instructs the republicans to vote or not vote lockstep 100 that's what they do so the fact that three of them peeled off the fact that all of the democrats voted for the bill and that's no small matter either because before george floyd you would have not had a hundred percent of the democrats voting for a bill like this what it is in what it indicates is a seismic shift in our country in terms of people's consciousness around policing before when there was a murder even if there was a murder on videotape you would do polling and polls would say black people think this way white people think this way and it was a polar opposite what has happened now is 70 percent of white america believes there is a fundamental structural problem with policing in america and in my life i've been involved in this issue for decades this is the first time i have ever seen that happen and you've been working on this for for 47 years you were at the george floyd memorial you talked with the george floyd family and told them that you were going to get this done so what is the red line for you in the negotiation the thing that you and democrats absolutely have to have in that bill in order to pass it you know to say it in general terms it would be enforcement so in other words i don't want to do legislation where there's no way to know whether you've had a dis a difference so there's a lot of different pieces to it but if you ask me for what's the common thread is enforcement making sure that something sticks otherwise it's window dressing now i want you to know that i'm talking to my republican colleagues i was over talking to senator scott today and sometimes after you go through the process of doing the bill voting for the bill then you begin talking so i don't say that nothing is going to happen i'm still still very hopeful that we're going to get a bill on the president's desk and if we have enough republican support the president will sign it

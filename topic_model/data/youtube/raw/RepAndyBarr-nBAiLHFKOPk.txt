former secretary of state mike pompeo slamming john kerry as new calls from republicans for kerry to testify under oath kerry says that accusations that he fed information to iranian foreign minister muhammad javad sharif are false the current secretary of state anthony blinken calls the accusations utter nonsense so i want to bring in representative andy barr on this nonsense he's on the foreign affairs committee you can you also led a letter uh to kerry pushing back on the administration's plans to force banks to meet climate goals so first of all i want to get your reaction uh on this accusation and now that we've heard from kerry from the secretary of state and others what's your reaction to this well we've known for some times edward that john kerry is more interested in appeasing iran the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism uh more interested in appeasing iran than standing up for our most important strategic ally in the region israel we know that because he was the architect of the flawed iran nuclear deal but if these revelations are true that john kerry disclosed sensitive information about attacks on iranian assets in syria then it's an outright betrayal of our ally israel israel which is a force of good uh an island of stability and moderation and democracy and freedom in the middle east so so if you have the administration circling the wagon so to speak how do we come and figure out if this is actually true well that's what this letter is about edward we're calling for an impartial investigation we we want an investigation the american people deserve an investigation we want to also know what the state department knew about john kerry's relationship with mr zarif the foreign minister of iran and we want to know when the state department knew it and this is not a simple matter of shadow diplomacy again this is a betrayal of not only u.s national security interests but also the interests of our key allies and you know john kerry is currently a member of the national security council he's not just the special envoy on climate he is a member of the national security council he has a special responsibility uh to advocate for the security interests of the united states and our most important allies in the region and um if this investigation reveals that in fact he was working against the interests of the united states undermining actively undermining the previous administration in our efforts to restore and re um and re reinitiate some level of deterrence against the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism then he should have his security clearance revoked are you among the voices calling that he should testify under oath about this absolutely i can't think of anything more important and remember um it would only be consistent with what democrats were calling for in the previous administration no they accused michael flynn of a shadow diplomacy that undermined u.s interests this is this should be no different it should there should be no double standard and and here we know that john kerry is admitting that he at least twice met with mr zarif at the same time that the trump administration was attempting to re-establish some level of deterrence by withdrawing from this flawed joint comprehensive plan of action the so-called iran nuclear deal and i think here what you see here is john kerry putting his personal ego and his defense of the flawed agreement that he put together ahead of u.s national security and certainly ahead of the the interest in the security of uh our ally israel and that leads me to my next question in the last minute or so you know clearly former president trump's actions against iran had an impact on iran itself it was hitting the iranian military hard where do we go from here given all of this new information out well i co-sponsored the maximum pressure act uh we need to uh keep with the policies that were working the policies of the previous administration um sanctions putting maximum pressure it was working how do we know it was working because unlike during the obama administration and under the iran nuclear deal where there was an acceleration of ballistic missile testing where there was an acceleration of funding and cash going to terrorist proxies hezbollah assad and the houthis in yemen unlike all of that destabilizing activity that was happening with the sanctions relief the avalanche of cash that was flowing to tehran when when president trump reversed course and placed maximum pressure iran's uh foreign currency reserves declined by 95 military spending in iran declined by 25 and foreign terrorists that were supported by iran their salaries were cut in half and so uh the maximum pressure campaign was working we need to go back to that and we certainly should not re-enter the flawed iran nuclear deal that emboldened uh this uh this state-sponsored terrorism and further destabilize the region yeah this is an issue we will be following congressman i really appreciate it congresswoman and congressman andy barr thank you very much for your time thank you so still

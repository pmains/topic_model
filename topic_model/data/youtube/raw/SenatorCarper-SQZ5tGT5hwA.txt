thank you uh thank you both uh good to see you thanks for uh for joining us today tell me where you're from both of you i'm from rolling fort mississippi i would have guessed boston but okay and and how about you sir pardon sir yeah where are you from um alaska top of the world this part north issue can go in the united states okay who would you say is your favorite senator senator who's your favorite u.s senator from alaska you got a couple of good ones you had a couple of good ones well let me just say to uh our chair and uh and ranking member thanks for for convening this uh this hearing today and and we thank both of you for uh for joining us i think we have a couple of other witnesses apparently you're going to come as well today i believe is the first senate environment public works committee hearing in almost 15 years on the subject of environmental justice first one and the first since the subcommittee has been renamed to include the awards environmental justice and but as we all know this topic and the need for government to address it is far from new for decades minority communities and low-income americans have sheltered much of the burden from pollution and other environmental problems that impact our nation it's often hard to illustrate the enormity of a problem such as this but there's one statistic one statistic that stands out in my mind and that's a report last year that found that 70 percent of the nation's most environmentally contaminated sites are located within just one mile of federally assisted housing think about that 70 of our nation's most contaminated sites are all located within one mile of federally assisted housing that's just uh one drop in the bucket one funding of myriad mart uh that all paint the same picture crystal clear we're long overdue for a reckoning here so when we say environmental justice is not a buzzword or talking about environmental justice means that we have a moral obligation to put justice and fairness at the forefront of all the work that we do i talk when i talk about environmental justice i say it's another way of saying golden rule treat other people where we want to be treated well this has to be a top priority for all of us democrats republicans independents i could speak for myself to say that's certainly the case as i approach i work on this committee from which i'm privileged to to chair and through the environmental justice caucus which i co-founded with our colleagues senator duckworth and senator booker so i'm pleased that our committee is leading by example in april our committee-led senate passage of the bipartisan drinking water and wastewater infrastructure act by margin of 89 to two we don't do many things around here by 80 92 but it's a huge huge vote and our legislation makes overdue investments in our nation's water infrastructure so that our most vulnerable communities would have access to reliable clean water and the means to pay for it one part of our bill that i'm especially proud of 40 of the funds in the legislation are designated to go to underserved rural and tribal communities including communities in alaska this funding will be crucial in helping disadvantaged communities make necessary upgrades and to ensure families access to clean water and healthier brighter future for for their kids and with measures like this we can start to do right by our neighbors and help those most in need whether they're neighbors around the street around the block across the town and another community or the county but those are our neighbors too through the american rescue plan we need to set aside 50 million dollars for environmental justice grants at we also set aside some 50 million dollars for environmental justice grants at the apa and another 50 million to improve air quality monitoring for our communities most threatened by dangerous air pollutants now as this body is in the final final uh sprint working on expansive legislation to invest in our nation's infrastructure and economy we must keep our focus on this core principle of fairness to fulfill the moral obligation to left those in greatest need and pursue justice in all that we do this is especially true when it comes to providing nurturing environment so critical to livelihoods and prospects for generations to come we must make sure that we're working to create a better future for all of our neighbors whether to live again in our community or in some other community or across across the town but that's why i'm pleased we're having this hearing and discussion that explorers is an important issue we thank you for coming today now a long wind up for a short question your testimony you mentioned that you wrote a book about how rural communities have traditionally been denied access to sustainable and resilient infrastructure with natural disasters and extreme weather events on the rise investing in these communities as well as other communities that have suffered from historic disinvestment will become even more important here's the question how can the federal government help environmental justice communities prepare for climate change and its effect is this for senator is this for uh miss flowers this is for ms flowers ms flowers is online well thank you thank you thank you for that question uh i think the way the federal government could could help environmental justice communities uh adjust to climate change is to pass the american jobs plan i think that it is a start and making sure that 40 of those investments are going to those communities that are front line communities that are most overburdened and i think we've seen some examples of that today uh with with the other witnesses so i support that effort i was just in a community where people are dealing with raw sewage running into their homes for over 20 years and and but i think this is the first time that i've heard since i've been doing this work and effort to try to address this in in all of america but certainly in rural communities yeah i understand thank you for that that for that uh responsibilities i can i just mention the question for the record and i'll ask our uh or what is this just to respond for the record but the question would be please tell us more this is for mr uh polito ms polito um here's a question please tell us more about how threats to water access impact environmental justice communities especially those in rural areas and how does this threat compare to the threats from cumulative pollution releases that you mentioned in your testimony that's my my question and we'll just ask you to respond to the question for the record again our thanks to all of you for testifying today and then holding this hearing and let me participate thank you very much

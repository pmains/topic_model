thank the gentleman Mr Speaker I rise in opposition to this irresponsible bill that would effectively block the settlement of Syrian refugees in the United States for years the shocking and tragic events in Paris have touched people all over the world and strengthen our resolve to defeat the terrorists who are responsible responsible for these heinous acts and for bombing a Russian airliner and carrying out deadly bombings in Beirut but defeating terrorism should not mean slamming the door in the faces of those who are fleeing the terrorists that is why I am appalled by the actions of this house and buy some of the words of my colleagues today the United States has been has always been and should always be a place of refuge remember the Syrian refugees are running away from Isis they are running away from war and terror they are its victims to stop thousands of desperate people who are fleeing unspeakable violence is unconscionable we might as well take down the statute of liberty statue of liberty countries with much smaller populations like Lebanon and Turkey have agreed to take a million refugees or more even France just announced they're increasing the number of Syrian refugees they're accepting we in the United States are talking about a mere 10,000 these refugees are subject to an extensive vetting process which can take up to 24 months but the real danger America faces is that Isis through its propaganda can radicalize people already here and inspire them to attack the United States from within in Paris we saw that several of the attackers were European nationals who could enter the US without being vetted so it is ridiculous to assert that by denying access to refugees we would be making America safer we face a choice that will echo through history in 1924 a racist xenophobic anti-semitic Congress passed legislation slamming the door shut on Jewish and Italian in Greek and Eastern European immigrants the Almanac of American politics said that if it weren't for the 1924 integration act perhaps two million of the six million Jews who were murdered in the Holocaust would have been living safely in the United States instead back then we shut our doors to people in desperate need we must not do so again we must not let ourselves be guided by irrational fear we have a moral obligation and for those who care a religious obligation to extend the hand to the as you need i urge my colleagues to oppose this bill and I yield back the balance of my time gentleman from New York it yields back

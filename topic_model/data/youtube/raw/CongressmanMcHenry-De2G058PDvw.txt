mchenry the chair of our oversight investigation subcommittee director cordray to follow the chairman's opening line of questions about your building renovation now would you provide the committee with the um occupancy agreement between the bureau and the occ uh i don't know that there would be any reason why we could not provide that and i'd be surprised if we haven't provided it but i don't know offhand it we have you haven't so so if you would that would be helpful for us to understand this yeah that was an agreement signed before i became director but it's what we're going to do even easier in the next 30 years so even easier since it's a 20-year contract that you've disclosed in your report now the reason why we ask this is because you you spend 12 million dollars a year in rent you disclose that and we appreciate the fact you disclose that we also know from a treasury audit that the value of the building that you're occupying is 153.7 million dollars as of 2011. and yet you're spending first we find out 55 million dollars based on your disclosures then 95 then 150 so it looks very odd to us and that's why we would like to know the details of this don't you think that's reasonable i do think that's right okay yes thank you and look um so then you said today that you'll actually have to move out of this building that you're leasing you don't own but you're leasing and and you're going to have to find temporary space yeah it's it's a very annoying problem for us and it hasn't made anybody happy including that it does it but you know you think about the cost of it and it seems a little insane that you're spending 150 million dollars of taxpayer money and spending 12 million dollars in rent and you're not even going to be in it look uh there's much that i'm unhappy with about this situation it's a it's a building that's a deteriorated building uh it's a classic cold white elephant it's going to cost a fair amount of money to bring it back standard it's not that old yeah it must have been used pretty heavily i mean it was yeah building places for the 60s i think yeah but this place was you know kenny laid the cornerstone on this little building yeah a little heavily used here too so anyway if i were a consumer i would be complaining a lot about the building uh i owned it you'd provide us with the details of this temporary arrangement for space and what it's going to cost i think it would just as you've seen not today but as you've seen our budget uh and spending has become more and more transparent as we build up this agency all of that is available on our website each quarter and let me let me follow up on that i wrote you a letter beginning of the month i appreciate you responding in a timely manner you provided back and my my question and i know you receive letters a few and i understand that uh my my letter request was about the details of your budget you responded back with some links on your website and i appreciate that one was a newly issued report on your financials for the year what i asked was the resource detail and operating levels detail within your budget now the report you sent me a link to um i went to it looked at it and the level of detail there is is fairly non-specific i'll give you an example so what i'm asking for is a line item uh structure of this and you have a 166 million dollar line item that has three lines of description in order to add up to 166 million dollars and and it has a great name prevent financial harm to consumers while promoting good practices that benefit them i don't know that we oppose that idea we just like to know what that is now your bureau has also done something i think is proper you disclose contracts so we're able to ask you about contracts right so i know that you spent two and a half million dollars to pay for web ads to drive traffic to your website i know that and i know who you contracted with well-known firms now i also know whether it's a no-bid contract a bid contract right yeah and i appreciate that being that we've done it you know real emphasis on competition in our contract and i appreciate that i also see the no bid contracts and we could have questions about it now as a policy maker you're also spending a substantial amount in salaries and benefits you disclose that but not in the detailed level in your budget estimates we know you have 238 people working on one area we don't know anything more than that so what what's going to happen to you is you're going to come before congress we're going to have a lot of questions about your contracts even if you have enormous amounts of wasteful spending to the tune of three four hundred million dollars a year and we don't know the details of it what i would ask you to submit to us is that budget line item that other agencies who have to go through the appropriation process submit on a regular basis would you submit that to our committee so what what i would say is as i said uh the extent of detail of our budget has grown greater as we've been it's still insufficient to have the ability to do that it's my understanding that the amount of information we provide about our budget is comparable to that of other agencies and we're now providing it on our website on a quarterly basis which other agencies do not do if you have other views about how much detail we should be providing the time of the gentleman has expired the chair now recognizes the gentleman from georgia mr

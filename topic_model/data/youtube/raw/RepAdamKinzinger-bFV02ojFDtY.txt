three minutes well i thank the chairman for yielding let me just say first madam speaker as a republican don't let my side use the security posture as the straw man argument in this the reality is that's the equivalent of blaming the victim of a crime for the crime and while it is important that's not what we're here to talk about today madam speaker voting on a criminal contempt resolution is not the position we hoped to be in but steve bannon went out of his way to earn this resolution before us and now we must approve it mr bannon's willful disregard for the select committee subpoena demonstrates his utter contempt for the american people's right to know how the attacks on january 6 came about he has advanced a ludicrous legal argument in support of his decision not to cooperate or comply a decision that defies the rule of law and rejects the will of the american people mr bannon's reported actions put him near the center of the investigation into the events surrounding january 6th his own words strongly suggest that the actions of the mob that stormed the capitol and invaded this very chamber came as no surprise to him he and a few others were by all accounts involved in planning that day's events and encouraged by those who attacked the capital our officers and our democracy i have no doubt that mr bannon scorned for our subpoena is real but no one and i repeat no one is above the law and we need to hear from him as the select committee's contempt report states it was mr bannon who on january 5th predicted with chilling accuracy quote all hell is going to break loose tomorrow on his radio show that day he stated quote it's not going to happen like you think it's going to happen ok it's going to be quite extraordinarily different all i can say is strap in you made this happen and tomorrow it's game day so strap in let's get ready and it was mr bannon who is recorded as saying quote it's all converging and now we're on the point of attack tomorrow mr bannon said these things publicly as a private citizen someone deeply involved with stop the steel movement and he said them nearly three years after leaving his job at the white house mr bannon was also reportedly among the small group of trump confidantes assembled at the willard hotel to discuss plans to stop or delay the january 6 count is it any wonder that the select committee needs to hear from him that we want to see related materials that he has furthermore does anyone really believe mr bannon's actions are covered by a blanket no questions that claim of executive privilege one the former president has never actually made madam speaker steve bannon is a key witness to the select committee's probe he has yet to say or produce anything in response to the subpoena and his assertion of executive privilege is far-fetched in the extreme and not his to make i urge my colleagues to join me to support the contempt resolution and i yield back

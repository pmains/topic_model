[Music] to the point with congressman bill Pascrell focusing on the concerns and issues facing the families of New Jersey's ninth congressional district [Music] hello I'm congressman Jill Castro and I'd like to welcome you to the point here in New Jersey we may be born to run but any update of the iconic Springsteen song would have to take into account the traffic jams and obviously the transit delays we have enormous transportation needs in our state particularly in northern Jersey and our needs haven't been fully addressed by the state or the federal government deteriorating roadways you've seen that every day crumbling bridges be careful under service throw aways and over capacity tunnels are slowing down travelers and making some daily commuters absolutely commuting it unbearable now leadership in Washington prompts us to focus on fixing infrastructure problems as a bipartisan issue that could get the ball rolling on the major projects long ignored unfortunately that hasn't happened yet and the Trump budget proposal slashes federal investments in programs to fund mass transit and water infrastructure from my part I'm pushing forward with initiatives that can help satisfy the state's transportation needs last year I worked with my colleagues Democrat and Republican in New Jersey's congressional delegation to secure a federal grant to jumpstart replacing the central portal bridge a major bottleneck point in the northeast Carter locally we had a 2.5 million dollar federal investment to upgrade the Passaic bus terminal nearly $600,000 for runway safety upgrades at Teterboro Airport and most recently a 10 million dollar grant of New Jersey Transit for implementation of the positive train control safety system along our rail lines so here to talk to us about what more we can be doing instead of just talking to great people Martin Robbins on know many years founding director of the Allen Emboar he's transportation center and Rutgers University our own and Janet sure Nets New Jersey policy director for the tri-state transportation campaign a transportation advocacy group that covers New Jersey and New York and Connecticut right so thank you both for being here today Jay let me ask you a question what do you do as the policy director of the transportation tri-state transportation campaign well tri-state Transportation campaign is a nonprofit nonpartisan transportation advocacy organization so as the director of New Jersey I basically work on all things transportation obviously in transit with roads and bridges we watchdog if you will the type of spending that goes on in the state in terms of NJ do T and New Jersey Transit also work on bicycle and pedestrian issues as you know New Jersey's a pedestrian focus state which means we've got some serious issues that need to be addressed as we have a pedestrian been doing it a little bit over six years going on seven more how will you be doing transportation donor workers before Rutgers goes back more than 40 years now forty years that's all that's all my Marty law something's changed in the forty years and how we look at our transportation bra has been a dramatic change both good and not-so-good back in the early part of my career I was involved in the formation of New Jersey Transit helped to write the original bill and work with Lou Gambaccini then the Commissioner of Transportation River and getting funding for mass transit in the state and and highways right we really got the ball rolling at that time in the round 1980 and we had a role that continued until about ten years ago since that time we've been in a decline and why why because they've been policies particularly at the state level but to some degree the federal level to start transportation particularly public transportation or the maintenance starved that money how does this happen because we have the largest transit system in the country well we might have the system and we might have good people working on it but if the funding system that's initiated by the governor doesn't produce enough money the system is not going to be functioning I take Gary Jersey Transit I do take the buses and the subways and the folks that take us across under the river and over them to enter Manhattan but the experiences I've had in the past four or five years I've noticed something particularly when I go Excel and track down to Washington the maintenance is dreadful the cars are all over the place I mean this is becoming a safety issue absolutely I mean this has been something that's progressed from administration to administration this is not something that's just come up in the past few years there's been substantial starting if you will of New Jersey Transit's budget what do you mean by starving you it well it'll be given an example it came up at a hearing yesterday when George Warrington the late George Washington was executive director of New Jersey limo he was a very progressive president in the position he established a forty five million dollar a year a program called the joint benefits agreement in which New Jersey Transit contributed to the North Eastham tracts maintenance of the Northeast car it was a very effective way of bringing the agencies together on a capital program and then spending the money and so George was in charge back around the year 2002 or three in that time period and it lasted for about five years as soon as George passed away and Governor Christie took over the joint benefits agreement went from 45 million dollars a year to zero and remain that way through the early years of the Christie administration and during that time we lost opportunities to repair the track and fell behind on the maintenance that's called deferred maintenance and that's a passport to fail so anybody can cut a budget yes you think it is you're to cut a budget that's right it works for me and the Congress so you can get anybody to cut a budget but what are the consequences what are the ramifications and can the people of the state that paid many many tax dollars afford to do what you're doing so you smile at them and say we're going to cut your taxes or we're going to put this about this budget we're going to try to put it in balance ha ha which has never happened I mean New Jersey's a state wall you got a door put metal bud budget available I mean I think we're seeing what these ramifications are we're not properly funding well you've got substantial delays and we don't we don't have to look very far everybody knows whether you take transit or not that these things are going on to get worse than a summer they're absolutely going to get worse and the other thing that we're starving is the economic development in the state under Christie we had 11 down grades because you know we're not we're not providing municipalities with the transit so that they could so that they could develop around those transit hubs and really bring in the economy bring in the bring in the ratable for the municipalities to make them to make business how is robust in New Jersey to be a vibrant jumping market along that point there's a story in The star-ledger I think was yesterday about one of the hottest real estate markets in New Jersey and they pointed out I think with 19 different real estate markets and the interesting thing is that while we're complaining and worrying about the mass transit system particular rail system right what are the real estate markets that are doing well the railroad towns in New Jersey those are the ones that are thriving and it's what that is an expression that people want the rail they wanted at a high quality they wanted to be reliable and yet our government and Doug Governor Christie was in charge of setting those budgets right our government has starved New Jersey Transit wise pound foolish on us in the end you're going to get a and and he waited so long to really put into effect a real capital program we too late he should have done that back in 2010 when he put out his first capital budget which was really just cannibalizing the arc project monies and he's really been a disservice to the citizens of the state well I know that this president governor that we have in the state of New Jersey uh you know he had heard of them s - we know that when he became the governor of the state however to do it on the backs of the commuters to do it on the backs of those people who want to get to a job where it would be a Busbee to transit or being our roads doesn't matter does not matter it's not good because it has consequences right he could have set up a five-year capital program that would be a success what he did was he set up a five-year grant realigning it reduces anxiety out there how many jobs are stopped last summer because they ran out of money all over the sled because that was it that was a disgraceful situation and it never should have happened and what did he get out of it 3/8 of a percent just sufficient 3/8 percentage of the sales tax very people don't even notice the denotes so in fact most people go near an hour and he stops the construction for three months right and put workers on the street it was a look back on it was again a disservice to the people of New Jersey now when I first came to the Congress a few months ago 20 years ago I was on the chest with that one of my committees of transportation as I was right down my alley Jersey always has a couple of guys on them yes you do okay so it's important to us not only the transit system but the entire inter interlocking of the systems the dirt railroads planes the whole thing what I noticed the first thing I noticed was that Democrats and Republicans particularly in leadership worked together on transportation look probably the one great one of the great transportation presidents of our time was delight the Eisenhower he was no Democrat in fact Eve saw him very independent as a politician he was thinking about running as a Democrat then he wound up running as a Republican but it was a great president white not only a great general but a great president he saw this in front of had this vision about taking the highways across the country on security the security issue is very important to Dwight at the General Eisenhower it was very important to him you got to get people to places out of places sometimes and you got to get people across the country so that we see one another not just on a hopeful wish of some of some sort everybody in the Congress that I knew that was in leadership on transportation and that at that time member I took the eighth congressional seat that was Bob rose he was the head of he was the Democratic leader in transportation and and Shuster was the Republican leader now his son is the chairman of it what did the apple fell far from the tree or not is and will be better people to decide but they agreed on five-year plans so that this state each state knew how much money was going to get from the federal government beforehand you could plan projects you can turn them down or accept them this was important up until the tea party their tea parties were going to say well this money and nobody first want to complain that they're stuck in traffic would be the first one to say that the trains are late I can't get any place to be the first one it's like me picture of mass transportation we don't need it I mean can you say if we didn't have mass transportation going in another Lincoln Tunnel going over to George Washington Bridge going going over every the white stone bridge where would we be but we're so we're so built out to New Jersey and especially in the New York City metropolitan area that not mode of transportation can absorb the other and we have to have robust options in order to keep everybody moving and that's also keeping going back to the economy when you have leadership in DC and leadership in Trenton that recognizes the economic drivers or transportation errors look how long it took us Jenna to get the gas tax now we could have done this nine years ago and gas tax was where the gas price was / fairly low because we don't have courage we don't have courage of our convictions because it's spending money or there I go again spending money well if it's other things that are necessary then we need to do it and we're going to have this problem again get out of the way in a few more years because we're not building in these periodic increases to keep it going making it sustainable we're not doing that we're going to have this argument over and over and over again as congressman Lewis of Georgia get out of the way and you don't want to know something that's not a simplification plication of our problem who is in the way Martin who is in our way well I think the Trump administration may be in our way among other things what I've heard about the their infrastructure planning I don't it doesn't occur to me that it's going to work I think an organization privatization will solve about five percent of the problems five percents the idea from Indiana Indiana did that right and that is that was a case where there was a road already in being and they decided to put tolls on it and or turn the tolls over to a private company those opportunities are sickly in the Northeast are rare and the public has shown in the history of tolling the show and I just reading a little piece on that is that people don't want tolls imposed on roads that they're already using look we're going to take a minute okay so we're going to come right back up you guys are great terrific and you've got you got the fever we need you out there talking seriously right back when our great great guest stars all the things you done with your bike donating it's a goodwill may be the most incredible of all your donations help fund job placement and training for people

here in the caboose China getting things going here and really thank the both of you for being here you have an expertise you know you're talking about she isn't it good when you're talking to people that know what they're talking about we can learn something for crying out loud you know instead of talking about our opinions all the time most of the time any of our opinions I found out Marty in the Congress are not substantiated by the truth or facts hmm that's a problem pretty distress okay so let's get back to where we're talking about and I do just showing I wanted to check the number that this administration budget in Washington which is dead on arrival as far as both many Democrats and Republicans are concerned you can do this one only wants 630 million dollars cutting out of Amtrak long distant lines now that's not the northeastern line the line I get on Mondays and go when I go to Washington but as many of the other lines that are out there and as you say I like your word you starve it you kill it that's how you do it you know you don't even have to do away with it just just starve it it'll die on its own way you know what what's the main priority in New Jersey the caterers Isaac actually you all agree actually cross hudson commute we've got to get this gateway tunnel going governor christie cancel the arc project when it'll period one of the biggest mistakes I'll be taking up he lost almost a generation of the proper transit but resident sound good Barney doesn't sound good I'm cancelling because this is going to go over budget who could argue with that Marty well it was a that was a fraud I know I know was teleological and it was all about canceling the project cannibalizing the money that had been so carefully organized and putting it into highway building and avoiding going forward on a gas tax and the governor was able to do that that was in 2009 xev ten nine and this was ten and he was able to do that and postponed it for six years and he was able to say I never asked for a gas tax increase could the Democrats have stopped that and continued to or does the governor now that governor in New Jersey has enormous power more so than any other governor without gentlemen so I know I look like I thought about that when it was going on and unfortunately or whatever our Constitution gives the governor immense power and the legislature was unprepared to may be incapable of being able to stop him maybe both yeah yeah yeah but that's how know how important was it oh we always use you two are the experts on how as you know about for planet for the last tunnel I said me Janet I went it out it's become even more important than it ever was why because of superstorm sandy there exists the others existing tunnels there is another nightmare about two percent of superstorm sandy s anymore because the president is going to do away with our River our connection with the climate change and everything we've got everything solved we as the water rises around the done then we have a timeline that we with you're not be able to control got to take these tunnels out of service you take these tunnels out of service you knock transportation capacity down by 75% you can't do that in the Northeast Corridor the three trillion dollar I wanted to be into it I went to the meetings for 14 years Democrats and Republicans running for highs and I were always at those meetings the Democratic Senate is at the time Frank locking her a lot more many recipes Bobby Menendez they were at those meetings and we thought we put a good project together you want me to go another 14 years of playing the next tunnel is that what you're saying well it's not a matter that I want you to it's that you have to because they destroyed that Christy destroyed that plan we had to go back to square one the process is now moving a bit but even with the process moving and there's an environmental study going on and there's commitments engineering for the portal bridge which you mentioned but but what is really of concern is that the one piece of the funding for the start of the new tile is actually been undermined in the Trump budget that's right it's hard to have any project you know all those people who Secretary of Transportation says oh this is the most important project we got to move on it well they're kateri ciao yeah I've been somebody been here before you think she we know you think she'll speak out you think she'll stand up to her president you've got to be kidding me but do you think so no oh but somebody's got to that's the point and that people like you will and I can't read my big mouth wagon on everything you know II can't you're doing a great job on other things as well but but certainly senator Menendez senators Menendez and Booker can do their share on this and they've already started with a letter that they just sent it's it's incredibly disheartening that after all this the first thing out of the box in the Trump budget is to under to knock out the money for the Gateway project that's it's really disheartening because what you're talking about the commuter who's waiting for the train to get into New York City to work or any place to work that little commuter where you're talking about a big tunnel what comes down to whether or not we're going to be able to afford and you're as you said Morton you must afford it we got to find a way to fund it oh yeah and and it cannot just be a one or two year plan and then you shut down the project when the governor whoever the governor's hiccups you've got to have a plan that's sustainable you use that word a lot what do you mean by it we well let's let's just look at the timeline for Gateway looking at not full realization until 2031 well and this and you've got another timeline that working on which is the viability of the existing tunnels everything has to stay focused and prioritize in order for us to get to that timeline and that's really the key priority and it's going needs to it needs to be a prioritization in the New Jersey administration's New York and DC because this is going to missus in the nation this is going to this is this project is going to outlast the one let me ask you talk about the coordination between New York New Jersey okay let me ask you a question Marty do you think we should blow up the Port Authority system and build a new coordinated system or can we salvage the Port Authority system and make it work for us we should not blow it up okay now we should not at all tax under I used the wrong term but that's out oh yeah walk away from it right under John Eggman's leadership in the this in the second half of Christie's terms the Port Authority has begun to steady itself and begun some very good things what I'm worried about in terms of the Port Authority is the power grab that I see that Governor Cuomo is making he's become incredibly difficult became very very obnoxious at times on the bus terminal yes and we had to put him in this place and I worked very closely with Jerry Nadler on that congressman I deeply respect from Ann hang and of course he would he I told Jerry you can't be a lap dog to your governor I can't be a lap dog to my dog we got to do what's right for the people for cornellà right for the area too because it can't be a quid pro quo your state my state the region we need to really slogan you need to refocus that priority of the Port Authority and go back to its original mission which we've gotten off of because Helena served in doing that can you get the state to focus the states to focus on what needs to be done keep on pounding away on it sure sure I mean that's really what our focus has been but unfortunately with the with the starving of the funding and the neglect we're really seeing the ramifications and what we about let's do something about it but you you used that's that's the priority for us the Gateway you've got to make well you go that's our authority bus terminal that is a second priority yeah so and it looks like that many of the problems have been settled Eggman was very important in that and I thought he took a bad rap from Governor Cuomo I which was unneeded unnecessary went wilderness together for crying out loud if the water rises over Manhattan it's going to eventually get to New Jersey and by the way if we have any more Sandy's sandy sandy hurt a lot of folks inland not only on the beaches incredibly horrible situation but if you came in we got had transportation system that can in some way get people out of places sometimes absolutely and evacuate people but don't forget buses carry more passengers than rail so while we're focusing on gateway we also have to focus on on the bus because as I said before neither one can absorb the overrun from the other so they all have to be functioning in order to meet the capacity in the ridership man most people don't realize it right now but there is a cap on a number of buses that can use the Port Authority I don't know in the Detroit and so well that can't exist with the new terminal no the new terminal is except to see what the the plan is good that isn't yet agreed upon ready but but the whole idea is to expand the capacity of the rest of it so that capital end that cap is going to be could be very detrimental to the economic development of New Jersey now where do you have enough time to get it to light rail I want I want light rail also nurturers in Northwest Rosa you got nothing do you ever see what happens on Route 23 up here for crying out loud Sussex Warren town how do people get down the place is backed up forever it's bumper-to-bumper you got to come down to the bus terminals down here depots down here are in Wayne they need help out there Oakland I want to extend that light rail beyond thorn Oakland up into Sussex County let's become a modern you know a couple of my friends were sent to me last night they were just in Europe and so quickly real fast rail when are we going to get that bill I said that the rate we're going you and I will never say but what you have is long-term vision and that's what we need in Trenton and what we need in DC this long-term vision and we don't have that we build for now we're not building for the future we have to close on that point you guys were great Jana you were terrific more you're terrific both of you deserve a lot of credit on a tough tough issue when the politicians like myself had BS their way through this thing and I'm telling you and Leslie I'll have it we don't have a resolution on this kind of thing not only will traffic back up into the suburban communities which is it already but if you're looking to angry at one another okay so I thank you

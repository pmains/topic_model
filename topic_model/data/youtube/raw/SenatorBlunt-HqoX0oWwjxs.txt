well it's already been said we're waiting for our friends on the other side to step up and do the work that needs to be done early in the year they passed a lot of bills that had absolutely no chance of passing the Senate our ever being signed into law now's the time when the real work needs to be done the trade bill the appropriating bill keeping the government functioning as Senator Barrasso just said the leader over there the speaker said they can walk and chew gum at the same time well not sure if they're walking or chewing gum but they're only doing one thing and that one thing looks like it's headed toward a almost totally partisan impeachment vote there's going to be hard to explain to the American people a plan that had no chance of success while the daily work of the Congress and the daily work of the government is set aside first time in 59 years we we are struggling to pass the Defense Authorization Act we need to get busy right now to take those numbers that the leaders said had been agreed to and appropriate the money and keep the government running the first defense bill pay raise and the biggest in ten years is in one of those bills it's time to do our work it's time to do the work that actually can become law rather than to do work and talk about it that can't possibly become law

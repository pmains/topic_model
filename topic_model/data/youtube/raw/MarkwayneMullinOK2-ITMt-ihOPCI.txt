congressman mark wayne mullen of oklahoma sir welcome to the program hey carl thanks for having me on again of course my pleasure so you are a very normal guy and you give a lot of opinions that resonate with a lot of people so i thought about i'd ask you about this nobody held a gun to these kids head they just said hey i want to go to college i want to get a whatever in you know epic dance theory or whatever they choose nothing useful in science yeah exactly political science so they can be a consultant in dc for your campaign or something like that you know and now they want their debt repaid they're like how i can't possibly afford 250 000 because all these universities are paying people like elizabeth warren and all these other former obama officials hundreds of thousands of dollars should we forgive that listen you you are raised on a sense of responsibility and that sense of responsibility is a duty that you have i i inherited quite a bit of debt when i first when i first got into college and then when i left college to to help my folks out and a lot of people around me was telling me to file for bankruptcy and my dad and i said a lot had a long conversation about it and he's like son this is our commitment this is our word and you're only as good as your word and and so in my opinion when you allow people to get away with just simply filing bankruptcy walking away or forgetting their debt forgiven it really takes away from the value of the hard work of earning that money and the pride it takes to to in a character builds to to pay that back listen you took on that responsibility you took on that debt no one else made you do it but when it's just simply given to you you don't respect it the same way you do when you earn it when you have value inside of that and if there's a sense of you that is never there anymore you you almost have this in this sense of entitlement rather than i've earned it and the pride that comes with that

well thank you as well and let me first commend the the committee staff for putting together this report which is a we had wrote this five years ago this is the second volume if you will of a line in the sand and I'd like to submit it without objection into the record as well as a letter that we sent to the administration to the assistant to the president for national security affairs after we took a delegation led a delegation down to Latin America to look at the very issues that we are discussing here today I'd like to enter that into the record as well and also state that this letter was sent on October the fifth and we have yet to receive any any sort of response from the administration this is an area that kind of mr. Duncan that shares my concerns I I believe mr. steffelow as you stated that this is an area that has been gone largely ignored overlooked and yet it's right in our backyard and we talked about the Middle East a lot we talked about North Africa and Egypt and Libya and yet there's that something's happening not too far from here that I think the American people just have no idea the threat level that it presents to us and as you look at the tension between Israel and Iran right now and how that is heightened to a point of flash point that I don't think I've seen is great in my lifetime as that tension heightened so does the tension across the world and in this hemisphere if God forbid there is a strike from Israel into Iran the retaliation it will be certain and it will be swift not just against Israel but in the entire Middle East and it will also expand into this hemisphere it will light up Hezbollah perative i think in latin america it will also light up hezbollah cells in the united states and many people don't even realize that there are Hezbollah cells in the United States when I was a one or a USA chief of counterterrorism that was our job is to find out where are they you don't know what you don't know where are these cells and what we found was that Hezbollah's actually pretty sophisticated and in some ways more so than al-qaeda now there's certainly probably better financed and so we when we went down to Latin America mr. Duncan and I we went to the tri-border area paraguay Brazil Argentina and we saw a huge heslin presence that billions of dollars being sent from that area of that region to Hezbollah to Iran we also saw that there are satellite nations of Iran in Latin America there's certainly Venezuela being one of the biggest and then bolivia in Ecuador and Cuba they were even talking about disavowing a treaty from 1947 that deals with the Monroe Doctrine where if one attack on one is an attack against all why would these states want to violate that treaty or get out of that treaty it's because of the influence of Iran in the region so I guess you know my question is that we were we were always told in I investment or a guy that you put it you just hit the nail on the head by saying when it comes to the State Department it's a head in the sand because when we were down there we got you know briefings from the chief of station which were pretty good but we get in that the local security guys better and then we went to the jewish community center that was blown up by hezbollah and these guys probably it was the best briefing that we got down there most likely wired into Israeli intelligence which is probably the best when it comes to Iran but then when we talk to our own State Department amazingly how the threat is downplayed how the terrorism word is not even used I think it's been taken out of the vernacular and even though you have this large Hezbollah presence down there they don't seem to care so it's like diplomacy outweighs threat diplomacy outweighs looking at this as a Counter Terrorism issue so i think that was to me the line of the the hearing that had in the sand and they need to get their head out of the sand and look and look at this problem so my question the panel is we were always told you know yeah yeahs was down there and but they're just they're just finance support cells it's nothing to get too worried about so I don't over blow this problem it's not really a problem well then we saw the kids force operative in Mexico you know the lining with what he thought was a low Zetas cartel member to assassinate the Saudi ambassador in Washington and to hit the embassies in Argentina both the Israeli and Saudi embassies the first time we're seeing this theory that they're not couldn't be possibly be a threat to suddenly seeing a in operative in operation so I guess again my final question is can you discuss the sort of unholy alliance that we're seeing now and marriage between these Hezbollah Kurds force more radical Islamic groups and the drug cartels that are largely financed I understand that but discuss that and then also is it possible that they could become operational in the future particularly in light of the situation between Israel in Iran currently if I could jump in yes well mr. Chairman I you exactly right ahmad vahidi is the minister of defense of iran he said if the iran were attacked by anyone that there would be a tough and crushing response he said that on may 2011 in Bolivia where he was inaugurating a an academy on asymmetrical warfare that was that is being funded by a ram just one example mohsen ravani is a cleric who is wanted for his role in the 92 and 94 bombings in Buenos it√≠s he travels on documents provided him by Venezuela he's not supposed to be able to travel at all because there's a red notice and Interpol red notice but he travels in this hemisphere on a regular basis and we've been able to place him through our sources at least a couple of times in the last 18 months so that exists the juma case that I refer to involves all of these different criminal elements and really a global enterprise where Zuma played a role bringing Colombian cocaine to the Los Zetas through Central America taking the money there commingling it with a used car enterprise those cars that value with an exported to Africa converted to cash so you launder the resources and then flown back to the Western Hemisphere this is a terrifically sophisticated mechanism that's that is going to reach out and touch us in a serious way if we don't get ahead of the curve and start to block some of these moves on their part thank you Miss booster sofa mr. chairman to build on one of the previous questions as well regarding metrics I think before jumping into the specifics it's worth remembering the terrorism what gets measured gets done but are we measuring what matters but more importantly terrorism is a small numbers business if you look back to 911 we weren't talking about hundreds and thousands of people so it's worth factoring in the vulnerabilities that can be exploited you don't need big numbers to cause catastrophic effect so in terms of the Lebanese Hezbollah marriage in the tri-border area I think general Frazier ahead of Southern Command put a best they are working together mostly alliances of convenience but it's those alliances of convenience that can cause real significant damage to our US national interests of national security I might note that la pd recently elevated the government of Iran and its proxies to a Tier one threat at par and even to al Qaeda its affiliates and those inspired by Al Qaeda that's a significant development and why PD has done much the same in addition to the points that ambassador Noriega brought up nasrallah the head of Lebanese Hezbollah has stated himself and his quote was if Israel targets are on America bears responsibility so clearly they're going to light up and tap some of those networks I might also note there have been a number of arrests JTTF arrests in the United States in 2010 there were 16 significant arrests of a web of Hezbollah sympathizers trying to access Stinger missiles night vision equipment so this isn't something that we need to be worrying about this has occurred so the question is is if you see these pieces come together and should a triggering event cause yes I think that is a significant issue the United States needs to be concerned about and I might also note that they're pretty sophisticated in terms of trade craft so that that's just something to bear in mind mr. Farrell I would echo what ambassador no Diego said and I think that if you look at it Ron's history in the region we tend to look at the attack on the attempt attack on the Saudi ambassador is sort of a crossing or you chain a sea change and how they behave but it's not really and if you look at the 2007 attempted attack on the JFK fuel facilities that was also an Iranian plot it didn't get a lot of publicity but if that the Ronnie connection but mr. kadir who is running the involvement pot out of Guyana was sent to you the Western Hemisphere at the same time motion rabbani was and he was working the northern tier as motion rabbani was working the the Argentine sphere and the money far the money for that and is documented in our own court documents for that attack were put into the mosque that mr. kadir was running in in Guyana so I think it's they've been waging an asymmetrical campaign against us for a long time and we are not taking it seriously think the other thing that one has to pay attention to is simply the breadth of their activities many of them small but but in taken together they're quite significant number of businesses they're opening the Panama and padam at the colon free trade zone is astounding they're buying Panamanian citizenship for ten thousand dollars as Panamanian citizens than opening businesses in the Cologne free trade zone with extremely broad capabilities for acquiring dual-use removing whatever they want through that particular area if you look at that when you VC own report from last year on the Manassa irani you they've documented and filmed Iran's attempts to hack our major national security networks from a Mexican University in conjunction and with the Venezuelans asking for anything that was taken to be shared back with them so I think that you are assumption is that this is all starting now when in reality there was a meeting in Tehran in 1983 where they made the decision to expand into Latin America using guns and uh automatic weapons you know Lucille se queda novice you know sir weapons and grenades to to take over the region so I think that the idea that they're somehow unprepared or that this is a new thing for them and they're suddenly scrambling to position themselves is nonsense they've been doing this for 20 years they're in places where we are only beginning to look to see where they are and I think the potential to light us up in the if they felt necessary is huge and let me follow up on the omit this isn't about cyber but there was an attack recently by Ron a cyber attack on a ram co in the set and the Saudi Peninsula and a thirty thousand computers compromised and at the same time a an attack against our financial institutions in the United States and so it really is astounding and you're correct it's not some science fiction thing it's happening you know right now and then these flights going back between you know caracas to Tehran what's on those planes we can't monitor those planes speculation uranians on those flights what that came back weapons-grade into this hemisphere and smuggled across the border that that's a nightmare scenario for a lot of us i would say perhaps more dangerous than those flights are that are the unregulated shipping which have much more significant capacity even or even less monitored than the flights are their ability because the state to state transaction there's no way of knowing what's on those planes if they leave this last question ambassador you know you said you have a lot of friends in the State Department so given all this mounting evidence why do they continue to have their head in the sand on this well i should add I I had a lot of friends in about 20 minutes ago maybe fewer I'm sorry oh they're not still there yeah well you know they conflate this mr. chairman with other issues that we have with these countries for example Venezuela they don't want to mud wrestle with Hugo Chavez and they think that if we do it elevates him that's a wonderful Theory seven years ago it might have had some validity but it's been disproven as we see that we try to sort of stupid seriously ignore him that he's galloping forward at this staggering alliance with Iran for that matter with PRC buying nine billion dollars weapons weapons for the Russians the Cubans essentially run the internal security apparatus I don't know what else he could do if we didn't if we were to provoke try to provoke you the other thing is there are countries like Mexico and Brazil that are just so sensitive about talking about this issue and part of it is every time we raise it they read it miss read it as an accusation the fact is we can all up and down this table give examples of the things the Mexicans have done right in fighting this issue but for some reason we can't even they are not doing their job at the state's warm to find a way to have a serious dialogue about this so that the Mexicans are more open and the Brazilians are more open Brazilians are going to host the Olympics and the World Cup in the next three or four years both events and if you ask a lot of these foreign ministry types of Brazil they will tell you the terrorism is an invention of the United States government to intervene in our internal affairs well it's going to come unfortunately in the manifestation and manifest itself in another way if they don't do something serious to address this issue yeah and the Brazilians when we were down there absolutely right did not want to acknowledge any of this but at the same time that while we were there sent 10,000 troops to the tri-border area so it's not a threat but we're going to send 10,000 troops the fact is it's to the tri-border area while you're there mr. chairman some of the best at work being done on this is by brazilian police you know by the Brazilian security agencies but at the political level it's completely you know sergeant Schultz they know nothing about anything and one other example Argentina the country that were 144 people were the victims of Hezbollah violence not so not so far in the distant past is engaging in talks right now with the Iranians and what are they up to well there have been vast transfers of cash at least a quarter of a billion dollars from Venezuela to Argentina we know that Ahmadinejad asked Chavez to intervene with nestor kirchner the former president of argentina to turn back on the sort of nuclear cooperation that they had back in the 90s before those bombings and now these talks are I believe to launder the reputations of two potential candidates for president of iran to succeed Ahmadinejad who are indicted by argentina so mark my words this taught this sort of this will involve some sort of transaction very high-priced soybean exports from Argentina dataran and you're going to see Argentina find a way to lift those indictments so that they don't have a black mark against the next president of Iran this is sort of stuff my state department needs to know about and engage on everybody needs to know about it i can tell you meeting with the ambassador from argentina was hardly a friendly experience as well a very anti-american that was my sense so I've gone way past my time I'd like to now recognize the gentleman from Illinois mr. Davis

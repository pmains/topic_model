Lauren I I'm intrigued by the notion that everyone's talking healthcare out there is that been your experience or what are you most asked about by voters absolutely I'm a registered nurse that decided to run for Congress based on a broken promise coming out of my representative he promised that he was going to protect health care coverage for people like me with pre-existing conditions and then he went and broke his word and so as I travel around my community the seven-county is in northern Illinois you know folks are talking about how can we afford our prescription drugs how are we going to pay our premium prices when we're facing these astronomical increases on the on the rise for 2019 I mean health care is the forefront issue of this campaign and we've got and got to fix our system a question for both of you as women running as we mentioned in a year where we're there we're literally seeing American historical records broken with the number of women candidates and there's so many references to the aggregate view of politics day and the view of Trump and that seems to actually sometimes obscure something I know you both know about which is a gender gap so take a look here and when you look at the support among women a higher negative view of Trump 65% negative then when you when you break it out otherwise to both of you what does that mean starting with Lauren so I think that what we see among women is that we are energized and motivated to do the work in my community women have been leading in every area civic life they've been PTA leaders leaders of our community associations our neighborhood associations church groups right but have not necessarily been running for office and so we've seen an unprecedented number of women stepping up and being candidates in this era we've also seen an unprecedented number of women stepping up as activists and leading groups in our community and so what I see is that we have a huge number of women getting involved because we know what's at stake this year

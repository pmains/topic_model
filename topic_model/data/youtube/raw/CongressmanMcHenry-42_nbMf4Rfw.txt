mchenry the chairman of the oversight investigations committee for three minutes thank you mr chairman i want to thank our panel for being here today two and a half years ago president obama when he signed the dodd-frank act said that this would end too big to fail across the ideological spectrum we hear debate but greater consensus on the side that dodd-frank did not end too big to fail i appreciate the ranking members opening statement and in fact in the oversight subcommittee which i chair we've gone section by section in the text of dodd-frank and we've heard a variety of witnesses over the previous few months about how dodd-frank does not end too big to fail and systemically we went through those section by sections of dodd-frank very important from these hearings were identified among other things this shocking inability of the financial stability oversight council to perform one of its core functions identifying new risks to the economy we've learned that nearly three years after enactment of dodd-frank the federal reserve is not considered nor made public how it will apply its broad new authorities to prevent future financial crises we've heard from legal scholars and economic experts on dodd-frank's new resolution authority the orderly liquidation authority and what it will mean in future bailouts as the bailout mechanism when the taxpayer will provide liquidity to these failed firms the subcommittee learned that far from creating greater clarity and certainty in the marketplace the dodd-frank law simply granted an incredible amount of power and discretion to federal regulators to enshrine future taxpayer bailouts for specifically specially designated large institutions now that designation we have we've had a lot of discussion about as well finally we heard testimony shockingly from the justice department regarding their obvious reluctance to prosecute large financial institutions which may be the best evidence yet that this administration doesn't even believe that the dodd-frank act ends too big to fail now the fact is dodd-frank did not end too big to fail it guaranteed it instead of making it implicit it now has made it explicit that is a problem and we need to address it and the message that is sent to the marketplace has created a perverse incentive to the creditors of the largest financial firms now this undermines the taxpayer it undermines small financial institutions and it undermines a truly competitive and fair marketplace too big to fail must end and that's what this hearing begins to discuss thanks so much mr chairman chair now recognizes

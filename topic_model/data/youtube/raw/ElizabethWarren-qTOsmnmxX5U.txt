okay I know it is not a newsflash to say that Donald Trump cares more about how he looks than about how government works but even so look what he's done with a stimulus checks I'm sure people will be very happy to get a big fat beautiful cheque and my name is on it these checks were delayed because Donald Trump wanted to make sure that he got his name on him think about that people who needed those checks to be able to pay the rent or to put food on the table to cover their bills all had to wait but hey the stimulus checks are gonna be beautiful with his name I and he also cares about how he looks in terms of handling this crisis and that is make sure that whatever goes wrong blame someone else and so much death has been caused by their mistakes we have a leader who cares about himself first and last we really have done this right the problem is the press doesn't cover it the way it should be quiet quiet quiet maybe it's a good thing to take a look at what a real leader looks like this is bigger than any individual this is bigger than yourself this is about America this is about the world this is about how we bring people together meanwhile Donald Trump is more concerned about protecting himself and his big corporate buddies that he has about protecting the American people he's fired one watchdog after another and then he put his favorite lawyer in charge of overseeing a trillion dollar bailout for big corporations I mean this is a great fun is by the lack of oversight your treasury having these unilateral authority to dole out all of this money look I'll be the oversight I'll be the owners this is how corruption flourishes with checks and balances just torn apart when somebody's the president of the United States the authority is total Trump doesn't like checks on his power and that's why Congress needs to step up in the next stimulus any bailout of giant corporations needs to come with real strings attached part one strong conflict of interest rules so that government officials are not profiting from taxpayer bailout money part two a ban on political spending by any corporation that is receiving bailout money from the federal government part three strengthen the congressional oversight board and give it subpoena power so it can totally do its work and part for any giant corporation that wants to take federal bailout money needs to be willing to put workers on the board of directors there's going to be another stimulus package and I'll be fighting for more accountability join us at Elizabeth Warren calm you

i have the secretary of the united states department of health and human services who's over basically overseeing all health care in america to have him here in fairmont west virginia to have this opening of something brand new in our state and it's not that plentiful around the country to have this type of a small centralized hospital that's able to feed into better services and bigger services but stabilizing and keeping families close to home is pretty special for us to have the first one in west virginia here in marion county center mansion has made it possible to have this type of quality facility health care facility available to people that's what we need to do and so i'm coming anytime someone fights this hard to get this kind of a resource made available to people it's what we got to do and that's what we should be about is improving access to health care for all americans including rural americans [Music]

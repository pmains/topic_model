Thank You mr. speaker and to the gentlelady from Florida and the gentlelady from New Jersey for affording me this opportunity to discuss a tragedy as the gentlelady from New Jersey stated that has hit very close to home and the reason I say that is as stated by the gentlelady from New Jersey the Northeast Corridor is the way we are able to travel back and forth from our homes to Washington DC to do the people's business and so it is not uncommon that I could have been on train 188 I've taken it on numerous occasions my thoughts and prayers are with the victims of this horrific and tracked train derailment and their families at this difficult time I'm grateful for the first responders who put themselves in harm's way to rescue passengers and I wish all those injured a full and speedy recovery this tragedy as we stated has hit so close to home sometimes weekly I travel as do many of my constituents and colleagues on this rail line I've taken Amtrak's 188 and have my wife and children on that specific train leaving here going back home as a member of Congress we have a responsibility to ensure and enhance the public safety the derailment of Amtrak train 188 serves as an important reminder that if we are not where if we are to meet this responsibility we need to invest in our infrastructure there is no doubt that our nation's infrastructure is crumbling the American Society of Civil Engineers has rated it as a d+ now Mr Speaker I know all of us find education important if you were given a d+ on the work that you do on the quality of your service what would that say there's no doubt that we are fail we are falling behind other nations in the quality of our infrastructure long-term investments in our nation's infrastructure is essential for achieving economic growth and competitiveness throughout the world yet Republicans refuse to address this very real crisis this only compounds the problem costing American jobs and undermining our economy we don't need short-sighted thinking we need to stay competitive boost Commerce invest in economic growth and job creation and protect our communities these are the benefits of modernizing our nation's infrastructure one day after the derailment of Amtrak train 188 my Republican colleagues voted to cut Amtrak funding while the and tracked investigation remains ongoing we know that slashing funding will hamper safety improvements and upgrades we shouldn't stand in the way of this wise infrastructure investment let's commit to ensuring modern safe and reliable infrastructure that reflects the greatness of this nation and as I go to my seat I just wanted once again thank the gentlelady's from Florida and New Jersey respectively for giving me the opportunity to have several moments to discuss what is a issue that impacts the safety the productiveness the competiveness of our nation in our infrastructure and with that mr. speaker madam I yield back thank you

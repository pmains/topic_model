lingering question will we ever get to see the email involving top White House staffers discussing their quote media strategy concerning a fox news report in the days after Benghazi apparently the Obama administration believes this is quote sensitive material and releasing it would have a chilling effect on their quote Frank deliberations South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham is a Republican and member of the Senate Armed Services and judiciary committee sir thank you very much for being here tonight and so this is a Fox News memo seven page email chain in reference to a fox news level been reference to a fox news report on sep tember 27th 2012 that reported that the Intel community knew within 24 hours that Benghazi was a terror attack this appears to have caused major waves at the White House and they won't share with the public their discussions why should they well I think it's relevant to the investigation but they'll have a chance to go to court and say this document should not be disclosed and we'll leave it up to a judge Richard Nixon tried that he used executive privilege but I don't think you'd have a chilling effect I think it would turn up the heat on their obvious effort in my view to try to spend the story away from a coordinated terrorist attack of an unsecured facility six weeks before an election into a protest caused by video they had nothing to do with but here's what I would like to see I would like Leon Panetta and Hillary Clinton to testify at the same time I'd like to know why the Secretary of Defense knew about security requests being made to add security to Dominguez in the Secretary of State not this facility had been attacked twice in April in June we were the last Western symbol in Benghazi people it was a death trap so there's so much yet to be learned and in terms of secretary Clinton's role in all of this why was Susan rosen to talk about Benghazi when she had absolutely no responsibility how r benghazi said before i don't like to do the sunday shows that she wanted to let you know what well then don't become present in the united states then don't ask to be present in the united states if you don't like going on national television talk about four Dead Americans who were killed by terrorists don't even recall the fact that Senator Reid has already said despite your request that there will be Oh Select Committee in the Senate there will be no cooperation that that's a house only thing well we've had one Committee and the Senate issue a report about Benghazi the Intel committee they did a pretty good job but they said they didn't have jurisdiction over the state department officials and they thought the attack have been prevented I'm trying to get Harry Reid to let us look at all three agencies Department Defense Department state Intel at the same time here's my advice to my Democratic friends if you're seen as trying to cover up getting to the truth of Benghazi and you think that everything that has been known and this is just a witch-hunt you do so at your peril if we're over playing our hand we do so at our peril so to Senator Reid can you please tell me why Susan Rice said on 16 sep tember the consulate was strongly significantly and substantially secured when she was asked about the level of security when nothing had been further from the truth can you tell me why this email was withheld for 19 months showing a coordinated effort to mold her testimony to get it away from a terrorist attack I'll give Center to read a list of 10 questions and maybe he can answer these questions because I can't senator Graham thank you for being

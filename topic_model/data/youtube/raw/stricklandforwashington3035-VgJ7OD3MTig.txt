my mother often tells me a story when we first came to the United States my mother and father drove around with me in Virginia in the 60s looking for a motel room my father wore his military uniform my mother dressed for church they drove around for hours in the evening but no one would rent a motel room to them this was my mother in min kim strickland introduction to america after we moved to the Pacific Northwest I attended good public schools and had opportunities to be successful I began to see what our country could be but I also knew we could never stop working for it when I think about why I got involved in public service it was quite simple the experience of my parents so when Wall Street crashed our economy in 2008 leaving our community reeling and people scared I knew we could do better I ran for the Tacoma City Council and then for mayor together we raise the minimum wage pass paid family leave brought good-paying jobs and we invested in the City of Tacoma we raised the high school graduation rate from 55% to nearly 90 percent so every child from every background has a fair shot our community however is facing serious challenges again people are worried about their lives and their livelihoods I'm running for Congress because we need proven leaders with the experience to heal and rebuild this nation and help workers families and small businesses just like I did when I was mayor of Tacoma I'm running because we deserve better than the incompetence and greed of the Trump administration and his go along Republican caucus and while much has changed since the 60s these Trump years have shown us there's still so much work to be done I'm also running to be the first african-american ever elected to Congress from Washington State and the first Korean American woman in our nation's history and I will go to work every single day to make my family's first car ride together in America truly ancient history you

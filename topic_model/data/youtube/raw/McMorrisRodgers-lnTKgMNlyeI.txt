Thank You mr. chairman and I want to thank administrator will or for joining us today I appreciate your focus on getting results thank you we must have clean air and clean water for the citizens of this country and it seems to me that you are really focused on how we're going to get results you've been particularly helpful in working with me on issues that have a direct impact on eastern Washington and to that end I'm pleased to see the biomass carbon neutrality rule that was sent to Ownby this week this is long overdue and I just am pleased to see you pressing forward on finalizing it we've also discussed the aronia erroneous water quality standards at the Obama EPA imposed on Washington State that are not even a table and attainable are not measurable they were imposed at the tail end of the Obama administration after the Inslee administration at the state level had spent years putting together water quality standards for the people of Washington State bringing stakeholders together and hammering out some of the strictest standards in the country for Washington state and yet the Obama administration said no and impose their own standards right at the tail end for for me representing Eastern Washington Spokane the city of Spokane spent hundreds of millions of dollars to clean up the Spokane River local businesses spent billions on state-of-the-art technology to eliminate their footprint on local rivers and lakes the former mayor of Spokane David Condon was even brought to the White House by President Obama for his praise on the to praise him on this water storage system the innovation and the state-of-the-art technology that we were putting in place in the city of Spokane yet despite this investment and praise these efforts still do not meet the unattainable and immeasurable standards imposed by the Obama EPA we cannot get the permits that we need I find it odd that the Inslee administration now governor Inslee is now defending the stringent federal standard it previously opposed and is now opposing our own standard that they had negotiated he's also devoting state resources to a study meant to advocate for removing the four Loras Nick River dams to save the salmon his Department of Ecology has a heavy hand on Eastern Washington enforcing these unattainable water quality standards and threatening our dams while at the same time seemingly ignoring the city of Seattle in King County dumping millions of gallons of raw sewage into Puget Sound this certainly doesn't meet any test of the water that I would want my children to be drinking in addition there's now fentanyl and heroin in the water needles in Puget Sound for too long governor Inslee and others have turned a blind eye to the issues in their own backyard and instead pointed the finger to Eastern Washington as the source of all their problems and how we save salmon in fact in 2017 after a spill that resulted in 250 million gallons of raw sewage spilling into the sound the Seattle Times noted quote not a single person from an environmental group or the public turned out to testify or demand action or even take notice of one of the largest local public infrastructure failures in decades and this has been going on for decades ladies and gentlemen but yet nearly every week we have to defend our dams from those who refuse to look at the science and look at the facts the governor's focus on these unattainable water quality standards and efforts to tear out the the Snake River dams are a distraction from solutions that will actually make a difference solutions like cleaning up Puget Sound we could save the salmon save the orcas and save the for Laura Snake River dams if we cleaned up Puget Sound the number one salmon for the orcas are in Puget Sound so administrator wheeler I appreciate the current EPA's effort under your leadership to revise these standards I heard from my colleague from Oregon about city of San Francisco 1.5 billion dollar billion gallons of raw sewage city of New York I'd like to ask have you looked at the City of Seattle have you looked at Puget Sound what tools do you have to hold the city of Seattle and King County accountable first of all congressman I have to agree with you it's hard to keep track of your governor's positions on these issues but we will have to be happy to look into the City of Seattle and Puget Sound we have approved the state's criteria that the governor originally accepted and we have approved that and we think it is based on sound scientific judgment are we happy to take a closer look at the Puget Sound and any pollution going into that that body I would I would greatly appreciate it and my time is expired I yield back

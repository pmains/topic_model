hi i'm byron donalds candidate for the united states congress the negative ads just keep coming so it's time for me to set the record straight i am supported by a group called the club for growth the club for growth has supported true conservatives running for congress for the last 20 years they've supported mike lee rand paul marco rubio and our own governor ron desantis when he ran for congress and now they're backing me and these attacks about how they're an anti-trump organization are a lie they supported ted cruz in a republican primary for president but now they've been active allies of president trump they're actually spending five million dollars right now in this campaign to re-elect donald trump to be the next president of the united states but speaking of negative attacks let's talk about one of my opponents casey askar he has the gall to say that i supported obama in 2008 but he has no facts no details he's lying to you i supported john mccain in 2008. you can ask my mother she'll tell you the truth it's time to get away from the lies and the smears it's time to send a true conservative to washington i'm byron donalds i'm asking for your votes please make sure you vote for me by mail or at early voting or on election day on august 18. god bless you have a good day

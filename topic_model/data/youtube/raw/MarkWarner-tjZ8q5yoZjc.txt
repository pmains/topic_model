to thank the presiding officer for uh taking a few moments so i can make my my statement i again thank my friend senator from illinois for his comments and um let me start by saying that heartened to hear the comments the majority leader made that we are close to an agreement to make sure that we don't put the american people or the great federal workers through another one of these 11th hour fire drills we get to the brink of the precipice of of shutting down our federal government it's in that spirit that i rise today because as many know over the last year and a half or so i have come here regularly to the floor of the senate to continue a tradition that was started by senator kaufman from delaware where we recognize the contributions of great federal employees and today i'm pleased to honor another exceptional exceptional federal worker mr john merlino mr merlino is the senate's assistant legislative clerk working on the legislative team on the office of the secretary of the senate mr morlano began his senate career in 1994 as a senate door keeper he then joined the secretary's legislative staff and has performed many of its functions including the constitutional task the constitutional task of maintaining the senate journal another of mr molino's main responsibilities is to call the role during votes and quorum calls more importantly he is also one of those special workers on the dais who have been known at times to actually keep new members as they preside over the senate awake during chair he's always ready with a good sports quip he's known for a person above who goes above and beyond the call of duty a matter of fact i know it was his birthday yesterday and i've been planning this speech for some time i wanted to make sure it wasn't coincided with that important date for him secretary of the senate nancy erickson noted that in addition to his hard work and attention to deal detail and this is i quote it is his great sense of humor that keeps many of us that helps many of us keep smiling especially during the senate's late night legislative sessions a small cog in the greater legislative process mr molino is a member of an other a member of an often unrecognized but dedicated team that keeps the senate running smoothly and one that is charged with ensuring continuity of operation no matter what the situation in fact mr molino recently entered the history books during a pro forma session held at the postal square building immediately following the earthquake in august mr molino unknowingly became one of only two people along with senator coons who have spoken during the only official session of the senate convened outside the capitol building since 1814. the last time the senate met outside the capitol building for such a session was when the british troops burned the capital during the war of 1812. again so mr molino took his some role in the history books of this great institution i hope my colleagues and i know the presiding officer again by spelling me from the share this morning to allow me to make this statement will join me in honoring mr molino a fellow virginian for the excellent work he and the legislative team do each and every day and for their commitment to public service and it's in that sense of mr molino's commitment to public service that i know the presiding officer joins me in this and that we get our work done today so that we can give this team and the literally couple other million federal workers across the country the sense that we're not going to shut down the government they're going to be able to go into the holiday season with the recognition that uh the government will continue operating but more importantly that so many of us recognize the great work they do to keep this country moving forward so with that mr mr president i yield the floor and again thank my my good friend mr moreno for his good work

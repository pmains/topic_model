today is Earth Day and in honor of this special day congressman Brad Schneider is hosting an event at climate change and change at is at the Chicago Botanic Gardens this afternoon and he's been so kind to come in bright and early for this morning and is joining us welcome we appreciate you coming in this lab we here so we're here to talk about the transition to green energy first of all it's just start with exactly what is green energy what's your goal with this well the idea of green energy is trying to replace our reliance on fossil fuels which are polluting the environment emitting carbon gases as affecting global climate change and trying to move to an economy that is renewable fuels cleaner fuels cleaner opportunities to provide the energy we need to power our homes move our tents for our people and grow our cities so and and and you have felt we've been going in that direction but there's concerns now that things have changed with the new administration so you along with some other lawmakers have introduced a new bill tell us about that we did so a president Trump issued an executive order that would roll back the President Obama's clean power plan would loosen restrictions on emissions from coal-fired plants take other negative actions so I with my some of my colleagues introduced the climate act a congressional leadership in mitigating the administration's threat to the earth act and this would prevent the president from taking these regressive actions prevent government from funding his his efforts okay you know it's very interesting because climate change is a really controversial issue as you well know and some people are saying that this greenhouse effect are you know the what's happening with our environment is just a part of how climate changes over time and there's really no proof that as a result of what we've been doing that it's having a big effect on our our globe but you have evidence otherwise oh i think there's overwhelming evidence we've had the last number of years of each year successively has been the warmest year on record we're seeing shrinkage of the polar ice in the winters and on the North Pole oh waterways in the summers for the first time in modern history we're seeing increase in storms and the impact of these storms hitting our communities causing economic damage so we need to take action on climate change this is something that I have been leading on will continue to lead to try to make sure that we give our children a healthy sustainable environment and a planet with a climate that will carry us forward so how do you convince the current administration and those who are non-believers that something has to be done well that's the point of today's forum is to you listen to the experts you follow the science the science is clearly there we could also look at the economics we have in our country today over 3 million clean power green jobs if we back away from those if we abandon the efforts if we walk away from the cleric Paris climate Accord the rest of the world understands it and they're moving forward and we're going to lose those jobs to China we're going to lose those jobs to India the United States has the opportunity to continue to lead on environmental actions today is earth day it's the 47th anniversary in 1970 the EPA was created because of the challenges we saw in our country what's our environment rivers that caught on fire plan polluting those rivers we've made great progress we still have a long way to go in the United States really does need to lead so there have been some reports that the EPA is actually considering closing its Chicago office that I've heard those rumors by I joined with tendered ribbon and other members of the Illinois delegation writing to the EPA director Scott Pruett highlighting the important work this office does representing six Midwestern states and we need to keep that off office open there's also the president Trump's budget eliminates full funding for the Great Lakes restoration initiative we can't abandon the restoration of the Great Lakes this provides the water for 30 million people across eight states the Great Lakes want basin is an important economic drivers we have to protect the Great Lakes we have to protect the environment of our region and our nighttime and our nation so funny for those people watching say you are very passionate about this what can the average citizen do get involved there are a lot of people can do it starts with calling your representative of whatever congressional district you are in reach out and talk to your representative call the Senators but it's also today's Earth Day get involved go out in your community and try to clean things up this truly is an issue where we can think and act globally but also very much act locally well you're going out do a little cleanup today yourself you told me I'm a dreaded about woods today to work on cleaning up the woods with some veterans in Lake County well we appreciate the work you do and thank you so much thank you again we enjoy the rest of your day is going to be gorgeous according to Marx drill right it's going to be good day that's all

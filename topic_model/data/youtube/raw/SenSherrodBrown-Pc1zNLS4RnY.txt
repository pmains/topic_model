thank you mr president yesterday i left my home in cleveland and kissed my wife goodbye and headed to the airport at early in the morning and started i worked went to gates a b and c in the cleveland airport and talked to tsa agents who are all working and working without pay then i got to washington flew into a national airport went straight to a building in arlington where i talk to cafeteria workers they're federal contract workers who serve food at our smithsonian museums and other federal facilities they don't work for the federal government their paychecks don't come from the federal government they are contracted through a company and then paid by these companies so they have lost their jobs during the trump shutdown they're not only not these workers making 12 13 14 some with some seniority make 15 an hour they are a union they make two or three dollars more than the non-union comparable workers but they're not getting paid but unlike the 800 000 federal workers some working without pay some furloughed unlike them they if history's the judge they will not get paid those lost wages so these are people making 12 13 14 an hour who have lost already two weeks of work because of the trump shutdown and they have no prospect unless congress acts they have no prospect to get that back pay uh and again their wages are are at that level then last night to sort of cap the day uh in my in my apartment here i watched the president united states talk about his wall and dig in a little more you know mr president i wish that i wish that president trump i wish donald trump would talk to the workers he's hurting with his shutdown i wish he would he would go out as and he would go out in in as as president lincoln used to say to get his public opinion bath would listen to these workers that he would leave the white house or mar-a-lago where he spends most of his time in in talk to these workers that i talked to yesterday the tsa workers in cleveland who are working without pay and the anxiety levels are going up and up and up for these workers because they this coming saturday they'll miss their first paycheck and then beyond that too and these these food service workers last week president trump said his shutdown has i imagine this he said this is a billionaire president his shutdown the trump shutdown which he proudly as commander-in-chief said i'm proud of this shutdown that he went to shut down the government he said this shutdown has a higher purpose than next week's pay imagine that a billionaire president living in this beautiful house paid for by taxpayers and having his estate in mar-a-lago that he would say this shutdown this trump shutdown has a higher purpose than next week's pay i wonder if he'd tell that to tsa workers the ones i met in cleveland including aaron bankston who told me if you're the only breadwinner in your family and you have your kids looking up at you it's hard to tell them we don't have anything to put food we don't have any way to put food on the table that's the hard part senator is what he said we just have to get us back working we're working diligently over here we're trying to make sure people are the flying public is safe or mr president tell the cafeteria workers that i talk with tell them that there's a higher purpose than their week's pay because remember it's not just federal employees feeling the pain it's also these contractors there are 800 thousand federal employees there are we think we don't we can't get the number from the government yet i'm not sure the administration wants to tell us these numbers there are thousands and thousands and thousands of contract workers making 10 12 15 making a little more if they're lucky enough to have a union but some making as little as eight or nine or ten dollars a lot an hour a lot of americans don't realize it thousands of janitors in cafeteria workers and security guards are out of work because of the president it's it's you know it's all kinds of federal employees it's people that process it's people that process tax returns of the irs it's people that are helping farmers adjust to the new farm bill that we passed proudly senator roberts and senator stabenow and a bunch of us it's about people wanting to get a mortgage and they can't get it approved with fha because of this shutdown it's people like that but it's also people making eight and ten and twelve dollars an hour unless we do something these workers won't get the back pay that they should get because they're employed by private contractors and they have no way at twelve and fifteen dollars an hour without pay they have no way of making up their lost hours and lost wages i'm working with of the relatively new minnesota senator senator smith on legislation to try to come up with a solution to get these workers back pay the way that workers who are actual federal employees get back paid because fundamentally mr president it comes down to respecting the dignity of work and that means respecting the dignity of work that these workers make a decent wage with decent benefits missing one paycheck may not seem like a lot to the billionaire president in the multi-millionaire cabinet with their massive investment portfolio i'll say that again missing one paycheck one two week paycheck or two two week paychecks or even if the president gets his way three two week paychecks may not seem like a lot to a billionaire president in a multi-millionaire cabinet with their massive investment portfolios but it means a whole lot to those people missing a paycheck is a big big deal that the president united states clearly either doesn't understand or doesn't care about the president doesn't understand that working people can't just send a letter to creditors saying hey excuse me from paying rent this month or paying my mortgage or paying for my medications you can't buy groceries or put gas in the car with an iou one of those cafeteria workers told me yesterday in arlington i have to pay rent i have other bills i have a college student in community college in the second semester he needs help with his books she said president trump i'm asking you would you please open the government everyone is going through hardship we really don't want this wall that you want i'm guessing the president united states the billionaire president jetting back and forth between the white house and mar-a-lago and florida i'm guessing that he will never talk to not just these workers i talked to in virginia or those tsa employees in cleveland i'm i'm sure he won't talk to them but i would hope he would talk to some people like them he spends his time it is a resort but he doesn't see them to him they're invisible but mr president mitch mcconnell mitch mcconnell could see them he could right now mitch mcconnell was president his office is right down down the hall down the hall on the right about a hundred feet i have shared on this floor before how lobbyists during the tax bill when president trump and the majority in the senate the majority in the house gave a trillion dollar trillion half dollar tax cut 70 percent of that tax cut to the richest one percent people like themselves the president the cabinet many members of this senate many members of the house and i documented and showed as i looked out the store and opened these doors these doors showed this is the place where the lobbyists go in and out of the majority leader's office talking to them about this special interest legislation so i i ask right now senator mcconnell senator mcconnell could come out of this office he could his office he could walk down this hall i'd be happy to open the door with him if that's not contrary to senate rules i'd be happy to open the door with him welcome him he could right now he could right now talk to he could right now vote to reopen the government and get this process moving and tell the president united states he also could go to virginia he could also go to the airport in louisville or in cincinnati and he could listen to their stories but he doesn't seem to be listening either because i i'm guessing if he did he might be a little more inclined to let us vote to get these workers back on the job i'm calling on senator mcconnell to come out of that office to walk down this hall to come here and begin the process of opening the government let's talk for a minute about what the president said last night mr president president continued his record of telling lie after lie after lie after lie of misleading the people he's supposed to serve facts matter so when you hear the president say we need a wall remember it's a fact it's a fact that illegal border crossings are at historic lows it's not fake news my wife says if it's fake it's not news if it's news it's not fake these are facts it's a fact that illegal border crossings are at historic lows another fact apprehensions at the border are down nearly 80 percent since 2000. another fact the president's wall would do nothing to stop opioids coming into our communities first most illegal opioids are seized at legal ports of entry not trafficked over some remote area of texas fact the shutdown makes it harder for customs and border protection to do their jobs intercepting those opioids last year another fact we passed the interdict act bipartisan bill i worked with my colleague from ohio senator portman on bipartisan bill and senator markey from massachusetts to get customs and border protection the screening devices they need to test for opioids why would we focus on the president's vanity project building this wall a promise he made remember his promise i will build the wall and the mexicans will pay for it well he's now asking american taxpayers over time to pay 20 or 25 or 30 billion dollars but why would we focus on the president's vanity project instead of getting getting the agents and technology they need because we can do this with with agents and technology and helicopters and all the things we need to do to protect the border because that's what we want to do we don't want this vanity project we want to protect the border another fact most of undocumented immigrants aren't committing crimes in fact 56 percent fewer criminal convictions for undocumented immigrants than native born texas so a native born texan is more likely to commit a crime percentage likely to commit a crime than an undocumented person living in texas keep in mind the facts of what this shutdowns cost the american people 800 000 federal workers are going without a paycheck 420 000 of them were on the job without pay thousands of contract workers custodians cafeteria workers security guards not only getting a paycheck but they probably never will for this lost work here's another fact the president and senator mcconnell can end the shutdown right now the senate passed a bill unanimously to fund the government in december that's a fact we passed it it's a fact it was unanimous it's a fact the house passed bills to fund the government last week it's a fact senator mcconnell right now could come out of that office could walk down this hall senator mcconnell could put those those house bills on the floor right now we could vote to end this shutdown we could send them to the president's desk and if the president's going to continue his vanity project and continue his this trump shutdown and he vetoes it we have the ability to override it the president doesn't tell us what to do he seems to be telling the republican majority what to do day after day i applaud those who have stood up to him recently and said they want to open the government but it's a fact also this president said i'm proud to shut down the government this president the commander-in-chief of the commander-in-chief of the united states of america the commander-in-chief the top person in this country in this country's government said i'm proud to shut down the government facts matter the fact is president trump has once again as he betrayed the general motors workers in lordstown is he betrayed the general motors support that all the companies that supply building of the chevy cruzes he betrayed those workers he's betrayed these federal workers he's betrayed these contract workers that are making 10 and 12 and 15 dollars an hour he's betrayed the american worker

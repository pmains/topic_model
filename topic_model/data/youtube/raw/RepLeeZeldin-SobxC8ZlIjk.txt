chair recognizes the gentleman from New York mr. Zeldin for five minutes Thank You mr. Speaker I rise today in honor of the one Oh third rescue squadron a unit of the 106 rescue wing on the New York air national guard commanded by Colonel Michael Bank the 106 rescuing is based out of Gabreski Airport in West Hampton Beach located in my home district and has a long and distinguished history of service in October 1991 during the storm that was depicted in the major motion picture the perfect storm in hh-60 and tanker from the 106 rescuing flew to an endangered sailboat about 250 miles south of its base after survival gear was dropped onto the vessel they began their return to base however braving incredibly severe weather conditions the hh-60 was forced to ditch 60 miles south of base in the Atlantic Ocean all but one member of the crew was rescued by the United States Coast Guard Cutter tamaroa in addition in 1998 the 106 rescuing carried out the longest over a water rescue mission in in hh-60 members of the wing were also on scene at Ground Zero during the 9/11 terror attacks and then most recently this past April the heroic members of this squadron saved several lives when an explosion occurred on a Slovenian cargo ship these brave Airmen took immediate action when called upon to offer desperately needed medical assistance on April 24th the cargo ship tomorrow was rocked by an explosion in the forward bulkhead which resulted in the immediate death of one individual and severe burns for three other crew members one who sadly perished prior to the team's arrival 1,300 miles off the coast of Cape Cod at the time of the explosion and holding a crew of over 20 men the situation looked dire for the injured members of this crew Boston Rescue Coordination Center was initially contacted for help who reached out to two canadian vessel in the area however these ships were 12 to 24 hours away at the very least and did not possess the necessary medical capability it was then that the 106 rescuing was called into immediate action to save those lives aboard the vessel less than two hours after the request was made by the Coast Guard this seven-member crew led by major Shawn Bogle boarded a c-130 Hercules aircraft from the 1o second rescue squadron also a part of the 106 rescuing to begin the search and rescue following a five-hour flight and superb airmanship of the c-130 crew the 7 man PJ team executes a complex night parachute insertion of equipment and personnel into the water and then made their way to the stricken vessel after making it on board the 1o third rescue squadron PJ team provided advanced medical care for the next two days until a Portuguese rescue helicopter could hoist the team off an airlift the injured seaman to a higher level of medical care if not for the brave actions of this rescuing that could have very well been a greater loss of life upon that vessel mr. speaker these pararescueman risked life and limb to save these crew members and have more than earned our respect and admiration today I would like to honor major Edward Bogle technical sergeant Jordan Sinclair major Marty Vieira Senior Master Sergeant Eric Blum Master Sergeant Jed Smith Staff Sergeant Brian duller and senior Airman Michael Hartman for their life-saving efforts on April 24th not only today but every day men and women like those in the 106 Rescue Wing put themselves on the line to protect us our families and our communities it is so important that we continue to give our support to our nation's defenders and provide every needed resource for these heroes all Americans should be very proud of the 106 rescuing and their continued legacy of remarkably answering the call to duty Thank You mr. speaker and I yield back

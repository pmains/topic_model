I'm Congressman darrell Issa for 18 years I served in Congress leading the charge against waste fraud and abuse holding people like Lois Lerner at the IRS and Eric Holder the Attorney General in contempt when they failed to meet their obligations to the American people I left Congress to serve in the Trump administration but I feel called today to return to Congress to return to the fight against the corruption that's going on with people like Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff but I can't do it alone I need your help would you contribute five ten or twenty five dollars today to help me rejoin the fight thank you for your support

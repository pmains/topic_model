I want to highlight an important section from the National Taxpayers advocates 2020 purple book and I quote the IRS mission statement says the agency's mission is to provide America's taxpayers top-quality service by helping them understand and meet their tax responsibilities and enforce the law with integrity and fairness to all since fiscal year 2010 the IRS budget has been reduced by more than 20 percent after adjusting for inflation largely as a result of these budget reductions the IRS is needed providing top-quality servicing nor enforcing the law with fairness to all this should have everybody in this room concerned so let me repeat one of those lines the IRS is neither providing top-quality service nor enforcing the law with fairness to all now we can have a debate on whether specific tax law is fair or not fair I suspect that there's a consensus that if a law is not enforced across the board is not enforced the same for everyone or every group that's not fair and I'll open it to the whole panel does anyone disagree with that I think we have consensus but unit unanimity and I think this is really jarring the agency tasked with enforcing the law with integrity and fairness to all is failing at its core responsibilities IRS staffing is on the decline as was noted earlier the agency employed 78,000 people in 2019 nearly 16,000 less people than the employees that had just ten years ago the number of operation staff has fallen by 31 percent the number of revenue agents with the expertise to conduct audits of complex returns has fallen by 35 percent and the IRS is eleven point five billion dollar budget it's six hundred and forty million dollars below that of ten years ago that just doesn't seem right and it's wrong I'll turn to you briefly for a question when you have limited resources you set your priorities you often go after the low-hanging fruit you touched on this in your testimony where's the low-hanging fruit that the IRS seems to be pursuing well the Irish the Irish should be pursuing those who contribute most of the tax gap but as you as you mentioned the simplest returns are those that get audited as that colloquial term but their correspondence exam by the by mail for low-income filers to see more documentation to serve to substantiate their claims right so I love hanging fruit on one hand you can say well go where it's easiest to understand those are the simple individual returns but the potential to find those abusing the the people taking advantage of the system are gonna be the more complex klaris doesn't have the resources and I raise this because it's the individuals and groups that followed the law that are footing the bill for those who skirt the rules I'm particularly concerned with this lack of funding and enforcement is allowing wrongdoers to get away with within a very narrow area our tax-exempt system last week I released a report detailing a pattern of misdeeds by the NRA the National Rifle Association it details egregious spending by NRA leaders extensive self-dealing in conflicts of interest and pervasive efforts to hide their activities and avoid transparency last year in this room I questioned the Treasury Inspector General for tax administration and laid out a series of scenarios similar to allegations facing the NRA and the tig to confirmed that they were worthy of investigation I've asked the IRS to investigate these claims and understand that they cannot share any information due to section 6 103 however I'm concerned that the national tax payer advocates 2020 report that says the IRS is unable to properly administer administered tax laws makes it whole harder to hold groups like the NRA to account I'm as wrong do you believe the IRS has the resources to investigate investigate organizations like the NRA who use the complexity to hide their activities I do know that just generally the IRS is increasingly outmatched by large organizations both because it lacks the resources as you see it needed to do the audits in the first place but also when they do the audits to be able to do them thoroughly and follow through again because these organizations can throw a massive resource at an order to stall it to flood the IRS with the relevant documents to stretch out litigation and the high risks on the other hand is left struggling to pull together funds to actually hire people needed to even start or continue in order right so we have an asymmetry we have the organizations like the NRA or other large corporations who have well-paid highly-trained very sophisticated tax experts and an IRS who is understaffed under-resourced trying to make sure that the law is applied fairly and we can debate the law but I don't think there's any debate as we said that whatever the laws are should apply to all of us not just those who don't have the resources to avoid them thank you I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides to help the IRS fulfill its mission ensure that our tax laws are applied fairly thank you gentlemen let me recognize the gentleman from New York mr.

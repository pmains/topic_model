thank you so much well first to go back to the environmental issue first world countries around the world have clean air and water because the government puts regulations in place to protect them and I know my opponent has previously called foreign policy mind-numbing but I would remind him that when we pulled ourselves out of the Paris Accord we did so to the detriment of our own country we did so to the detriment of our relationships with countries around the world to say that the left doesn't understand growth is ridiculous because in fact when we invest in environmental policies we see strong job growth the numbers are wind jobs are up 34% solar related jobs are up 25% investing in strong environmental policy can breed new industries growing and new jobs for people across this district my question for you in counter to congressman Bratz question is do you want the federal government routinely putting debt on the backs of your children and grandchildren as they did with the tax bill in 2017 that added one point nine trillion dollars to the deficit a debt that is continuing to grow the one point nine trillion dollars to the deficit when we look at who olds art holds our debt the the largest holder of US debt is China as a former CIA officer I have to ring the alarms that that is detrimental to our national security and when we are talking about what it is that I am for I have said time and time again that I do not support Bernie Sanders plan I support a public option plan in fact my dear primary opponent is sitting in the office and this was the one thing we disagreed on and so I questioned again whether congressman brat knows which Democrat in fact he's running against because I am not the Democrat who supported single-payer in the primary I am NOT Nancy Pelosi and I am not President Barack Obama I am a woman who grew up in Henrico County who grew up in this community who was taught service hard work and a commitment to the belief that the American people can be anything and we will lead the way in this world and that's who i am i returned home four years ago because I wanted to get my kids closer to my parents closer to my in-laws closer to my family and I am committed to this community I am committed to making it stronger and I am committed to policies that make sense and that are fiscally responsible because to me it is absolutely hypocritical that we would have someone stand on stage talk about fiscal responsibility after adding one point nine trillion dollars to the deficit after voting against hurricane relief after voting against the omnibus on the bus bill after voting against budget after budget because he didn't want to add to the deficit however when it came time to give 42 billion dollars in tax rates to pharmaceutical companies there he was I want to serve this community it's the community that made me who I am and I asked for your vote on November the 6th Abigail Spann burger

45 minutes Thank You mr. chairman mr. O'Brien in your testimony you use quite a few statistics and it's in fact there but you didn't provide the sources of those so that we could verify that things on page three you talk about the 20 time you use a 20 time multiplier you talked about the three three percent with the poorest people they're just serious could you go back through your testimony and provide us the references of those if you would please we'll be happy to do that um and but that leads me to another because what I heard in your comments you raised a very interesting quite frankly a moral question I think I think everyone in the panel when others would agree that that the African nation needs affordable and dependable energy for them to emerge from poverty and there's a consensus among economists that the best way to do that is using their fossil fuels that they have or they can develop with that but by virtue of some of your testimony it came across that it these Africans and other people in third world nations shouldn't be comes across as they shouldn't be entitled to use them now America can but they can't and so there was a quote that that was given it was forcing a third world person to stay behind by forcing him to use more expensive electricity just so some first World person will feel better about themselves this comes across as immoral and I'm troubled with that and I hope that we can work together somehow that to get across it maybe change change the minds or some some individuals with that but at the time that I have remaining I'd like to hear a little bit of so mr. moss some because you were also providing some very interesting to me I started talking about Africa a year ago the problems that they have with a power and how we can be exporting a coal into Africa to develop so that they can emerge from poverty and I use then I use the model of a 60-watt light bulb I said that's the total power that they have there is a 60-watt light bulb for three hours a day per person that's it so I want you to amplify a little bit more on that and also to reflect back on some of mr. O'Brien's testimony if you would please sure I mean I think that it's absolutely right that the poorest people in the world are going to be hit the hardest by climate change but it's perverse to actually make the world's poor pay twice by compounding their poverty by trying by taking measures that effectively deny them access to power and you know there is no plausible scenario that I have ever seen where African carbon emissions are going to affect global emissions so if it's a global problem the problem is in the current emitting countries it's not you know us denying gone a two or three natural gas power plants is going to have absolutely zero effect globally so it doesn't make sense to try to connect Ghanian farmers who are having trouble with climate change and saying well let's not let gunning farmers get electricity from Ghana's natural gas that just is a logical leap that I think is quite frankly quite quite immoral just one other point I want to make the IEA figures um the international energy agency when they define energy access it's for an urban household of five people 500 kilowatt hours per year that's 100 kilowatt hours per person that is what an American will use in three days so if when you see these scenarios that we can provide universal energy access through you know nice solar panels yes some clinics will run on solar panels yes micro hydro and other technologies are changing every day but if your target is three days worth of electricity per year for somebody of course you can do it through these other technologies and you're not going to be able to build industry you're not going to be able to have households that run refrigerators and washing machines and all the things that all consumers want without being able to provide a modern energy system which given current economics frankly is going to have to be a mix including a lot of fossil fuels in many places and it's true that the prices of renewable technology is coming down if it turns out that renewables are cheaper in Ghana or Kenya or Mozambique then the regulations on something like OPEC are totally irrelevant because OPEC is going to decide project by project on what what is commercially viable that's how they do it so thank you Mon sounds expired this time recognize the gentlelady from Florida and is castor well thank you mr.

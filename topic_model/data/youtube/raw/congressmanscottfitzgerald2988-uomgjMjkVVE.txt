recently had an op-ed piece that I saw in the Hills stressing the importance of government accountability can you tell me about that yeah I mean I think that um one of the things one of the eye-opening things that I've already encountered in DC was uh that there really is uh a role for oversight uh and and it's per the Constitution it's part of what Congress has been certainly delegated to do is to uh take that that role seriously make sure that you're scrutinizing make sure that you're digging into things make sure that you're actually bringing up members of the executive branch in front of those committees and and for the most part asking them serious questions and trying to get answers and and I as part of Judiciary Committee which is very high profile obviously my colleague Jim Jordan who's the ranking member takes that takes that very seriously he's very high profile and along with that what's been examined in some of the Committees that I'm on is uh and especially in in light of the pandemic that there were a lot of federal programs that were created under some of this big spending that was done by the Democrats and unfortunately the Fraud and Abuse has continued to creep up and I the one example I've been using as of late was the PPP program if there was some underwriting by a financial institution uh and certainly all the information was garnered before they issued those PPP loans let's run abuse uh the percentage is much smaller than a direct loan by the SBA when the Small Business Association gives Direct Loans to individuals uh the scrutiny is not there and guess what we've got huge Fraud and Abuse and a ton of money that went out during the pandemic uh that uh I I'm hopeful that at some point uh the IG can claw some of this back but I don't know if that's reality at this point so you know what what the op-ed basically talked about was this uh 4.7 4.6 billion dollars in fraudulent paycheck Protection Program loans I I you know it's one of those things that at the at the moment it helped out a lot of small business is but unfortunately there are a lot of CD characters out there that work the system and got got checks in the mail and should have never received them

i come to the floor with tremendous pride and a heavy heart as we say goodbye to two of the greatest liberal legislators california has ever known henry waxman and george miller i have the honor of receiving henry waxman's endorsement from my very first congressional bid in 1992 but i had been an admirer of his long before that i believe henry's career will be judged favorably by history and going back to his co-founding of the los angeles county young democrats with congressman howard berman back in 1973 his passion for social justice is long and storied and i have to say as a member from the inland empire where we suffer from some of the worst air quality in the nation i am grateful for henry's commitment to clean air he has been a stalwart stalwart of progressive values conducting powerful investigations on water pollution aids tobacco to name a few and who else could have cajoled executives of tobacco companies to claim that nicotine was not addictive under oath only harry now let me turn to the other liberal titan george miller george's work on education and labor issues are unparalleled from leading the effort that raised the minimum wage in 2007 to his commitment to protecting pell grants and expanding college accessibility for all students his support of my bid to the education and the workforce committee made one of this teacher's lifelong aspirations a reality to honor george i plan on renaming the committee education and labor when we retake the majority george's passion and presence on the house floor and in committee was powerful and will be missed the commitment of both these men the commitment that both these men have to the right issues not always the easy or popular issues makes them true public servants and examples for the rest of us to follow and while there is no question that both henry and george have earned their retirement the house is losing two of its fiercest liberal voices and i'm humbled to have served one term alongside these gentlemen but selfishly wish that i could work with them for many more years in departing they leave they are leaving big shoes for the rest of us to fill but i can safely speak for all of us when i say to henry and to george it has been an honor thank you and i yield back

Mr Speaker I rise today to congratulate the United States women's national soccer team on the world cup victory in France for weeks the Americas women's soccer team has captivated the imagination and the enthusiasm of not only America's soccer world but much of that throughout the entire globe their performance over the past few weeks leaves no doubt that they are the best team in the world but their victory sunday is a stinging reminder that members of the team are being paid much less than their male counterparts with four World Cup titles four Olympic gold medals and a long history of dominance they are the most successful team in the history of women's soccer more successful in the world stage then their United States men's counterparts and what we're really talking about here is an issue that's been out there for for many years that is equal pay for equal work the highest paid male soccer player makes $200,000 more than the highest paid female player over the past three years the women's team generated more revenue and higher TV ratings then their men's counterpart the gap is a stark reminder of the persistent and frustrating reality that women's sports are undervalued and their stars simply are underpaid that's the facts but it's not just the playing field where the women's work is undervalued but it's also in the workforce in the United States women who work full time still earn only 80 cents on the average for every dollar earned by a man today's wage gap Rob's women of over 400,000 dollars over the course of their working lives so equal pay for equal work is really a I think a incredible value that we must pursue in this Congress it's the fair thing it's the right thing to do in March I join my colleagues to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act which will give women tools they need to fight pay discrimination and I urge my colleagues in the Senate to pay attention to the strong support for the bill and to ensure that in fact we follow up we follow up and get it to the President's desk also in March the u.s. soccer team sued for equal pay alleging gender discrimination with the men's team supporting their efforts now this really goes back to title 9 that was started decades ago to ensure that in our collegiate sports women could have the same access to the same sporting programs throughout our universities now this week we're gonna see parades in New York and in Los Angeles celebrating this great world championship this victory but shortly after the final whistle on Sunday these women solidified their efforts in history books celebrated by the cheers in the crowd quickly erupted into the pay's a chance of equal pay equal pay showing their support as well in which a groundswell I believe is developing it's time therefore that we in pay disparity on the playing field and in the workplace once and for all congratulations to the United States women's national soccer team go USA and equal pay

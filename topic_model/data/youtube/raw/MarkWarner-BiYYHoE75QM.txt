hi Senator Mark Warner again giving my daily update on the impeachment trial we're now at our supper break we get a half hour to eat and imagine we'll go a few hours longer tonight the last 24 hours since about this time last night through today has been a house managers have made a very powerful case it's been a little bit repetitive but I have to say even if somebody who followed this all of the timeline and the facts are much clearer for me and I think most of my colleagues Democrats Republicans and the fact that it appears that the president both withheld a meeting for the Ukrainian president in the White House and withheld military aid to our Ukrainian allies who were in a war with Russia and they withheld both of these activities so that the Ukrainian president would announce an investigation into the Biden's and an investigation into the frankly debunked theory that somehow Ukraine was involved in the 2016 intervention has been fairly well laid out now I'm anxious to hear from the president's lawyers I want to hear what they have to say I'm curious to see whether they will try to debunk the facts will try to appeal against the facts or whether they'll say the president took these actions but somehow they don't rise to the level of impeachment one question that keeps haunting me though is if the president's lawyers feel that either this isn't the way it took place or there was a different fact pattern I just don't understand why the president's most senior aides who were in the room his closest chief of staff his Secretary of State other senior officials who could give us this full information or the documents that were involved in these meetings in these sessions I just don't understand why those documents and those witnesses wouldn't come forward my hope is my Republican colleagues will reach that same conclusion but only time will tell so stay tuned a few more wild days a few more long evenings but it is remarkable be part of history

I think in bring the subcommittee to order I am once unfortunately senator Akaka Daniel Kaka Hawaii broke two ribs and a minor accident home last week he's unable to be with us to attend the hearing to today and his statement and the witnesses answers to his questions for the record be included in the hearing actually hearing record for today 9s Danny's coming quickly and we look forward to seeing him back again soon he's one of my favorite people we love Danny o'clock around here one of the off the DL and back into the game and his starting lineup and told he will be very soon the today's hearing will examine the recently enacted government performance and results Modernization Act of 2011 and how progress is being made toward its full implementation bipartisan legislation which i sponsored with among others senator Akaka and i want to say senator voinovich i think senator warner maybe senator no I was up senator Brown with Senator Brown a co-sponsor I'm not sure put up in could have been well anybody bunch of us push this legislation the last Congress has got signed into law but we're grateful to all my colleagues for their support and looking forward to hearing while we're doing in its implementation 17 years ago Congress passed the government performance and results act to help us better manage our finite resources and to improve the effectiveness of federal programs given our mind boggling budget deficits today there's never been a greater need for more informed and effective management of taxpayer dollars since 1993 agencies across the federal government have developed and implemented strategic plans and have routinely generated a tremendous amount of performance data the question is have federal agencies actually use their performance data to get better results producing information as we know does not by itself improve performance and experts from both sides of the aisle agree that the solutions developed in 1993 did not work as we had originally anticipated and hoped the American people deserve and are school challenge is demand better results in fact when the bill was passed in 93 I was just becoming a new covenant but when it bill was passed at 93 I think it was sort of referred to as the results act bow they wanted the folks in that administration had a new president and we had a ten-time I think a Democratic Congress but they were focused on performance and on results something that I think the three of us certainly focus on results wanting to get things done Vince cell Lombardi used to say if you're not keeping score you're just practicing he said a lot of memorable things that was one of my favorite he also said winning isn't the only thing no winning isn't everything it's the only thing so we could probably spend the better part of this hearing coming up with fella with his clothes but I like this one a lot you're not keeping score or just practicing but we haven't been doing a very good job of setting clear goals for federal programs least for some of them we've not been doing a very good job of keeping score either and it's time to get into the game and play for real the government performance and results Modernization Act brings a strategic government-wide focus to performance management by requiring the office of management budget to set government-wide goals to align programs from different agencies to work together to reduce overlap and duplication it also requires OMB to seek majority and minority views from Congress on those goals with an eye toward eliminating redundancy within government the law requires agencies to support government-wide priorities by linking their goals to them and working across party lines to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their work pleased to hear that OMB is taking the new law seriously and neroli in fact that one be helped to wreck and I'll develop the new lawsuits especially encouraging that they're also taken it seriously but in early April OMB director Jack Lew along with deputy director for management Jeff science who's with us today issued a memo to agency department heads directing them to begin to implement the new law the memo told agencies to submit the name of a agency chief operating officer to OMB by May second and that was last Monday i think class one day and the name of their Chancey performance information officer by June 1st these positions codified by the new law or crucial to improving the performance of the federal government the memo also instructed agencies to begin holding data-driven progress reviews of their goals by the end of june I look forward to hearing from his designs today about whether these timelines will be met and about how many agencies have put their chief operating officer into place finally the law requires that all the results and performance information agencies generate be placed on a single searchable website this electronic information would replace much of a large performance related documents agencies produce a day that often go on read it will provide this sort of transparency and accountability of agency performance that Congress and the American people demand it will also enable us to see what's working to fix what's not and to make some tough decisions about what problems may be duplicative or not needed this web site known as performance gov has yet to be launched and recent cuts to the electronic government fund make its future a bit cloudy that's a matter of concern to me I know it is to others we hope to hear more today about the website status and importance from our witnesses finally during his State of the Union address a couple of months ago President Obama pledged to merge and reorganize agencies I believe mr. science is leading these efforts for the president and we hope to hear from him and other witnesses about how this new law can serve as a tool for making some of the tough decisions ahead and we know they'll be tough today as we face on parallel challenges both here and abroad and these require knowledgeable and nimble federal government that can respond effectively but concerns growing over the mounting federal deficit and national debt the American people deserve to know that every dollar that they said to Washington is being used with that most potential we need to replace the what I would subscribe is the culture of spin thrift that has become all too common in Washington really in federal agencies across the country replace I called for spendthrift with what I described as a culture of threat and making better use of performance information is an invaluable tool that can help us get there if used effectively it can identify problems find solutions and develop approaches that can help us to provide better service to the people who sent us here for less money than we're spending today better results for less money with that said I'm not going to turn to our witnesses for their testimony but with that said I'm going to turn to send her Scott Brown for whatever's on his mind thank you don't want to know

as crime becomes a major issue heading into November Kevin McCarthy who could very well be the next speaker of the house come January says his plan the so-called commitment to America will address issues like crime and the wide open Southern border on day one for reaction let's welcome in one of Lee zeldin's colleagues in the house uh Wisconsin Republican Congressman Scott Fitzgerald back with us Congressman good morning good to see you good to see you great to be with you guys again uh good to have you back just quickly your reaction to your colleague's performance last night and what's become a surprisingly close race in the state of New York well what Lee was so passionate about I think is uh what we're feeling Across the Nation it doesn't matter if you're in New York or in Wisconsin the homicide rate is way up in and around southeastern Wisconsin we've got individual reminders like this Daryl Brooks case which has been going on Ad nauseam now for the last month and a half with final arguments being made yesterday on six people murdered uh and then we've got a gubernatorial race where our governor Tony Evers his parole board has let out some very dangerous people that have reoffended it it it's not just a partisan issue however it seems that the Democrats simply don't understand uh kind of what they should be doing instead of the messaging that's out there on this yeah and things have gotten a lot worse over the last 22 months of Joe Biden um doesn't matter if you're in Wisconsin Washington or or where we are in New York I'm Daryl Brooks by the way that's the that's the Christmas parade the guy that barreled through a Christmas parade there Joe Biden never went to uh to visit um and he's he's basically representing himself making a mockery of the courtroom uh We've kept a close eye on that as well but Congressman crimes become a big issue to voters all over the country um if Republicans do take the house in November in 13 days and it looks like that's going to happen what do you do on day one uh what I'm proposing and I think you know there's a number of other members that are talking kind of in in a similar fashion about uh trying to come up with either incentives or deterrence to this entire cashless bail thing that's sweeping the nation as the Democrats have taken control it's always it's this bleeding heart kind of proposal that you know it's based on race and the judicial system is unfair and and but but what it's doing is it's opening the the cell door to all of these individuals to continue to reoffend and we've got these very soft liberal DA's Across the Nation that don't get it either so I mean the bill that we have now and I think what many of my colleagues are going to be looking for is some type of proposal to make a significant change at the federal level uh and and work with local officials to make sure that this doesn't continue to happen um and it starts so often with minor are sort of small time offenses it's so rare that somebody you know commits their first crime and that crime is a homicide or a murder or something like that uh Congressman I've got to ask you uh the senate race in your state Wisconsin the Senate comes down to four states these are the states that we've had circles on the calendar Pennsylvania Georgia Nevada Arizona but what's happening in Wisconsin and Iowa is starting to get a lot of attention Ron Johnson senator from your home state is he safe Mandela Barnes the Democratic opponent How concerned are you listen we're not taking anything for granted um I know that there's been a couple of polls that have been out there that have showed that Senator Johnson has got some separation from Mandela Barnes but you know this is Wisconsin and things are always going to come down to late in the evening on Election night so my message to everyone in the fifth Congressional and across the state as I've been driving through some of these districts is to say don't take it for granted keep your foot on the gas and make sure that we close strong and I think Ron Johnson is going to win this race though yeah we're keeping a close eye on that Congressman good luck to you 13 days from today we appreciate you being back with us thank you thank you good to be with you guys again all right

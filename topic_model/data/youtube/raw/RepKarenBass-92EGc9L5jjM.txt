joining me now congresswoman Karen bast the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus welcome thanks for being with us Joe Biden once described the process he went through when he was being vetted by the Obama team is a rather unpleasant medical exam I think I'm paraphrasing him how rigorous has it been for you well you know those questions have to go to the campaign but I do believe that the vice president will pick the person who can best be a partner with him and to help in the healing of this country because so much needs to be done I just think about a hundred and forty-one thousand Americans that are dead because of the problem you were talking about in the last segment it's just unacceptable and would that best person be a black woman because of all the other you know the reckoning of a race the president praising the Confederate flag again was saying he's going to veto the defense bill because of renaming bases isn't it time not just to make the administration look like America as he indicated in that answer de Torre read meaning some black women on the Supreme Court people in his cabinet but a black running mate and that would be a black woman well you know I do think that with all that the president has done every time he's in a tight spot he always goes to race he always goes to division and so if you think about what's happening in the country whether you were talking about policing or now that people are looking at systemic racism hence him sending the troops out to cities there's so much division going upon of course I would love to see him appoint a woman of color as his running mate but like he said he is going to make sure that his administration on every level looks like America and I think that that is absolutely important and sufficient at this time wherever those people might be placed are you at all lost amidst optimistic about the funding battle right now we're Senate Republicans and Democrats are getting together today wait for the first time the next money for kovat relief and there are about two trillion dollars apart so the gap is huge one trillion versus three trillion from what the democratic Democrats are wanting but the Senate Republicans are not on the same page as the White House does this make it better or worse for getting a result well you know I do think it's difficult and what I think is so shameful though on the Senate side is to let people suffer first I mean you know that we passed the heroes Act more than a month ago they've had plenty of time to act and it's like they wait until the car is going over the cliff to pull it back and I just think that's so unacceptable I do believe we'll reach resolution I do believe it will happen but I think that it's just with all of the anxiety and stress that people are feeling now because of how our lives have so dramatically changed with the virus to add unnecessary stress I just think is cool given what's happening in your home state in your home district in LA County do you need a stay at home order now in LA because of the surge well it looks like that and I think that that's especially frustrating because in the state of California the city in the county the leadership did everything they were supposed to do you know we were one of the first states to do that so it is very frustrating that we've had the spike again and I do believe that we might get to the point where we have to shut down I know they're thinking now then maybe we opened up too soon that's hard for me to imagine I mean you don't go anywhere in Los Angeles without seeing people with masks on and you can't get in anywhere you can't go to a store you know you basically can't do anything unless you are protecting others and yourself so I think it just shows how difficult the cogut virus is how difficult it is and then you have states of course I mean look at Georgia where the governor is gonna sue the mayor because she's trying to protect the people in her city it's just craziness but it's what happens when you don't think it's crazy well speaking of craziness of a different sort according to congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio Cortez after votes yesterday she was really attacked by a colleague representative Ted Yoho of Florida who called her a terrible name a really outrageous attack on her using the f-word he's denying it now to us but apparently there were some witnesses to it it was overheard by a reporter women members of Congress being attacked this way from colleagues well I have never seen or heard anything like that before and I'm so disappointed in representative Yoho I work with him we're on the Foreign Affairs Committee together you know I'm glad you're raising it because just 15 minutes ago I spoke to Athens Andrea and I told her that I had heard about what happened and I thought it was completely unacceptable and that I think we need to do something about it after I spoke with her I spoke to Brenda Lawrence who is the chair of the Women's Caucus and I said that we need to come together because as far as I was concerned it was a verbal assault something like that should never happen I do understand that he's not running for re-election but he cannot get away with behavior like that and she told me again just a few minutes ago that wasn't the first time he's done this now a couple of times so right after the first blow up a few hours later he did it again and so we just can't have this and so I know we're gonna be putting our heads together and figuring out how we respond but there will be a response and we have not been able to confirm this yet but there is word that's coming out of the Republican caucus that some of her colleagues I think hazy hunters just confirm this I'm now being told that some of the Republican colleagues went after Liz Cheney for criticizing the president defending doctor foul Qi I don't know what's the matter these boys are that talk about craziness that they seem to be losing it over there but we're just not gonna stand for that we have a woman speaker there's a woman that runs this house and we're just not gonna stand for that so if they are treating there only that way I guess it shouldn't be knocking but I do think that we need to do something I also just finished Janey as a third ranking member of the Republican caucus I just want to point out she has a leadership role right right right I mean they only have a handful of women over there to begin with you would think they would treat them like gold Karen bass it's always a pleasure thanks for being with us today

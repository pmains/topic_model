Hello. I'm Kimberly I'm a member of Senator Mansions Academy
team. Are you considering applying
for a nomination to one of the U.S. service academies? If so, here's a tip that may help.
Start your application now. The senator's application is available
on his Web site at manchin.senate.gov and it's due
October 1. Through the senator's Web site,
you can create an account so you get notifications
of upcoming Academy events as well as be able
to start your application. The application is your chance to shine
and share with Senator Manchin
why you want to attend a service academy. In your application, you will include
your extracurricular activities, volunteerism in your community,
and your academic achievements. You'll need a copy of your high school
transcripts, three letters of recommendation
and your ACT or SAT scores. You should be proud that you are a student
who is considering a life of service. If you have questions, reach out
to Senator Manchin at 304-342-5855. Or send your questions by email
to academy@manchin.senate.gov.

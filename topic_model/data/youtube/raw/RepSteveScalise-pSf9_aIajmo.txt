house minority whip congressman steve scalise joins us now i'm going to divert for a second you know i watch that speech or some of it at least bernie sanders an aoc wrote it what do you say yes stuart good morning good to be with you and they couldn't have written a a more kind of far left socialist speech than what president biden delivered and frankly i think everybody knows that the very far left elements of the democrat party are the ones who are controlling president biden's agenda i don't really know what he stands for in terms of what his agenda is but he's carrying out theirs and it's trillions in more spending it's it's going to be trillions and higher taxes and by the way anybody who thinks bernie sanders who's the senate budget committee chairman is going to stop taxing at 400 000 or whatever the number is going to be the middle class knows they will be paying higher taxes under this biden plan if he gets it and i hope he doesn't get it because it will slow our economy down it will lead to bigger problems and more crises at our border which president biden created he did that with a stroke of the pen by getting rid of well-negotiated agreements with mexico and the northern triangle countries that president trump negotiated so i hope that he doesn't go down the socialist road even further but he's already spent trillions of dollars and every employer today will tell you they can't get workers because we're paying people not to work but it's popular steve it is popular you start chucking around free stuff whether it's com whether it's free education preschool whether it's community college massive subsidies for health care you're chucking around free money somebody else's money that is popular i suspect that he may get quite a lot of what he's proposing what say you stuart there is definitely a sugar high that comes with this idea of everything being free but innately americans know there is no such thing as a free lunch somebody's got to pay for it and usually it's everybody in in the middle class the lower income people are the ones who end up paying the bill for these kind of massive spending programs that's how history is beared out and by the way you know when he talked about the charging stations this is a really good example stuart so 97 of americans do not drive electric cars nothing wrong with electric cars but the idea that we're going to be spending billions of dollars to the charging stations all over america do you know how they actually pay for that because it doesn't get plugged into a tree it's plugged into your electrical grid and families mostly low income families will be paying higher electricity bills because that's going to be on their electricity bill 97 of americans paying for the top 3 electric vehicles charging stations that's the kind of stuff biden didn't talk about last night but that's where the devil's in the details they don't want you to know that but everybody knows they're going to pay for this stuff because somebody's got to pay for it and you know whoever's the rich and who's paying their fair share everybody who's paying taxes is going to pay more money so maybe if you're not paying taxes you think you're going to get away with with this if you pay electricity bill you're going to pay more if you have any kind of income tax that you pay you will be paying more for this plan got it constant steve scalise thanks for being with us this morning i'm i'm really interested to see how much of this radical plan actually gets through the congress and my suspicion is not that much that's my hope at least steve scalise thank you sir we appreciate you being here always we'll be a stronger country if we hold it off thanks to it

every day joining us now is congressman adam schiff one of the members of the january 6 select committee congressman good to see you thank you for being with us this evening and i want to pick up a bit from the conversation that we were just having with michael schmidt who says you know what happens you're gathering lots of information we are more and more certain of the plot to overthrow the election and possibly democracy it wasn't simply an attack on the capital that would have been bad enough but what happens if there isn't something that causes donald trump to be held accountable before the midterm elections well our goal is really to fully analyze what went into this multi-prong effort to overturn the election and how we protect our democracy going forward what kind of recommendations we need to make to make sure we have another never have another january 6th or anything like it uh it isn't really our role to prosecute the former president or to develop evidence for the justice department to do so the justice department should be doing their own investigation they certainly are vis-a-vis the violence on january 6 but they should be doing an investigation of these other multiple lines of effort to overturn the election um but we will consider our work successful if we write the comprehensive report of what took place if we make a series of sound recommendations and if we inform the public about what went on in that respect i think the series of public hearings we're going to do will be every bit if not more important than the ultimate report so when you make the point and you've made it before that it isn't your your job wasn't your your role to do certain things and that the committee by nature of the type of thing it is does not have the ability to prosecute criminally um and that the justice department should be what's your sense of is that sounds a little like the satisfaction from you do you feel that the justice department is pursuing this as vigorously as it should be well i i feel they're pursuing the violence on january 6th vigorously and including people who were not present but nonetheless uh were involved in a seditious conspiracy where i have less confidence is other efforts to overturn the election uh such as the former president on the phone with the secretary of state in georgia uh trying to coerce that secretary into finding 11 780 votes that don't exist i think if you are or i or any of your viewers who are on the phone recording a conversation like that um we would be under investigation and it shouldn't matter that this was the former president of the united states so on those issues i am concerned but in terms of our role we are going to get to the bottom of all of these efforts we're going to make them public and we're going to try to legislate in a way that protects us from any recurrence you make an interesting distinction which you've written about in your book and that is whether you look at january 6 as a day and an attack on the capital violent attack on the capital or whether you see that remarkable dangerous dark attack on the capital and on the process that was underway in congress as being the fruits of an effort to overturn the election itself and to undermine democracy and it is that bigger second issue that is probably of greater long-term concern to us as americans i think that's exactly right and and ali tragically when we look back uh on this uh you know last few weeks where we had the anniversary of january 6 we're in a worse position than we were a year ago um because the republican party has decided uh rather than repudiate what went into that violence on january 6 rather repudiate the big lie about our elections that drove people that violence they're using that lie all around the country to disenfranchise people of color to attempt to subvert the next election their lesson seems to be if they couldn't get a secretary of state in georgia to find 11 780 votes that don't exist they want to make sure they have somebody in that position and others next time who will and so that threat goes on uh and in that sense the work of our committee is not just looking backward it's very much looking forward congressman it's good to talk to you again thank you for being with us this evening california congressman and member of the january 6 committee adam schiff we appreciate

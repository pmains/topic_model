that is where we begin leading off our discussion is Democratic congresswoman karabast of California a member of that House Judiciary Committee good evening to you thank you good evening we saw a lot at Americans really all over the place we're watching what happened in the House Judiciary hearings the late night the adjournment come back when you take it all together or what do you think people should focus on and understand just happened well I hope that people focus on the gravity of this I mean this was just an incredibly important day in our history but understanding how serious it was that the president abused the power of the office for his own personal gain and to make it worse he did it in order to fix or put a weight on the next election in his favor and if you go back and look at the history of when the Constitution was being put together impeachment was inserted in this is exactly what the framers were concerned about they were concerned about foreign intervention especially in an election and a president who would take his authority to beyond to an extreme and use it in an abusive manner and that's exactly what has happened here and why we had to resort to impeaching him what was it like other than what we saw in the room sort of going in and going out with your colleagues given all the rancor with Republicans well I will tell you that there was no joy amongst the Democrats there was no joy at all I think all of us feel the weight of history feel the seriousness of this decision that we made but the other reason why it was so important for us to do this and why it was so urgent is because we also feel as though we're watching a crime while it's being committed and so there was no reason in the world to think that the president was going to stop you know that that infamous phone call was literally the day after Muller testified before the Judiciary Committee were clearly the president felt emboldened that he could take it a step further and interfere in the next election and that is just something that is acceptable so if we had done nothing I think it really would have been a tragedy to our democracy and we just could not sit on our hands when you look towards the Senate trial assuming that the house does vote on this next week what are Americans who take from it apart from the the predictions or expectations about the ultimate outcome what is the point as you say of catching a crime as you put it in progress what's the point of having a public trial and accountability for it well as you know the impeachment process is a two-step process so what we did was essentially indict the president and then we hand him over to the Senate for trial now here's what I'm concerned about the leader of the Senate has basically said he is in lockstep and he is going to coordinate with the defendant and so if you can imagine going into a courtroom in a trial and the foreman of the jury says well I'm working with the person that's you know being accused of the crime and so it's completely inappropriate but Connell should recuse himself but I really think it speaks to the way that trumps the whole way he has gone about his presidency he's kind of infected and contaminated the culture where these the Senate President could feel emboldened enough that he could say yes I'm gonna put my foot on the scale I mean boldly said that he is coordinating with the White House how can a juror coordinate with the defendant you find this corrupt you think he I don't think we have much in common well as you say there's there's much to keep track of here and it's certainly true that as we're going to be covering tonight the Senate appears ready to dispense with traditions that it's held for a long time apparently bowing to trump at least some Republican senators we're gonna get into that congresswoman Karen bass staying up late with us thank you so much

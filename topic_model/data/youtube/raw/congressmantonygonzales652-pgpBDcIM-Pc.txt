chairman I yield back Kidron yields back chair recognizes Mr Gonzalez for five minutes uh thank you chairman Cuomo for hosting me today I represent 42 percent of the Southern border places like Uvalde Eagle Pass Del Rio uh El Paso County that are in the news every single day as a representative of the largest border District in the country I share the frustrations with my colleagues and it's long time for Congress and the administration to stop playing political games and do something I want to first start by thanking you thank you both Chiefs for everything that you do thank you for the men and women in green that every day roll up their sleeves and go to work my first question is the chief Chavez yes or no please do you think repatriation flights work uh yes sir they do for us yeah I'm right they do a repatriation flight is someone that does not qualify for Asylum gets put on a plane and they don't they don't get flown to New York or Chicago or Washington DC they get flown to Haiti to El Salvador or Guatemala they absolutely work uh when there were 15 000 Haitians under a bridge in Del Rio What stopped that was literally around 2000 was it the whole 15 000 Boca people were released into the country but it was about 2 000 people that were that were flown back to Haiti and all of a sudden it stopped uh my next question also for cheap Chavez I have a bill uh the Security First Act that labels cartels as terrorist organizations would you agree that cartels terrorized the people they smuggle and deserve to be prosecuted with higher penalties I do agree that they do terrorize the migrants that they smuggle just from statements and debriefs that we receive when we interview migrants in our custody of course these are evil people that don't even view these migrants as cattle uh they're really treated mistreated in every single way uh next question also for chief Chavez does the border patrol currently have the capacity to permanently house all migrants for the entire length of their Asylum process absolutely not Congressman we do not have that level of capacity in our facilities it currently takes around five years for an asylum case to be heard sometimes longer depending on what part of the country that you take this is the danger of turning an agency like yours that is meant to catch terrorists fentanyl real-time situations and putting you into processing centers uh my next question is uh is for chief uh uh modeling would banning all Asylum claims including people in legitimate life or death situations make the Border more or less secure thank you for the question sir um I don't know that that banning any Asylum claims would make the Border any more secure yeah I think your your sector in particular where the bulk of your the bulk of the people coming over are got aways are essentially trying to flee and Escape that's what I worry with uh with the rhetoric if you divide the two you won't solve the root of the problem which is essentially catching bad people from into our country I want to go back to Chief Chavez uh would would Manpower and Technology would that help start to secure the Border yes sir absolutely Manpower and Technology makes a huge difference in order for us to secure that border can you give me some examples of of where Manpower and Technology have been successful if we go back uh 27th year career back in the mid 90s we had a five mile piece of Border in San Diego from the beach just to Interstate five five miles of Border we were encountering over half a million people and in those five miles we increase the the amount of personnel and we tripled the amount of technology and within uh a couple of years we were able to gain operational control of those five miles of water so it was effective it was really effective but it also added barrier so with infrastructure we were able to uh to gain a significant amount of enforcement there you know a a little over a year ago last Christmas I visited Del Rio I spent 20 years in the military I've spent a lot of of Christmases abroad I wanted to spend this Christmas on the border so I visited the Del Rio Del Rio at seven o'clock in the morning and there was over a hundred migrants waiting to be processed and I'll never forget that day there was one border patrol agent that was exhausted you could see it in the Man's eyes it was 7 A.M his shift had just started and he was already tired and so you can tell that the workforce is under immediate an incredible amount of pressure in the same lens I see a young woman in her mid-20s with a four or five-year-old little boy and that little boy is gripping her hand as tight as can be and all I can think of is what kind of Journey had they had gotten to get to that point and so you know speaking with her a little later her husband was killed uh in the country that they were fleeing what I'm getting at is there there are moments where there are people legitimately fleeing persecution all across the world we got to be respectful that we also have to stop the terrorism and the fentanyl from coming into our country and killing our children Mr chairman I yield back German

um what we did here as you say earlier today from Massachusetts congressman Jake lost he of course is a Democrat and had pretty harsh words for the new majority the House GOP is in complete disarray the 118th Congress can't get down to the business of governing until the House GOP gets out of its own way and chooses who their leader is going to be they made a commitment to America on the campaign Trail they can't even commit to a speaker I think the House GOP has on day two now demonstrated that it's unfit and unable to govern it's a very poor way to begin a addition to the American people for taking uh the Senate kind of take the White House in 2024.

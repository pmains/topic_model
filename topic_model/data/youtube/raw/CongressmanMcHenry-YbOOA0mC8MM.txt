and back here in the United States Congress is getting ready to head out for the summer recess awaiting them when they return in September the highly anticipated vote on the Iran nuclear deal joining us joining us with what we can expect as congressman Patrick McHenry he's a Republican from North Carolina he is also the chief deputy we equip and congressman McHenry thank you for being here today hey thanks for having me back on the president laid out his case yesterday in a call to everyone to listen in all of his supporters he says that this is very important he thinks that it was either this deal with Iran or war what do you say to that I think it's a false premise and that his work is within the Democrat Party to hold enough of his members so we can't override his veto he's got a tough road ahead to actually keep his party together on this bad agreement you know just simply because John Kerry says it's a good agreement doesn't mean that all the Democrats in the House and the Senate will go along with that false premise you're the chief deputy whip you're responsible for counting votes where do you think things stand right now well in the house I mean Republicans are nearly unified and that's nearly all you can ask out of Republicans is to be nearly unified and among Democrats I think we've got a strong group but currently not enough to override the President's veto we need 43 Democrats in the house I think by the time we get back in September the case will have been made by by folks understanding the contents of the agreement that that we will be right on the edge of actually being able to override the President's veto what happens if you're actually successful if you override the President's veto where do you think that leaves us on the global scale just in terms of this deal that we've announced if it doesn't go through what do we do now with the European partners who have said that they would like to in this embargo well look I mean we've had a sanctions regime with Iran effectively globally for the last two years and that brought table prior to that America was the leading on the leading edge of sanctions against Iran and this in this in this regime and so I think we'll return back to what was pre 23 years ago with a majority of global finance flowing through American corporations domiciled here in the United States I think it would have a strong impact of the Iranian economy if we return back to the sanctions regime that we had in place but again that sanctions regime is something that we have relied on Europeans to stick around with and part of the argument for going head with these talks was that that was not going to be held together that our partners were no longer going to stand by with that if that were to fall apart that partnership then what do you do well then they would suffer the economic consequences because if we return to our sanctions regime they would have to make the tough call them whether to you know trade with a number one you economy in the world or do they have a trade with a very small country in the global scale so look at what we've heard from John Kerry is we cannot have 535 secretaries of state I'm reminded of seeing John Kerry during the last administration act not only a secretary of state as the United States Senator but also Secretary of Defense vice president and president so the fact that Congress has a say has an opinion is very much in keeping with our constitutional checks and balances we have to exercise our right on behalf of the American people in the United States Congress and I think we'll have Democrats come along with Republicans to stand firm against this bad agreement that will cause Iran in time to to have all the ingredients for weaponization of nuclear their nuclear technology hey Patrick it's eric nice to see you great to see listen you know I know you've been we miss you by the way hey listen I know you're there and doing a great job counting those votes so you know you know I hear you talk about sort of the the job the president's got head of a man and I think he does because as you know I'm very much concerned I think this agreement is a disaster and you know you correctly pointed out it's a false choice is being shut up that it's either war or it's this agreement so you know what are you hearing from some of the colleagues on the other side of the aisle because I know that there are a lot of very very strong advocates for a strong us-israel relationship there are strong advocates for a strong America trying to stop Iran from its nuclear request what are you hearing from them what are you hearing from the leaders like yourself and the other side of the aisle they hate being put in this box that's the number one thing please let let's let's not vote on this please let's hold off they realize that they're putting a tough choice between the president of their party and their long-term commitment to the security of our best partner and on the glow of Israel and so they don't want to have to make that choice and it's a tough choice for me I acknowledge that but when we're looking for 43 Democrats in the house we can count very easily well past that of those that are committed to Israel committed to a strong national defense and there are some reasonable Democrats in the house they'll come along but their initial reaction is please hold off we really don't want to be put in this box congressman if that's the case then what each of those individual Congress people here when they go back to their districts should be very important what do you think they'll be hearing when they go back to town halls this summer well I think they're going to say stand with Israel I think they're going to say stand against Iran I think they're going to say stand against a bad agreement and once we once American public more deeply understands this this idea that if we want to have in shins we've got to wait 24 days after Iran gives us approval to go into a set group of areas I mean I I don't think the American people like this and I think they're going to hear very strongly vote to vote for the override of this agreement and vote for the override of this president's veto things like those details not being allowed to go in for for days I mean I'm assuming you were opposed to the Steve deal even before that is there a deal that could have been reached that you would have signed off on yes I think they're there was a there was a way to move forward but you can't simply give sanctions relief on day one in the hope of future action from a you know a deceitful and deceptive regime the fact that you're going to have the flow of well over a hundred billion dollars for an economy that's flailing on day one is is deeply problematic that doesn't actually help the stability in the Middle East it actually will help this regime but flow that money into extremist groups whether it's in Syria or around the region all right congressman McHenry we want to thank you very much for your time today we really apprec--

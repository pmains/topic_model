SURROUNDING THE INSURRECTION  AT THE CAPITOL TO THE AMERICAN  PEOPLE. JOINING US NOW, SELECT  COMMITTEE MEMBER AND CHAIR OF  THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE  COMMITTEE, CONGRESSMAN ADAM  SCHIFF.  >> CHAIRMANSHIP, I WANT TO  START WITH YOUR ASSESSMENT  THUS FAR OF THE HEARINGS THAT  HAVE UNFOLDED ON JANUARY 6.  >> WELL, OUR GOAL HAS BEEN TO  EXPOSE THE MULTIPLE LINES  EFFORT BY DONALD TRUMP TO  OVERTURN HIS LAST PRESIDENTIAL  ELECTION. I THINK WE ARE  PRESENTING A VERY CLEAR,  COMPELLING CASE TO THE PUBLIC  HE WAS THE FIRST PRESIDENT  HISTORY TO LOSE AN ELECTION TO  KNOW HE LOST AND YET TRYING TO  HOLD ON TO POWER ANY DO THIS  IN MULTIPLE WAYS. HE DID THIS  BY PUSHING THIS BIG LIE THAT  THE ELECTION WAS SOMEHOW  RIGGED. HE DID THIS BY PUTTING  PRESSURE ON THE VICE PRESIDENT  THIS WEEK DEMONSTRATED TO IN  OUR MOST RECENT HERE TO THE  POINT WHERE TO PUT HIS OWN  VICE PRESIDENT'S LIFE AT RISK  AND INSULATE OTHER BROUGHT  THIS COUNTRY TO A DANGEROUS SO  I THINK WE'VE BEEN CONVEYING  THAT THERE'S MORE TO COME  MORE. I THINK QUITE POWERFUL  EVIDENCE OF THE PRESIDENT'S  CULPABILITY AND A CLOSE. WE  CAME TO LOSING OUR DEMOCRACY  IN TERMS OF WATERGATE, THERE'S  BEEN A LOT OF PARALLELS TO  COMPARISONS TO THOSE.  >> WATERGATE HEARINGS THAT  TOOK PLACE. AND YOU MENTIONED  SOME OF THE CLOSE FIGURES TO  PRESIDENT TRUMP AT THE TIME  THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM THROUGH  THESE HEARINGS. YOU KNOW WHAT  HER FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL  BILL BARR, THE PRESIDENT'S  DAUGHTER DAUGHTER, THE FORMER  PRESIDENT'S CAMPAIGN MANAGER  AND SOME OF THAT TESTIMONY HAS  BEEN DESCRIBED AS STUNNING  THINGS THAT WE LEARNED ABOUT.  YOU KNOW, RUDY GIULIANI, HAVE  WE SEEN OUR JOHN DEAN MOMENT  YET? OR ALEXANDER BUTTERFIELD  MOMENT YET? WE LEARNED THAT,  YOU KNOW, OF COURSE, THE PREP  PRESIDENT NIXON WAS RECORDING  CONVERSATIONS IN THE OVAL  OFFICE THAT SORT OF STUN  PEOPLE HAVE WE HAD THAT  MOMENT. IT COM.  >> YOU KNOW, WE'VE HAD DOZENS  OF THOSE BUT THIS IS A  DIFFERENT TIME THAN WATERGATE.  AND PART OF THE REASON WHY  THIS IS DIFFERENT TIME, I IS  THAT THERE IS A CABLE NEWS  STATION, A DEVOTED TO GIVING  TRUMP SUPPORTERS THEIR OWN  SEPARATE INFORMATION. HARTMAN  NOT EXPOSED TO COUNTRY FACTS.  SO FOX WILL BROADCAST THE SUN  AND THE PRIME TIME AND THAT'S  FOR A AND I THINK THAT IF  RICHARD NIXON HAD HAD FOX  NEWS, IT WOULD HAVE PROBABLY  NEVER BEEN FORCED OUT OF  OFFICE. IT'S A SINGLE  DISSERVICE TO THE COUNTRY THAT  I THINK FOX IS DEPRIVING ITS  VIEWERS OF THIS IMPORTANT  INFORMATION. BUT BUT  NONETHELESS, WE'RE REACHING  MILLIONS AMERICANS WHO DON'T  LIVE BREATHE POLITICS BUT ARE  DEEPLY INTERESTED IN IN WHAT  TOOK PLACE. AND NOW CLOSE,  CAME TO LOSING OUR DEMOCRACY.  IN THAT SENSE. IT IS VERY MUCH  LIKE WATERGATE. YOU KNOW, THE  FACT THAT THE PRESIDENT NEW  THE LIE HE WAS TELLING WAS A  BIG LIE WAS TOLD ATTORNEY  GENERAL. THAT'S THAT'S LIKE A  WATERGATE MOMENT. THE FACT  THAT HE WAS TOLD THAT THIS  PRESSURE CAMPAIGN AND THE VICE  PRESIDENT WAS ALSO  UNCONSTITUTIONAL. THAT'S  ANOTHER WATERGATE MOMENT THERE  ARE SO MANY OF THEM. I THINK  THAT PEOPLE HAVE BECOME DULL  TO THE SHOCK OF FORMER  PRESIDENTS LACK OF ETHICS. AND  THAT IS A CHALLENGE TO DEAL  WITH ONE STATE'S HEARINGS.  WRAP UP. DO YOU BELIEVE THE  ATTORNEY GENERAL MERRICK  GARLAND WILL HAVE ENOUGH  EVIDENCE TO CHARGE THE FORMER  PRESIDENT WITH A CRIME?  >> I ARE GIRL AND THE JUSTICE  DEPARTMENT ALREADY HAVE ENOUGH  EVIDENCE TO OPEN AN  INVESTIGATION. DONALD TRUMP  AND OTHERS IN HIS  ADMINISTRATION IT'S NOT MY  OPINION. THE LOW JUDGE SHOULD  DAVID CARTER, FEDERAL JUDGE IN  CALIFORNIA LOOKING AT A SMALL  SUBSET OF THE EVIDENCE, REACH  THAT SAME CONCLUSION. NOW  WHETHER THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT  WILL HAVE PROVED BEYOND A  REASONABLE DOUBT TO INDICT AND  CONVICT A FORMER PRESIDENT OR  ANYONE ELSE. THEY WILL NEED TO  BUT THERE IS ALREADY AN  ADEQUATE EVIDENCE FOR THEM TO  BEGIN AN INVESTIGATION. AND A  WEEK AND A SITUATION. WE  CANNOT A SITUATION WHERE THE  PRESIDENT CANNOT BE INDICTED,  WHICH IS CURRENTLY THE THE THE  OPINION OF THE JUSTICE FOR SON  HAS BEEN IN THE PAST AND  WHETHER A FORMER PRESIDENT,  THEY CAN'T EVEN BE A CONTEST.  IT BECAUSE THE 2 CONTROVERSIAL  WE'RE DEVICES WERE SOME  POLITICAL BECAUSE THAT GIVES A  KIND OF IMMUNITY TO A  PRESIDENT THAT IS DANGEROUS,  DANGEROUSLY ABSTRACT AND EVEN  MORE DANGEROUS AND VERY  CONCRETE EXAMPLE. DONALD  TRUMP.  >> CHAIRMAN SCHIFF WILL LEAV

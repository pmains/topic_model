hello friends this is your congressman Patrick McHenry I wanted to take a moment out of your holiday we can wish everyone a happy fourth of July for me personally the fourth has long been one of my favorite holidays as a lifelong history buff I've always appreciated the day sacred place in our nation's history it's a day we broke free from our British rulers to form our own nation our own nation a new nation a nation based off the beliefs that we hold dear freedom and liberty for all more so the fourth represents a day we can all come together regardless of your race religion or party affiliation we're all Americans and today we celebrate our nation and its history and its place as a leader of the free world today as you celebrate with friends family neighbors or even strangers remember we're all blessed to be Americans we are the greatest country in the world and we must not forget that thanks so much and God bless

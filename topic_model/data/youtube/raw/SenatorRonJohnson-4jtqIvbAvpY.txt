joining us now is the doctor i mentioned internist and cardiologist from dallas texas dr peter mccullough and chairman of the senate homeland security and governmental affairs committee and senator from wisconsin ron johnson gentlemen welcome to the show so glad to have you and speak more about this um dr mccall i read some of your resume there and senator johnson on top of being a senator you've also been a very accomplished businessman and ceo uh dr mccullough i want to start with you uh because it's interesting to me that they would attack you so aggressively and what does it feel like to have the mainstream media and people on the left dismiss this medical findings that you have found well let me thank you for being on the show and i'll state that my opinions are my own and not necessarily those of my institutions but i think this reaction is actually welcome because it means we're on the right track throughout history in the middle of crises the answers have never been given down from big institutions big government or from any other types of ivy towers innovation has come from practicing doctors and creative doctors in research in fact we're on the right track an early multi-drug home treatment for covet 19 clearly works yeah and senator johnson you're clearly presenting you know these new different evidences and voices out there um and they're treating you like a cheap salesman well first of all the hearing wasn't about hydrostatic when the hearing was about early treatment as dr mccullough presented in our hearing there's really four pillars in in dealing with the pandemic it's first of all trying to reduce the spread he'll flatten that curve then early treatment then hospital treatment and finally vaccines we've completely ignored the second pillar which is early treatment and unfortunately thousands of people have died because we've ignored it and i think that was the question we were asking why i wasn't you know recommending i'm not a doctor any treatment but obviously the president talked about hydroxide fork when i think that poisoned well for all early treatments but there's in ivormectin there's a host of things that we should have explored we should be using we should be letting doctors be doctors and we should be celebrating their their their courage and their compassion rather than raking over the coast calling them names in some cases you know queensland australia actually putting them in jail this is ridiculous well yeah and big tech by the way any time you talk about it either shuts you down demonetizes you takes it out it's funny i think you're absolutely right senator the thing that i find so fascinating doctor is you know when when i go to my doctor i sometimes will bring up you know something that someone else has said hey i know my friend has taken this before i've heard this on the radio and they'll say well in your particular case you're not eligible for this because this or you're not a good fit for it right the goal as senator johnson said is a doctor to talk to their patient about what's best for them so what are some of these early vac treatments that might be worth discussing with a physician if you are diagnosed so sean you're right so medicine is both an art and a science and whenever faced with a crisis doctors actually do innovate and find the solution and then later on clinical trials come in and refine the approach so what we know is that there are drugs that work to reduce the viral replication in cells and they include hydroxychloroquine ivermectin either one of those combined with doxycycline or zithromycin they work to reduce viral replication but that's just the first phase of it we know that when covet has pulmonary symptoms that patients respond to steroids a common steroid would be prednisone that we use in asthma anyway and then the last part of covid which is probably the most important is internal blood clotting or thrombosis and we know there that blood thinners oral blood thinners as well as by injection and aspirin all have been shown to have a marked favorable impact on covet 19 so we actually need all three things anti-infectives steroids and anti-thrombotics in order to manage covet 19 at home and when this is done doctors and this has been shown in america and outside the united states can reduce hospitalizations by about 85 percent and drop mortality in half so senator johnson all you did was give a platform for medical experts to come in and explain that there are some things that can be done early on in this and this is how you were treated what what did you i mean even senator tom carper expect a lot of excuse me expressed a lot of skepticism i mean i i think you did the right thing but but it was amazing the way that the media and the left attacked you for just giving a platform for experts to talk about it well first of all it goes to the territory they can attack me all they want but when they call think oil sales men they're referring to people like dr mccullough and dr uh rish and dr fareed that these these are courageous people dr freda has treated over a thousand high-risk patients exposed himself to covid and they're being raped through the coals so this is just completely unacceptable but the current nih guidelines for covid is do nothing send people home scared afraid give them no treatment whatsoever explore no treatment and if you just if you get sick enough go to the hospital and nobody wants to go to the hospital and potentially if you die in the hospital you'll never see your family again that is not compassionate care and there's a term that dr mccullough could introduce me to the the circle of empathy and we had a witness that the democrats called dr ja totally outside the circle with empathy because he admitted he never had treated a covet patient and he's raking these guys over the poles you know he's the guy that by the way wrote that that op-ed that referred to them as snake oil salesman they're not selling anything they're trying to save lives yeah well this is absurd what's happening i got to say this i just want to say thank you both for at least bringing this information forward again it should be made between a doctor and a patient but folks in the media have no medical expertise and should not be judging this and senator johnson i want to thank you for giving a platform for people to at least discuss this because you're right at least knowing this so i appreciate you both being here and sharing this with our audience and i hope that you will give us an update at some point soon we're doing it again next week it'll be part two because this is so mischaracterized we're gonna give it another shot all right well we're out of time and we'll have you back so thanks so much

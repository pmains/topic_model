we thank you for joining us here um one of the things we wanted to really talk about today is the child tax credit that's contained in the american rescue plan that's going to be significant for new hampshire families it's going to lift an estimated 8 000 kids in new hampshire out of poverty it's going to impact tens of thousands of other kids and families in our state the support that exists in the rescue plan would uh increase the tax credit for a number of families it would make it fully refundable for those who earn below the threshold that doesn't allow them to fully take advantage of that credit today um and really i think this is going to be a game changer um and when you couple that with the assistance that's in the bill in the form of direct checks of help for making child care more affordable for housing security for unemployment benefits for those who are working fewer hours or who have dropped out of the workforce altogether support for our school districts and state and local government this is really a comprehensive proposal that i think is going to help um strengthen our communities strengthen our families make sure we can come out of covid uh as best we can and help meet the challenges that people are facing

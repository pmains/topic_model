president let me first of all join with my good friend senator cardin and appreciating the incredible work that really so many federal employees have done to make these programs work i was with the sba director i think the uh about two weeks ago on friday she said in the first 14 days of the ppp program they did 14 months of loans in that 14 day period and i thought many times secretary mnuchin set these high standards for how quickly we would get to each of these these points and probably only later realize just how difficult it is to get the federal government to move but this is a case where the federal government has moved the congress has moved working together we didn't have the element of time on our side we really had to move quickly and i think we all knew when we were doing that that we were going to have some miscalculations whether it was the amount of money for ppp or a program wasn't quite as refined as it needed to be and hopefully we're right now trying to look at not only how we have filled in the blanks on the programs that we so quickly dealt with in march but also to look forward at may and july and try to figure out what the economy is going to need where we're going to be in this health care crisis in may and july certainly a number of our states are beginning to reopen uh states like missouri are opening and what i think is exactly the appropriate way the governors looked at the whole state and said we're going to allow we're going to step back from our initial order in the entire state we're going to remove that order but he's then worked thoughtfully and carefully with the mayor of saint louis and the mayor of kansas city and the county executives in bigger counties the mayors of colombia and springfield and not gotten fights with local officials about situations that they have every reason to know more about than he does just like the governor of missouri has every reason to know more than somebody in washington d.c about when our state should reopen i'm glad the president has let governors have that sort of authority and i think in most states including mine governors have stepped back and let local officials assert their view of what should happen in the area where they've been elected to be responsible and with that combination of things we're going to reopen and begin to see the economy reconnect again like it has not connected for the last couple of months at the same time we've got these two fights one is to save the economy and one is this important fight against the virus i think in the two months since we went home after the the cares act i've spent most of my time working on the health care side of this senator alexander is the authorizing chairman on the for these health care programs i'm the appropriating chairman for most of them programs that certainly in the last months americans have learned a lot more about than they ever knew about before who knew that the center for disease control the cdc was doing what it was doing or that health and human services had the responsibility that they had or how troublesome it was if we let our hospitals get out of whack in terms of income and continuing expenses all of those things happen one of the things i've worked on hard has been to get that research funding at the national institute of health where dr fauci runs only one of the double handful of agencies at nih the infectious disease part of that but the american people begin to see those things that the government does and also see that the government like every every other family or every other institution doesn't respond to crisis with immediate efficiency but does begin to work its way toward a solution so we've spent a lot of time together with senator alexander and i have with fda and with all of those other agencies and what we see happening what i see happening is a real willingness with the total backing of the congress a real willingness to get out there and try to move these solutions at a faster rate than we ever have before dr fauci said early on that if we developed a vaccine in 18 months that would be the world record for a u.s developed vaccine from a new virus to having a vaccine available we're trying to do everything we can not only to meet that potential world record but to beat that world record and how are we doing that we're doing that with things like the shark tank concept at nih that we specifically put one billion dollars behind in the last bill one billion dollars for a place where people would bring ideas for vaccine for therapy for testing and you'd have that shark tank environment begin to evaluate which of those ideas deserve the help of the federal government to push them forward faster and how would we do that how would we push them forward faster in in you know obviously vaccine is what we need to fully emerge in my view from this therapies to deal with people who get the virus before we have the vaccine and testing to know whether you've had it or not and hopefully have some level of immunity or testing to know whether you've got it and we've got to do better on all of those fronts on testing we need tests that are easier to take and and get a quick response we need millions of these tests that millions of americans will take more than once if you're at a factory if you're in a close situation if you're on a college campus the administrator the boss you made they decide i want to take that test every week and i want to call my mother every week from this college campus and told her i've taken the test again just like i told you i would i was okay last week i'm still feeling okay nobody in my dorm is sick it's okay that i'm here and that's the kind of thing that will get us started well how so how do we get to that quick easy response test how do we get to that therapy and and how would the shark tank work people bring in ideas um let's assume that but on testing that the shark tank decides there are really ten of these that have real potential to work and we're going to begin to advance them and then at some point there are four of them that are still one or two steps away from being fully vetted but you don't want to wait till they're fully vetted to go into production and so that's where another billion dollars an agency called barta is to take that's that billion dollars and find a private partner and say we're going to go ahead and produce all four of these of these tests we're going to have all four of these tests ready 30 days from now when we know which one works because 30 days really matters 30 days and getting back to school 30 days and generating the economy if you're 30 days ahead of where you would have been otherwise that has you can put a lot of money behind that and still pay only a fraction of what we've been putting behind trying to stabilize the economy and if two of them work in that 30-day period of time when you're going ahead and manufacturing all four of them they're just ready quicker than they would have been otherwise and if the two don't work you know madam president we hear often the idea of failure is not an option this is a case where actually failure is almost a certainty on some of the things you're trying if you're not failing you're not trying enough things if all you did was advance four things that were going to work anyway you really didn't take much of a chance to fast forward or dual track what you're trying to do and so we're working hard to get ready to have those tests a test where you have a normal blood draw to check your cholesterol you could say when you turn that doc to your doctor also check for coven 19 if they don't ask you if you want to check for coven 19 and then they can say you have it and hopefully by the time that test is available they can say you have it and you have enough of the antibodies you have enough of what it took to fight this off uh that you should have immunity up until the time we're likely to have a vaccine that many americans then know they're out there not with no danger to themselves or no danger to others that many americans know that in all likelihood they can safely visit somebody they haven't been visiting for a while because they didn't want to take a chance of carrying a virus that now they know they can't possibly get and so those kinds of things will make a real difference in our economy therapeutics that we don't have the vaccine yet you get the disease we need to find and fast forward the manufacture of the therapeutics we think are most likely to work and the same with vaccines and on all those fronts we're making headway i think we're probably testing sophisticated testing for the antibodies and for just a diagnostic test uh we're having lots of interest in that lots of private sector interest and an antibody test this sclerosing test where you you know particularly if scientists begin to say if you've had it and you have this level of antibodies you can't get it again who wouldn't want to take that test and we believe the authorizing chairman the appropriating committee senator shelby senator senator alexander senator murray and i all believe that the government should pay for that test and we've said the government should pay for that test if your insurance company won't most insurance of companies have said they'd pay for that test seems like to me if you've got millions of customers and a guaranteed payer this is one that the private sector is quickly about to take care of on their own and thank goodness for that this is one of those times when a the most sophisticated pharmaceutical medical science laboratory system in the world begins to pay off and that's what we're going to see here we've got other areas where companies are working together like they haven't before where i know they've told our friends at the national institute of health if we can test their experiment better at our facility than they can bring it over here and test it over here we need an all-out effort to get this economy going again we need an all-out effort to get people's health secure and once that's happened i think we'll see all of those things come together and so madam president i think we've made great strides i haven't heard anybody say in some time on this issue the congress just hasn't provided enough resources to do this job on the testing therapeutics medical device side of this personal protective equipment side of this people look at what the congress has stepped up and done and said okay the congress has given us the tools now the administration the research scientists of america american pharmaceutical companies medical companies have to step in i believe they are stepping in let's break some records here let's do some things quicker with the same amount of safety that we've done in the past there is a dynamic need to do this the american people understand why it needs to be done people all over the world would benefit from our leadership here i think we're seeing it hopefully we can continue on these efforts to have the bipartisan determination to win these two fights the fight against the virus and the fight for the economy that the american people deserve

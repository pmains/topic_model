good afternoon everyone i'm congresswoman lori trahan and i'd like to thank each of you for taking the time to participate in this very important telephone town hall whether this is the first time you've joined us over the past year or your ninth welcome it's been a difficult year for all of us and and that's a tremendous understatement for the families of the nearly 17 000 people just here in massachusetts who lost their lives to covet 19 and the hundreds of thousands of others still struggling to make ends meet as we work to defeat this virus i've heard from so many folks in communities across the third district over the past 12 months about the need for additional relief and most recently the need for accelerated vaccine distribution i can promise you that those messages were heard loudly and clearly as were the cries for help from across our country the need for additional relief couldn't be more urgent which is why i was thrilled earlier this year when president biden unveiled the american rescue plan a comprehensive relief package that builds on the down payment we made last december and finally meets the moment in our fight against covent 19. i was proud to cast my vote last week to send this historic package to the president's desk and now that he's signed it into law it's important that you know what to expect in the coming days weeks and months for working families the american rescue plan fulfills president biden's promise to provide two thousand dollars in direct assistance to households in need by providing them fourteen hundred dollar checks per person following the six hundred dollar down payment from december it extends access to critical unemployment benefits including the three hundred dollar monthly supplemental benefit through september 6 for workers who have been laid off as a result of the pandemic to help folks struggling to pay for food and rent this package makes key investments in food assistance programs like snap and wic and it provides more than 40 billion dollars in housing assistance to cover rent mortgage and utility bills and one of the most important provisions of the plan that we were able to expand the child tax credit to make it fully refundable for 2021 and increase the annual amount from the current two thousand dollars per child to three thousand dollars per child or thirty six hundred for a child under at the age of six and it will allot those checks to families in monthly payments that's key because currently there are 27 million american children who do not receive the full value of the current two thousand dollar tax credit because their parents do not earn enough money to get more shots into more arms the american rescue plan provides more than 20 billion dollars to establish a national coven 19 vaccination program and improve the administration and distribution of vaccines including allocating funds for fema vaccination sites across the country another provision that hits home for me as a mom of two young girls is president biden's plan to allocate 130 billion dollars to support efforts to reopen k-12 schools and to make sure we're prioritizing the safety of our students and educators during that process massachusetts schools stand to receive more than 1.8 billion dollars so that they can work with public health experts to ensure the safe return to in-person learning the american rescue plan goes a step further to support working parents looking to return to their jobs full-time by investing another 39 billion dollars to rescue our nation's child care system from the brink of collapse that fund alone will deliver 512 million dollars in federal child care investments and another 13.6 million in head start funding to the commonwealth of massachusetts integral to our getting women back to work and stimulating our economy for our small businesses and nonprofits this legislation increases funding for the paycheck protection program and creates a 28 billion dollar restaurant revitalization fund to aid non-corporate restaurants and bars hit hardest by the pandemic to support state and local governments and their workers who have been forced to shoulder an overwhelming majority of the burden in responding to covid the american rescue plan provides 350 billion dollars in new funding that will keep our first responders our frontline healthcare workers and other essential employees paid and on the job i'm glad to report that the commonwealth will receive more than four and a half billion dollars and our local governments are estimated to receive over 3.4 billion dollars finally the american rescue plan delivers for our veterans by ensuring that they won't have any co-pays or cost-sharing retroactive to april 2020 for preventative treatment related to covid and it provides funding to mitigate the pandemic's impact on the va's benefits claims and appeals backlog now i know that was a lot and we have a lot of questions about the specifics of these provisions what they need for communities here in the third district and additional provisions that i wasn't even able to get to so but first i want to make sure we get to as many of those questions as possible and i'm fortunate to be able to do it with some help from our incredible guests who i'm so grateful for taking the time to join us our first guest is mayor michael nicholson a lifelong gardener resident who in his spare time also serves as the chair of the city school committee mayor nicholson is a proud graduate of gardner high school and umass amherst where he earned dual bachelor's degrees and a master's in public policy in it in addition to overseeing gardner's response to the coven 19 pandemic since his election last june mayor nicholson and his administration have worked to secure over six and a half million dollars in grant funding for the city broken ground on gardner's first dedicated elementary school and so much more i'm particularly proud of the work we did together last fall to help deliver broadband internet access to gardner residents who wouldn't have had it otherwise a challenge still faced by too many families in this day and age which has only been felt more acutely due to the pandemic i look forward to continuing to work with the mayor as relief from the american rescue plan flows into gardner in the coming weeks mayor nicholson thank you very much congresswoman very happy to be joining you here today and uh look forward to the discussion we're going to be having thank you terrific our second guest hardly needs an introduction john silva is the president and ceo of greater lawrence family health center where he leads the community health center's efforts to deliver high quality health services to the most underserved in the greater lawrence region throughout his 40-year career in service to communities across the commonwealth and beyond john has revitalized distressed community health centers and developed and expanded health center services delivery locations and patient access for countless families in addition to his current role leading our nation's first ever teaching health center he has also held a number of leadership positions at the national association of community health centers including leading the organization as its president throughout his career john has been an agent of change an innovator and a leading voice for community-based primary care across our country i'm honored to be able to call him a friend and i'm so grateful for the time he took to show me around the health center's vaccine distribution facility in lawrence just over a week ago where they're doing incredible work getting shots into arms welcome john thank you congresswoman and um right back at you for all the great work you've been doing on behalf of the district it's a pleasure to be joining you this evening well the reason why folks tune in is to hear from you uh so i am going to get right to our first question uh mayor nicholson this one is for you and i think it's a really important one there's been a lot of misinformation out there about what the state and local funding in the american rescue plan is going to be used for in fact one of the questions we got was about this money being used as a bailout which simply couldn't be further from the truth wondering if you can give us some insight into what expenses gardner has had to step up and provide to get folks in your community through this pandemic well thank you very much congresswoman that's an excellent question to ask because there is a lot of misinformation that's out there gardner right now is projected to get about 6.1 million dollars from the uh american rescue package and that's going to do wonders for us i mean if you just look at the past year and what we've done with the cares act in terms of getting ready for our vaccination clinic working in our schools to make sure that we have the proper technology and equipment in place that when our students go back into the schools and we are operating in a hybrid model right now in gardner that we are in a safe environment in which our students can still thrive and get the high quality education that they deserved over the past year we spent about 315 thousand dollars just on laptops and it's the first time in gardner public schools history that every individual student in gardner public schools now has their own laptop so that they're able to make sure that no financial barriers make it so that no student had access to the adequate technology they needed when we were in that remote learning period or even this hybrid period that students are home three days a week and in the classroom two days a week uh that they're already our students are already struggling enough because of the pandemic and the different mental aspects that go along with not being in the classroom and having to learn in a different environment and adjusting to not being with their peers that we want to make sure that there's no barriers to make sure that they aren't in that situation that they just can't keep up with their peers who may be in a more affluent situation we also use that funding to help a food bank program that we have uh going here in the city to make sure that our students don't go hungry when they're not in school we spent about i want to say it was close to 60 000 just in the fall alone and this is a program that we did in the summer fall and we're continuing now where any person under the age of 18 in the north central mass region can stop by one of our drop-off locations and pick up a free kit in that kit and it has a breakfast lunch and dinner already prepared that just needs to be heated up that way we make sure none of our children go hungry during the period we've updated our hvac systems in our public buildings and in our schools to make sure that the people utilizing city hall and our schools are all in a proper ventilated area to make sure the air is circulating to make sure that we are cleaning the air and there's no pathogens that could potentially spread the virus from one person to another so there really is a lot in this package that really helps us as we go forward that people may not realize because you kind of take it for granted you walk in a room you may not see the air filtration system in place but it's something that we were able to use this funding that we would not have had the funding for otherwise and i think the biggest impact that we've seen with funding like what you see in the american rescue plan that's going to help us even more is gardner's vaccination clinic right now is serving primarily 12 towns in north central massachusetts including the city of gardner but again we are welcoming anyone from across the commonwealth so one of the things that my administration did back in february was we met with the different town administrators from westminster asham templeton westminster hubbardson and the different area uh town administrators and town managers and talked about how we all have this money that we've received from the federal government for you know covert responses and for vaccination use how can we pool that together to make sure our regional clinic is actually as successful as it can be so we are sharing the cost of our regional vaccination clinic so haywood hospital who's our contractor and partner in running that vaccination clinic hasn't put a dime into that clinic because we understand that the hospital themselves has been strapped the past year with everything that's been going on with the pandemic that we're really doing it as a cost sharing measure and a regional measure measure because we've gotten funding like this so this is going to be something that's going to help us in more ways and isn't even close to a bailout uh well those are incredible examples and so indicative of what we saw on the ground right it was community people in as you mentioned cities and towns banding together and doing what needed to be done over the course of this difficult year i mean this funding was such a priority for us because of the essential public workers whose jobs have been at risk for the duration of this pandemic and we're talking about our first responders our policemen our firefighters our emts who are responsible for transporting uh people to the hospital if they get sick or injured and we know that to date 1.4 million local government workers including these heroes have lost their jobs because of these budget constraints so help is on the way and i know for you mayor it can't come soon enough john this next one is for you and it's about the role community health centers are playing in the vaccine distribution process emily and haverhill wants to know who is eligible to get vaccinated at greater lawrence family health center's haverhill vaccination site and whether that will be expanded in the coming um i think that's a that's a very good question um specifically the role of community health centers in the commonwealth and throughout the country has been um vital in that uh because we we serve the uh the poorest or the largest minority or the most rural populations in the country federal vaccines have been directed directly to community health centers so that they can be delivered to really the the highest risk and the highest need areas equity is playing an important role in the distribution of the vaccines and health centers are a key player in terms of haverhill it's a pretty simple answer anybody is eligible to get vaccinated at our haverhill vaccination site as long as they qualify and are eligible according to cdc and uh the commonwealth of massachusetts department of public health criteria uh right now and i think everybody that's on this call will probably know this anybody that's 65 and over qualifies right now anybody that has co-morbidities qualifies all the health care workers the forward-facing workers the emergency care workers very recently teachers were added and according to the governor the expansion to everybody in the commonwealth will occur on april 19th so if you come to the site and the site is at two water street in central plaza and you don't qualify you will also be able to register name register put your name in to get an appointment when you do qualify um but what i would encourage emily to do is um is reach out to the mayor's office they can help you in terms of uh the specific criteria and whether you fit or not um and yes the best answer to this question is the is at the end um uh there will be significant access and expansion um over the next few weeks culminating with the entire public being eligible by april 19th such great news you know i'll just add that what the our community health centers in lawrence lowell and fitchburg have been doing for the past year has been nothing short of incredible which is why i'm especially proud that the american rescue plan includes 7.6 billion dollars in funding to further support uh covid response and vaccination efforts you know i said in the beginning i got to see firsthand the work being done at the greater lawrence family health center's vaccination site a couple weeks ago and i can say for certain that these funds are ensuring that the heroes working there and at the health center vaccination sites across the the third district are getting the support and resources from washington that they need uh to continue doing their jobs safely and efficiently and also making sure that we're closing um these disparity gaps that we've seen and so for so long uh in our in our underserved community so thank you for that john i think this next question is for me uh jason from chelmsford asked since the since the part of the relief package about the stimulus checks changed this time around who is eligible to get the payment and when can we expect them well that's a great question jason when we took up and passed the first version of the american rescue plan in the house back in february we voted to provide direct payments to the same group of people who previously had access in the cares act and in the december package meaning individual filers making 75 000 or less would receive the full amount and it would phase out for people who made up to a hundred thousand dollars individually and those thresholds uh doubled for joint filers when the senate took up the legislation they narrowed the pool of people who would be eligible for this round of payments so in the final version of the bill individual filers making less than seventy five thousand and joint five dollars make less than a hundred fifty thousand will still be eligible for the full fourteen hundred dollar payments where it's different is the phase out instead of phasing out at a hundred thousand dollars for single filers and two hundred thousand for joint filers the new provisions added by the senate phased out those payments much quicker uh individuals making more than 80 000 and joint filers making over a hundred and sixty thousand will not receive a direct payment now it's not what i wanted to see happen but in my opinion you know we simply could not afford to hold up passage of this bill and the ability of the most vulnerable in our community to get this release under the senate's version of the survival check provision nearly 4 million people in massachusetts will receive a payment and those have already begun hitting bank accounts so to answer the second half of your question if you haven't received your payment already and you want to know when to expect it you can head over to the irs website at irs.gov and click the get my payment option to find out when you can expect your payment to hit okay we got another quick question on this issue from matthew who wants to know since he did not qualify for the previous checks because his parents claimed him as an adult dependent on their 2019 tax form if he qualifies for a direct payment under the american rescue plan well matthew the short answer is yes adult dependents are now eligible for the fourteen hundred dollar survival check under the american rescue plan it's important to note however that the ability of a dependent adult to get their payment rests upon the income of the taxpayer claiming you on your taxes that means the payment uh phase out at the same eighty thousand dollar threshold for a parent who is a single filer and a hundred and sixty thousand for parents who are joint filers okay mayor nicholson julie from westminster in westminster asked a question how can we ensure our children will be safe when they return to school what precautions have you all taken in gardner so that's a question several parents have been asking especially with the re the state's recent decision for students in elementary and middle school to return back to school by certain dates and i can tell you that every school district across the commonwealth right now has been working to address this issue i can tell you in gardiner we've replaced the hvac systems completely in all of our different school buildings we've had independent testing done on all of our hvac systems and if a classroom found out that the reading wasn't the rating wasn't as high as we had hoped even though it passed uh general inspection we went out and we bought a separate filter to put on the um on the air vents in that classroom just to make sure again that air is circulating and it keeps moving forward uh our desks being three feet apart we've there is some science behind it to show that with a mask that there is some scientific background to show that that distance is okay while students are masked together and then we further move them apart to that six foot difference when a student is unable to have the mask on when they're eating lunch and gardner public schools one of the things we're doing is we're separating the students who are bringing lunch with them versus those students that are getting a school-based uh school purchase lunch because we understand that gardner does have a high percentage of students that do participate in the free and reduced lunch program that we're able to separate students more that way by you know adding the different rooms for those different students to make sure that we do have the space to spread students out and we are still able to provide a hot meal for students who just simply need it and for some of our students that meal that they receive during the school day is probably one of the only hot meals they receive so we want to make sure we are able to continue to offer that in a safe manner you know and i think a lot of the things to remember with this too is our schools teach a lot more than the traditional reading writing and arithmetic our students our schools teach students how to interact with each other how to be friends how to learn how to share how to learn how to be respectful toward others how to public speak and there's a lot more to a school system than teaching a student what material is printed on a page in a book and i think that while we've done an excellent job here in massachusetts and working with the different programs that we've received from funding from the different federal programs that we've talked about this is just going to add that extra layer that we can still do in a safe manner one of the other things that gardner public schools has done is that there are designated mast break areas in the hallways in our schools that if a student is feeling you know i'm having a you know a hard time catching my breath or i'm just hot under my mask they can step out in the hallway for you know a two minute break and pull down their mask in a designated area and then simply put their mask back up and go back into class and that's something that we're working with our teachers to make sure that we are able to provide that service there and i think the last thing the garden is doing right now is last saturday and then again this friday gardeners offering regional vaccination clinics for just our teachers to make sure that our faculty and staff are doing all they can to make sure that they aren't being susceptible to the virus and they also aren't spreading the virus to our students and everyone there is protected and while our students may not be eligible to receive the vaccine yet our teachers have been made eligible so we are doing separate dedicated clinics for our teachers that way too there's a lot of things different school districts are doing and a lot of it is regional and fashion no one's reinventing the wheel here because no one's had to deal with a situation like the covert 19 pandemic before so by working together and coming up with these creative solutions things really are going to be safe in the schools this year and i'm very excited to see how we can take all of the out of the box thinking that we've done in the past year to make sure that our schools are operating in a safe environment with new technological means to make sure our students are keeping up with the curriculum given everything that's thrown at them and use that as a launching pad after this pandemic is over to see what we can do next i really think it's going to be quite a positive impact on us in the commonwealth well thank you mayor you know and if it hasn't been said enough uh let me just reiterate our gratitude uh for everything that our administrators uh our teachers our custodians all of the staff are doing continue to do to get our kids back into the classroom i know this is one mom who is really looking forward to getting her daughters back into back into school and your focusing on the logistics of making sure that's done safely and also just compassionately is so appreciated john you will receive vaccine distribution for one of the most economically and racially diverse communities in the commonwealth roslyn from lawrence asked what is your health center doing to ensure vaccine equity and what can we all do to make sure we don't leave anyone behind in the vaccination process well first of all we're bringing vaccines to the community we're not expecting the community to come to us we're setting up locations using resources including the national guard to expand our vaccine accessibility and expand locations as you know since december the health center has been engaged in standing up staffing and equipping and operating vaccination clinics not only for our staff and our patients but for our entire community that means in the city of lawrence out of our 62 000 registered patients 45 000 of those are are in lawrence and the vast majority of those are are are latino there has been a difficulty of accessing that population in terms of getting them in and vaccinated in a steady and a consistent manner until we began opening up vaccination clinics in the heart of lawrence i also want to note that lawrence general and the city of lawrence have also opened up things uh clinics um it's it sounds obvious but it's not always obvious that um uh people will won't necessarily be able to get to you or to come to you for vaccines some of them are scared of the vaccination some of them are are very hesitant so part of what we're doing also is educating as many of our patients and as much of the community as we can on the value of of vaccinations we are very passionate about health equity and getting those vaccines into our communities arms what we ask uh folks and i'm glad um roslyn raid the quest raised the question what we're asking asking everybody to do um is work to educate your relatives your neighbors your friends your co-workers on the importance of getting vaccinated educate yourself on the value of vaccinations and then pass it on to everybody that you see there's a lot of misinformation that is spreading around especially minority communities related to what vaccines are and are not and the more we can shed light um on what they are and the value and the importance of them uh the more folks will be vaccinated in those communities and then the last thing i just throw out is offer to volunteer at any local vaccination clinic the manpower and the resource and the staffing necessary to stand up not only one but 10 or 11 of these vaccine clinics is astounding and last but not least we'll do more as the vaccine flow increases the feds are now shipping us vaccines the state continues to increase the number of vaccines available to us and our communities so i think taking all together we're doing the right thing for the right reason and we just need your help in terms of educating and promoting the value of vaccinations thank you john that was uh so great and i actually got to see that up close right when i was at uh the clinic in in lawrence trust plays a huge role when you're educating and you're making folks more aware and you know the greater lawrence family health center is a trusted brand in the community it serves and so certainly that is a big driver for folks getting uh their vaccination but then we all play a role in that right i mean i i do think it's important that when your name is called get your vaccination and and tell folks about it and help them um you know learn about the process so that you know we get as many shots in arms as possible it's it's so important that we all um you know continue uh to to stay focused on on getting um everyone vaccinated uh so this next question i believe is for me it comes from donald and marlbro uh he asked what opportunities are there for small businesses in the american rescue plan uh so this is a really important question and i'm grateful that someone asked it i gave a brief overview of some of the big small business provisions at the beginning of this call but this is a good opportunity to dive in a little bit to the details so first and foremost the american rescue plan replenishes the paycheck protection program it's referred to as the ppp program by providing another 7.25 billion dollars in funding for these critically important loans it also makes those loans available to nonprofits but explicitly prohibits any funds from going to lobbying organizations for example it also provides another 15 billion dollars for small business grants through the economic injury disaster loan program also called the idle program and that provides ten thousand dollar grant advances to small businesses in need of targeted relief now what i mentioned earlier was the restaurant revitalization fund which is brand new and it was created by this relief package specifically this new fund provides 28 billion dollars to offer assistance to restaurants and bars who have been hit hard by this pandemic now of that 28 billion dollars nearly 20 percent of that funding is set aside specifically for our small establishments with less than 500 000 in annual revenue and it also carves out a prioritization period for restaurants owned and operated by veterans women and socially or economically disadvantaged individuals finally one of the lesser-known provisions in the legislation is also important and worth mentioning and that includes funding to support up to a hundred billion dollars in small business financing through state programs essentially ensuring that small businesses have another avenue through which they can apply for and receive financial relief so that's um that is our small business portion of the american rescue plan so mayor nicholson i think we have time for a couple more questions and i'll just say up front i wish we could stay on for a full hour but i'm gonna have to run down to the house floor soon and vote uh but i think we have a uh i think we have time for one or two uh so this one next one is for you mayor um and this question is actually from me what have you been saying to folks in gardner who have expressed concern about the safety of getting vaccinated or saying that they want to hold out on getting their vaccine because they heard that uh some were more effective than others this is a question we've actually been getting a lot since we've started the vaccination program and a lot of the basic quick answer to the question is you really have to trust the science behind it and trust the doctors and medical staff who have put hours and hours into making sure that the vaccine is safe if you look at the flu vaccine that we have every year it's there's a different strain of the flu that happens every year and we it the oftentimes that vaccine which is a lot was popular before the pandemic has a quicker timeline that what people perceive to be quicker but that quicker timeline is actually a normal timeline so that's one of the things that we've been stressing too is to trust what the doctors and the scientists who are professionals and experts in this field are saying in terms of holding off on getting one vaccine versus the other the other question that we've been or the hesitation we've been dealing with is people concerned about getting their second dose because they're hearing that there's more adverse side effects to a second dose than your first dose of the major moderna or pfizer vaccines that have been more prevalent and the one thing we've been saying is if you think back to this year we've all had to make some type of sacrifices and we've all had to take you know something and reshape how it's been in the past year that having one day of a sore arm or a headache or some type of fever that's gonna go away after a 24 hour 24 to 48 hour period that doctors are saying is the average amount really is a blip in the bucket a small drop in everything that we're dealing with and that compared to what we've been through in the past year and if having a 24 to 48 hour headache or sore arm or a small slight fever or some discomfort is all it takes to get us out from not having to go through what we've done the last year and get back to the new normal then it's worth every minute in the world and while it may be uncomfortable in that moment that small bit of discomfort is what's going to get us through this pandemic together and you know there's a certain community responsibility behind the whole vaccine vaccination process just like we've done in the past year where people have had to follow the social distancing guidelines and the masking guidelines and everything else we've done with this pandemic this is that a logical next step to make sure that you're not only doing everything you can to protect yourself but you also are not the reason that someone else gets sick when they don't have to get sick and being showing that the vaccination process isn't just a way to protect you it's a way to make sure you're doing your part to protect your community that's really everything we've been saying to all of our residents who have expressed some type of hesitation and it we understand that there's been hesitation with everything that's come out in the past year just because again like i said earlier and like john said too it's just a matter of educating people what the process is because this isn't something that we've dealt with before and people are nervous and people are anxious either about what vaccine to get or how quickly they can get that appointment to get that shot in their arm in terms of what vaccine tends to be more um have a better um strength than the others yes we're hearing things like johnson and johnson may not be 100 effective against obtaining the vaccine but it's 100 effective against hospitalization people get you know sick and if it's just a small chance of you having a small more mild case versus having to get hospitalized again that's worth its weight in gold so there really is a lot more positive and it just takes a little bit of education so a lot of the conversations we're having is educating people on these processes and trying to make sure people see the bigger picture behind the vaccination process rather than just the worry about getting the actual shot in the arm and then this reaction that happens the next day and looking past that 24 to 48 hour period immediately after it well i can tell you that dr foshi agrees with you i i was in a hearing today of the health subcommittee and he was before the subcommittee said exactly that all the vaccines are safe they're all highly effective and if you have the opportunity to get a shot take it um so thank you for for that um john we have time for one more question uh and it's from david and lowell he said i read yesterday that lowell community health center was recently added to the biden program to receive additional vaccines since your facility has been part of this program already can you tell us if this means more folks are eligible or receive a shot will this expedite those in line to get vaccinated well this is the easiest question of all the shortest answer no it doesn't mean more folks are eligible as as we discussed earlier that'll that is based upon when the cdc in the state uh increases eligibility and we know now that that will be april 19th before um the entire public is eligible but it will absolutely expedite the line uh to get vaccinated with the federal vaccine that we're getting along with the state doses we were able to open up another vaccination clinic and move the waiting list much quicker as i said before more vaccine means more vaccinations which means more people which then finally shortens the lines in the waiting list so that's wonderful that lowell has been added to the program because it will provide more vaccines and move and move and move the registration lists terrific well unfortunately that is all the time we have for tonight i i have to head to the house floor as i mentioned and vote uh but i'm so happy we had a chance to answer some of these great questions uh i'd like to thank mayor nicholson and john silva once more for sharing so much vital information with us we are so grateful for your time and your expertise and thank you everyone again for dialing in and committing yourself to staying informed you know for an easy way to stay updated on the federal and state response to covid19 as well as information on future teletown halls and events please follow us on instagram facebook and twitter at rep lori trahan and if we didn't

that number is 877-382-1609 and they are available to help 24 hours a day seven days a week 365 days a year finally i can't say it enough we all have a job to do to finally defeat covid19 that means washing our hands maintaining a safe social distance from others and wearing a mask when we're around others it also means pre-registering to get vaccinated at vaccine signup.mass.gov again that's pre-register pre-registration website is vaccine signup.mass.gov and then getting the vaccine as soon as your appointment becomes available we will get through this difficult time and as long as each of us continues to do our part we'll get through it together thank you all again everyone and stay safe and stay healthy

hi i'm cathy McMorris Rodgers the top Republican on the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee that is working on a single national standard for data privacy in America a national standard is the best and perhaps the only way for the American people to trust that their privacy is protected unfortunately I've heard from some leaders across the aisle that one national standard for privacy is disturbing and won't happen that would be a mistake if Congress doesn't act and if it allows a patchwork of state laws to become a reality it will have harmful consequences to Americans and our data privacy here's why first a patchwork of state laws could fragment the internet services businesses and platforms could be forced to blackout products and leave states where they can't comply with the burdensome state privacy laws if that happens someone in Spokane Washington may not have the same options available as someone in San Francisco or Silicon Valley how is that fair or even workable on the Internet marketplace that today is seamless no matter where you are your ability to access Facebook a startups website and use your smart phone is the same and that's how it always should be second a patchwork of state laws will force sky-high compliance cost on startups and small businesses this will drive up cost on Americans and our families it's already happening in the European Union under GDP are the general data protection regulation compliance cost per business are between one and ten million dollars and that's just one set of rules imagine if small businesses had to comply with 50 different laws that's a tangled web of regulations that will mean higher cost pushed on people every time we purchase something online third a patchwork won't keep our data secure why because a patchwork creates more for privacy to be invaded more laws equals more loopholes for hackers to exploit smart home devices Wi-Fi baby monitors health trackers and more if companies are forced to work overtime to comply with 50 different regulatory regimes they won't be able to innovate and keep up with the evolving way that the bad actors seek to access personal information a national standard will provide clear rules of the road and give Americans the same data protections wherever we go finally a patchwork will leave us in the dark for us to know how data is used and how its collected there should be zero surprises in fact nine and ten people in a recent survey said online companies need to get permission before even sharing or selling personal data again how is this achievable in a patchwork if someone lives in Washington buy something online from a small business in Oregon and ships it to their family in Idaho how can they trust a system with changing rules across state lines they can't in a patchwork there's no way to guarantee that transparency and accountability we rightfully expect again I've heard the naysayers say things like a national standard won't happen on behalf of every single American who uses the internet I'm here to tell you that a national standard must happen the people we serve deserve better than a patchwork it's their privacy that is on the line they should be able to trust that it's protected and they should be empowered to control how their data is used no matter what state they are in an enforceable and single national standard that protects consumers and promotes innovation is critical and that's why I will continue to lead to make it happen

joining us live congressman michael waltz of the house on service committee congressman good morning it's great to see you so the president is in israel right now tomorrow he's going to be meeting with palestinian leaders and then he's off to saudi arabia what do you think is going to come out of this trip well i think one of the main things that i look to hear when the president has his press conference is a very clear statement unambiguous no gaffes that iran absolutely cannot have a nuclear weapon and we will stand with israel and use all elements of national power all elements are on the table and all options are on the table to stop iran from getting a nuclear weapon that needs to be crystal clear the iranians need to get the message and the entire region needs to get message and why do americans care so much look if iran gets a nuke it would be like the taliban getting a nuclear weapon and what they could do with that we've seen what russia is doing under the threat of a nuclear umbrella and then number two the entire region will explode in a nuclear arms race the saudis the turks maybe even the emiratis and others will want nuclear weapons too and no one wants to live in a world where the middle east is under mutually assured destruction but congressman realistically is there any chance that joe biden makes that speech that you want him to make today uh you know he's talking the talk as officials are talking the talk uh kind of behind the scenes and off the record so that that's what we have to see from him that's what we have to see strength uh on the international stage in the middle east you guys knows i've served all across south asia afghanistan the middle east africa in that part of the world they respect strength they respect resolve and we need to be very clear what the united states is willing and not willing to do and this is a time for the commander-in-chief to step up yeah and you know president biden right now is doing something that really he's never done before in his presidency and it's embracing one of former president trump's foreign policy achievements in the abraham accords and he's trying to expand that with israel and saudi arabia he's getting a lot of pushback especially within his own party uh for meeting with saudi arabian officials tomorrow but in light of the fact that iran does have enough enriched uranium to make a nuclear weapon within weeks if they wanted to how important is brokering this deal this peace agreement between israel and saudi arabia well you know i think it was sad and frankly petty politics that uh joe biden in his op-ed uh where he that he had to put out there in the washington post to kind of defend himself from even going uh mainly to his left didn't even mention the abraham accords you know the whole reason that he's able to go from israel directly to saudi arabia and have this dialogue is because of president trump's groundbreaking historic achievement with the abraham accords here nor there the president president biden has to sit that you know petty politics aside and build on those achievements and the reason that they are all coming together is because of iran and because of the threat of iran that is threatening uh to one have a nuclear weapon to wipe israel off the map uh so i i really hope that he uh steps up and and will talk about it we'll reaffirm it we'll move forward and then finally obviously the reason the underlying reason that he's there is to get the saudis and the gulf nations to pump more oil and you know it's only because of his asinine energy policy uh back here at home his war on american energy that he has to do this in the first place how about we defund dictatorships like iran venezuela and others with producing american oil and he wouldn't be in this situation in the first place if he would just do that and take on the progressives and unleash american energy you know congressman got 30 seconds to you uh but in president biden's op-ed that you mentioned he did say that the middle east is more stable and secure now than what he inherited 18 months ago uh given the fact that the one year anniversary of the afghan restaurant withdrawal is coming up what are your thoughts on that well the entire world saw us run from uh from a terrorist organization in the taliban and listen they now have a super state and al qaeda and isis are once again reconstituting to attack the united states again it is happening right now as we speak this is the time to show strength and

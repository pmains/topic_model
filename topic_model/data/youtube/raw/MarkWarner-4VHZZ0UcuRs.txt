hi it's Mark Warner again giving you an update on today's first day of the impeachment trial I've only got a ten-minute break so I'm gonna be very brief and I'm sure we're gonna be going very very late tonight earlier this afternoon we heard from the house managers and the president's lawyers on whether we should see witnesses and receive documents now at the beginning of the trial or rather wait until both sides make their presentations and then make that determination to me it seemed important if we're going to be able to evaluate the president's guilt or innocence that we get a chance to look at those documents at the front end get a chance to interview or have interviewed potentially in depositions the witnesses who were relevant to the very accusations that have been made I think it's really important that we have this information and it's presented in a fair way fair to both sides we took our first vote on whether we should at least be able to get documents unfortunately that vote went along party lines 53 voting to table the amendment offered by Senator Schumer 47 of us voting no on that we're now taking up the next amendment which will focus on documents from the State Department I hope it doesn't end up with the same result at the end of the day I think we all need to reach an impartial verdict but I think the best way to do that is to make sure that we get all get all the facts and get a chance to hear from these witnesses who have relevant information and I think it makes sense that we hear from those at the start of this process rather than Midway at the end or potentially not at all I'll continue to give you updates but buckle up it's going to be a long involved process

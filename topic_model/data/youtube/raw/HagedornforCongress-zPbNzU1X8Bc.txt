one Jim Hagedorn joins us running for Congress 2016 once again against Tim Walz well Jim you got to try it again aren't you well yeah you know 2014 we were on the ballot I want a pretty late primary and only had ten weeks to go on a general election and and yet we were outspent 621 and we had forty five point seven percent of the boat the highest total against wall since he's been in office the one here in Brown County I want to thank the people for their votes and we're going to start a little earlier keep working harder build our organization and do our best to finish the job in 2016 how are you going to go about doing that what's going to be the biggest thing for you to winning this this this this election is tomorrow well you we got to continue meeting the people i'm going to get out spent hopefully not by as much we were last time but the key is to get out and shake hands meet people get yourself known we start with a very strong name ID right around eighty percent across the district and we're going to keep building that up i have to raise them more money so if they're people out there they want to support our campaign we sure could use the support go to gym hagedorn org and contribute and also to try to build relationships with the National people the Republican National congressional committee people in st. Paul to make sure they understood that this is a vulnerable seat for the for the Democrat incumbent and we can take it back in 2016 the big thing in your eyes what's wrong with America why are you running well you know ever since the congressman's been in Washington it's been almost a decade really by every key indicator things are worse and you look at our economy our economy stagnating we had the lowest job percentage workforce percentage since Jimmy Carter and he delivered us an economic plague of biblical proportions and wages are flat and people are hurting out there is it isn't as good as people think the stock market is being propped up if it weren't for that people would really recognize it so I think the government is too intertwined in business with too many regulations to make big government programs we have to kind of weed out that government in order to allow businesses to expand and prosper and hire people and help working Americans working Americans are struggling paying a lot for their disposable incomes are shrinking and we've got to help them another thing we have to do is defend the country the first responsibility of anyone in Washington DC in a federal job like this is to defend the United States and protect the American people we're not doing a very good job congressman walz President Obama have an open borders policy they're allowing this country to be flooded by people we don't know their identities and also we have very lack standards when it comes to immigrants coming from countries that happen to be in the Middle East North Africa folks with radical attitudes and we're seeing that come home to roost and Minnesota now the US Attorney here President Obama's use that US attorney says that Minnesota has a terrorist recruiting problem and and we do we've got to protect the American people and defend them from Islamic terrorism how do you do that Jim how do you go about what would be say the first thing you would do to try to stop that well there's several things first of all we need a foreign policy in the Middle East that isn't going to turn things in the chaos as it has under President Obama the radical Islamists are rising up the Christians are being slaughtered now we have these Isis and other characters that are kind of moving towards the United States trying to train people trying to get them involved in terrorism but mostly we have to make sure that people coming into our country are properly screened for radical attitudes that we don't allow this open borders and very liberal refugee and asylum program so I think they need to be revisited we need to make sure that people are assimilating there speaking the language they're self-sufficient and that they're not going to be prone to jihad and you know that's just not happening under this administration it's been it's really chaos in the Middle East and that's starting to come into the United States and frankly it only takes a handful of people think about 911 think about the Boston Marathon think about major ass on down there in Fort Hood only takes a handful of people to kill a great number of Americans to wound people and to change our way of life and hurt our economy all right well speaking of economy oh wow your thoughts on is it going good bad what would you do to fix it well yeah I think you know when I was growing up we used to walk the bean fields and if the younger people don't even know what that is anymore but we go out there and pull the weeds so that the the the bean could have a proper nutrition at that proper sunlight get enough water you know wouldn't the weed wouldn't crowd out the plant and I think in government we have to do the same thing we have to get in there with regulatory reform to pull out these extra regulations that are hampering business and driving up costs we have to I think update and replace these big government programs like Obamacare which are stifling economic growth and having people working part-time jobs and then we need tax reform tax simplification to make sure our tax code is updated so we're competitive in business sense and so the American people can take their money and spend it the way they see fit not the way the Washington politicians and the bureaucrats tell them to so there are a number of things that I would do and promote in Washington that I think would be positive for the economy and those are all things in opposition to what congressman Walz is doing out there supporting President Obama voting for the big government programs and supporting the EPA and these big government agencies that are stifling growth and opportunity for working Americans you know that almost kind of ties in with agriculture too doesn't it well what's going on in agriculture I'm concerned you know crop prices are low you know the cost for the farmers are still high I see a lot of you know a softening in the agriculture economy and we have to be very careful because if farmers get into trouble and they end up selling out usually bigger and bigger operators buy that land and they're not bad people but we want to keep the land in as many hands as possible so we can continue to have smaller communities in rural areas to flourish to sustain our way of life one of the major issues in Washington on this that every farmer should be cognizant of is the so-called death tax and that's the estate tax and we want to make sure I want to get rid of that because we want to be able for farmers to pass their land down of future generations and to be able to continue the family farming congressman Walz just voted for the death tax again here a couple three weeks ago he's on the wrong side of farmers on that he's a part-time advocate for farmers I'd be a full-time advocate we all understand the need for death and taxes but they shouldn't be in that order and of course you speak you're speaking of agriculture you're thinking the family farms that's family values that's where the especially this area here that's a big that's a big thing that's really becoming a hot topic isn't it yeah it is at Brown County always a very you know pretty conservative traditional I'd say this is you know the part of the area where traditional values are still valued and again congressman walz and I have a little difference of opinion he I think about a week ago he voted for a bill that would allow abortions in the seventh eighth ninth month of pregnancy you know even the Liberals think that that's wrong by that point you should have figured out we shouldn't be killing seven pound babies I'm on the other side we need to protect innocent life and that means the unborn that means the elderly that means the disabled and of course people with special needs and that's the type of values that I would take the Washington on them on behalf of the people it's gonna be a long campaign isn't it for you well we'll keep working and organizing and raising money and and it's just a little earlier than normal but this is when a lot of decisions are made at the national level state level as to which races are winnable which races are vulnerable and I've showed them a we ran a very short campaign and got outspent by a great deal but we were right there within striking distance we can take this seat back for the Republican Party in 2016 okay wish you the best of luck well thank you so much for your time Jim Hagedorn

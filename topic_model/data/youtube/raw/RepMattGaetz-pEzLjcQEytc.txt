for more on what this means we're joined tonight by Florida Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz congressman thanks very much for coming on tonight what jumps out at you from all of this well happy no collusion day Tucker yeah I mean it's 675 days deep tens of millions of dollars spent on a team of people who had large part were biased against the President and they could not produce evidence to even bring charges for indictment against people for the underlying allegation conspiracy with the Russian Federation but you've asked the operative question what do we do now my expectation is that we have to have a thorough review of how we got here how we allowed political opposition research to fuel an investigation that was never founded in any fact or reality and then I think we need to seek apology from the Democrats in Congress who said there was stone-cold evidence of collusion that they had demonstrable proof that these things were happening and you look at all the work the president's try to do around the world to end the wars resolve conflicts and reduce nuclear proliferation a lot of that work has been hindered by the lies being told in this country that can be traced right back to the DNC and the Clinton campaign no it's such a smart point I can't believe that were kind of alighting over just blowing past the fact that the Obama administration spied on the Trump campaign if the Trump camp administration we're using the Department of Justice to spy on the Kamla Harris for president campaign that seems to me it would be a very serious breach and a very big news story why are we not finding out everything we can about what the Obama DOJ did to the Trump campaign it all goes back to the fact that we allow secret courts to operate in the absence of transparency and that invites an opportunity for us right corruption and and it allows people to politicize the highest levels of our intelligence community and our investigative community so here we need to have more transparency within those court systems we need Senate confirmation of FISA judges and then ultimately we need to make the opinions published you know who filed that bill Tucker Adam Schiff but now he won't co-sponsor his own legislation to reform the FISA process because he doesn't want the same rules that applied to President Obama to apply to President Trump it's a double standard it's hypocrisy and it doesn't allow us to move past this moment the country never wants to have to go through another 22 months like this again where we're torn apart based on a lie political dirt and then we had the blessing of our intelligence community and FISA courts over something that never should have begun well I didn't think I could learn anything new about the story but you just taught me something I didn't know and it's shocking it's and why don't we have secret courts in the first place that what country is this anyway those are great points congressman I'm and I'm grateful that you came on to tell us about that thank you

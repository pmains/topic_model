I now recognize the gentleman from Florida mr. Posey thank you very much chairman Raskin and and ranking member Woodall for this opportunity to testify you and my colleagues I have two amendments and they're directly related one to strip funding from the office of children's issues and the other to block funding from the Lebanese internal security force which shall hereafter worst referred to as the ISF and I have combined those into one statement with your permission just to save you time and any time thank you very much I'm hoping that by offering these amendments we can have a much-needed discussion about international child abduction and how we can make us a higher priority for the Department of State I'm dealing with constituent cases that involve American children who have been abducted to Lebanon as you can imagine this is a very emotional topic and I've not taken this subject lightly and I know that you won't either as of last year 98 nations signed on to the Hague Convention on International child abduction abduction but there are still several countries like Lebanon that have not signed into the Hague Convention making the return of abducted children and the resolution of their cases very difficult the State Department's Office of children's issues is tasked with among other things like international child adoption services overseeing cases of international child abduction as per their annual 2019 report on child abduction going back to 2016 only 33 percent of the children involved in abduction cases open by the office of children's issues have returned the United States in the last three years that's a very very dismal proportion a constituent of mine Michelle Littleton recently testified before a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee about the abduction of her three beautiful children to Lebanon by her former husband a little over two years ago Miss Littleton has worked tirelessly to litigate the return of her children in Lebanese court and remarkably has won landmark decisions unprecedented decisions in the favour of an American in this type of case in Lebanon despite her legal victories she still waits for the court orders to be enforced by the Lebanese internal security force that I mentioned earlier to make matters worse the ISF dragged its feet while enforcing court ordered return of her children and created a fugitive situation allowed the abductor time to escape with her children in the weeks leading up to miss Littleton's final Court ruling State Department officials inform me on numerous occasions they had an idea of the location of mrs. little to his children's so they could be returned quickly when all the appeals were exhausted I come to find out later that they had in fact lost track of the children the previous month's but neglected to tell me or mrs. Littleton and others involved in this case in working the case I further am disappointed that it took almost two years two years for me to get a scheduled phone call with our US ambassador to Lebanon Elizabeth Richard I've also had a request for seven months to speak with the secretary about these cases I hear other members are we running into similar obstacles working similar constituent cases across this country but something I found out to be the most insulting was when Miss Littleton testified before the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee about the international child reduction despite being invited the office of children's issues failed to even show up didn't even show up for the hearing then there's Dexter's case the four-year-old whose abductor kidnapped him committed fraud by obtaining false travel documents and took him to unsafe southern Lebanon his abductor is wanted by the local authorities in Florida the FBI and Interpol he has a record of making threats past kidnappings burglary and has been held in contempt of court yet the State Department officials recently met with both him and Dexter in a local mall and did absolutely nothing to alert the authorities so that he could be returned they did nothing it's unbelievable and and we're really on a half State Department that wants to leave the kids there in very poor conditions regardless of the renewed national emergency declaration American taxpayers continue to foot the bill in Lebanon since 2006 the US has provided a Lebanon over 1.7 billion dollars in security assistance more than two billion in bilateral foreign assistance Lebanon and nearly 1.8 billion in humanitarian assistance since the start of the Syrian crisis in many ways our mission to Lebanon has failed despite spending billions of taxpayer dollars our embassy doesn't feel comfortable asking the ISF which is more which is more like their local police department actually to partner with us to recover American children and holds dangerous international child abductors and criminals accountable if we leave these American children behind we will be denying them the basic freedom and opportunities and each never one of us in this room is of joy to graduate from high school go to college pursue a meaningful career it's sad but the possibility of cutting their funding may be the only way they will listen to us I'm asking you to allow members of the house a chance to discuss this international child abductors issue how we can direct taxpayer dollars to better serve American parents and citizens and make the return of the abducted children a higher priority thank you very much

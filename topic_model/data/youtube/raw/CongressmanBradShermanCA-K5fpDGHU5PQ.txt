  OF H.R. 3320 AND YIELD MYSELF AS MUCH TIME AS I MAY CONSUME.  THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE   GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED FOR SUCH TIME.  MR. SHERMAN: CLEARLY, TAIWAN   SHOULD BE A FULL MEMBER OF THE   WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION. ALL NATIONS SHOULD BE FULL   MEMBERS OF THE WORLD HEALTH  ORGANIZATION, ESPECIALLY ONE   WITH AN ADVANCED HEALTH SYSTEM   THAT CAN HELP US STOP PANDEMICS  FROM SPREADING FROM ONE COUNTRY  TO ANOTHER.  THAT'S WHY IT MAKES SENSE FOR US TO ADVOCATE TAIWAN'S   PARTICIPATION IN ALL   INTERNATIONAL BODIES BUT   PARTICULARLY THE U.N.'S WORLD  HEALTH ORGANIZATION. I'M PLEASED TO CO-SPONSOR THIS   LEGISLATION. IT'S CRITICAL TO PREPARING TO  PREVENT PANDEMICS. LOOK AT THE NONSENSE THAT IS   BEING FOCUSED -- FOISTED ON THE  WORLD BY BEIJING.  FOR POLITICAL REASONS, IN AN   EFFORT TO SAY THAT TAIWAN  DOESN'T EXIST EXCEPT AS A  PROVINCE, THEY ARE ENDANGERING   THE HEALTH OF THE WORLD. BECAUSE THE PATHOGENS HAVE NOT   BEEN TOLD THAT THEY'RE NOT TO GO TO TAIWAN. THE EPIDEMICS HAVE NOT BEEN TOLD TO SPARE HUMANKIND FROM THE  INEFFICIENCIES AND GLARING   OMISSIONS THAT OCCUR WHEN AN   IMPORTANT COUNTRY IS EXCLUDED  FROM THE WORLD HEALTH  ORGANIZATION.  TAIWAN'S EXCLUSION EVEN FROM   OBSERVER STATUS FROM THE WORLD   HEALTH ORING N DURINGING OR --   WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION IS A   TERRIBLE SYMBOL, AN ATTEMPT TO   DENY SELF-DETERMINATION TO 23  MILLION PEOPLE.  BUT IT IS WORSE THAN A TERRIBLE  SYMBOL.  IT IS A PRACTICAL IMPEDIMENT TO  STOPPING EPIDEMICS.  IT IS A PRACTICAL IMPEDIMENT TO  WORLD HEALTH.  AND IT IS TIME FOR THE UNITED  STATES TO HAVE A STRATEGY TO   REACH OUT TO THE WORLD AND SAY   TAIWAN NEEDS TO BE PART OF   HEALTH PLANNING, TAIWAN NEEDS TO BE PART OF THE LIFE-SAVING   INITIATIVES OF THE WORLD HEALTH  ORGANIZATION.  SO I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING   WITH OUR COLLEAGUES TO PASS THIS LEGISLATION AND WORKING WITH THE STATE DEPARTMENT TOIMPLEMENT IT. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THE DAY  WHEN WE DO NOT PUT THE WORLD AT  RISK OF AN EPIDEMIC THAT COULD   HAVE BEEN CONTAINED BUT FOR THE  MALICIOUS SYMBOLISM BEING  FOISTED ON US BY BEIJIN

Thank You mr. chairman and chairman the end is near thank you for hanging in this morning I would echo what my colleagues and her Miranda said we actually have legislation to try to promote be startup activity start up to point o which addresses the very issues you talked about as well as the issue of talent were in a global competition for talent and I commend senator Moran's leadership on this issue we did make some of the movement on the access to capital earlier I'd also know most of my colleagues have left but would point out for some of my colleagues that because of the actions we took as this Congress in dodd-frank and otherwise we have seen an increase in capital and American banks in excess of 300 billion dollars more in capital reserves since the crisis and clearly i think that has helped our banking industry relative to some of our some banks who are under assault around the world i also want to commend you for your continuing urging of us to a con fiscal policies waiting for Congress is a little bit like waiting for godot hopefully we will see some actions later this year and a number of us have been working on this I guess one of the things I my first question would be as we grapple with this issue of trying to get an appropriate balance of revenues entitlement reform to generate at least that four trillion dollars to drive our debt-to-gdp ratio back down and because as you pointed out we can do this on a moderate we donate our in intermediate basis and have the ability to phase these things in I sometimes scratch my head because what it be asked of the American people is so much smaller than what's being asked of the folks within the UK or folks within Europe or even folks in India and elsewhere where they are going through policy changes is there have you done any kind of sizing of what a four trillion dollar deal relative the size of our economy and the ask the American people versus what is being asked of folks all around the rest of the world as they try to move forward and get their own fiscal houses in order well a number of the I haven't done that exercise exactly but in terms of percentage of G p you know some of the fiscal shifts that are taking place in countries like Spain Portugal and Italy are very substantial and in the near term which is part of the reason why their economies are so weak in the near term so it's it's certainly true in terms of the fiscal step that's being taking that it's it's it's larger in these countries which are under fiscal stress but that's the I'm not quite sure what the implication of that is we're lucky that we can borrow in a very low interest rate we're not currently in the same situation as a grease or or Portugal and therefore if we can intelligently combine a gradual glide path with a strong credible plan for stabilizing our deficits in the longer term we can avoid that kind of painful contraction and do it more gradually it almost seems to me that it is remarkable and I guess why Congress that record low levels of approval that we can't step up almost unamerican that we can't do our job relative to what is being asked of other people around the world one of the things that we I know we've had some policy debate this morning on additional actions you may take to stimulate the economy I guess one question I would say for those who question taking these actions if we look at the European Central Bank's recent actions in terms of if we look at the Bank of England if we look at the Chinese financial institutions what effect of their stimulus activities and or loosening activities does that have on world economy and in terms of your decision-making well there's been a global slowdown it's emanating a lot of its emanating from Europe which through export demand is affecting Asia and other parts of the world United States as well there's been some slowing in in Asia as well the chinese gdp statistics have been weaker this year than in previous years partly that was intentional as they sought to cool their housing market and to address inflation concerns but there is a slowing in the local economy to the extent that actions taken by our trading partners strengthen their those economies it'll it'll help us on the margin because it'll increase our markets and and provide an overall better economic environment but I would say at this point that compared to what we saw during the aftermath of the crisis nothing is happening globally of that kind of scale I mean there's relatively modest steps being taken in both of those jurisdictions to try to offset some of the slowing but those actions are similar to what you may take in the fed and I guess the point I would simply make is that this is a there seems to be a consensus opinion around major economies around the world to take these type of stealing of actions but the world is an easing cycle that's correct and in terms of the specific actions the UK for example just has been adding to its quantitative easing program and doing other things as well so the US has should be very clear the United States the Federal Reserve is not the only central bank that has been using these unconventional policies as a tool for trying to strengthen their economies Thank You mr. chairman

hello I'm indeed on Titus your representative from Nevada's first congressional district today's earth day we only have one planet and vowing to protect it one day a year is not going to conserve it for much longer so while today marks the spot on the calendar let's remember that tomorrow is also Earth Day next Tuesday will be earth day and every other day from here on out should be earth day in Las Vegas we know the consequences that we face if we don't act with vigor we know that late mean is a hundred and thirty feet lower than it was 16 years ago and that the Rockies don't feed the Colorado River like they once did this week new reports show that 2016 is shaping up to be the hottest year on record the Clarion calls keep blaring and we can't wait around to mitigate the effects of climate change Nevada has taken action to cut greenhouse gases by investing in large-scale renewable projects and by cutting out cold but more needs to be done we need to incentivize solar and the utility and residential scales and we have to protect our public lands and the flora and fauna that thrive there we can do new things too like refusing to use plastic bags and rebuilding our plastic water bottles also recycling aluminum cans every little bit helps but we need the world to come together that's why I applaud the US and more than 140 other governments for signing the historic Paris climate agreement we need to recognize that the ball is in our court when it comes to saving our planet this is a problem that does not stop at the border it doesn't recognize political parties so have a great earth day today and remember that tomorrow and all the days after our Earth Day to thank you so much

freed and some of his other colleagues joining us now is representative Brad Sherman of California member of the House Financial Services committee chairman of the subcommittee on investor protection and capital markets uh Congressman it's great to have you back on it's an important time FTX FTX was headquartered offshore it was listed offshore it is registered offshore what power do you or U.S authorities have or might have over Mr bankman freed some of his colleagues and FTX Beckman freed is an American I'm sure that he was a target of criminal investigation I assume that he's going to try to flee to Dubai or Argentina or some other country without an extradition treaty FTX U.S is a U.S company but ultimately I have for many years called for us to Simply prohibit Americans from investing in crypto not only does an investor protection issue I know some of your viewers are going to make money from time to time but because of the effect that it can have on our ability to collect taxes enforce bankruptcy laws and have the uh the dollar play the international role that is so valuable to America do you think he is a Flight Risk uh do you think he's still in the Bahamas because someone tracked the jet that they think might have been his they don't know from Nassau to I think it was Buenos Aires Argentina but they do I believe have an extradition treaty with the United States he's told Reuters he was in the Bahamas do we have any idea where he is and if not why not we have no idea where he is because he stole billions of dollars and he's using that money to get himself somewhere where we can't catch him so I want to be clear because we want to be very careful here on at least on my side of the camera Congressman you can say what you want you know for us these are allegations right now we know there's money missing no charges have been filed it sounds like you believe that there will be criminal charges filed soon I don't know how soon and I don't know whether he will be in a jurisdiction where we can reach him uh but uh it appears as if money that should have been segregated and held for customers was instead diverted to high-risk bets placed by the uh by uh the the FTX company um this is this this shows that we need regulation although frankly the money and power still in Washington is with the uh the crypto brilliant billionaire Bros and I think we'll be fortunate if we can just avoid passing bad legislation because they are so desperate to get they really want to they really want a patina of Regulation they needed so much now to try to restore their credibility I'm going to ask you a direct question you can tell me to kiss off if you want and I want to make it very clear we looked Congressman Brad Sherman you took no money from FTX you took no money and by the way from stock trading you own a couple of stocks Disney and a few others that's it the restaurant CDs but many others in the Democratic and Republican parties did take money he was one of the biggest donors to President Biden's reelection campaign Super PAC his mother's politically connected as you imagine in this world that we live in there's a lot of talk about how that may help him can you assure the American people or at least your constituents that even with his political connections and money that if there is a need to bring him to Justice he will be well I don't think that uh campaign contributions will shield them from Justice and keep in mind this was not just a one-man operation Ryan salt uh salaim was his co-ceo and uh Ryan gave tens of millions of dollars on the Republican side yes there's a tendency to focus only on the guy in shorts but uh it took one more than one person to create it yeah and you are making an important point that there was money from the organization given to both parties I want to make that clear but we know the Democrats are in charge so I think the focus is going to be more on on the party that is that is in power obviously his his family is politically connected there's a lot but you are telling the our viewers the American public that that this will not get in the way of Justice particularly for by the way what could be as we just noted Congressman a million creditors many of whom are probably just CNBC viewers that got crushed think of the demand from the American people including a million who are owed money for us to apply the law the Department of Justice is insulated from Politics the criminal investigate investigators there perhaps even more insulated uh I am confident uh that there'll be a good criminal investigation uh and and I do want to point out the investigations uh haven't even started let alone completed there is the possibility uh that Sam bankman freed followed uh you know avoided committing felonies but uh I think that's unlikely and I guess the American Pie listen we won everything yesterday I understand that and and there are no charges filed we'd like to probably just hear from him and Caroline Ellison who ran the hedge fund and others that you mentioned what happened what do you know uh the longer this drags on Congressman the more likely it is that perhaps there will be a flight risk or something or something else do you believe that there is that the U.S authorities are currently working with police of the Bahamas to try to come up with some way to at least get him to answer questions I don't know whether Bahamas is cooperating with the United States I don't know what connections they have in the Bahamas and I don't know if he's still in the Bahamas but I do know uh that uh other there are other countries that are more susceptible than the U.S system to the kind of money uh that uh bankman free has yeah and it would seem and if you were brought this up just now and I this is a little bit off off topic but I know he's a computer quote genius but he is tweeting so theoretically there's going to be some geolocation that we could figure that out at least again not to arrest him we just need to know what's going on can we work you're in California but I know you're in Southern California can we work with some of the technology companies to maybe help us out at least locate him uh I am sure that uh uh that we are trying to locate him um and at the same time I don't know if we can bring him to Justice um and uh we'll we'll have to see uh it is somewhat suspicious that there's this 300 million uh uh hack where assets are stolen from the company just as the company's going down um there is talk on Twitter Etc that people know who it is that that did the hack but that's a suspicious there are a lot of suspicious things here uh but uh you know uh obviously bankman freed had decided to flee a couple days sooner he'd already be in Dubai wow sounds like you're pretty confident that uh there is a risk of him either leaving or maybe already left again there's private jet traffic to Argentina we don't know if he was on if anybody was on it his jet was red that jet was registered in Argentina which you know is not a crime unto itself but it's interesting Congressman Brad Sherman of California uh could pry to an hour with you Congressman so welcome you back on anytime if you learn anything please let us know we'll put you back on at a moment's notice thank you I will thank you Congressman Brad Sherman a California out there representing Burbank and some of those

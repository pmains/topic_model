Thank You mr. chairman you've been an excellent hearing I want to commend commend you and I think your point was chairman about Senator Nelson's absolutely right and he has been in the vanguard of senior rights for a lot of lot of years and i really want to pick up on senator Nelson's a point and perhaps a direct this towards you mr. Levinson and you as well mr. Ferrar I mean what-what Center Nelson is really talking about with respect to seniors on patrol really elaborates on the concept you've been talking about mr. Levinson which is really get more people looking at the data you know I've listened to you talk about this front for a number of years and you've talked about data analytics and data forensics and it really is another way for addressing what senator Nelson was talking about which is having seniors on on patrol and sort of getting more eyes at this whole topic now senator Grassley and I have proposed an effort to open up the Medicare database to make it possible for us in a fashion that allows for more eyes to be on the subject for us to stop these sort of abnormal trends the kind of people who are ripping off the system acknowledging with dr. Budetti said that most people are honest given the fact that I may even be one of the last senators to ask ask questions isn't this really what the panel is trying to get us to zero in on is to have more eyes on the data more people trying to give us an early warning sign of developments as you know we've had some of the most outlandish you know cases on the west coast one of them in in in Portland so we have tried to follow this and and I would just ask got you mr. Levinson and mr. Ferrer about this question of trying to really put more people looking at the data whether it's the approach center Grassley and I are talking about in terms opening up the Medicare database or other approaches that's really the bottom line here that your view mr. Levinson Thank You senator wyden well I've been on record for a long time as encouraging as much transparency as policymakers and the lawyers will allow us I think it's very very healthy for the system and the notion of citizen involvement and especially Medicare beneficiary involvement is absolutely crucial in trying to ensure the integrity of the system and in every summit that hHS has held on the fraud prevention challenge around the country and there have been half a dozen over the last year in my remarks I always underscore the importance of having our beneficiaries as our frontline protectors if you will and when you look at the record of of our I OIG case is open for investigation I have to assume that a considerable number of the hotline complaints that come in and that are then forwarded to CMS their sources their origin most likely is from exactly this cohort the people who are on the front line so while government obviously has all parts of our government enforcement and compliance structure have very critical roles to play a crucial partner needs to be the beneficiaries themselves mr. frere tell me about your thoughts with respect to approaches like the Medicare database because that's the one place where you can really on an ongoing basis spot abnormalities spot trends you have any thoughts on that well I couldn't agree with you more in with respect to the importance of reviewing that data and let me tell you why we have been so successful in the strike forces and in our efforts in Miami we actually have what we call the fusion center for medicare fraud it's what it's a standalone facility the only of its kind in the nation why has it been why has that worked because we have a CMS contractor working in in that facility with agents with a nurse investigator and agents whose job really is to look at the data so we have a we have a national database and it's called stars they review the stars database to see where there's some aberrations some suspicious building spikes and then they then come to us and enter the agents and then point us to the right direction so we can know which eight which providers we need to sort of examine and investigate the beneficiaries getting involved in reviewing and also in this effort is crucial we have cases where it's the beneficiary it's the patient who comes to us after examining their explanation of benefits from Medicare and say hey listen I'm being a Medicare just got built for a prosthetic and you know look here he I don't need anything one of the beneficiaries was a federal judge who was who Medicare you know someone got his information it was billing Medicare for for some prosthetics and he had to go to court until the judge Here I am and I've got I've got my limbs I mean we need everybody we need we go out there do a lot of public outreach the regional summits that inspector general Levinson is talking about is crucial we tell everybody that they need to speak up and be aware and I've got to tell you that at least I can speak for South Florida the community there is fed up the that's why you know we we put all our a lot of research into this that's why our sentences have increased senator Coburn was asking about doctors being sentenced we've had doctors sentenced to 19 and a half years and 30 years the judges are trying to send a message in this area but reviewing the data and anything we can do to continue to facilitate the sharing of quality data in a timely fashion is crucial in our efforts mr. Chairman I my time is up i just look forward to working with you and Senator Grassley and I have put a lot of years into this and the fact that you're constantly looking for ways to beef up the fight against a fraud and these kinds of ripoffs is really appreciate and look forward to working with you

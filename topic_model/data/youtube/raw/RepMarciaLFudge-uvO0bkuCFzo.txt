congresswoman Marcia fudge of Ohio is chair of the Congressional Black Caucus which is holding its annual legislative caucus in Washington this week hence my presence here in DC and congresswoman congressman came to Senator Caine just said that the most controversial part of the president's plan was the arming and training of Syrian rebels would you agree that that is more controversial than air strikes inside of Syria by the way air strikes which we have not discussed with the sovereign country that we are bomb is absolutely right okay I think that is the most controversial piece because there's so many of us who do not believe first off that there is a moderate opposition secondly we know that this whole concept of training the moderate opposition is going to take more than a year we're talking about as many of maybe 5,000 over a year but Isis is is a threat now right they have more than 30,000 fighters and tons of money yeah you voted against it you voted against that port that was connected to the the continuing resolution which in and of itself might be a questionable thing for a lot of Americans why it wasn't a standalone vote so you voted against that piece do you support what's happening right now in Syria I do and why what I believed I always believed that the air stress was the way to go okay I think that once you start to train people once we're on the ground to me that's mission creep yeah and I just don't want to see us do that I think as long as we can make some real significant progress by airstrikes and this is the bigger piece to bring our allies yeah I think that is what has made this and is going to make it a very successful event and sex was the successful effort but I do believe that the president was right when he says that other nations Arab nations need to stand up and that's what I'm pleased about today yeah and but should Congress I mean we do have this really bizarre situation where we are now [ __ ] air strikes inside Syria we have a military action going the president is calling members of Congress and and briefing them in on what is happening but Congress isn't here should Congress come back and have AIDS Day separate distinct debate and vote specifically on what you have to say is our war we are conducting in serious shouldn't congress come back and vote on that yes Congress should never have left for that we had what we have is a is a majority who doesn't want to take a vote before the election they say in this instance the president has all the authority he needs yeah but then you'll turn around they say no you know what he should have done that so they had executive authority to my successful when they want to get exactly right look what John Boehner I mean things will be the Republicans who've spoken most of them except for the Justin a monsters in the world the more libertarian members are in favor of these airstrikes what would what would John Boehner what would bear be too worried about him coming back and holding a vote his people being reelected that's what he'd worry about they do not want to take any vote that is difficult about anything whether it be war immigration voting rights nothing stunning stunning congresswoman Marcia fudge well you're here in DC and I appreciate you being here on the moon day thank you very much thank you all right

THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE   GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED. MR. SHERMAN: THIS RESOLUTION   IMPOSES EXTRAORDINARY  RESTRICTIONS ON THIS PRESIDENT,  AN EXTRAORDINARY PRESIDENT WHO   NEEDS EXTRAORDINARY  RESTRICTIONS.  THIS IS BEST EXEMPLIFIED BY THE  PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS THAT HE   WOULD HIT CULTURAL SITES IN  IRAN.  NOT ONLY IS THAT A WAR CRIME,  BUT IT'S A MISTAKE.  BECAUSE IT DRIVES THE IRANIAN  PEOPLE TOWARD THE REGIME, WHILE  ALIENATING OUR EUROPEAN ALLIES   WHOSE SUPPORT FOR OUR SANCTIONS  IS CRITICAL FOR THEM TO WORK.  THE MINORITY LEADER CAME TO THIS FLOOR AND SAID DEMOCRATS WERE  DUPES OF THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC. I WILL COMPARE MY EFFORTS  AGAINST THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF  IRAN WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER   MEMBER.  YOU CAN ARGUE WHETHER  SOLEIMANI'S DEATH MAKES IT SAFER OR NOT OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. WE HAVE REMOVED A TERRORIST  MASTERMIND FROM THE BATTLEFIELD, BUT WE HAVE INSPIRED THE OTHER   TERRORISTS.  BUT THE REAL ISSUE IS EFFECT OF  IRAN'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM.  THAT PROGRAM IS MORROW BUS TODAY THAN IT WAS A WEEK AGO AS IRAN   HAS EMPLOYED MORE CENTRIFUGES  AND BUILDING A LARGER STOCKPILE  ALL WITHOUT OUR EUROPEAN FRIENDS WHO ARE STILL IN THE JCPOA   TAKING ANY ACTION AGAINST IRAN.  THERE WAS NO POLICY PROCESS ON   THE GOLF COURSE WHERE THE  PRESIDENT MADE THIS DECISION.  HE HEARD NOT FROM A SINGLE   EXPERT ON IRANIAN POLITICS,  RELIGION OR THE ECONOMY. OUR MAXIMUM PRESSURE CAMPAIGN IS DESIGNED TO PUT PRESSURE ON THE  IRANIAN PEOPLE THAT THEY CHOOSE  NOT TO ENDURE IT BUT DEMAND THAT THE NUCLEAR PROGRAM BE SCALED  BACK OR ENDED OR THE REGIME THAT HAS THAT PROGRAM BE SWEPT AWAY.  THIS ASSASSINATION UNDERCUTS   THAT EFFORT BY BUILDING SUPPORT  FOR THE REGIME AND ITS NUCLEAR   PROGRAM WITH MOST OF THE IRANIAN PEOPLE.  BY MAKING SOLEIMANI A MARTYR IN  FRONT OF A SHIITE POPULATION, A  SHIITE RELIGION THAT LIONIZES  MARTYRDOM, WE INCREASE T

order maybe generalizes canon can give them that order I want you to stand by general Honore I want to bring in another guest right now congressman Steny Hoyer he's the Democratic House Minority Congressman you made an impassioned plea this morning for the American citizens more than three and a half million Americans are in Puerto Rico right now give me your reaction to the federal response at least so far well I agree absolutely with general Honore who went into New Orleans and got the job done and we haven't done that we haven't deployed enough resources at this point time as he said Katrina was a more contained geographical area this is a much larger one and very frankly general Honore I think it has said it all we need to deploy every resource necessary very frankly that aircraft carry that went in to Florida should be diverted down to Puerto Rico now and the air assets the requisite personnel and what general Honore said I hope general Buchanan has all the authority he needs to get this job done we have people I talked to secretary Price this morning early this morning about people who are dying because of their inability to get to a dialysis center that works frankly they can't get anywhere some of the dialysis centers are up and running in some of the urban areas but folks can't get to it now we need to have enough personnel on the ground working every day to make sure that we could save lives there there will be time and we ought to have legislation to give the resources necessary to rehabilitate but right now this is about saving lives in the face of one of the biggest humanitarian crises we've had in this country America these are Americans and we ought to respond as vigorously as we respond to any other crisis in the world or here the mainland yeah we deployed the Abraham Lincoln the aircraft carrier the Abraham Lincoln to Florida and it would not be all that difficult to move that aircraft carrier over to Florida Rica right and I think we should yeah go ahead I was gonna say frankly Wolff we should have done that days ago a general Honore is correct I mean we yesterday we started mobilizing the day before that or two days before that I had called for appointing an individual similar to general Honore to be in charge of coordination and very frankly of getting the job done without having to worry about any red tape or any by-your-leave kind of comments we need to save lives we need to be in there with full resources that the Armed Forces can get the job done if they're given full authority to do so and the resources to get it get it done and if it requires more than one aircraft carrier send in two or three or four whatever it takes with the troops to save these people's lives that's why I say whatever resources are needed ought to be deployed frankly days ago but now very quickly when are you gonna vote on legislation to fund this massive reconstruction effort in Puerto Rico if this is not going to be cheap as you know well it's not going to be cheap but it needs to be done these are American citizens and just as we did in New Orleans just as we will do in Houston and as we'll do in Florida we need to make sure that with the states and of course Texas has resources Florida has resources Puerto Rico is stretched as we know they make great fiscal difficulties so we need to make sure that we we build back better we don't put in second-rate systems that would be subject to devastation by a category four or category five hurricane we've got to expect that's going to happen again and we need to prepare for that kind of what are you gonna vote for the funding well I think we'll both hopefully vote for the funding before we leave here in the next two weeks clearly one of the things that has to be done is an inventory and assessment of what spending is needed but we need to do this I think before I would hope and urge that we do it before we leave here we know them another two weeks and then we have a week break for a district work period again but frankly before we leave we ought to have a bill that appropriates sufficient funds won't be all the funds necessary that'll be done over time but whatever is needed in the short term we ought to provide authority for before we leave here in two weeks all right congressman Steny Hoyer thanks very much for joining us the people in Puerto Rico are counting on all of us to help during this desperate situation

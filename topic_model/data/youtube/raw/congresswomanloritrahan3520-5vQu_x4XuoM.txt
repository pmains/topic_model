my generation and every generation of women after us has grown up with the freedom and the security under roe v wade well today those protections are under attack from lawmakers and activists many of whom have never had to make the tough personal decisions about family planning or about the health of a pregnancy well those attacks have been successful and it's chilling as a mom of two young daughters rose on the verge of elimination and millions of women are rightly terrified of what that means for their bodily autonomy and the future of reproductive care even beyond abortion today we're going to pass the women's health protection act because we know that no one can be more trusted to make the best health decisions for themselves than women the government should not have a role in that choice and i reject the hypocrisy on the other side of the aisle that suggests otherwise please join us in passing this critical legislation and protect protecting reproductive rights protecting the freedom for of women to decide if not for the people you represent then for the women in your lives thank you madam speaker i yield back

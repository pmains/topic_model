with me now is congresswoman karen bass of california that's my first question for you congresswoman thank you for being here is that true that the fact that there was a guilty verdict makes it less likely that these reform bills will get through that's absolutely false it is the exact opposite yesterday was a hopeful day but joy as you know it was an important first step we have to have the sentencing now no i think it has created tremendous energy and hope and momentum and i do agree with senator scott we need to wrap this up and you're working with senator scott um who you know he has his own interesting story i remember going to a talk that he did with ej dion at georgetown where he talked about being stopped by police uh as a black man that he's been through this himself as a black man he would know how sincere do you think he is in not only being wanting this bill to get through but also in being able to deliver the 10 republican votes that he would need the last time his version of the bill failed to get cloture it went down 55 to 45. do you think he can deliver the 10 votes well i do i mean i think that he's been an honest broker throughout this process i think he's very sincere and yes he does have his own personal story i don't know too many black people men or women who don't have their own personal story but i'll tell you one part of his personal story was just recently being stopped by the capitol police he had his senate pin on they asked for his drop his driver's license and that wasn't that long ago and so everybody has their personal stories for me this is very personal and i think all of that is going to help us get it across the finish line let's talk about the differences in the bills because i think the fear that a lot of people have is that a compromise bill won't really do much right that you know the original bill that passed through the house would ban chokeholds it would ban no knock warrants it did a lot of stuff that is really important to people are are we looking at having to give that up and still allow police to be able to do what they did to brianna taylor to do no knock warrants to choke people out like they did with george floyd no i think it's really critical we're not talking about window dressing or smoking mirrors we are talking about substantive legislation i think it's accurate to say that we have discussions we do not have formal negotiations which would have to be designated and appointed by leadership but i do think that there's enough common ground so when we're talking about a bill we're not talking about the justice act which was senator scott's bill there are elements in that bill that you know were similar but we are talking about legislation that has a t has teeth in it and holding police accountable is absolutely critical i mean derek shavin didn't think anybody was going to hold him accountable that's why he was looking at the camera and doing what he was doing and that has to end and and so i don't know if you have had conversations with the floyd family um floyd was on earlier on the show and he's very much interested in being a part of the advocacy for this build you guys had conversations with the family i have not had direct conversations not recently uh to me it's just i haven't really wanted to talk to them about the bill because i feel like you know the the centerpiece was the trial and then just their grieving process yeah but i am absolutely ready willing and able to involve them in every kind of way you know we love we never get to do good news on this show so i want you to maybe if you have it uh give me some do you think that we could in theory have a george floyd policing act a justice bill before the anniversary of his murder yes there is no reason for us not to you know we introduced this bill almost a year ago and so it's time to act and how much more do we need and what i'm worried about joy because you know the way this works the energy is there now there could be a hurricane or something tomorrow that completely shifts the agenda and so we absolutely have to act now i think people demanded it i think that's why people voted for us and so we have to deliver i gotta ask you about uh the confirmation of anita gupta for justice department number three despite a lot of opposition also kristin clark who is phenomenal as well what what will be the change here was a 51 to 49 vote is very close senator lisa murkowski actually crossed over and did vote for her what do you think they'll be able to accomplish and change at justice that's important i think it's just going to be amazing i have worked with these two women who i believe are phenomenal and they are going to make a big difference between them and the number one thing that needs to be needs to happen is the rebuilding of the department of justice so that it is a justice department that works for america and not a justice department that works for an individual and i think they will lead the way they will restore the civil rights teeth in the department of justice congresswoman karen bass can you keep us up to date please on what's going on with this bill a lot of interest here so we really want to know so yes please keep in touch with the show thank you very much absolutely

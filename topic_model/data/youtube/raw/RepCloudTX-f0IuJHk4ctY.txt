today we celebrate national manufacturing day honoring the men and women across our nation who are involved in manufacturing our nation's manufacturing jobs are growing at the fastest pace in 23 years unemployment rates rise the lowest level in decades here in our part of Texas tens of billions of dollars are being invested in new factories trading thousands of construction jobs in the near term and high-paying permanent jobs over the long term from the port of Corpus Christi where we're breaking export records a caterpillar plant Victoria American manufacturing is rebounding the strength of American manufacturing is being driven by pro-growth policies that empower the American worker the president and conservative leaders in Congress have enacted policies that have placed the brakes on Washington regulations lower taxes on American employers adopted tax policies that actually encourage rather than discourage investment and we've tapped the American oil and gas resources at the Eagle Ford and Permian Basin American manufacturing is back and I'm proud to support it

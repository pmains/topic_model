let's bring in candidate for the Senate on the Republican side Pat Toomey with us on the big Tucker 1210 hey peg welcome back in and I can see the good work you're doing your crisscrossing the state I am indeed driving south from wilkes-barre as we speak but thanks for having me on the show well thank you pat thanks very much give me a sense of what you think is the state of the union what's on your mind look where it's very very troubled um I mean I agree with your point the American people and certainly people across Pennsylvania are rising up and demanding that we get our government back that a totally out of control men in Washington start to listen to the people and start to actually represent them so so you know we're going to recover from this down the people are going to demand that we are correct for a federal government that's really run out of control it seems to be captured by the most liberal left wing of the Democratic Party who try to take us on a lurch to the left and we're going to have a major correction and then we're going to sort this out but but it's a not we're going through some awfully tough times right now and they're getting worse because some of the flawed policies that we're seeing in Washington yeah so you're sensing to a pat not just the issues that you and I have talked about and you've been very consistent on these but that people are melding these together and that's what the Scott Brown race was about and somebody in your position that has to be pretty encouraging to see that Scott Brown could win in that state well it woulda let's face in Massachusetts is a lot more liberal in Pennsylvania's and Massachusetts just elected a Republican to the Senate and it was not all about health care it was a lot about health care but health care is just the most recent and maybe the most egregious and certainly the most personal of the efforts on the part of this government Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid who seem to be running the show and who are just trying to take us on this huge lurch to the left I mean dumb it's the endless bailouts of failing companies its spending on a staggering level its debt that we can't afford and then they come along and say by the way we're going to take over health care well thank God the American people are reacting against this well absolutely not Pat I know that those been the issues that you've stuck on and I commend how discipline you are to stick on these because that's the paramount concern but I saw in the Scott Brown race that I'm hearing with listeners here and I'm wandering across Pennsylvania since the crotch bomber and since we learned that under the direction of Eric Holder he personally was responsible for this we only had 50 minutes with a guy who knows where other bombers that he trained with our and then we let him lawyer up are you hearing that the Terrorism issue because it played out in the brown race big time yeah it's unforgivable what they've done there this look the federal government's first responsibility is to protect the American people here you have a guy who's attempting who's bound and determined to commit mass murder against Americans he's a terrorist we know that that's not even in question and to think that they would let him the the first thing he does is we give him his Miranda rights we give him a lawyer I mean and then when they were challenged on this and said well you know how are we going to get the information about well where does he come from and who's behind this and what kind of resources and who is coming next and where are they gonna hit ya how are we going to get that information and you know what their answer was well he might give it to us if we offer him a plea bargain can you imagine we should happen this conversation done and I would imagine across vast parts of Pennsylvania that you probably know better than I do Pat that that has to reverberate and that your opponent come the fall certainly can't defend that it's well there's the thing well who is it pronin is question number one but you know Joe Sestak on the day that they announced that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed the actual mastermind of September 11th right the day that they announced that he would be tried in a criminal court in manhattan which is an outrageous mistake joe sestak went on TV repeatedly yes and the decision about how that was such a great thing well he this is fundamentally miss reading that this is a war these people are trying to kill as many Americans as possible our job is to stop them not to lawyer them up absolutely Pat I couldn't agree with you more and in the infamous Washington shown which you know Sestak did take position among all the other things that went on there yeah it's so far out of step with where Pennsylvania is down well a pet is there anything new out there too that you see in the campaign or people just focus in on those issues and your travels and talking with people is there any other area that you've uncovered to that seems to be their focus there are a lot of things you know but the important thing is what you just said it's focused what are people focused on they want this economy to grow people want to provide for their families they want a future for their kids so they want a strong economy where jobs are growing wagers a rising standard of living is increasing and we know where that comes from Dom that does not come from just ever higher taxes and spending in a big bloated government in fact that makes it more difficult to reach the kind of economic prosperity that we're capable of so I'm focusing and I'm hearing from people all across Pennsylvania let's focus on getting this economy moving again you know we can make some modest reforms to healthcare that will help improve accessibility and help to lower costs but we don't belong turn in the whole system upside down spending a trillion dollars that we don't have all kinds of tax increases and mandates this was just a very ill conceived approach this government ought to be focused on growing the economy creating jobs absolutely Pat Toomey give the website for folks that want to help or see what you're all about to me percentage calm I'd sure be grateful for your listeners to check it out to me for Senate calm join this effort to take back our government restore some balance some common sense some fiscal discipline let's end the bailouts and let's get the economy moving again good stuff Pat thank you for being in touch with us and that we appreciate it thanks for

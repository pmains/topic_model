gentleman from south carolina is recognized thank you madam speaker and i thank the gentleman for yielding me the time let me begin by thanking my friend mr smith uh mr davis uh thank you so much mr defazio mr swazi thank you guys very much for bringing forth this bipartisan bill in march 2019 samantha jefferson a 21 year old native of new jersey was finishing her senior year at the university of south carolina in my congressional district she was a great student and had earned a full scholarship to study drexel university school of law to pursue her dream of practicing international law sammy as she was known to her family and friends did not get a chance to fulfill those dreams after an evening out with friends she decided to order a rideshare home video captured her getting into a black car that she assumed was her ride instead of being her ride the unmarked car was driven by a predator who kidnapped and killed her today we are voting on simon's law to put protections in place to prevent similar tragedies this legislation makes it illegal for anyone other than the rideshare companies to sell ride share vehicle signs so predators can impersonate and authorize drivers it also institutes the additional safeguard of a new code system that will allow the passenger to verify that the vehicle is their ride before they get into the car finally the bill sets up a new council at the department of transportation to develop performance standards for ride share technology to ensure that our safety protocols keep up with the pace of technology i want to thank once again congressman chris smith my republican colleague for samus neutra she's from uh new jersey hometown for his sponsorship of this bipartisan bill i have met with samuel's parents and i want to thank them for their strength and commitment to ensuring this legislation becomes law and i want to thank my colleagues in advance of their votes hopefully in favor of this legislation that will allow samus legacy and enacts important safeguards to protect ride share users from predator behavior and i'll give back the balance of my time

good evening everyone and welcome to congressman pete sauber telephone town hall we are glad that you joined us tonight you will have the opportunity to hear about the many issues that are important to Minnesota's ace congressional district as well as what congressman Stauber has been working on in Washington DC you will also be able to speak directly with congressman solder to ask the question if you would like to ask congressman Sauber a question please press star 3 at any time during the call we look forward to a thoughtful and respectful dialogue again press star 3 to ask a question at any time thank you well good afternoon everyone this is congressman pete sauber I am so glad that you all could join me for this telephone town hall I will start this call with a brief overview of recent legislative action and then open up the floor for you to ask questions as you heard Kelsey say please press star 3 if you would like to ask a question I want to begin by saying what an honor it is to represent you all in Congress I take this responsibility very seriously and it is forums such as these that help me better represent you in Washington as your representative in Congress I am excited to tell you that constituent service is a central function of our office whether it's helping veterans or seniors secure the benefits they deserve coordinating a tour of the US Capitol for families visiting washington d.c flying a flag over the US Capitol to commemorate an important event or helping individuals navigate the difficulties of a federal agency my staff and I are here to serve you if you need assistance then I encourage you to call my office at to one eight four eight one six three nine six or visit my website at star house go again if you need assistance I encourage you to call the office two one eight four eight one six three nine six or visit my website at Stauber st Auber house gov you know it's hard to believe but we are just over six months into the 116 Congress and while some of the media would have you believe that Congress is broken I am proud to tell you that I am committed to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to find common-sense solutions to the most pressing issues facing our nation one of the priorities this Congress is protecting American workers from unfair trade deals you and I know that American workers can compete with anyone in the world so long as there is a fair and level playing field unfortunately for too long one-sided trade deals have left our workers at a competitive disadvantage fortunately President Trump recently put the American worker first and negotiated a deal with Canada and Mexico that would eliminate many practices and trade barriers that have long hindered US companies access to Mexican and Canadian markets in short this deal would deliver a win to those working in Minnesota factories as well as our farmers want to export more of their products even though members of both parties agree that strong trading relationship between Mexico and Canada are vital speaker Pelosi continues to drag her feet and refuse to bring the USMC to the House floor for a vote while speaker Pelosi delays the approval of the USMC our workers and farmers continue to face an uncertain future and I do want to add just today the country of Mexico approved in their legislative process the u.s. MCA you know Congress owes it to the American people to quickly enact the USMC and deliver a new era of job creation and economic prosperity I promise you all that I remain committed to see to seeing the u.s. MCA passed another issue I am prioritizing is rural broadband I recently held a Small Business Committee field hearing in scandia to hear from small business owners and families lacking access to broadband and examine what can be done at the federal level to ensure every Minnesotan has access to quick and reliable broadband with quick and reliable broadband access even the smallest columns of communities can compete with the rest of the world unfortunately much more still needs to be done to connect communities across rural Minnesota and America to high-speed Internet access it is imperative that we close the digital divide between urban and rural communities at broad as broadband is vital to the success of every small business school hospital and student you know during this hearing I was joined by a few of my colleagues including representative Jim Hagedorn and Angie Craig I am thankful to be working with my colleagues from both sides of the aisle on the issue together we can assure that every American family and business has access to quick and reliable broadband as the father of work beautiful children I believe every life has value and will continue to be a pro-life advocate in Congress at the moment of conception every human being shall have all the rights and privileges granted by our Constitution that's why I find it incredibly troublesome that some of my colleagues have either the babies who survived abortions should not be given the same level of medical care that other newborns received I am a proud sponsor of the born alive abortion survivors Protection Act which would require healthcare practitioners to provide the degree of care to children born prematurely as a result of an abortion as they would any other child well common sense the morality would argue that this bill should have become law of the land years ago speaker Pelosi disagrees refusing to bring this bill to the House floor for a vote Congress must always stand up for the sanctity of life so earlier today before the House of Representatives I asked for immediate consideration of the born alive survivors Protection Act for the 61st time Democrat leadership and speaker Pelosi blocked mandatory medical care for children born alive rest assured I will not give up and during my time in Congress I will always fight to protect life I am so honored and humbled to have the opportunity to represent you in Congress you know with that mind if you want to ask a question please press star 3 and we will get started with the questions and again thank you everybody for spending some time with me this evening all right thank you again for joining congressman pete sauber teller town hall don't forget to press star 3 to enter a question in the queue I repeat I repeat don't forget to press star 3 to enter a question in the queue ok so up next we have break and Frank has a question about transportation phrase you are now live on the call yeah I want to all we get the process going to add a third lane to interstate 35 from Forest Lake to Hinckley the backup traffic is horrendous on weekends and during the day from North Branch because Forest Lake it's backed up terribly and it's saying we should get on top of that before it gets to bed how does that be possible to get started you know Frank thank you for the comment and the question you're exactly right you know I I travel that interstate quite a bit because the southern part of our district is just in that area and so you look at the opportunity to kind of look ahead and for me it's to bring these issues that are not only supported by like the MnDOT Minnesota Department astron and other communities in that corridor it's really important that we we advocate for for that those those third lanes in those congested areas because you're exactly right when we go down there certain times so that at certain times the the weekends you know if you're coming back to down south from the weekend it is backed up like like nobody's business and then it's also backed up going north on the weekend so frame to your point those all things that are discussed but what we're looking at in transportation infrastructure committee is is to look at these projects that have value and then put the investment so we can make sure that traffic flows to and from in a smooth and the most important aspect is the safety of our motoring public so that's a really good suggestion Frank and and like I say I've experienced the same thing you've described and those are some things that we want to work with MnDOT with and in particular make sure that we have a robust transportation and infrastructure package as we go forward here thank you Frank very good question all right up next we have Dan and Dan has a question about what the congressman is doing in regards to seniors and health care Dan you are now live on the call it's a thank you I was just curious I know people like myself that it worked 45 years and retired and all that we're on but still paying into Medicare and supplementary insurance and all that it's getting to the point where you can't afford it a 30-year check is going for your hospitalization and your pills and all that and there's got to be something done about because I 45 years I consider myself a lawyer I paid my taxes I paid my dues and I think something should be done to help the seniors on this dan I couldn't agree with you more you're spot on and and you know my elderly parents my mother my father is 85 and my mother's 83 and they too have paid their entire life into Medicare and we owe it to them to make sure that they get the services that this country promised you know the goal for me is to protect Medicare for those who have paid into it and Ian you talked about and we can talk about lowering the cost of prescription drugs I can tell you that just recently out of the Energy and Commerce Commission came a bipartisan unanimous vote out of the energy commerce that we need to look at drug pricing we need transparency in our drug manufacturing and allow generics to come into the market sooner that came out unanimously out of energy and commerce when it came to the floor of a house down Speaker Pelosi could not help herself by putting for affordable care amendments on that it did passed the House Speaker Pelosi knew that if it passed the house Senator McConnell wouldn't even pick it up nor with the President signed it to become law so this is the frustrating part of the drug transparency and the drug prescription prices that that are that are costing a soul I mean millions and millions of dollars across this nation and as you said it is not fair that you pay a great portion of your retirement for medicine and prescription drugs but I want to share this with all the listeners here that's the stuff that speaker Pelosi is putting on the floor had she not put those four ACA provisions this would have been in to the Senate and it would have been most likely in law very soon that we hold the drug companies accountable transparency we want to cost of the drug and be able to get prescriptions in Souter because that's a benefit for us the users and it was frustrating to see that but I can tell you that the EPA told Edie for me I'm this is a this is a so important that we work on this element and make sure that we have the ability to to make sure that the pharmaceuticals understand that they're not going to take advantage of America anymore we've had it and this is Dan I'm not I don't know what prescriptions you're on but we can name XYZ prescription in most Minnesotans and it's frustrating so I am working extremely hard across the aisle to make sure that take away the Republican Democrat do what's right and and the thing which is right is to make sure that those drug companies bring their the price of their products down and bring competition into the market all right thank you Dan so next we have John from cloquet who had the question about the windfall elimination provision John you are now live on the call well hi John hi I'm calling regards to the windfall tax Oh illumination that took took away 50% of my Social Security die earned and this not only affect me affected every military technician whether you work for the Army Reserve the neighbor reserved their National Guard army army national car or the Marine Reserve we lost 50% of our Social Security that we had earned through the years and I spoke to representatives put some stuff on this probably a couple years ago and there was nothing done about it the federal court a sixth District Court ruled that this thing was illegal to do but nobody has done anything about it to help the technicians that are retired John thank you very much for bringing up that point you made a comment that nobody has done anything about it I will add up until now because I have co-sponsored hr:141 which is the Social Security Fairness Act this bill repeals the windfall elimination provision and fixes the issue that you just spoke about this to me is common sense John why should you be penalized why should you be penalized in your Social Security because you have another retirement this is except this even on the campaign trail John is this was a huge issue and so I agree with you and I'm fighting for this legislation to move forward and that we must protect social security my job now in the minority is to make sure that speaker Pelosi puts it on the House floor for a vote rather than playing partisan politics so I couldn't agree with you more and I'm doing on this win for eliminating the windfall provision John you're exactly right it should have been done years ago but I want to tell you I jumped on this bill and I co-sponsored this bill very early because it's the right thing to do and you have earned that privilege of taking your Social Security and here and your retirement fully thank you John that I passionate about that thanks for the call all right thank you John so up next we have a question from Kerry Kerry has a question on helping citizens in rural areas Kerry you are now live on the call good day thank you very much for your time and consideration congressman sever we are in need in our rural areas here of who stake and barnum especially volunteer drivers who can help us get to our medical appointments in the larger cities like Duluth and so forth and I interned in congressman over Starr's office in 1992 and learned a lot still have a lot to learn and I just want to thank you for your service and for your stand on abortion as well I am a member of the Minnesota citizens concerned for life and also regarding student loans I went to a private college there in the Twin Ports and now they are taking my social security over two hundred eleven dollars every month to pay back student loans which are mostly interest added on to them and any help that you can give people like myself would be so much appreciated and you're in my first well Terry that's a I really appreciate not only your comments but that we are in your prayers that's really special to your point of the volunteer drivers I just want to share with you that is critically important for in rural Minnesota that that are that those volunteer drivers who drive their neighbors and patients to medical treatment they should be treated fairly and that's exactly what I co-sponsored the volunteer driver Appreciation Act which gives our all with your drivers the proper tax write-off for their mileage and not only that we have to look at what the insurance companies are requiring of our volunteer drivers who we've had in place for many many years helping out their community some insurance companies are treating those volunteer drivers as if it's a business and that's simply wrong and what I like to do is make sure that that as we that is volunteer driver appreciation act that it gets to the floor for the vote because you know what members of Congress are listen on both sides of the aisle understand rural transportation and it's important that we make sure that rural transportation is available and that we take care of these volunteer drivers because you know what sometimes it's transportation alone that will keep our senior citizens in the home that they grew up in and work for their entire life so I want to be I want to tell you Terry that I'm a champion for that the volunteer driver appreciation act it is so important that that we make sure that our volunteers our rural areas can help our friends and neighbors in need for rights you know to in to the city or to their appointments and also I do Terry share your love of life thank you for the question all right up next we have a question from Greg read the question on rural broadband gray you are now live on the call thank you very much for taking the time and taking my call yes I listen to you a congressman and regards to the rural broadband you know proposals and and requests I had lived all of just three and a half miles from a rural community and not even the phone company Centrelink will bring us even a quality enough line that I could even have a voice conversation much less data and there is no other option other than using Verizon and trying to use that as an internet and I can tell you at an extremely high expense to us to be able to do so and because of the limitations of what they impose on us we're constantly running out of any speed and running at a very low rate and one of the side neglects of that is because as I'm reaching the older age and need medications a lot of that has to be accessed online and now we're being penalized and not being able to access that as well it just seems like even the phone companies need to be made to install adequate transmission lines to be able to allow this capability Greg I I want to thank you for the call in the comment and the concern as you know and I've always said this that rural America rural Minnesota matters and for many years we've talked about delivering rural broadband you know a high-speed internet is not a luxury anymore it's a necessity for a variety of reasons and Greg you talked about picking up your prescriptions and what have you that's how important it is we also have to understand that's important for schools for small businesses for our rural hospitals to have the ability to have high-speed reliable broadband to keep us in the 21st century you know we're looking at we're looking at small business expansion in rural Minnesota rural America it was two weeks ago that I held the very first rural broadband meeting was literally an extension of the Small Business Committee that I'm a ranking member of and we held a meeting in scandia Minnesota on the importance of rural broadband and that we matter and what was disappointing is the gentleman's business that we're at he said had I known that broadband was not going to be effective in this area I would not have located my business there that was that was really hard for me to hear because here's a rural community hiring and employing a 1011 people in a rural community good-paying jobs that's important and so the rule broadband is extremely important and I have to share this with you Greg I was speaking to an individual from the Federal Reserve in Minneapolis and we were talking about the investment that this country has to make in rural broadband and he said this to me he said Pete at some point in the history of this country this government decided to deliver mail to every mailbox in this country that like that that says it all we need to make the investment and that rule America matters we do not take a second we do not take a backseat rather to anybody in the metro or the urban areas and I can tell you that on the TNI committee we've talked about and we have enough representation from rural America that we've we're not the we want to put our words in action we want the other the other members of the committee to put forth the investment into rural broadband because it matters to us and so Greg thanks for the call I'm very very passionate on getting this done and you know many of us are impatient because we've heard the federal government talk about a talk about we want to act now let's make the investment to ensure our rural residents have access to it sure our schools keep our rural hospitals open and keep our business expansion expanding in rural America so thank you very much okay thanks again for everyone who joined our Town Hall don't forget to press star three to enter a question in the queue so up next we have a question from Kathy Kathy you are now live on the call hi I just wondered where you stand on the gun issues basically you're all together not anything specific just in general yeah Kathy appreciate the question obviously our Second Amendment is important so the minimum to the Constitution and and I've always said this that that I want to support our Second Amendment and allow law-abiding individual citizens the right to keep and bear arms and that's critically important and so Kathy I'll bring you back to my 23 years in law enforcement at 22 of them in the city of Duluth I retired as a area commander in in December of 1995 I was shot in the head by a career criminal and survived obviously and so the frustration frustrating part for me was I survived and the US attorney in Minneapolis would not charge that individual who tried to take my life with felon in possession of a handgun it was crystal clear and I know that our detective bureau John Hall at the time was adamant that they charge this individual who tried to take my life while off-duty and the US attorney in Minneapolis wouldn't do it how frustrating is that that was extremely frustrating for my wife and I cuz she was my fiancee at the time and witnessed this horrific crime furthermore let's fast-forward just a couple years on the job on an address on London Road in Duluth where we were working on a on a case involving a hostage situation I had a career criminal a pro made quickly from Rihanna corner put the gun to my face and pull the trigger and by the grace of God it malfunctioned and I was literally fighting for my life now with that being said nobody wants a drug dealer a career criminal somebody going through a mental health crisis to possess or purchase a firearm nobody but don't take that right away from law-abiding citizens so these two individuals these two individuals continued their behavior and victimized many people and I want to be crystal clear about six weeks ago there was a tragedy an absolute tragedy in Hermantown Minnesota where two deputies were involved in a shoot with a criminal and I mean it was a tragedy and the criminal dire Cathy I want to tell you that that criminal that tragically died six seven weeks ago in the city of her McDonald was the same individual 20 years ago that tried to take my life and so I will tell you this I have love and respect for our law enforcement what they have to the calls for service they may have to go on etc but I don't believe that me or my wife who are concealed carry holder by the way should should be diminished the ability to carry because you're not afraid and I'm not afraid of me or my wife I am afraid of an individual who's a criminal who's a who's a sells drugs if it going to a crisis that's what I'm concerned about and so I think together together we can have the ability to make positive positive legislation on the firearms and the current concerns it up if we take out forget our read playbook and forget our blue playbook you know we want to make sure that we live in the safest society there is we talked about kids going to school school and churches should be the safest parts of our community our worship spots and our schools and at times they're not so I I just want to let you know that for me I have no no more I have no more energy and of supporting our Second Amendment for individual lighting citizens to purchase and possess a handgun if they qualify and go to the proper procedure but there is nobody I know nobody that wants criminals and drug dealers to continue to harm our folks Kathy thank you very much for the question okay everyone do not forget to press star three to enter a question in the queue so up next we have a question from carries with from Zimmerman Carrie has a question about the wall here you are now live on the wall thank you for having me I want to know when we can start pushing and getting that wall through to keep those that we don't want in the United States out and protect the citizens that are here in our country safe Terry thank Terry thanks for the question from them from the Zimmerman area and I just want to share with you that you know I just talked to you about my law enforcement past and when I'd go on a when I go on calls for service as a donut place officer there was always two sides to the story when I'd go and investigate and I knew that the truth was somewhere in between and you work through that through investigations and in re-interviewing and maybe audio or video tape or what have you but I have to tell you that that this the issue of immigration and the crisis on the border when it was coming you know coming for several months ago I said that I wanted to go down to the southern border and I spent four days at the Yuma sector Arizona border 126 miles on the week before Easter I wanted to go down there and see it for myself Terry and you know they talked about a picture's worth a thousand words I can tell you seeing is believing the week I was down there the Yuma Arizona mayor declared an emergency because there NGOs their non government organizations would be an overrun with illegal immigrants and what was happening and I'll share this with you what was happening was the the I'll give you an example like lutheran Social Services or the Red Cross or the damiano or the Chum Center in downtown Duluth those are NGOs just like in Yuma Arizona they were overwhelmed there were overburdened the American we can't handle anymore so I wanted to go down to see for myself I went down there and stood on the banks of the Colorado River which is about 40 feet wide waist-deep and there was there's over brush on each side of the river on the United States side and the country of Mexico side it was broad daylight I'm with the Customs and Border Patrol they're showing me the area I can hear people talking on the other side of the Colorado River in the country of Mexico there underbrush so I can't see them but I can hear them I asked the Border Patrol age of this I said if they come over to our country right now why don't they come during the daylight and literally kind of chuckled he said Petey each one of those people pay the drug cartels between five and seven thousand dollars to give them to get them safely over the through the river into the United States and they do it at night because when they bring 5460 people over with a child it consumes all the Border Patrol resources in that area which leaves the left flank and the right flank open that's where the drug runners ourselves are sending their coyotes to run drugs across this country it's happening every single day and tell you what I what I want to share with you is this I saw fifty-four people come across the border at night and give themselves up and guess what everyone with the exception of two females had a child with them keep in mind the Flores decision it was a US Supreme Court decision that said a family quote family cannot be detained longer than 20 days at the border so they're exploiting this law by coming over and they're giving themselves up to the Border Patrol and they say we are a family the Border Patrol has to take them at their word to say no they can't prove that they're not the child of that illegal immigrant they have 48 hours to get as much information and on the on the immigrant and the child and they let them go into this country with the promise that in - between two and five years they'll show up in court for their Asylum during we know less than 10% show up and this is what the this is where the term catch and release is all about and so where I'm asking the Border Patrol I asked the Yuma sector chief I said sir do you have a crisis down there he looked at me and he says we have a crisis we are overwhelmed I went to a detention facility that was meant that was originally built for 246 illegal immigrants or 246 people the day I was there they had over 1100 illegal immigrants trying to process in a detention center they they actually had to expand out in the parking lot and then give and then get portable air conditioners and I have to tell you Terry for me as a father afford to look into those children's eyes who were being trafficked the Border Patrol says they go into this country females were flying back to Guatemala and no Salford or the kids and then they rent them out to the cartels to have their illegals pay the cartels five to seven thousand to grab a kid again and walk across it's cyclical and we I believe Terry Congress has to act speaker Pelosi will not touch this issue and being in the minority there's nothing we can do at this point other than show her there's a crisis at the border now you know people are starting to talk about there are there is a crisis at the border I'm going to share with you Terry that I have one of my colleagues my Democratic colleagues I said you go down there and we'll talk when you come back he says got it beat my Democratic colleagues went down to the border he came back he says you are right there's a crisis and we need to do something that's my good Democratic friend and he understands so now we have to get the speaker to say we have some issues we need to to put forth funding for those children right now because we're running out of funding and the president has requested this sever several weeks ago so we have a crisis I could before a.m. Terry I want to tell you three things when I was down there the Border Patrol these are the experts these are the absolute experts said we need there's three parts to the equation to secure and have credibility on our borders it is a physical barrier or a wall it is increased technology and it is personnel those are the three things that those experts and law enforcement that are that are protecting our border have requested from us in Congress and goal is to help deliver that but it's frustrating when we have a Speaker of the House who wants to politicize this issue and so we're working on it and and I'm not I you know from my law enforcement background Terry I believe this nation is a country of law and order we are Republic and I support legal immigration where the immigrant wants to come to our great country live their version of the American dream and contribute thanks for the question Terry okay so just a reminder to press star three tent or a question in the queue up next we have a question from Dale this question has to do with helping local County Sheriff with our mess issue jail you are now live on the call thank you a bit of starter and I really appreciate the good job you're doing I talked quite forgiving risk both local county sheriff's clearly American County about a big problem they're having with meth addiction and the drugs that are coming into our Minnesota obviously but that coming into rural Minnesota and I'm just wondering if there isn't something on federal law enforcement folks couldn't be doing kind of more than overarching we've got some skill sets that probably a local sheriff's department don't have and I know there's a rail to bring them to bear and provide a little more support because as you know as a recruiter enforcement guy the folks on the street you're fighting this on the front line but I'm asking for a little more support for the federal government kind of an overarching Clinton it would would support a local law enforcement folks yeah they'll go we deal we can talk about you're absolutely right the drug addiction problem you'll be at crisis it's real you know as you know my background I've given too many death notifications unsuspecting parents and so here's what one of the things that I have been I really have the privilege of standing and group in front of groups or certain you know talking about certain legislation from my experience there's no there's very few members in Congress both the House and the Senate that have ever worn the law enforcement you know form so we have those of us who have served have credibility in talking about the drug issue one of the things deal that we're trying to do and I've supported and wrote a letter on behalf is the Haida money H I DEA which is a high intensity drug trafficking area and we're looking at when I first started in my law enforcement career deal we looked at the city of Minneapolis as kind of the hub they were bringing the drugs from from our southern border into for instance Denver Chicago and other parts of the East Coast and then running them north and when I first started they were basically the hub was in the Minneapolis st. Paul area guess what the hub now is in northern Minnesota the hub is in Duluth and the spokes reach out to you know the ache in st. Louis Crow Wing lay cook coochie-coochie shanks Isanti County they reach everywhere and so that money is federal money designated for drug and gang task force to target these individuals and to stop the flow of illegal drugs and one of the things they'll tell you is there's three things there's three things that we must concentrate on to solve this crisis number one is prevention we have to prevent our young kids from succumbing to peer pressure in that for a lack of a better term soft moment to quote try or experiment with because that's the time that that they can get addicted or hooked and the second thing is treatment we have to have treatment facilities Dale that are open at the time the addict needs to help at their lowest point is when the addict will ask for help we a society cannot when an addict asks for help he or she is on the low point of that quote hi they're asking for help and when they do that the door has to be open because if we as society say okay a John Doe thanks for asking for help for your addiction we're going to put you in a food you know get you in treatment 30 days that's too late Dale we have to do it right away and then the prosecution we have to prosecute these drug dealers that are killing our kids our friends and our family members because it's devastating to the families and our communities it is not a victimless crime and I will say this bill you know we have there's a push to have legalized marijuana like like the state of Colorado legalized marijuana I would say this ha I totally am against it I disagree with that because I believe it's a gateway drug I could tell you for kids that I dealt with as a police officer three of the four are not with us because of a drug overdose and they started with marijuana and there's a lot of examples that devastates that marijuana does to our brains does to our our you know as we grow up how it affects us and so I asked I asked this how many more people impaired drivers do we want on the road how many more do we want and we as a community need to step up and say no you know we have right now we have the governor talking about the potential of legalizing marijuana and then also in the same sentence talks about the ability to have for drug treatment clinics to me why don't we just not legalize it because it's bad and make sure that treatment facilities are open for those folks that want help and we can do we can do better now with that being said Dale I will say this that there there's there's there are science to some part of the plant that may be beneficial for chronic diseases who have you you know to have the ability to look at that option for for somebody that's chronically ill or terminally ill you know I think we have we have a hope you should at least have that conversation but I will not support Mara legalizing marijuana so our young kids can smoke on the street corner and and think it's legal so and I know I think daily you would agree that we've got we've got to take this and hit it head-on and make sure that our rule representation is part of that equation that removes that federal money for a height of the federal money for a drug treatment and rehabilitation is front and center because we we who live in rural America and rural Minnesota should never take a backseat on these types of issues okay Thank You Gail I'm just reminder to everyone to press star three if you have a question for the congressman up next we have a question from Shauna Shauna has a question about abortion Shauna you're not live on the hall Thank You representative summer for taking my call thank you again for being a pro-life representative but also just having a lot of common sense we don't see that a lot in politics these days my question is not necessarily on abortion but is more general having to do with many of the life issues I'm a healthcare provider in Duluth and I've worked in many states where we've seen laws not only on abortion but on euthanasia and physician assisted suicide advance and knowing they fear the law that they tried to pass in Minnesota and hearing some of the language in that that discusses no opt outs for hospitals and for health care providers I'm just wondering if there's anything we can do as far as of course we want to protect life at all all stages I'm wondering if there's anything we can do to protect health care providers like myself who went into this business to help people get healthier or to walk with them through their suffering at no cost would I ever want to be involved in taking someone's life no matter how old they were whether it's at the beginning of life or at the end of life you know I oftentimes think when I hear things like this I'm going to have to find another job and I'm not qualified for much I'm a single mom of two kids and I can't take a job that makes half my salary because I have student loans I have things to pay but I don't feel you know is there anything that protects us as healthcare providers the majority of us don't agree with these things that are being pushed into society as being normal or being helpful they're not even healthcare ya know Shauna I tryna what a perfect very good question especially timely question in the environment we're living in and as we as we move towards the election you're going to there's going to be more focus on pro-life and abortion conversations and and first of all I think shall you and I share the same opinion that life begins at conception and ends at natural death and and that for me standing on the House floor today talking about protecting those babies who survived an abortion that they need to be given that cared just like any other infant that was has been born you know you stated you have two children two beautiful children my wife and I are blessed with four beautiful children and I have to tell you that I was present at each of their burps and I can't tell you in my own mind what a miracle life is to to see a see my children my wife birth my children it's just a beautiful just a beautiful moment our lives and and we have to we have to make sure that in our conversations you know if we if we run into a woman in crisis pregnancy we give we nurture her we give her support we give her you know options and and of course we want to make sure that life is one of those options that you choose is life and that we also look have to look at that there's the adoption have the availability to to you know put that child up for adoption but we have to nurture that mom through that that that pregnancy and make sure that that in our mind to choose his life for you know for that child and that's why one of the shot of one of the very first things I did when I got to Congress I sent a letter to our president and asking him to veto a legislation there weakened the pro-life protections you know he then announced that he would do just that at the March for Life you know we must be supportive of women's health care and at the same time if it is against the doctors relationship or perform an abortion or euthanasia they should not be forced to perform such a procedure and I think that's fundamentally part of our discussion part of that equation and that's I think shadow you brought that up if it's truly against your conscience that that you shouldn't have to have to suggest that supported or you know perform it or what have you push into it you know our goal is to you know our goal right now and I think it should be is is we need to honor life every life is precious you know many years ago I was a police officer in Duluth and I worked an event there there's a gal she has now passed away her name is Norma McCorvey she came to Duluth she was the the Jane Doe in Roe vs. Wade and remember Norma McCorvey worked at a Planned Parenthood for her early part of her life the latter part of her life she changed her position and became an ardent advocate for pro-life legislation and pro-life causes and she talked about just a in that defining moment and she talks about how she felt guilty for what you did earlier in her career and Seana it forgot and for those of you are on the line it's a book Norma McCorvey helped write a book it's called one by law and the title is one W o n by love I can say that I read that book many years ago I couldn't put it down it was so fast meaning how through her conscious and prayer that she turned up she changed to that being supportive of life and so Shawna keep keep up keep the good conversations keep our conversations civil because because life matters every human being can can give us their time treasure and talents and make our communities a much better place and so Shawna thanks for the call all right everyone we have time for just one more question we have Andy from Brainerd up next and he has a question on health care Andy you are gonna live on the ball hi thanks for your time real quick I started a small business when I was 20 years old and it was affordable to to do it because of expenses and whatever else now at this point after 20 years and I'm obviously self-employed my I don't have any employees but every day that I get up because when you're a self-employed person you you count the pennies or you see where you're at financially with everything for health for my health care plus medication and my deductibles it costs me forty three dollars and 28 cents every single day that I get up and go to work for the year before anything is paid out of pocket but at that point I mean it's close to $16,000 that I'm paying out and when when a guy gets up and leaves to go to work in the morning and you think you got to make that $43 to even break even for the day to me it's just I've gotten to the point where you just want to throw your hands up in the air and say I'm I'm done I'll go work for somebody and also I feel that it's enabling people let's say an electrician that works for a guy that has a wife and four kids he's probably way better than his boss but he can't afford to start on his own because of the health care and what it's going to cost him to support his family how do you feel about that and what's it going to take I I the $43 is too much for me every single day if you go to church on Sunday and give $20 you're in for 63 dollars that day right now Andy that is a first of all thanks for the question and you and I have a lot in common that we were small business owners I'm still a small business owner you you you wanted the American Dream the entrepreneur spirit that you put forward you invested your capital in whatever business business it was just like me and small businesses Andy are the engine of our economy so I would encourage you to to read to keep keep keep the faith in that week that we in DC can do things right that we want to make sure that our health care is assessed we can access it that it's affordable and it's up quality and you know we talk about you talk about you know the price for prescription drugs and we talked about that earlier we had we had a bill that was very transparent that was bipartisan but this leadership speaker Pelosi just wouldn't let it go without putting some what we call poison pills in it and it's very frustrating and you know the the I was a co-sponsor and I'm a co-sponsor the pre-existing conditions Protection Act which continues covers for those with pre-existing conditions I campaign on it and I'm living my campaign promise by voting for actions such as that and you know this is it for me it's I want to make sure that our constituents know that that you know I'm working the I'm working at making sure that our our health care is affordable and you know we talk about associated health plans for small businesses I mean that's important that we were able to pool some of our resources we also have to have competition in our health care you know and any other entity when there's competition is good for the consumer and so when we put competition in the private Marcus it's very good for the consumer and so our goal is you know my whole you know the whole philosophy is uh you know I want I want to make sure that that we improve our healthcare and I want to be able to say that that it's not necessary easy but I'm pushing to make sure that that you Andy in your family and make the call on what you need for health care not the politicians or the bureaucrats in Washington and I think that it when you when you start peel peeling the layers of the onions I think you said I think we can come down to a very good set of consensus that that don't bring here like is it'll bring a red playbook or being playable candy bring a playbook that helped Main Street Main Street Minnesotan just like you and I and I think it's important that I mean for you to say that's forty three dollars at twenty eight cents a day is just a startup let me come on we we I know we can do better and I think it's important that that I'm working across the aisle I want to get the let's bring the best practices that that have that have that have that are competitive in the private market let that drive and bring the cost down and and make sure that our drug prices are transparent we can bring generics in sooner and that we have we have the ability to have the conversation and I'm I can tell you that this is this is extremely important and my goal is to try and make sure that we get some legislation that promotes the ability to have our health care affordable assessable and up quality very very soon but sometimes a when when you get into this when you get into this town unfortunately there's they play politics as a winner and loser that's what I'm say the frustrating things for me and II I don't know and I don't care what your political leanings are you ought to be able to afford your health insurance for you and your family and be a an entrepreneur and a small business owner without having to deal with the excess cost and I know we can do it and I'm bringing some of those that conversation I'm bringing that conversation too to the meetings and the discussions I have right here in this town so the whole goal is to is to change the way we're doing things make sure that that we collectively bring out the best practices forward to reduce cost across the board so Andy thank you for your call and I want to apologize to all the other folks that we didn't get to speak with but if you have if you still want us to call or talk to me you can call the office at 2:00 and eight for eight one six three nine six and I'll try to get back to you as soon as practical and I really appreciate this opportunity to spend some time with you this evening and and just kind of share my thoughts and visions of where we're going and I want to stress with you that constituent services is the absolute number one priority the Minnesota eighth the district citizens are the priority and you will continue to be the priority thank you so much for allowing me to serve you in this capacity and I want you all to have a good night

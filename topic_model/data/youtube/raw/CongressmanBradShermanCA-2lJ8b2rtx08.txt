turn out to brad Sherman a democratic congressman from California he sits on the House Foreign Affairs Committee good to see a congressman I want to quickly start right away with your top line reaction to what you just heard from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and what he said about what secretary Kerry said earlier today well I don't think that this is unprecedented either the resolution or the comments keep in mind during the Eisenhower administration is a the Eisenhower took the pro Egyptian position in the Sinai war this is the Obama administration has just approved a ten-year plan that provides more aid to the Israeli military than any other president has come close to so this is a particular aspect of the relationship but unfortunately i think is being overplayed the fact is that many administration's virtually every administration has allowed an anti-israel resolution to pass through the UN Security and this resolution is hardly unprecedented it simply repeats things that America has allowed to be adopted by the UN Security Council many decades ago so for I think it's a it's it's unfortunate particularly when israel's foreign policy depends upon the support of both the Democratic and the Republican Party and I think there are Republican operatives who see a short-term political objective in driving a wedge between Democrats in Israel I think that's bad for Israel I think it's bad for America again something that's not unprecedented as you say secretary Kerry spent much of his speech today condemning the Israeli government on settlements let's listen to some of that policies of this government which the Prime Minister himself just described as more committed to settlements than any in Israel's history are leading in the opposite direction they're leading towards one state if the choice is one state Israel can either be Jewish or democratic it cannot be both so he doesn't come out and say it quite directly there but he lets anybody just about anyone in for a line between Israel's pro settlement policies and what he actually suggested could be the rise of an undemocratic state what's your response to that I think Israel remains dedicated to two-state solution there's talk about how many Jewish settlers there are most of them are in areas that you would expect to be part of Israel in a two-state solution and also Israel has demonstrated both in the Sinai settlement and in Gaza a capacity to remove those settlements that are harmful to a peace process and in fact the laÂ·cu diamond Netanyahu's party has been at the forefront of removing any settlement that is called to be for to be removed as part of a peace process so there are these settlements going forward there was a settlement freeze that was not used by the Palestinians to reach a deal and finally what I think what's most missing is just how outrageous the Palestinian negotiation position is first Hamas calls for the death or removal of every Jew in the Middle East but the Fatah the the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank this calls for the same thing only to describe it as a quote right of return but their real position is there should be no Jewish state ten millions or even tens of millions of Arabs should be free to move to Israel and then force the removal of all Jews from the Middle East so I think there's a tendency to look at the individual thing that the Israel does here are there that we might disagree with and not to really understand the

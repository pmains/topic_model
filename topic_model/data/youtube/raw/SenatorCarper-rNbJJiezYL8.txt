as everyone works to prepare our homes in our kitchens for Thanksgiving it can be easy to overlook the true meaning of this holiday and to me Thanksgivings always been about tradition and about giving thanks and the vision that I cherish most is simply spending time with my wife Martha our boys Christopher and Ben and we have great day together one tradition that never changes for us is a annual trip at least for me is an annual trip to Emmanuel dining room sometimes I'll drag somebody with me in wilmington it's a sort of soup kitchen where we help serve as some of our neighbors who don't have a big Thanksgiving meal waiting for the ideal with former congressman former governor mike castle and his wife a lot of other people too well many of us are privileged to do in Thanksgiving with a big dinner thousands of Delaware and so can I and that's why each year I love to have just a small part in the providing a tremendous turkey dinner and this case of lunch with all the fixings to some of our hungry neighbors Thanksgiving is also about more than just a meal oh it's about reflecting on our lives for being thankful for what we have and what we're lucky to have in searching for ways to ensure that our friends our family our neighbors have more to be thankful because of our lives the way we live them for me it was time it is a time to remember one of most important questions ever asked from the words in the scripture am I my brother's keeper and I think the answer is yes the this year I've been thinking a lot about another part of the scripture in Matthew 25 and goes something like this Pope reminded this Pope Francis reminder this when he was in America is what I was hungry I did you feed me when I was thirsty to give me to drink when I was a stranger did you invite me in when I was naked did you clothed me when I was sick did you visit me when I was in prison did you come to me and more than ever I think we must remain committed to showing generosity and kindness to our loved ones and neighbors here in Delaware and all around the the world and when we do that that knowledge we make other people happier in their lives but it brings great joy to us because in the joy of others we find their own every day I see the spirit of giving is alive and well in the first state and I'm confident that this holiday season will help to bring us even closer together that would my prayer I hope you and now your loved ones have a joyous thanksgiving god bless you all thank you for giving me the privilege of serving you

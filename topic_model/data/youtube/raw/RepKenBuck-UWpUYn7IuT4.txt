I think the chair for yielding and I appreciate the ranking members reference to the term honesty um the title of this amendment is the threat of a nationwide abortion ban and I'm trying to figure out as I look across the aisle is a nation is a is a abortion ban in place in Pennsylvania I don't believe abortion ban is in place uh in Pennsylvania I'm certainly sure it's not in place uh in California um or Rhode Island I don't think anybody on the other or New York I don't think anybody on the other side of the aisle believes that there is a threat of a nationwide abortion ban there is right now a decision from the Supreme Court and law that that holds that the issue of abortion should be taken up state by state as the ranking member uh mentioned the every state has legalized abortion some states unbelievably and and my state is one of them and I'm thoroughly embarrassed that my state is one of them has abortion up until the time of birth now let's just make sure we understand something because we use terms like late term abortion and it's and it's so polite and it's and it's you know you could go to a cocktail party and you could talk about late term abortion and not really offend anybody you're talking about ripping the arms off of a unborn baby and then the legs and then the head a beating heart a central nervous system that is fully functional and all of you sit on that side and suggest that we are in favor of a ban on abortion I'll tell you something the American people aren't in favor of they aren't in favor of ripping the arms off of a baby and the legs and the head and pulling that baby out as if it was some group of cells that baby is a living human being it just happens to be inside of its mother at the time that's disgusting that's not what America stands for and I'll tell you I absolutely am in favor of a threat on late term abortion but this language is misleading it's incorrect and it just is absolutely false that we believe that in this country there is a threat of uh abortion on demand and I there's a gentleman from um a yield to the gentleman from Texas

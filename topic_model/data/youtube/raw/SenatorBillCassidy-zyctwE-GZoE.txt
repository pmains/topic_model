today senator from Louisiana Madam president the national flood insurance program risk rating 2.0 has officially been in effect for almost a year families in Louisiana are feeling the unfolding disaster now we're not talking about a storm or a flood which the national flood insurance program is supposed to protect against we're talking about the financial crisis unfolding at kitchen tables families cannot afford the premium hikes that the nfip is planning with risk rating 2.0 and for some the premiums have become unaffordable and threatened the collapse of the value of their home for now rate hikes are capped at 18 per year but these compound a year after year so for the couple who've lived in their house for decades they're not thinking okay it's only 18 no they're thinking it's 18 compounded upon 18 and they don't have a plan to move well let's escape from it this is where they've been for decades and 18 percent compounds and adds up very quickly now this is not fiction these are real stories that I hear from folks in Louisiana great Americans great louisianans love our country and they're wondering what in the heck is going on an example the Bourgeois family an elderly couple in Raceland both turned 83 last year they have owned their home for 56 years it's never been in a flood zone it has never flooded before risk rating 2.0 they paid 500 a year in flood insurance premiums after risk rating 2.0 they are scheduled to pay when fully in effect scheduled to pay 500 dollars per month 500 a year to five hundred dollars per month now their full risk premium will reach 60 almost 6 300 in 14 years but their annual payment will double in the fourth year so how many 83 year old retired couples do you know that can afford an extra fifty eight hundred dollars in expenses just like that the holiday season just passed I'm sure the Bourgeois family we have big families in south Louisiana they have their children grandchildren nieces and nephews but I'm sure there is extra budgeting this year families should not have to spend holidays budgeting for this kind of increase in flood insurance premium when they've never flooded that's the crazy thing about it they've never flooded and these are the premium increases that they're seeing now families across Louisiana and America's Coastal communities not just in Louisiana are finding themselves in the similar situation to the Bourgeois now by the way Louisiana has been hard hit by hurricanes over the last few years I had a Delta Zelda Laura folks in my state are still recovering and they are responsible in maintaining their insurance but with risk rating 2.0 it feels like the Biden Administration is kicking them when they're trying to get back on their feet so it begs the question why is the administration allowing risk rating 2.0 to take effect Congress never required FEMA to implement this President Biden can stop with a stroke of a pin he has the power he should have asked FEMA to delay or cancel the implementation of risk rating 2.0 or to reconsider it altogether throughout the process though FEMA has not only been slow to share information with policyholders they've stonewalled members of congress not being upfront about the cost of policyholders homeowners did not get significant information from FEMA until less than a month before risk rating 2.0 began to be implemented and now Many Louisiana policy owners are getting notices in the mail of their new risk premium folks in my state they feel blindsided the Bourgeois family was blindsided when they got a notice that their full premium will go from 500 a year to six thousand two hundred and ninety five um we're here to serve the American people and in case again folks think no this is not true they can look at this property four-point Drive Raceland Louisiana they can see that it is never flooded they can see that this is a single family a main dwelling and they can see that it's a modest home it's not a big mansion the Bourgeois are not Millionaires and then they can see the premium that they have to pay um they can see that there's no discounts being applied and that their premium eventually grows to that full risk premium now it's not just this family with this I have a dozen more Insurance bills from constituents showing massive premium hikes through no fault of their own they're penalized just for living where families where their families have lived for Generations um with risk rating 2.0 FEMA has put them into an apost impossible situation now by the way families are now choosing to drop out of the program because they can't afford the premium the pool of homeowners is becoming smaller leaving those subject to how the mandatory requirement to buy insurance worse off they face the diff those who are required to own are now faced with a difficult task of of come coming up with thousands more to pay their insurance or to lose their mortgage FEMA knows this is going to happen they know that up to 20 to 25 percent of those policyholders will drop their policies because they cannot afford them and that has the potential to put this into what is called an Actuarial death spiral where the risk is placed upon fewer and fewer therefore premiums go up even greater and greater therefore more and more have to drop if the intent to destroy the program did not help Americans in times of flooding this policy could not be done more effectively there has to be another option Congress has taken steps to avoid major flooding in the future Louisiana has already received over 680 million dollars for Coastal restoration flood and Waterway projects from the infrastructure investment and jobs act it's already delivering on its promises when I was helping to negotiate the bill I had those Louisiana families in mind what can we do to lower the risk of flooding which by the way then helps all those helps everyone else in our country to help make this flood insurance program more affordable and sustainable now the second half of helping these families is ensuring that they're not forced to move because of unaffordable flood insurance premiums flood insurance must always remain affordable and accessible for the homeowner accountable to the taxpayer and sustainable for the future only President Biden has the power to change that now which she has a responsibility to do with that I yield back

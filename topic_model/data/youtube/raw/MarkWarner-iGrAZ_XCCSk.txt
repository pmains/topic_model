all right let's now bring in the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee Democrat Mark Warner of Virginia Mike Barnicle Jon Meacham and mark McKinnon are back with us as well along with Willie and me so senator first of all just continuing the conversation do you expect that you will vote for the confirmation of bill Barr I've already thought said that I thought it was appropriate for mr. Bartel withdraw listen he's got a great reputation he's got experience but we've let's look at the facts we've got a president who's obsessed about the Moller investigation he's tried to do everything possible to undermine it he put in this acting guy mr. Whittaker whose only qualification is that he was against the Muller investigation and I think mr. Barra unfortunately in a sense disqualified himself when he sent these unsolicited memos that seemed to me a most unseemly saying hey look at me he I'm against the Moller investigation I think you the president has has extensive executive powers and I think with this kind of cloud over Trump's view of Muller we don't need an attorney general that is going to be at all compromised

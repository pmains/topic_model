ah thank you thank you mike uh i appreciate you and brian allowing us to hold this very important gathering here today i love the motto of frontier justice faith family and freedom and those are the traits that made america great america great and they're the traits that we believe here in the heartland and they're what we have to fight and defend in washington so thank you [Applause] faith is what inspired this nation and it underpins its greatness the psalmist said blessed is the nation whose god is the lord and as americans we have been blessed because we declare that we are one nation under god this must continue to be our rallying cry and this must be what we stand for our nation is at crisis the socialist democrats are endangering our security bankrupting our nation killing our jobs fueling inflation harming our children defunding our police and rewriting our history they are destroying the country you and i love and they must be stopped our security our freedom and our future are at stake over this past year we have seen how quickly our freedoms can come under attack we have witnessed big governments censor our speech deny us the freedom to assemble and squelch our freedom of religion government bureaucrats have told us when and how we can go to work how many people can meet in our home and what we can have to wear on our face they have ignored science and relegated our children to learning alone on the couch rather than in the classroom harming our kids educational progress endangering their mental health and hurting family budgets a million and a half moms have been forced to quit their jobs to stay home during normal school hours due to the misguided coveted federal public mandates and now they tell us that they may even can't go back to school next fall well it's time to get our kids back to school and our parents back to work [Applause] out of touch liberals turn a blind eye to the riots in their neighborhoods yet have the audacity to propose taking our guns and endangering law-abiding citizens well let me be clear to the socialist democrats here in the heartland we will never relinquish our guns or our rights [Applause] freedom is a cherished gift passed on to us that allows us to pursue our dreams and live our lives free from government interference it's been earned by generations of proud americans who have sacrificed served and secured the freedoms we now enjoy as a daughter of an army reservist and a senior member of the house armed services committee i believe there's no higher priority for those elected to federal office than to provide for the common defense i have led efforts in congress to ensure our men and women in uniform have the equipment and the weapons they need under president obama our military was cut degrading our readiness and bolding our enemies i fought successfully to restore those budgets and rebuild our military now president biden has proposed a budget that cuts our military again while destroying the morale of our troops here at home by forcing woke training undermining unit cohesion and pride in the nation they serve ladies and gentlemen our military's mission is to keep our nation safe not to be used as political pawns they defended us we must defend them [Applause] our freedom and security also endangered at our southern border i just recently returned from el paso where i met with border patrol agents observing firsthand the emergency intake center for illegal migrant children and traveled to the border to see the gaps in the walls and the piles of fencing sitting unused and rusting following president biden's order to stop building the wall border agents shared horrific stories of abuse of children being trafficked by cartels across dangerous territory as a direct result of biden's open invitation to come drug cartels are enriching themselves not only due to the millions of dollars they're making a day extorting money from the migrants but also from the flood of drugs that they are smuggling across our border the border patrol tells me they've recovered record numbers amounts of drugs including over three tons of fentanyl massive amounts of opioids and unfettered delivery of meth which ends up in our communities and kills our kids this is not a compassionate policy this is a cruel policy that must be changed for the good of our communities and the good of individuals who want to come to america legally we need to go back to the trump policy that was working and secure our border [Applause] we are also experiencing attacks on our economic security president biden's attack on american fossil fuels has destroyed millions of americans jobs raised gas prices and is putting energy independence we want under president trump at risk inflation is rising at levels we haven't seen in decades increasing the cost of goods and services across the country hurting hard working families the socialist democrat policies are destroying the country we love and they must be stopped we must defend this nation against both foreign and domestic threats we must stand strong for what is right we must not give up or back down and we in missouri must lead the charge and that's why today i'm announcing i'm running for the u.s senate to protect our freedoms and preserve our greatness [Applause] missouri will be key in 2022 elections and our ideals are desperately needed as missourians we embody the values that made this country great we embrace hard work love of country stand by our families help our neighbors hunt on weekends go to church on sundays and we just want the government to leave us alone we are the voices of economic security we are for border security for national security for personal security to us the second amendment isn't a right it's our way of life [Music] at a time when cities are burning and rioters are taking over our streets setting up autonomous zones we believe we need to defend law enforcement not defund them we know more bureaucracy means less opportunity we know senseless government regulations and higher taxes destroy jobs for working families and puts our financial security at risk we know we cannot cut our military we must stand for israel our greatest ally in the middle east [Applause] we know peace comes through strength and we must continue to rebuild the military remain the strongest force for good in the world we know we're right to oppose the socialist democrats efforts to cancel us and cancel our culture they push equity over equality seek to pack the courts and plan to force taxpayers to pay for politicians campaigns with federal government funds the extreme socialist left is taking our country in the wrong direction and it's up to us to get our country back on the right direction [Applause] we know it can be done we've seen it under president trump record low unemployment stable inflation energy independence the border was protected jobs were being brought back to america we rebuilt our military lower taxes allowed missourians to keep more of their hard-earned money the future was filled with promise of greater freedom opportunity achievement it can be done again and it will be with your help [Applause] i was a front line fighter for this economic resurgence and the only candidate in the race who has worked with president trump to make this a reality in fact i'm one of only two members of congress from missouri to have voted for and supported the efforts of president trump over 95 percent of the time [Applause] those of you who know me know i listen i care and i fight and with you we have gotten results when the federal government ordered the destruction of 1200 homes at the lake of the ozarks just a couple of years into me being in congress i led efforts to stop them and after a relentless fight the feds backed down and the homes of over a thousand missouri families were saved [Applause] after record rainfall and flooding my district and the disastrous failure of the federal emergency management agency to provide timely assistance to missourians my bill was signed into law by president trump to reform the way that agency responds to disasters and as a result people families all across america now receive timely assistance in their time of need when a retired police officer attended his granddaughter's music program in one of our schools in rural missouri he realized it would take 45 minutes for law enforcement to get there if something happened and then there was an emergency so he wanted to offer his services as a retired police officer to be able to protect those kids and to be there but due to federal law he could not and so i introduced and the house passed my bill the police officers protecting children act and when approved by local authorities are retired and our off-duty police officers can protect our kids after starting a missouri drug-free initiative in my district to address the drug crisis that is devastating our families and traveling to the southern border where i learned that drug cartels were using drones to smuggle drugs across our border and our border patrol agents didn't have the authority to take down those drones due to outdated federal laws i introduced and passed legislation giving them the authority to stop the flow of drugs across our border [Applause] when two of america's most trusted weapons to defend our freedoms were threatened with cuts i led the fight supporting the military's investment of the f-15 and f-18 fighter jets now our war fighters have the most modern equipment and since they're built in st louis we created thousands of high skill high paying jobs right here in missouri after visiting with people in our area i took action to address the need for more ba rural broadband because there's a problem without real broadband our children's education is being impacted seniors are being denied access to telehealth job creation is being stifled in our rural communities i passed legislation expanding access to rural broadband ensuring internet speeds will be adequate not just for now but into the future when coveted yes when kova has shut down our meat packing plants farmers were faced with euthanizing their herds i worked with federal agencies and the packing plants to safely reopen to save workers jobs save farmers livelihoods and save consumers money at the grocery store when trinity lutheran church in colombia was discriminated against i let an amicus brief before the u.s supreme court on their behalf the court upheld the constitution and provided a huge victory for religious freedom that has impacted other cases all across our nation we must stand for our first amendment rights [Applause] after a missouri soldier in our district was tragically killed in afghanistan and his mother was denied the full benefits due to a paperwork error i wrote and passed a law ensuring every gold star family receives full benefits they deserve it and we need to stand with them and behind them believing that all life is valuable and knowing that life begins at conception i am leading efforts in congress to defund planned parenthood americas they are america's number one killer of the unborn and they don't deserve a dime of our tax dollars [Music] as a member of the senior member of the armed services committee and long before the pandemic i co-led legislation to bring medicine production back to america and pass legislation stopping the sale of chinese video surveillance equipment to the u.s government in fact i am the only candidate in this race who's been sanctioned by the chinese communist party and i am proud of it [Applause] they sanctioned me after i exposed their horrific human rights abuse against the uyghur muslims and about and against christians i'm a member of the congressional executive commission on china we produce a report every year on their human rights abuses and i will not stop speaking up for those who cannot speak for themselves [Applause] missourians deserve more than rhetoric they deserve results and working for and with the good people of our district i've delivered in the u.s house and that's what i will do in the senate [Applause] my dedication to god country and family is rooted in my strong missouri roots and from those who have gone before me my grandparents

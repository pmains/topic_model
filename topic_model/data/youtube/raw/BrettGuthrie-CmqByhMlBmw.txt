Speaker I rise today in opposition of HR 3 two issues that I often hear about back home are robo calls and drug prices last week despite ideological differences on both sides of the aisle we came together to address robo calls I am disappointed that the same cannot be said for drug prices Republicans Democrats President Trump doctors pharmacists patients we all want lower drug prices and yet the Democrats have chosen to pursue partisan poison pill legislation that will go nowhere I was proud to co-sponsor the lower cost more cures Act a bill that includes only bipartisan solutions to lower drug prices done my Democratic colleagues have agreed to these provisions in the past the lower cost more cures Act will allow the continuation of life-saving innovation in health care research who are lower drug prices for Kentuckians oppose HR 3 and I urge my colleagues to support the lower cures lower cost more cures Act and I yield back

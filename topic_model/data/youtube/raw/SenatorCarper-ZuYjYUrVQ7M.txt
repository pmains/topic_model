let's hear from the democrats now delaware senator tom carper is a member of the senate finance committee no shoe throwing underway there certainly senator we are hearing that senator conrad is talking about the possibility of four trillion dollars in deficit reduction over the next 10 years do you know anything about how that is achieved well you may recall a year or so ago the president appointed a deficit commission co-chaired by erskine bowles and by former senator alan simpson that commission 11 out of the 18 commission members recommended a path forward on deficit reduction that added up to roughly 4 trillion dollars over 10 years roughly two-thirds of it on the spending side or third on the revenue side they did not call for raising tax rates they did call for broadening the the tax base and eliminating a number of so-called tax expenditures so it turns out we have about 15 trillion dollars worth of tax expenditures tax breaks uh tax credits all kinds of things that add up to 15 trillion dollars over the next 10 years and if we could find maybe 10 of those to reduce we could have a pretty good deficit reduction deal that did four four and a half trillion dollars two thirds on the spending side and a third on the revenue side without actually raising the rates what about waste it's my understanding you're an advocate of reducing waste in the federal budget how much could you squeeze a lot of people are fearful on the medicare and medicaid side folks democrats independence and some republicans are concerned about savaging medicare and medicaid to actually look at medicare and medicaid there's uh something that the general accountability accountability office tells us gao tells us there's some uh we call them uh improper payments uh improper payments last year for medicare we're 50 billion dollars the attorney general eric holder tells us that last year fraud in medicare was 60 billion dollars we just cut half of those cut cut those in half and do that over 10 years we'll be talking about deficit reduction in medicare alone of over 500 billion dollars without the reducing benefits but just going after some of the interface suspension inefficient spending wasteful spending we spoke last hour with karl rove who says that the president really needs to get out in front and lead on this issue in one of his opinion pieces he said that this could be a nixon goes to china moment if the president would would lead and come up with uh some some big deficit reduction numbers here do you see that happening well i'm encouraged that the president has decided to be as we say around here at the adult in the room this could be a nixon ghost to china this could be clinton does does welfare reform uh i think the best jobs bill that we could pass that i can think of right now would be to to pass a comprehensive balanced depth reduction plan four trillion dollars or more mostly on the spending side but some on the revenue side i think that would send a strong signal to the business community and frankly the rest of the world that we're able to govern we're still able to work together to reach across the party lines to reach common sense solutions we need that i think a lot of good would flow and what did rutherford be hayes used to say good policy makes good politics i think there's actually political gain for both parties if we're actually able to demonstrate and come up with something that's fair balanced and reasonable and stimulates economic growth what about just simplifying the tax code so many people would welcome that well part of this deficit commission's recommendation was to eliminate and reduce the very large tax expenditures that we have that's part of what makes the code so complex and there's uh i forget how many tens of thousands of pages are in the code today but a lot of that relates to these tax expenditures tax breaks and tax credits tax deductions some of which are good and we just don't want to tamper with some probably uh not as much value and i think we can do some of that broaden the base keep the rates either where they are actually bring them down a little bit especially on the corporate side and eliminate some of the the tax expenditures that frankly don't amount to as much senator tom carper is a democrat from delaware senator thank you yeah thank you so much take care

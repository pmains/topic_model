i just unveiled a remarkable piece of legislation on monday called the state's reform act which takes a bipartisan approach to cannabis reform across the country and is getting accolades from everyone from you know conservative and republican groups to places like center left normal has endorsed this bill and so um the the times that we see our country and today the divisiveness both within both parties and against republicans and democrats alike i'm trying to show leadership in very difficult times because i'm a single mom i got to go back home to my kids every night and explain why we're doing what we're doing today and i have to do a better job all of us have to to set a better example for our kids and our country moving forward if we're going to get through the crisis of covid and through the divisiveness and the violence we've seen over the last two years

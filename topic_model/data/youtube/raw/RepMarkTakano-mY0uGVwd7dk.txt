I'm congressman mark Takano from Riverside California and i stand with women and support their access to reproductive health services a woman's right to choose is protected by the Constitution and was upheld by the Supreme Court more than 40 years ago in recent years Republicans implemented laws that impose mandatory ultrasounds and waiting periods which restricted abortion access for women across the country these types of laws harm women and families closing clinics and states like Texas will not end the need for abortion and reproductive health services it will only force women to resort to methods that are unproven and unsafe we need to trust that women know how to make their own health decisions and stand up against interference from politicians who presume to know better it is time for the Supreme Court to reaffirm our nation's commitment to women's basic dignity

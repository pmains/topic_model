Capitol Hill some lawmakers are still fighting now to keep the spotlight on stopping the spread of HIV and chief among them California congresswoman barbara Lee who is joining me live now from Washington congresswoman thank you very much for joining us here mark boys are glad to be with you so you have co-author basically every single big piece of AIDS legislation since you got into Congress but there's this UN aids report out last year that says the world has basically five years to start getting a handle on how to stop the spread or else risk it rebounding completely out of control in your view is funding be and where does this money need to go to try to make some progress here moving forward absolutely what also we learned is that we can achieve an aids-free generation by 2030 but the next five years are critical and so we must ramp up our efforts and increase our funding we've been able over the last eight to ten years hold the line on funding for PEPFAR which was an initiative that basically the Congressional Black Caucus myself led the efforts on and president bush signed into law also we've been able to maintain the level of funding for the Global Fund the global aids of tuberculosis Relief Act which President Clinton signed into law we've held the line on funding for that also with the Ryan White Care Act and the minority aids initiative which it was sponsored and led by congresswoman Maxine Waters but i have to tell you this has been a bipartisan effort and we have to increase funding for prevention care and treatment otherwise as the report said we will go backwards but i think this is a testament to how we can work in a bipartisan way leader Pelosi you know congresswoman Ileana Ross Layton the late henry hyde the late tom lantos a senator bill frist the senator then senator Kerry many Republicans and Democrats stepped up and really said we're going to do this and we're going to lead on this country in the world lead our country in the world to try to stamp HIV and AIDS off the face of the earth in concert when you talked about that push for funding right but you look at 30 years ago AIDS was getting a ton of attention it was on headlines you know and headlines all the time now it's more rarely mentioned except for on days like today world aids day partly because the spread has slowed but do you think that makes it harder to push for more funding to push for more resources for prevention research the media quite frankly hasn't been covering the pandemic still but we have to educate the public more and hopefully and I'm really pleased to be able to talk with you today because we need to really understand that we've accomplished a lot 9.7 million people are on life-saving treatment the antiretroviral drugs we've saved 37 million lives the president before he even took office in 2008 on World AIDS Day 2088 boldly announced an emergency plan a national strategy and so we've moved forward in big ways and so yes it has been covered in the past on the front page through social media through media outlets but other priorities have taken place so i hope thats a day people will understand what we have to do as a country and that is the step up increase the resources because this is a matter of life and death it's about the quality of life for people it's about getting rid of the stigma you know in our country we have 30 states that still have discrimination laws on the books that discriminate against people who live with the virus so we have a lot of work to do but I'm very proud of the bipartisan effort that has been achieved and I hope that we maintain that not only in terms of our focus but also in terms of the funding congresswoman barbara Lee joining us here on world aids day thank you very much

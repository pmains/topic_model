thank you very much thank you Mr chair Senator cotton Mr rockelman do we have a violent crime crisis in America today I'm sorry Senator we have a violent crime crisis in America today Senator I would leave that up to policymakers to decide okay I would say we do since murders have increased so much in the last few years they're now up to levels not seen since the 1990s in part because of left-wing pro-criminal policies like the ones you advocated for in your 2007 article on the Baylor law review where you argued it was unconstitutional for law enforcement to log DNA samples from convicted criminals I know you discussed this a few minutes ago with Senator Grassley I was watching I was astonished what I saw uh you claim that you were only talking about one exception to the Fourth Amendment and not the fourth amendment in general that is not true here's what you said Senator Grassley this is what just moments ago in the law review article that I believe you're referring to I was only discussing one exception to Fourth Amendment Doctrine called the special needs exception I was not talking about Fourth Amendment law in general you just said the same thing to Senator Blackburn as well twice now you've claimed you're only talking about the special needs exception but here's your own words in the Baylor larvae article the question remains whether the court will uphold the DNA testing statutes under a theory other than the special needs exception current precedent does not support the DNA testing statutes under any Fourth Amendment Theory however given that every Federal appellate court that is considered the statutes has found them constitutional it is more likely than not the Supreme Court will do the same this article predicts that should the court uphold the DNA testing schemes it will rely on its line of cases establishing a diminished expectation of privacy for prisoners and those on probation or supervised release under this standard the court should refuse to uphold the statutes as applied to arrestees as opposed to convicted felons the court should not uphold the DNA testing statutes under any Fourth Amendment Theory so what you said earlier Senator Grassley I don't think was a nuanced difference on the understanding of the law you said that you were not talking about anything in the article other than the special needs exception but your article tells clearly a different story would you like to revise your answer earlier Senator I apologize if I forgot the end of the article I wrote it I think about 15 years ago my memory of the article was that it focused and I think it's title focused on the special needs exception to the Fourth Amendment which is an issue that I had litigated a few years earlier and therefore my memory of it is at the bulk of it discusses that narrow exception to the Fourth Amendment which is supposed to be invoked under Supreme Court precedent only in situations when the evidence isn't gathered for law enforcement purposes Miss rockelman you're nominated for a lifetime position on a court one step below the Supreme Court did you not review your own writings in preparation for this testimony uh Senator I did look at that article briefly again I wrote it 15 years ago and my memory of it including its title is that it really focused on the special needs exception again I just want to be clear to the committee that I will Faithfully follow all Supreme Court precedent whether it's on the fourth amendment or any other part of our law I know you wrote it 15 years ago but you said you looked at it albeit briefly I mean again this is a lifetime position on a court one step below the Supreme Court I mean I think we have a reason to expect you take more care than to review your own record briefly when litigants come before you are going to are you going to read their papers briefly or carefully I will read them extremely carefully and carefully look up all of the relevant precedent and the record that is in the case let me get to the substance of this argument itself um do you know what percent of convicted criminals are re-arrested in the United States I do not Senator it's almost all of them 83 percent are rearrested within the first nine years after they've been released from prison do you still think it should be illegal to check a convicted rapist's DNA to see if he's I don't know raped another woman or committed a murder Senator I think the Supreme Court has resolved the issue and I will Faithfully follow the Supreme Court's precedent in any criminal case that may come before me and I understand maintain the same personal view that you wrote about in the 2007 Baylor larva article that you misrepresented here today that we should not take DNA samples of convicted murderers and rapists to see if we can close out other cases or to use investigations in the future when they almost certainly commit other heinous crimes senator in that article I was merely discussing uh Supreme Court precedent and how it should be applied that's the only question that I was looking at there it was not meant to be a discussion of policy which I leave to uh folks in your position and again I will Faithfully apply all Supreme Court precedent whether it's on the fourth amendment or any other area of law well the folks in my position at least on the other side aren't doing a very good job of that and that's one reason why we have a crime wave across this country

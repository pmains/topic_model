and new jersey lawmakers and governor christie joined up at newark penn station for a call to action this week they're asking the federal government to honor the commitment of the previous administration to fund half of the gateway tunnel project it would build a new tunnel and revamp the existing tunnels to put an end to the commuter headaches that we've seen this month senator cory booker was adamant about the importance of the project continuing is the federal government going to meet its obligations to make sure that we don't have continued crisis in this region now the officials say that they sent a letter to transportation secretary elaine cho asking her to visit penn station and see for herself the condition of the rails protesters at the event blamed governor christie for shutting down the ark tunnel project which would be nearing completion if it had gone the way it was supposed to governor christie defending his decision though to discontinue the project to build a rail tunnel connecting new jersey and new york he brought up the tunnel project in recent transit issues during his monthly talk show with new jersey 101.5 and also took a shot at the media we don't own or maintain the tracks we don't own or maintain the infrastructure we rent it from them the press in this state isn't happy unless they're bitchin tell us what you really think all right some are wondering how much poll the governor has with president trump to make sure the funding stays in place now one new jersey congressman who joined governor christie and senator booker this week to stress how vital it is for the gateway program to move forward he's joining us right now congressman donald payne jr welcome back to the show it's good to see you good to see you as well thank you all right so uh let's get to it senator booker said that he was quote beyond the point of frustration here uh with the situation he made it sound very dire how worried are you that the trump administration follow through on the cuts well we're very concerned about it as the senator stated we're hoping that governor christie who really scuttled this project with the ark and i'm not sure if it would be done by now but we'd be well into it but we're glad to see that he's finally seen the light and the need for this we're hoping that with his influence with the president and our advocacy for the project that we can get it put placed back in the budget we believe or i feel that the president should understand how important this would be to uh new york since he's a new yorker and understand what it would mean to the economy in this in this region not just in terms of the construction but in terms of all the ancillary benefits that would go with the construction correct absolutely you know my my district takes in a lot of constituents that use new jersey rail as their lifeline and have really moved to this area because of the proximity of new jersey transit to where they live in and then being able to get into new york and so uh you know i was in a community of glen ridge last week and it really was the only thing they really was the pressing issue was the delays and the issues around new jersey transit we've seen numerous track problems derailments over recent weeks do you feel as though we have reached crisis stage here uh do you worry that even if this project does go forward that we're just going to keep seeing more and more problems like this and it's going to continue to completely snarl traffic and commuting in the region absolutely we've seen three issues in the last four weeks i was on the platform newark penn station waiting to go to washington three weeks ago when the initial issue of derailment happened in new york ran into another member of congress that had been there on the platform for an hour so we've we've seen it firsthand then subsequently you know we had the other issues at the delays at penn station and just this past friday eric there was another problem with delays going in to know so it is a crisis if if in the last four weeks we've had three major issues on that rail line we are in a crisis uh you and some of the officials who you were with over at newark penn station you were calling for the transportation secretary to come and to see the rails for herself do you think that'll make a difference do you think she'll do it we're hoping that she does and um absolutely would make a difference you know just as i stated i was on the platform when these issues were happening so i understand it firsthand so we feel that bringing secretary cho here will help us a great deal in having her understand how important and vital these federal dollars would be to correct the issues that have been there for years because federal government has really never stepped up and given amtrak the money that it should get since 1970 when they took over the entire rail line of the northeast corridor so we think her coming here and seeing the issues new jersey transit has i mean we've lost we've lost lives this this year in february a young woman died in the hoboken incident so it it's critical it's important and we feel bringing her here will she will give her the idea of why we are so adamant about continuing this project all right so changing tracks as it were right now uh next week is going to be what's to be what could be another very contentious one on capitol hill uh the gop plan to repeal and replace obamacare we we know what happened with the last version of that there's talk that a new version uh not sure how it's going to be different from the old one but the new version could be on the hill for debating for possibly a vote this coming week um speaker ryan is under a lot of pressure to get this done and through congress what are you anticipating seeing well i i've been hearing the same thing and you know as you know over the past several weeks members of congress been back in their district on recess and doing work in the district i've heard about their proposals uh we believe it's it's even worse than the one that they they they finally did not propose uh this new one will deal with taking out one of the most popular provisions of the affordable care act is people with pre-existing conditions not being penalized anymore well they're looking to give waivers to states and then they would allow people uh insurance companies to charge people with pre-existing conditions more i mean that is that is one part of the plan that americans love and now they're gonna they're gonna tinker with that and i mean it's just it's just um setting up for another failure we believe now we're gonna have to wait and see uh what happens in the coming week congressman donald p jr a pleasure having you on the show as always thank you for having good to see you

senate foreign relations committee will come to order let me first thank ambassador junior abercrombie winstonley the chief diversity and inclusion officer of the department of state as well as chief diversity officer at usaid nena diallo for appearing before our committee today i believe this is the first time the committee has held a hearing on this topic with senior department leadership dedicated to this issue our premier american foreign policy institutions must set the bar for others to follow and harnessing the incredible diversity of the american people our different points of view backgrounds and languages is crucial to not only our nation's security but also our global economic and other interests i've been working on efforts to promote diversity at the state department and usaid now for more than two decades and while i'm disappointed to say progress has been slow i'm pleased to see both of you here today only last year the head of the american foreign service association said quote the state department quote was more diverse in 1986 literally than it is now in the last 20 years there has been a two percent decrease in the proportion of black employees at the state department with the majority still in the civil service and latino numbers have barely budged and usaid is no better with six percent of its workforce latino while the latino population of the united states overall is almost 19 this year we are commemorating the pickering program's 30th wrangle program's 20th and payne program's 10th anniversary all programs created to increase diversity at our agencies but as we commemorate we need to know if these programs are actually accomplishing their goals i can count on my fingers the number of ambassadors and mission directors who are people of color so we've got a lot of work to do not fully utilizing the strategic advantage of america's diverse talent pool to engage our allies and counter our competitors and adversaries on the global stage is a vital error and let me just give one example of that i know some of our colleagues will probably be unhappy about today's hearing but the reality is that when i was in china our [Music] chief in china in charge of democracy and human rights programs was an african-american who was an active participant in the civil rights struggle his personal history his personal eyewitness to the accounts of trying to change the course of events in our country were a powerful voice to those in china seeking to create an opportunity for themselves in terms of greater openings for democracy and human rights i can recount easily over the course of 30 years of doing foreign policy dozens of moments in different parts of the world where the few people that we have had who come from diverse backgrounds have been able to make a powerful case and liaison with the peoples of those countries where we are being represented that cannot be purchased that cannot be bought and while it's an error in terms of where we've been at and pleased to say this administration is trying to fix it is also one that nations like russia and china continue to exploit by using their propaganda tools to highlight the gap between our promises and rhetoric when it comes to racial justice and our actions they paint us as hypocrites to talk a big game on equality and human rights the very foundation of democracy but say we don't deliver our diplomats are on the front lines of countering their narratives we must modernize our diplomacy and development efforts to meet the demands of the 21st century that means recruiting from all across america from the cities and coasts of new jersey to the border towns of texas and idaho it means cultivating and retaining a diverse workforce that can take advantage of our nation's technology advances and keep up with other industries it means ensuring workstations and foreign mission buildings are accessible for those with disabilities and it means committing to increasing morale so that people aren't leaving mid-career after years of investment in extensive language and diplomatic school skills so let me be clear as chief diversity officers you not only have the full weight of the white house and your leadership supporting you i want you to know that many of us support you as well i certainly do that's why i'm launching a series of initiatives to advance the diversity legislation resources and recruitment pipelines we need to keep our nation competitive in global affairs for years to come this is also an economic imperative we i often tell when i speak to the corporate leadership in our country about diversity not for diversity sake but for the bottom line study after study shows that more diverse corporate boards and senior executive management means more profitability and these are these are studies done by private entities also as i tell groups as a simple example of the past chevrolet found out what diversity means when they try to sell the chevy nova in latin america for those who don't know spanish when you pronounce nova in spanish it means it won't move it won't go and so that's just a simple example i don't care what type of marketing program you have it's a car that says it's not going to move it's not going to go it's not going to sell and so that's just one of many simple examples where in terms of the economics of how to do business and great get greater market share for our country is incredibly important so today i look forward to hearing from our witnesses on how they're advancing these goals at their agency and also wants to know what is needed to do your jobs effectively and if you're not getting what you need i want to know why the clock is ticking it's been a year and a half since these efforts began and i want to see progress finally to those who might be reticent to support these efforts i want to point out that one of our other great institutions the united states military has long been a place where people of all backgrounds fight alongside each other and where they can rise and an opportunity to be given including the highest levels of our military as a result our military is the greatest fighting force in the world our diplomatic corps and our development program should be strengthened in the same way we must as diplomatic nobel laureate ralph bunches once said quote adhere staunchly to the basic principle that anything less than full equality is not enough with that let me turn to the ranking member for example

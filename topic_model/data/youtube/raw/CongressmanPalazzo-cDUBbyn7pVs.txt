thank you mr chairman um good morning gentlemen thank you for your service and uh thank you for being here so early in the morning um general spencer i know you excuse me you probably share my appreciation for the kiesel air force base given the fact that they were named the best air force base in the nation in 2013. i had the opportunity a few weeks ago to speak with secretary james and general welsh and to invite them personally down to kiesler to see first hand the fine facilities the airmen in our south mississippi community so i want to extend that invitation to you and of course i always extend it to my colleagues as well and anyone who would like to come see kiesel air force base the latest air force budget proposal contains the third plan in three years to try to move the c-130j planes from keesel air force base i fought to kill the first two previous proposals and i'm going to continue to ask the hard questions for this third proposal because quite frankly this move doesn't make any sense it doesn't make sense from a cost perspective and it doesn't make sense from a readiness perspective the latest proposal to send these planes and these airmen to little rock seems like it would cost 27 million dollars just to move this unit that doesn't even take into account the 58 million in construction investment that's been completed at kiesler in recent years in order to accommodate these planes and then there's also the cost of retraining personnel for work on a completely different plane and that also takes time so in past hearings i focus on the questionable cost of moving these planes but i want to focus today on the readiness factor and so my question to you general spencer from a readiness perspective how much time and use of these planes does the air force stand to lose if this move goes forward well obviously we we wouldn't well let me back up a second we uh i think you've uh heard before and that we and when we looked at every one of our weapon systems as we looked at these redux read these reductions and we did an analysis on each one and bounce those against campaign campaign plans to see where we could take less risk our c-130 fleet overall is in excess of the requirement and so what we decided to do then is sit down with the active duty guard and reserve and look at the entire c-130 fleet and look at where they're located and try to figure out where is the best place for them to be based on the mission that we have and allow us to also draw down c-130s and so based on that sort of chess board if you will there was a a holistic plan general not to interrupt because i want to have asked a question of general paxton how does this affect readiness i mean we have a unit that's been in combat broke some serious awards over there and and from our perspective we're hearing that it may take 12 to 24 months just to train up this unit to get it to a state of readiness and if we want to get it to the state of readiness that this unit already has it could possibly take another 12 to 24 months no i is you know i i do not agree that it would take 12-24 will you provide me some justification for that i appreciate it sir thank you sir um general paxton my second question is for you a few weeks ago general amos testified before our committee that the marine corps needs more amphibious ships in fact cno greener said we should use 50 ships we got retired generals and admirals out there saying we've got to have more of these ships as well so we've got a need the navy says it's 38 ships under fiscal constraints that can they can make do with 33. right now we've only got 28 ships and we could drop as low as 22 in the next 10 years we're not anywhere close to the 38 and certainly not anywhere near the 50. so i just want to know how i mean i understand how important these ships are to have survivable amphibious lift like the lpd it's important to our marines and our navy personnel and we've got to provide our service members with the capabilities they need so my question is does the navy marine corps team require more amphibious lift what can we do to ensure that the marine corps requirements are being met that our homeland is protected and that we can get our troops to and from where they need to be and how would increase amphibious lift capabilities provide flexibility to our services the world becomes a much more dangerous place and not safer thank you congressman palazzo and i believe the navy and marine corps team are pretty close on this and we've been fairly consistent and if i could just add maybe a fine point to the numbers there the most pressing set of circumstances for the navy marine team is the steady state demand requirement and both admiral greenert and general amos have been on record to say that given the studies that somewhere between 48 and 54 is the optimal amphibious lift capacity that we need 38 has to do with getting amphibious slipped and getting our forcible entry element into uh the current the two major theater war plans so we have accepted the navy marine team years ago accepted 33 as a fiscally constrained goal we are below that right now we have 31 that are commissioned on the waterfront and then when you account for those that are in and out of maintenance that's that's the loss so to your specific question sir absolutely we could use and we would like to have more ships the challenge is the navy and the marine corps both have maintenance requirements and capital investment requirements there's a higher class sub and other things like that so the challenge for us is to get that balance within the current top line in order to get more amphibious ships we know that we need to just increase the top line for the entire navy marine team so that the navy isn't forced to go into these really tough decisions between a carrier a submarine and an amphib ship but we need more amphibious ships sir all right thank you thank you sir my time's expired thank you thank you mr plaza we're not going to

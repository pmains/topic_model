listen for allowing me to introduce this bill once again identity this is the third time we've introduced this hopefully third time's the charm and we'll get this important legislation passed it passed overwhelmingly and to Congress's I do believe this is the Congress where we will get cybersecurity legislation passed through the House the Senate and signed by the White House it's imperative as we hear reports almost every day of hackings taking place not only within the critical infrastructures but our federal government the Chinese the report about the Chinese military hacking into our military systems stealing our military secrets the attacks recently from Iran against Aramco in the Persian Gulf and against our financial institutions in the United States and of course Russia one of the most sophisticated countries that continue to hack this country on a daily basis whether that's cute whether it's criminal whether it's espionage or whether it's cyber warfare we cannot afford to wait any longer the White House has acted through an executive order I think it's imperative now the Congress act and legislate as we're supposed to be doing it's not a question of if but when the next or when the a cyber Pearl Harbor will occur and that's why I've worked very closely with my good friend congressman Lipinski to bolster our nation's cybersecurity research and development on February the 15th we introduced this bill once again HR 756 the cyber security enhancement act which is identical to the legislation passed overwhelmingly by the house last Congress it improves the coordination and government providing for a strategic plan to assess the cyber security risk and guide the overall direction of federal cyber research and development it updates the NIST responsibilities to develop security standards for federal computer systems and processes for agencies to follow our bill also establishes a federal university private sector task force to coordinate research into element improving the training of cybersecurity professionals and continues much-needed cybersecurity research and development programs at the National Science Foundation and the National Institute of Standards and Technology again I would like to thank my colleague chairman Smith for allowing me to introduce this bill once again I appreciate your support for this bill my colleague from Texas and I look forward to working with my colleagues to on this committee to find solutions to the challenges of cyber research and development and without a yield bag

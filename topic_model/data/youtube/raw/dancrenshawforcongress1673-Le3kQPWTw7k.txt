let me start with you then you're at the forefront of all of this this is shocking 29,000 murders in Mexico last year this stuff obviously filters over into our country as well what do you make of it and in my mind perhaps yours is this one of the best reasons we should be erecting that wall right now these numbers are shocking but they're nothing new to us here in Texas you know over the past six months we've had over 50,000 apprehensions on the border the Rio Grande Valley sector is that is the highest in the nation and we're seeing we're seeing lots of drugs come across and we're also seeing some some effect only because we've been using the National Guard for counterdrug operations and we've been using Department of Public Safety officers to enforce that as well so while we've actually been seeing an increase in violence across the border on our side we're seeing a decrease so it goes to show when you put more guys on the ground it actually does some good so we absolutely support the president's decision to send the National Guard in and we'd like to see the federal government foot that bill because Texas has been footing that bill this entire time

you know people I don't think always like to talk about crime but we we've got to address it I mean crime has become it's become such an interesting issue because we've had not been able to Define it very well as we've gone through uh these last three very strange years here in our area but in general dealing with covid and then now dealing with post-storm crime is just kind of hard to Define we've got to spend a lot of time talking about what to do how to do it and I know you've spent some time talking to some of our local officials about that we we have in fact spent a couple of hours uh last week with uh with Sheriff Sonja here in Terrebonne Parish and seeing the new facilities and all their capabilities the Investments they're making the efficiencies they're incorporating in but you know Keith one thing we have to all keep in mind just a little bit over to the east of where we are now New Orleans recently ranked the murder capital of the world we've seen some big spikes in violent crime in Baton Rouge and there's really no area that's immune to to increasing crime rates and so we've been working to try to bring some targeted Investments of the State Crime Lab for example is a has a one-year backlog right now and processing evidence so you may have a crime committed you may have all the evidence that proves it but it's going to take one year which means that criminal is out on the streets out on bond for one year in many cases committing other crimes so just really trying to work closely with our our law enforcement officials working closely with our DA's and others making sure that they have the resources they need that the laws are written in ways that hold people accountable that judges are imposing the appropriate bonds and not just slapping people on the wrist and letting them back out I was talking to one D.A up up north of here that was telling us that he has some criminals that are out on three bonds at the same time who committed a crime released on bond committed a second crime arrested again released on Bond and a third time I mean that just that's not okay it's not and and so we brought some resources to the table to allow for DNA evidence to be processed not in a year but in about a week week and a half and so just trying to bring more solution into the table like that and and at the end of the day it's all about holding people accountable for their actions well and efficacy of those processes right because boy you don't want something to get thrown out it's got to be precise when we're holding people accountable yeah we got to make sure that we get the evidence right and make sure that the evidence gets logged correct all of those things but that takes man hours and it takes the right uh information to be able to do that and and the right tools to do that and so a lot of those monies are going towards that they are and look these are all these Investments are all Guided by our conversations with again folks like uh sheriff sonier and Sheriff Weber and and other folks in the region that are you know the people that are out there on the street actually fighting crime on a daily basis well I can tell you we're very fortunate down here that all of our municipalities work so very well together uh be it HPD here in Houma terrible Parish Sheriff's Office same thing city of Thibodeau Lafourche Parish Sheriff's Office they all work so very well together the only thing that I can liken it to is all of our Levy boards it works so very well together and it's got to be nice for people like you to be able to say Hey listen if we give this money here they're going to all work together to do something right with it huh no you're exactly right it's critical and that comparison the levees is a good example you know you you build up levies in one area if you don't have an adjacent one it's just going to flood them and uh same thing happens with crime is that crime you know the criminals don't recognize Parish boundaries or city boundaries or anything else and uh it is important that all those sheriffs and law enforcement communities have good close working relationships and and and they do and and it and it ensures that you know at the end of the day that you're holding the criminals accountable that those people are being put in jail getting taken and they're taken off the streets uh preventing them from wreaking havoc in our communities at the end of the day making sure that uh you know that we have control of our own Community safe place to raise a family safe place to have a business and that's what's most important yeah as we close out you know it's one of those things that I think about making sure that there's good communication and maybe finding a way to have those those Bond agencies those bonds systems much like we did with Pharmacy you know you can't do poly Pharmacy anymore you can't shop one Pharmacy the other maybe just maybe that's the process that they can use for bonding so that we don't have people coming out on two and three bonds at one time

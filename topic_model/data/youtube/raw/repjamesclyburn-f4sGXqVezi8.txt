good evening and thank you for joining us today for discussion on the Public service loan forgiveness program today information will be presented from Ashley Harrington of federal student aid Mike Pierce of the student borrow protection Center and we'll also hear from Zach a teacher who has received forgiveness through the Public service loan forgiveness program but first it is my pleasure to introduce Congressman James Clyburn who will start us off thank you very much Ned let me thank all of you for uh joining us uh this afternoon or evening uh I uh I grew up saying that it had to be six o'clock before this evening but I understand it's got a little more now and they're dropped it back to five so whatever your preference thank you for joining us also uh we are calling this program today uh from public service to Financial Freedom if I were naming it I would say Financial Freedom through public service that is what this is all about trying to inform you who are tuned in today how to gain some Financial Freedom through public service this is a program that's been around for a while however as it's so often the case bureaucratic great tape and all kinds of various interpretations have left us to the point where I'm being told uh that 99 of the people who have applied uh for uh Financial uh non-forgiveness uh have not been able to qualify for the program for all kinds of reasons but Divine Administration has looked at this and they have decided that some reforms need to be made reforms that allow more people to come into the program but also reforms that would allow many people who are in the program now or in public service now to get into the program and many of them uh according to our research we all almost immediately have their forgiven how do you go about doing that is what this program is all about here today I hear from people all the time about the bird a student loan debt and as many of you know several years ago I introduced legislation along uh with the Senate uh to to give up to fifty thousand dollars instead of long now uh as time goes on you look at it says is this the best way to do it uh uh but to do that not do anything about uh interest rates I'm not too sure that after you're done much good and to do that and not have people take advantage of what's already there is not a good way to do it either so that's what this program is all about now they give me a lot of stuff here to read to you uh but you didn't come to hear me uh you can hear from some experts to tell you how to wake up in the morning and be able to get some of your financial uh problems cleared up or at least start you on the road to getting that done and that's what this is all about so Nate I'm gonna let you all go on with the program introduce uh our experts here today and then we're going to hear from someone uh who is um has been affected by all of this uh and answer your questions that's what this is all about so as for me Nick I'm out of here [Music] thank you very much sir and from there we'll let Ashley and Mike take it away great so I'm going to turn over to Mike first all right well thank you so much for uh for having me uh and Ashley thank you so much Congressman for all of your leadership on these issues over so many years um and uh we really wouldn't be here without you so as you mentioned before we have this amazing opportunity um because of the Biden Administration to be able to help folks in South Carolina and across the country cancel their deaths my name is Mike Pierce I'm the executive director of the nonprofit student bar protection Center and I was a federal regulator for the student loan industry for a long time before uh I became a consumer Advocate and I've been working on Public service loan forgiveness in some form or another all the way back to when it was just a bill when it passed with Congressman clyburn's support back in 2007 and as the congressman mentioned it's been a mess until right now and today we're going to talk about why that's changed why Public Service workers across South Carolina and across the country have a chance to get their debts canceled now um how that's working something like 10 times the number of Public Service workers have had their debts canceled just since October then in the 14 years before that and we are in a place now where we have this limited window till the end of October where every single public service worker in South Carolina and across the country that's eligible needs to get their debt canceled but you have to take some steps so we're going to walk through what the program is we're going to walk through what the program does I'm very lucky to be joined here by my friend Ashley Harrington from the Department of education's office of federal student aid she's going to walk through the specifics of this waiver this limited opportunity to get your debts canceled and then we're going to answer some questions um so with that I'm going to share my screen and we're going to walk through uh how this actually all works but know that at studentaid.gov there's lots of great information you're going to hear both of us say studentaid.gov over and over and over again today so all of the jargon all the confusing points you can get the stuff in English step by step on studentaid.gov and also on forgivemystudent.org that's a website that my organization runs along with the National Education Association American Federation of teachers asks me the American Association of University professors and the teamsters so a number of very large labor unions this Coalition is strong trying to help connect as many working people across the country as possible with debt cancellation so just know that studentaid.gov and forgivemystudent.org have all of this great information that we're going to talk about today so with that I'm going to share my screen and we're going to get into it so what is Public service loan forgiveness as the congressman mentioned this is the existing law this has been on the books since 2007. uh borrowers who work in public service that meet these criteria have had the right to get their debt canceled for a while it hasn't worked 99 of people who have tried to get their debt canceled up until October have been told to take a walk and there's a whole bunch of reasons why that happens Ashley and I are both going to talk about the tricks and traps along the way that have knocked people off track but most importantly I'm going to walk through what the program is and then Ashley's going to tell you why it's going to work better for you why it's going to be easier why it's going to be faster and why if you tried before and it didn't work you shouldn't get discouraged um so to be able to get Public service loan forgiveness you need the right type of loan the right type of repayment plan you have to work in public service and you have to do all of those things every month for 120 months um when I talk about the right type of loan I mean a direct loan that's a federal student loan made directly by the U.S Department of Education lots and lots of people millions of people have federal student loans that are not these so-called Direct Loans particularly older borrowers like me that went to school back before 2010 and took out a loan from Citibank or Sallie Mae that was guaranteed by the federal government but wasn't a direct loan those are known as ffelp loans or felp loans or federal family Education Loans again lots of jargon and we'll talk a little bit later about how to identify what kind of loan you have but the important part is if you have one of those older loans made by a bank or a Perkins loan made by your school there are steps you can take to turn them into Direct Loans and once you do that you can get on track um and we will talk a little bit more about how that used to work and how that's changed but just remember if you have a direct loan right now don't stress any of this stuff you're on track if you don't have a direct loan right now you're gonna have to take some steps to be able to get on track and a lot of what we're going to talk about today is really geared towards those older borrowers that have those older loans that need to take some steps to get on track um There are rules that might have knocked you off track before particularly this big one that if you take steps to make your old loans count you lose all the credit for your public service work that came before that that was the law of the land right up until Joe Biden changed the rules he did that in October of last year and it's only good for a year but for the first time for this one year window Ashley's going to talk more about what this means but just know that that rule about losing your progress that doesn't apply right now but only for a little while um we are also I'm sure going to get some questions later about Parent Plus Loans I'm not going to spend a lot of time talking about that right now just know that the Normal Public service loan forgiveness program is open to parents but the waiver there are some rules and some steps and a lot of people won't actually be able to get access through this this limited opportunity so I'm not going to spend time on this now I'm sure we're going to get to it um in the Q a but know that the rules are a little different for parents the next piece here is the right type of payment plan um again under the existing program you need to be making payments based on your income importantly payments have been paused going all the way back to the beginning of the pandemic that period that payment pause when none of us have been making payments going all the way back to March of 2020. that still counts it doesn't matter what payment plan you're in during this pause your payments are paused so as long as your payments are paused you're getting credit toward Public service loan forgiveness but the rules for the program are you need to be making payments based on your income and again Ashley's going to talk more about why this is much much simpler right now but these are the rules you also have to work in public service and this is something that didn't change you need to work for um an organization the government considers a public service organization but it doesn't matter what you do there you can be a lawyer in the general counsel's office you can be a teacher in a classroom as long as your employer is a public service organization that means a government agency a 501c3 non-profit or another kind of private non-profit organization that performs some specific qualifying Services that's very common in childhood education or health care and you work full-time that means you work greater than 30 hours a week or you meet your employer's definition of full-time if that's greater than 30 hours a week it also means you could work in multiple Public Service organizations and add up your hours to get to what the government considers a full-time job these are the rules of the program they've always been the rules of the program um there's some work being done to try to make them a little bit easier for people to navigate but right now this is what it means to work in public service and you have to do that every month for 120 months or 10 years and that means that you have to make a payment again this period where payments are paused your the government considers that making a payment but you have to make a payment you have to make those payments on time and uh there are certainly people that have gotten knocked off track before this is mostly just a flag that the rules have changed for a long time you have to make 120 individual payments make a payment every month for 120 months for it to count those rules have gotten a little bit easier so you can make a couple months of payments at a time or up to a year of payments at a time um so just know that if you're an older borrower and try to get Public service loan forgiveness before some of these tricks and traps that have knocked people off track they've gotten better over time and then Ashley's going to talk more about how this has really changed for folks and that this is much much easier right now um but I want to emphasize one more time during the pandemic while payments are paused that counts towards Public service loan forgiveness so if you have not been getting treasury interest not been paying your loans going all the way back to March of 2020. every single one of those months counts as long as you work in public service um but we recognize that this is complicated and along the way there's lots of things that have knocked people off track and as Congressman Clyburn mentioned at the top 99 out of every 100 Public Service workers who raised their hand and said cancel my debt before the buy Administration came in they were told now and that's bad I mean for many reasons that's bad but basically it feels like people have had this promise broken to them the government made this deal with a generation of Public Service workers more than a decade ago and didn't hold up their end of the bargain this has made headlines across the country for the public service workers on this call that have been struggling to make their way through the system um your government heard you and when Joe Biden came in uh he asked Public Service workers to help him understand what was wrong and how to fix it and more than uh 45 000 people shared their stories Public Service workers from across the country said this is broken it needs to be simpler you need to hold up your end of the bargain and cancel our debts and President Biden listened with pressure from National Democrats including Congressman Clyburn the administration actually did right by people and opened up this special opportunity to cancel debts for a generation of Public Service workers that have been knocked off track before um so with that I'm going to hand this to my friend Ashley who's now going to walk through what changed and why it's easy thanks Mike and thank you so much Congressman Clyburn for putting this together and for all of your leadership and support for student borrowers um it is it is so necessary and needed as Mike said my name is Ashley Harrington I am a senior advisor at federal student aid and Department of Education a former consumer Advocate and I'm really excited today because I can talk about the good stuff Mike got to talk about how pslf normally works right um and how and it's important to know that because it's going to start working that way again on October 31st 2022 when this waiver ends but I get to talk about them really transformative changes that this Administration has made to make this work for more borrowers right but Mike said fewer than 7 000 people had gotten forgiveness before this waiver he was right when the congressman talked about the 99 denial rate he was right but now we haven't we have increased that more than 170 000 borrowers have gotten over nine billion dollars in forgiveness and an additional million point one borrowers have gotten closer to forgiveness so the things that we're about to talk about are real transformative changes and they any real relief for real people and probably for many of you on the line today so we can go to the next slide Mike so what we're talking about here is called The Limited pslf waiver The Limited pslf waiver announced last October it is a rule change for pslf so all the rules that Mike talked about that were in effect until October now they're different right under the waiver borrowers can get credit for past periods of repayment that otherwise would not qualify for pslf so under this waiver any prior period of repayment is going to count we're not looking at your repayment plan we're not looking at your loan program we're not looking at whether you made a payment in full or on time we're not even looking at whether you actually made a payment right we just want to know were you in active repayment status and we are defining that very generously we are even expecting some periods of deferment and forbearance oh you you still need qualifying employment but if you meet these other criteria and again we are defining repayment very generously you can get closer to pslf forgiveness or even get forgiveness and so this changes for borrowers with Direct Loans because we know that's what pslf is for as we talked about earlier those who have already Consolidated to the Direct Loan program and those who consolidate into the Direct Loan program by October 31st 2022. if you don't take much away from this webinar I hope you take away this date October 31st 2022 because there are actions you may need to take by this date to take advantage of this waiver because after that this waiver turns into a pumpkin and you will not get these benefits now is the time even if you're not at 120 even if you haven't been in repayment 10 years even if you haven't been in repayment for two years you should go ahead and get your forms in get get your application in it doesn't hurt to get yourself on track for pslf so we're going to talk a little bit more about the waiver next slide so again payments made prior to consolidation are now eligible Mike talked about how you could consolidate before you could consolidate your failed loans or your Perkins loan or you can even consolidate Direct Loans right but once you did that you had to start at zero you had to start over under the waiver that is not the case if you have fell or Perkins loans and you consolidate you do not have to start at zero if you previously had fellow Perkins loans and you Consolidated and they told you you had to start at zero you can get credit now for that time spent prior to consolidation doesn't matter what repayment plan you're on we're not looking at that we don't care we're not looking at what loan type you have except for parent plus and we'll talk about that in a second you still have to be in for employ full time for a qualifying employer when every single month you're trying to get credit for every single month you're trying to get credit for but this is a big deal so if you still have fellow Perkins loans you have to consolidate by October 31st and you have to get a pslf form in by October 31st because after that the normal pslf and tpslf rules will apply next slide I really just try to advance it myself sorry about that so you may fall into one of three borrower groups right if you only have Direct Loans and we're going to talk later about how you know which group you fall into and how you know what type of loans you have but if you only have Direct Loans what you want to do is make sure you have a psls form on file for an eligible employer for post October 2007 because that's when PS left was created on file and get that in right you want to submit them we'll talk about how you're going to submit how you apply for pslf if you already consolidate into the Direct Loan program you want to get a pslf form in for the time spent prior to consolidation and if you still have Feller Perkins loans you have the most to do because you have to consolidate your loans into direct consolidation Loan program and you have to get a pslf form and you have to do it all by October 31st 2022. visit for any of these groups this is you effectively raising your hand and saying I have to I have federal student loans I'm in public service I want to qualify for this waiver I want to get the maximum amount of credit I can right now and even though I'm not at 120 I want to continue working towards pslf forgiveness next slide so I want to talk briefly about Parent Plus Loans in the waiver might touch up just a little bit that Parent PLUS borrowers are absolutely eligible for pslf it's based on the Paris employment not the students it's in the parent's name so it's going to be based on your employment so they are eligible for psls most parents are going to have to consolidate into a direct consolidation loans they can get access to income-based repayment for pslf right so most Parent PLUS borrowers if they're working towards pslf likely have a direct consolidation loan under the waiver you can't get additional credit for that underlying Parent PLUS Loan we talked about direct consolidation loans and how fell borrowers and Perkins borrowers are going to have to consolidate into the Direct Loan program that is true and those borrowers will get additional credit for those underlying loans that is not the case for parent plus borrowers if you're a parent plus borrower when you have a direct consolidation loan when underlying parent plus you won't get any credit any additional credit you will get additional credit for the time and repayment when it was already a direct consolidation loan so if you missed the payment or it was late or it was um on the wrong repayment plan you can get credit for that part when it's after it's Consolidated but not before or if you had a parent plus loan that you Consolidated with your own student loans and so you have a direct consolidation loan with multiple underlying loans you could get additional credit for those other underlying loans or if you Consolidated now you could get additional credit for those other underlying loans but you can't get any additional credit for the time when it's purely parent plus I know it's confusing but we can talk about it more I'm sure there'll be questions um but just things to know if you're a parent plus borrower there's always just a couple of extra steps you want to check out some more information you want to read because your loans operate slightly differently next slide so a couple things to know about consolidation we'd like to flag these because most a lot of folks are going to have to consolidate right but consolidation is not without things that happen right so your monthly payment may go down but you may have to pay longer because it's essentially a new loan however if you're working towards pslf and that 120 you probably don't care about this right if you have unpaid interest your principal balance is going to go up because that interest is going to be capitalized again if you're working towards pslf you probably don't care about this because that's just more that's going to get forgiven at the end of your 120. your new consolidation loan will probably have a new interest rate because it's going to be a weighted average of all the loans of interest rates for all the loans again if you're working towards pslf and you're on income based repayment plans you're probably not worried but you're probably not worried about this either and remember you don't have to consolidate all of your federal student loans you can consolidate One loan you can consolidate five loans you can consolidate eight loans it doesn't matter but just know that once you consolidate you can't undo it next slide so one flag one additional thing because I mentioned that we're counting certain periods of forbearances and deferments we're counting some military related forbearances and deferments and we're counting some long-term forbearances another thing we announced as part of our effort to provide targeted student loan relief and fix this broken system for uh for how we how people have to manage their student loans is we know that there are a ton of borrowers who were steered into something called long-term forbearances by their servicers because of that they were in forbearances of 12 or more months consecutive or 36 or more months cumulative when they could have been on an income based repayment plan it had a zero dollar payment or a very low dollar payment so borrowers who were steered into these long-term forbearances 12 or more months consecutive for 36 or more months cumulative can now get credit towards IDR and pslf for pslf you are still going to have to submit a psls form so certify employment for that time period but this is also going to help a large number of borrowers who were steered into these forbearances that they didn't need to be in and we're going to do a lot of this automatic medically it's going to take time it's going to happen later this year so stay tuned but that gives you time to get those pslf forms in in the meantime but this is also going to be a big game changer for a lot of folks next slide so just to note What to Expect When You're Expecting for those of us who are already in pslf or who have submitted pslf forms recently and you're wondering what is going on with my application so first you may know that the previous pslo servicer was a company called Fed Loan Servicing or FIA they are no longer servicing federal student loans so as of May 1 we are no we no longer sent borrowers to fear as of July 1 the pslf servicer is mojila so now when you send me that psls form you're sending it to Mohela and you'll be transferred to Mohela if you were already in the pslf program you are getting transferred to Mohela I just got transferred this week more folks are coming everyone's going to be transferred by September of this year and that's okay my payment count didn't change my payment didn't change my plans didn't change none of that my terms didn't change all of that's going to go with you all of anything you have pending is going to go with you to Mohela that's okay don't worry about that but we still say keep track of your own stuff be your own best Advocate keep track of your paperwork of your payments of your forms all of that because it never hurts to have backup copies next slide so I'm going to turn it back to Mike to talk about how you identify your student loans all right and now we're uh we're really going to get into the weeds here um so as Ashley mentioned and as we are gonna uh probably mention 20 more times in the rest of the hour you are going to turn into a pumpkin on Halloween you have until October 31st to do these things and if you don't do them you're gonna miss out um and I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't know the by demonstration might choose to give you more time here um that is a decision the president can make and uh we joined with hundreds of other organizations including the NAACP um a number of major labor unions to call on the administration to give everybody more time I'm going to mention that again at the end um but right now the rules are you've gotten until Halloween to be able to take these steps and that means first doing a checkup on your student loans figuring out which of these things you need to do which forms you need to send in and that first step is figuring out if you have a direct loan or you have another kind of Federal Loan or you have what's called a private student loan a purely private loan made by Sallie Mae or a bank that can't get on track for Public service loan forgiveness um the only way to figure this out is to go to studentaid.gov and I'm going to show you step by step how you actually do make this work um so to figure out what kind of federal student loan you have or if you have a loan that's not a federal student loan you log into studentaid.gov and studentaid.gov it's the same place you go to fill out financial aid forms in the past you might have needed to pause your student loan payments or learn more about what your student loan repayment options are so you've gone there before and created an ID to log in if you haven't done it it's fast it's easy you can do it in a single sitting you just have to go online and sign up once you have that credential you log in and you go under view details and you can download your student aid data again this is a lot of jargon and uh forgive my student debt.org our website has really good like step-by-step short videos on how to do this if some of this is confusing but log on to studentaid.gov and get your student loans and what you'll see next to your loans are the type of loan you have um if all you have are Direct Loans you can skip the next couple steps that we'll talk about and all you need to do is certify your service but if you have Federal loans that appear here that are not Direct Loans particularly Perkins loans or fell loans you're going to need to do some other things um in particular you're going to need to consolidate so again if you have one of these older loans a federal family education program loan or ffelp loan or a Perkins loan a loan made by your school you have to go through this process also at studentaid.gov to consolidate your loans into a new direct loan and I know this is a lot of jargon and I know a bunch of these words are probably words you've never heard before and you may never hear again if this is confusing again forgivemystudentec.org has videos that walk you through all of these steps including actual screenshots of what you're going to see on studentaid.gov and that can help you unpack some of the stuff but moving very quickly here you go through this tool that's on studentaid.gov to fill out what's called a direct consolidation loan application this is again a lot of jargon but really what you're doing here is you're paying off your old student loans with a new direct consolidation loan so whoever it is that owns your old federal student loans you saw them sitting on that list of loans that's not going to go whoever owns them is going to get a check from the Department of Education for what you owe them they're going to zero out your account and you're going to have a new direct consolidation loan that you owe directly to the United States government and that loan is eligible to be canceled through Public service loan forgiveness and it's eligible to get you credit for your entire tenure of Public Service work even before you fill out this form and that is only true right now it's only true to the end of October unless Joe Biden extends the waiver so you need to act now so you hit start you're on studentaid.gov you fill out this this form that it helps you populate um you get to choose who your student loan servicer is as part of this uh we recommend you choose this company called mojila m-o-h-e-l-a um they are the contractor the government has hired to handle all Public service loan forgiveness loan processing it used to be a different company used to be a company called Fed Loan Servicing but as of July 1st of this year it is now this company mojila so it's better for you to just start there because you're going to try to get Public service loan forgiveness and they're the experts um so you pick Mohela you go into the application you get to fill out a couple Fields it's all stuff you know and you have to pick the loans that count towards your consolidation so you want to check all the boxes you want to include every loan you have in this consolidation loan and that's because the government's going to give you credit based on the oldest loan that you have in your consolidation loan um and so this is again this is part of the waiver this isn't how the program used to work but right now if you include your oldest Loan in this consolidation loan you're going to get credit towards pslf from for all public service that you performed while you paid that old loan back even if you have some younger loans where I've been there um so once you fill out this form you submit it and the government's going to process your consolidation that's the the big first thing you need to do if you have one of these older loads you'll also be able to pick the payment plan you want to be enrolled in uh whenever payments restart again um and you'll have to sign a uh and certify that this is accurate and these are your loans um importantly once you've done that um there's also some steps you take to certify your service so I'm going to hand this back to Ashley now about the second chunk of things you need to do thanks Mike it's me again um that was really helpful I just want to flag a couple of things um one if you have Parent Plus Loans you may not want to consolidate all of them because then you're only going to get access to one income based repayment plan and it's the least generated so parent plus borrower should always read the fine print and think a little bit before they before they click just want to flag um and if you want to set yourself up for Success after the payment Clause is over and after the waiver is over when you're doing that consolidation application that Mike just showed you you want to click that you want to be on an income based repayment plan when you can solve it because that's going to put you in the best position to continue working towards pslf when this is when this is over so next slide foreign so I'm going to talk to you about how Mike talked about how you find out what type of loans you have and how you consolidate I'm going to talk to you about how you certify your employment this is really important because pslf one of the biggest things we want to know about you is do you work for a qualifying pslf employer so to find that out we have a couple of tools the first one which we just announced and we're very excited about it is what we're calling this employer Search tool prior to this all you had to log into our help tool which we're going to talk about next you have to have studentaid.gov account you have to have all that ready and then you could go in and you could look up your look up your employer now we have a public-facing website so you can look it up without logging in employers can look it up without logging in and they can see if they're showing up in our database if they're showing up as eligible or likely and eligible or ineligible and they can find out where they sit now keep in mind this this database is not the end-all be-all it doesn't have every single qualifying PSL employer doesn't even have every single qualifying employer so if you European if your employer is not in there or it's in there is likely and eligible or ineligible don't be discouraged still continue with the process if you believe your employer is an eligible pslf employer keep going it just will have to go through a couple of extra steps but it could be worth it in the end okay next slide so we're going to talk about how you submit your pslf form this is what the physical form looks like but and you can download it and fill it out by hand but what we really suggest is that you use our pslf help tool to generate this form next slide and you can find that form at studentaid.gov psls this is the landing page for the help tool and this is going to help you certify your employment so you're going to click login next slide and when you log in you're going to log in with your studentaid.gov ID which you should have or be getting one because that's the best place to manage your federal student loans and find information it's where you're going to go to consolidate where you go to sign up for income it's repayment and where you go to apply for pslf so we're just flagging that there's no separate application for the pslf waiver if you apply for pslf before you've applied for the pslf waiver because it's it's just applying for pslf it's just that if you apply right now your your time and repayment gets evaluated under the waiver and not under the normal pslf rules but it's the same application and so it's the same place student a.gov pslf so the first thing we're going to ask you for in the employer Search tool and in The Help tool is something called an EIN employer identification number this is something you can find on your pay stub or on box B of your W-2 you are going to need the Ein the federal employee identification number for every single employer that you want to get credit for I can't say that enough if you look right here you can see the first thing we ask you for is that number we don't ask you for the name of the place we don't ask you for the address we need that number you're going to need that number for every single employee you want to certify so you'll put that number in you'll put your employment dates in and then if you work for a federal estate agency or um some other entity it may pop up with multiple names underneath that Ein you may have to search through and find yours so you want to make sure you're looking at that so you'll put it in and it could say green for eligible or it could say this orange yellow thing likely and eligible that really just means undetermined don't be discouraged it just means we don't know yet it might be or it might not be but it has to go through our employer adjudication process or it could be read not eligible meaning that we don't think it's qualified because it's not a qualifying non-profit or it's a for-profit like Coca-Cola even if you get this orangey yellow or the red or it doesn't pop up at all it says we don't recognize the cin you still want to continue with the process don't be discouraged it just means it's going to have to go through a little bit of extra steps go through our employer adjudication team but it doesn't mean your application is going to be just denied next slide so once you put in employers you can put in multiple employers um during one session you're going to go to section two loan tips this is going to give you some information about the waiver and covid-19 forbearance next slide it's going to ask you do you think you made 120 payments yes or no you have to put whatever our system thinks so if our system doesn't think you made 120 even though you do because you're counting those pre-consolidation ones you still have to put no to move forward doesn't mean it doesn't do anything with how your application is processed it's just something you have to answer next slide then you're going to verify your personal information because you log into your student aid account it's going to be pre-populated but if you need to change it you can in account settings next slide then you're going to click review and save and you're going to make sure everything's right you might have multiple employers you're going to make sure application type your personal information is the same next slide then if your employer was in our tool list as eligible you're going to generate a a PDF form that looks like that first form I showed you but it's going to be all filled out now that you have this form you have to sign it and you have to get it signed by your employer and every single employer trying to get certified is going to have to be signed by you and by your employer so if you put in multiple eins multiple employers are going to be in that PDF you're going to have to get each of them signed here comes the fun part because you want to make sure you're following our signature requirements which we'll talk about next and once you get those signatures you're either gonna have to mail it in or fax it in yes I did say mail or fax or if you already have mojito as your servicer you can upload it online to their website but if not you're gonna have to mail it or fax it in I know we're working on digital submission next year next slide so you want to make sure you're at your meeting the signature requirements right you we don't accept DocuSign or digital certificate-based signature sorry you can do hand drawn like on your mouse or with your finger you can do um a scanned photo of a signature or you can literally do a wet signature where you print it out sign it in ink and scan it back in or mail it but you can do that digital certificate based signature you can't do the cursive font signature please don't try it I have tried it they have sent my form back it and it is annoying so make sure you're following the signature examples and requirements next slide okay turn it back over to Mike for a couple application reminders and then I think I think we're getting closer then and we can take questions right Mike all right Yep this is the end uh home stretch guys so I'm gonna um find a couple things that Ashley mentioned about um steps in this process where people get knocked off track and that is particularly true with the signatures and the forms so the first thing I wanted to make sure we flag here if you make a mistake on the form just do a new form I know this is annoying this is particularly annoying if um you're trying to get your employer to certify your form and you finally got a hold of somebody in HR or in your management that's willing to take a second to do the thing you need to do and they've made a mistake but this thing where folks sometimes hand correct or correct into a signature to to memorialize a mistake this system is very old it's very clunky the people reviewing these forms do a lot of them very fast they're just going to reject your form and they're going to make you do it again so save yourself the pain get it right the first time even if it takes a little bit more processing on your employer's end to make sure that it's correct make sure it's just correct and has a single signature in the right place and it's a wet signature or it's a scribble not a font or an initial signature also important um there's a lot of documents out there that were created under the original rules of the program I mentioned at the very top all the tricks and traps that knocked 99 of people out of progress towards pslf back when the program was first created um you might get notices from your student loan company that have information about the way things used to be do not lose Faith do not ignore what Ashley and I have told you today studentaid.gov is correct uh forgivemystudentec.org is correct your servicer is probably wrong just keep moving forward um that is true where you get These Warnings say you have older loans that don't qualify they do now only till October but they do now so don't lose Faith don't listen to stuff that seems wrong trust Ashley and I truststudenty.gov there's some bad information out there we are all sorry it exists it makes this very frustrating but we got to just work through it um that is also true on the Public service loan forgiveness help tool that Ashley just mentioned um the tool was built for the old rules so there's a place where it's not going to realize that your older loans will actually help you get on track to get canceled and it's going to say based on your loan information you haven't actually served in public service for a decade if you know you worked for a decade and you're just trying to certify your service and get your debt canceled ignore this thing keep moving through you might have to check a box that doesn't seem right just keep clicking through the tool to be able to fill out your form and get your debts canceled the last thing I want to flag one more time is that uh you might get forms from your student loan company that tell you that only a couple of your payments have counted towards Public service loan forgiveness when you know you've done all the things that Ashley and I have told you to do and you're going to get 120 months worth of credit or 50 months worth of credit or 75 months for the credit if your student loan company tells you you've only got three eligible months just ignore it and keep certifying your service keep filling out your forms keep consolidating your loans do everything we say to do before October and the government is going to go back through and reconcile all this payment counting stuff and you're going to get the credit you deserve these are the new rules this is going to work it has canceled 170 000 people's loans already um you just need to work your way through the noise and recognize that some of the stuff is going to feel wonky um so I just wanted to flag one more time trust what you read on studentaid.gov trust what you read on forgivemystudentec.org if your student loan company is telling you something that seems sideways they've got it wrong so with that I'm going to hand this back to Ashley and she's going to take us out I think and then we're gonna answer some questions Yep this is my last time and that's absolutely right so a lot of those letters that might point out are Auto generated so don't be discouraged it's just the system makes the system cranks them out we try to put this plant uh explainers on their disclaimers but I know that it can be confusing but just work with us stay with the process this Administration is committed to making sure every public servants get the credit they earn so don't worry about that um so next slide I just want to leave you with some resources and make sure you have them oh first a reminder just to recap take advantage of the waiver you want to confirm your employer is qualified you can use our employer Search tool you want to consolidate your loans if you need to and you want to get a pslf form in using our help tool and you want to do it all by October 31st 2022. next slide and here are some resources for the the best place to go for information about the waiver is student aid.gov pslf waiver the best place to go for the helptools2nate.gov pslf for general pslf information and how it's all going to work when the waiver is over go to studentate.gov public service and remember you're submitting pslf forms to Mohela now so I think I'm turning it back over to Nathan quickly and then we'll answer some questions thank you so much Ashley and Mike that was a great presentation with a bunch of helpful information um so we want to give you all just a little bit of time to really think through your questions and we're going to have you go ahead and type your questions into the group chat and um there we're gonna have uh Ashley and Mike see them and be able to answer those questions for you here and but before we get into them answering questions um we want you all to also hear just how this program works and how it has helped public servants out there and so with that being said I would like to introduce um a teacher Mr zakoon um who is here to um tell you about his experience with the program Mr thank you Nate I just want to say quickly Nate was my student in AP Literature I don't know maybe 10 years ago one of the best students I've ever had I want to thank majority whip Clyburn and his staff especially Nate and um Mike and Ashley for their presentation today even though I'm not as constituent he's one of the driving forces who brought me here today debt free at 43 years old with 18 years of teaching experience I am one of the 170 000 people who've had their loans forgiven I was one of the 99 percent of people who had their original application rejected in 2004 I graduated with a masters in English and a degree in teaching and I had 38 000 in student loan debt I made my monthly payments every month my mom and dad did not go to college they were a carpenter and a secretary and so I had to pay for school all by myself and when I was done I had 38 000 and by the time my loans were forgiven last year I had paid back 39 000 and yet I still owed 26 thousand dollars I think all of you in this room know what that's like to make these payments every month and to hear over and over again there's nothing we can do there's nothing we can do I originally applied and was accepted in 2013 and I was one of the 99 of people whose broad dream of having their loans forgiven was broken pretty much instantly by finding out that they weren't counting any of my qualifying payments President Obama with the help of of Mr Clyburn has uh changed I'm sorry President Biden has changed that with the help of Mr Clyburn and I was able to get into this program what does it mean to me to have my loans forgiven it means I have 250 a month extra income every month for some of you it might be 500 for some of you it might be a thousand I have friends whose loans are that high what that means is my kids get to go a few more places than we used to get to go I don't have to teach summer school anymore because that debt is off of my shoulders and the biggest thing for me that I wanted to make sure I said today was do not panic when you get a letter like the last one that Mike showed that says your payments weren't counted if you get into the program and you get accepted you'll have your heart broken a couple of times because you're going to read these papers and you're going to see well we're not forgiving it because of this and this don't worry Don't Panic follow what has been told to you today and you will find eventually that if you meet all of the requirements thanks to this new waiver and this new law that the loan will my loans were forgiven and 170 other thousand people's loans were also forgiven so I just wanted to make sure that I was here today to express to you that this can happen that it did not happen for a long time my original application was accepted in 2013. so I'm not a math teacher I'm an English teacher but I believe it took nine years for those forgiven eventually that was because the waiver was not in place this waiver changes the game for borrowers like me and like all of you wow thank you so much Mr um for sharing your perspective and for being so candid about your experience um uh with the pslf waiver um so now what we're going to do is we are going to go ahead and transition to the question portion uh I've seen some people are sending me some questions right now these are some really good questions that we want to get answered and so I'm going to turn it over to Kat who's going to ensure that we get these questions answered for you all hi thanks so much Nate and thanks so much everyone for joining um I know we're we're getting towards the end so I'm just gonna jump right in and start asking um Ashley and my questions um this is our first question is a really great question I think it's really similar to the story that uh Mr  just shared but someone said they applied for pslf before and they were denied because they had the wrong loans they have since um Consolidated their loans do they need to go back um and get their employer's signature again or can they see use the same one from their February um application so I'm assuming they submitted a PS Love form when they Consolidated their loans well they need to submit a new pslf form post consolidation you asking me cat yeah sorry actually sorry um so so if your form was denied so you submitted it prior to consolidation most of the time if you if you you can consolidate signature pslf form it will generally be held for 30 days until your consolidation goes through but if it was denied yes you would have to resubmit if it's from February that means the signature is not that old but if you applied like three years ago and you were denied now you're gonna have to resubmit we didn't keep those forms and you will likely need to get a more updated signature so yes you should get that signature done again and if something has happened and you need like a signature from like 10 years ago and your employer can't give it to you because they don't keep records or they no longer exist that you can you can check that you are unable to get that form we don't recommend this we prefer you use your help tool and get a signature but if you absolutely cannot you can consider W-2 or a pay stub as alternative documentation but you are going to have to submit something thanks Ashley um and then I guess this one to Ashley or Mike um do you have to work in public service for 10 years or do you have to make 120 payments is there a difference between that 10-year Mark and 120 payment mark well you have to do both so you need you need 120 months of qualifying payment under the waiver that's 120 repayment 120 month repayment period and you need you actually have to work the time in public service and so it doesn't have to be consecutive right but you're gonna have to get to 120. it might take you 15 years it might take you exactly 10 years it doesn't matter how long it takes you but yes you are going to have to have the months in repayment and actually work those 120 months in public service and this next question um there are two questions so one someone's been in public service for more than 30 years so you might say what years actually count for the purposes of the pslf program and then two if someone um has already paid off their undergrad degrees but still has graduate loans can they still try to get Public service loan forgiveness through this waiver um I forgot the first question already um the service before 2007 count oh I have any service after October 2007 because prior to that there was no pslf that's when Congress created Created it um the second question was if someone's been denied previously um can they still reapply we got the same question again about reapplying if someone's been previously been not denied oh yeah and you asked about graduate loans absolutely if you if you've been denied before we encourage you to try again this is this is your time right we have fixed it we have made this work for public servants so even if you've been denied or you've heard about these problems try now try before October 31st 2022 okay because these are real changes um about the folks who if you pay off your undergrad loans and you and now you still have grad loans absolutely like it doesn't matter whether it's undergrad or grad loans for pslf you can't you can't consolidate with the undergrad loans that were already paid off to get extra time because they're paid off so anything that's paid off can't now be Consolidated but it doesn't matter whether it's an undergrad loan or grad loan as we talked about even Parent Plus Loans are eligible for pslf so absolutely get yours get those forms in and if someone was previously on a graduated um repayment plan is there anything that you need to do right now during the waiver period to get those payments to count for pslf so remember under the waiver period we don't care what we're payment plan you're on we just want to know if you're an active repayment status and we're defining it very generously right so we're not looking at that but what you want to do is if you're not going to be at 120 before this repayment before this period is over coming out of this coming out of the waiver and the payment pause you want to make sure you're on an income based repayment plan going forward because that will enable you to continue working towards pslf but right now you're okay but going forward you want to be on the right path thanks Ashley and then for people who have spousal consolidation loans or do those qualify for pslf good question so if you have failed spousal consolidation loans unfortunately you cannot consolidate into a direct loan program because direct spousal consolidation loans are no longer made so you're kind of in a you're kind of in a pickle if you have direct spousal consolidation loans already yes you can get pslf for your portion of that spousal consolidation loan based on your employment thanks Ashley and then how does someone figure out how many payments they've already made well once you've applied for pslf and you've gotten into the pslf program you'll be able to track your payments on the PSL service or website so we're on mochila where you would have previously been able to do it on Fed Loan and you'll be able to track it on your student aid.gov dashboard when you look at your loans it'll literally say how many pslf months you've had thanks and then what about someone if their employer no longer exists or they can't get access to their employer is there a way to verify their employment yep if you absolutely can't get your employer to sign it because they no longer exist or they don't they don't keep records back as far as you're looking you can submit a w to our pay stubs you are going to have to submit something though but we really encourage you if you can get a signature get a signature that's your best bet but if you absolutely cannot you can submit your W-2 or old pay stubs that will um verify your employment and then should someone ask for forbearance while their pslf application is being processed that is going to be up to the borrower right now though under the payment pause you wouldn't necessarily need to ask for that um but going forward um and that's also we're looking at forbearances in general under rule makings and different things so you want to follow up and make sure you know exactly how that forbearance is going to be treated um while you're waiting if you think you're at 120 then it's okay if you're pretty if you're like pretty positive you're at 120 I wouldn't worry about it but if you were asking for if you're not sure and you're worried about it you want to make you want to think about that and I'm going to say one more thing that Ashley probably can't say we're really hoping that the pause on student loan payments gets extended again we are just a few weeks out from people having to pay bills again uh the president has not made an announcement about whether or not this pause on student loan payments is going to get extended um it's not good uh but we are we are pushing really hard and we're really hopeful that nobody's going to have to make a student loan payment this year so just keep watching um studentaid.gov watching the letters that you get from your student loan servicer hopefully the people's payments are going to stay paused all the way through the end of the Public service loan for goodness waiver and nobody's gonna have to make any decisions about what payment plan to be in to be able to get your waiver processed we're just going to be able to keep our payments paused keep the interest suspended and the whole system is going to work you know Ashley can't say that but I can so we're doing everything we can to keep the student loan system shut off until every single borrowers have their debts canceled consistent with their rights into the law I think it's like um and then also for people who are thinking who are going through the process how long should they wait to hear back or expect to hear back for the pslf waiver process it's a good question and it really just depends right so if you have to consolidate remember the consolidation could take up to 30 days and then your pslf form is going to be held in the meantime if you don't have Direct Loans so then that could be another month it also depends on if your application is actually if your employer is showing up in our database is eligible so we know that's eligible if not and we have to go through employer adjudication that will add some time also we're in the midst of this transfer and that's you know that's a thing and we have a lot going on and so that can add time as well so we're asking just be patient with us but we can promise you this do your part get your stuff in by October 31st get your consolidation loan get your consolidation application in get your pslf form in if you do your part by October 31st you will be okay we will do our part we will do our part but don't but don't wait don't say that's the thing that like you can do it October 30th no please don't go ahead and get it in but just know that as long as you do your part we can do ours thanks Ashley and then another question if someone's been submitting um employer certification forms um but they keep getting denied are there any tips um for what they should do or should they continue to resubmit them so they can get them approved well this should give you a reason as to why it's been denied and so um we can uh we can one of us will try if you offline about why it's getting denied and then we can try to figure that out and then another question so um is there a cap to how much could be forgiven under pslf nope is whatever you have left over at the end of your 120 payments the average amount of forgiveness so far has been like 50 or 60k doesn't matter what your how much how much debt you have doesn't matter what your income is we're not asking any of that you get your 120 you do your service you get forgiven and it's not taxable lovely um and then we have a question for someone who has they've Consolidated they've Consolidated their loans they have direct subsidized and direct unsubsidized are those are those both considered Direct Loans for the purposes of pslf yep as long as they say direct at the front they're Direct and then do you remind mentioning one more time um about payments during um the covid-19 payment pause do those payments count for the purpose of pslf absolutely you can get credit for every single one of these months as long as you also were still employed full-time for a qualifying employer employers I know it sounds crazy I know it sounds like it doesn't make any sense but you can get credit for every single one of these months that's like 26 months that's puts you more than a fifth of the way towards your 120 yes get your forms in get your forms in you can get credit for every single one of these months and then for payments that may have been on an in-school deferment or um just someone got a forbearance maybe like an emergency forbearance during a month to those months count for pslf so if you're an in-school deferment no that doesn't count um because you're not required to make a payment or if you're in that grace period um we for for heart for deferments and forbearances we are counting the long term for a banister and we talked about if you feel like you were still into our short term for marriage you can also reach out to our Ombudsman and she can get in Chic and she can work with you to get those payments applied to your account we also accept economic hardship deferments and all deferments prior to 2013 under the Account Adjustment but um if it's like a one month forbearance or something like that likely you may not be able unless you reach out to her if you were steered into that um we're also some military or some service members and Veterans can get credit for active duty um deferments and forbearances there's that ability um but in general that's that's how it works I think I answered the question uh I forgot what it was yep and then yep that was it he answered it and then one last question uh we were talking about um non-profits it's a 501c7 a qualifying nonprofit for the purposes of pslf I mean I don't know what a C7 is I've worn this year how many how many numbers come after C um it depends it has to provide a qualifying Public Service um you can find that list online and on that pslf form um I'm not sure what is a C7 I'm also not sure I don't know Mike do you know I Googled it's a social club I have no idea um probably it is not one of the categories of nonprofits that are explicitly excluded under the law it's not a labor union um and it is not a political organization and so that means that if you're performing a qualifying service it might count I'm not familiar with any c7s that perform qualifying services so I don't want to get anybody's hopes up but it is not a category that is excluded and is also not a category that's obviously in so I'd say raise your hand and figure it out but uh unfortunately I don't have better advice than that I want to so I just want to thank Ashley and Mike for um answering these questions these have been some really good questions that you all uh have been asking I think have really helped this conversation uh Mike and Ashley is there a way um our participants can reach out to you all uh if they want to follow up further or have any other questions that they need answered forgivemystudentdeath.org forgivemystudent.org is where all of our information lives about Public service loan forgiveness there's also a huge list of frequently asked questions so every question that Ashley and I have answered today someone's asked this question before they're all on there there are more questions than that on there there's videos explaining all of this and also ways to be able to get help um so I would very strongly encourage you to go to forgivemystudentdef.org and then Ashley's going to give a plug for the student loan Ombudsman at federal student aid I bet well first I'm gonna say ghost una.gov pslf waiver because we have the most up-to-date information and then I'm going to say also you can contact the pslf service or Mohela

so our participants know we are going to follow up tomorrow um in you all's emails with the recording of this uh presentation as well as some resources where um we can uh resources that will help you

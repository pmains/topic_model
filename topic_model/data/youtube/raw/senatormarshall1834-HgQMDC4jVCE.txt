with President Trump being in Argentina for that g20 summit and the fact that he and the Chinese President did reach this 90-day temporary ceasefire to talk about the negotiations on the trade I know your constituents there in Kansas are greatly concerned and affected by the tariff situation what's your reaction to this 90 days and what is your expectation well certainly it's welcome news whether it's a military war we're a trade war any type of de tanta slackening of the bow was welcomed but what we need is something more than just rhetoric in words my old track coach used to talk about don't tell me show me so we need some objective evidence from China we don't need just a one-time order of soybeans we need long-term solutions long-term market access we need these barriers removed we need taina making long-term purchases of milk products of sorghum of ethanol a beef and pork as well wheat so we need long-term solutions not just a short term rhetoric I'm tired for 20 years for I guess for 15 years excuse me China has skirted the WTO rule so we need them to respect the WTO and the trade agreements we know the last time the Chinese made a deal that being about cybersecurity and hacking a couple of years ago with the Obama administration they kept it for about 12 minutes so we'll see if they live up to their agreements on this when congressman Marshall appreciate it thank you very much sir thank you for having me good to see you

one of the most effective ways to protect the United States from radical Islamic terrorism is to keep those with jihadist attitudes as far away from our country as possible in my view that means securing America's borders once and for all and it means fixing a broken visa system that is far too lenient about who gets to come to our country doesn't do a proper vetting process and then on top of that when people overstay their visas our government is not doing enough to send them home it turns out that the San Bernardino bomber the female terrorist entered the United States in 2014 on a fiance visa that may have contained falsified information it's possible that she should have never been allowed to even come to the United States and it's too bad that our government didn't do a better job in that area because maybe 14 Americans would still be alive today it's ridiculous that 14 years after 911 our government hasn't handle these issues we haven't solved these problems in our country is not properly protected my opponent congressman Tim Walz is one of the worst offenders when it comes to securing America's borders he's with Obama and wants open borders Republicans offered bills to put the National Guard in the southern border and force the President to protect our country walls voted no and then when it comes to fixing our visa system and taking people who have overstayed their visas and sending them out of the United States walls is with Obama it wants to grant them amnesty that's just wrong it's time to elect a president who will begin to defend the United States and here in southern Minnesota it's time to elect a new congressman who will protect you every step of the way I'm Jim Hagedorn thanks for watching

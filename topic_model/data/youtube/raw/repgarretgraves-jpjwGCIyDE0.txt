tonight we had a vote on a bill that provided ukraine aid it provided about 40 billion dollars in um in aid to ukraine and um the legislation was just introduced today let me say that again it was 40 billion dollars i've been to ukraine i've been in poland i've spoken to ukrainian refugees and and they deserve help they do they deserve help i strongly believe that the ukrainian refugees the people the military zelinski they deserve our help but to introduce legislation today that spends 40 billion dollars last week they said it was going to be 30 billion today was 40 billion it it provided assistance for housing and humanitarian aid and resettlement assistance and all kinds of things and and look i'll say it again i support providing aid to ukraine but once again we have some of these same exact needs at home right in louisiana the hurricane ida victims are similarly challenged with not having a place to live with the inability to to have food in some cases and an appropriate shelter um and and the federal government has failed and and it's really difficult to to think that we're going to go out and we're going to spend 40 billion on citizens of other countries and not even help our own folks and so i did try and offer amendments to offer three billion dollars in aid to direct three billion dollars in aid to hurricane ida victims and others and and that amendment was rejected we offered an amendment um that would have fully funded all of the duplication of benefit victims those from the 2016 flood and others that remain um out there holding this this bill from the small business administration for a loan we we tried to include that and and the democrats rejected that amendment um the second amendment they rejected the third amendment they rejected was an amendment that said instead of spending all these billions and billions of dollars on new equipment purchases for the ukrainian military why don't we go back into afghanistan where we left billions and billions of dollars of helicopters and tanks and machinery and ammunition go get that back it's ours you paid for it and go bring that to the ukrainian folks and and the ukrainian military and offer that to them and if they need more we can talk about it then and unfortunately that amendment was blocked as well um so ultimately we opposed this 40 billion dollars but it was because they introduced a bill today because it was 10 billion dollars more than they said it was just last week they brought it up without going through any amendment process and they rejected or blocked all of our amendments and i'll say it again i don't know how we continue to treat people in other countries in a way and offering them all this assistance while rejecting uh the the people in in the united states the people in south louisiana that we represent uh preventing or not allowing them to be treated in a fair way as well and so we're going to continue working with the senate and see if we can help to tweak this bill to to be a bit more fair to the citizens of our country with your dollars

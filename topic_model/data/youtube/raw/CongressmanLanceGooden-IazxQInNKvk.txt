joining us right now is house financial services committee member texas congressman lance gooden congressman it's good to see you this morning thanks so much for joining us what is most important in terms of getting the economy back up and running and jobs as the president just referred to well you know this this stimulus package negotiation has so far been a disaster it started a little too late and we're now pushing up against deadlines a lot of things expire at the end of this month which the end of this month is two days away and we've got to get the economy going we can't continue to encourage people to stay home with excessively high unemployment that's one of the top sticking points among republicans in this next package that 600 number needs to be brought down a bit i think democrats privately agree with that because they've not even indicated that that's a red line i i believe they're willing to go down from that six hundred dollars there's talk about stimulus payments another round of the twelve hundred dollar checks that we had a few months ago and we've also got to have liability protections for businesses and schools that are facing lawsuits senator mcconnell has said that it is a non-starter if we can't get a bill passed that has liability protections i think we'll get something done in the next week i'm hearing this could go deep into august but i don't believe that i believe by sometime next week we'll have a package that we'll be voting on it will probably be bigger than any republican would like it to be and smaller than any democrat would like it to me but i believe it'll get done in the first week of august so why has it been such a disaster is it because things got started late or the democrats are just pushing back on on what you and your colleagues are coming up with well the democrats were in a good position uh because about two months ago they just passed a massive bill they let every far left member of their caucus get whatever they wanted into that bill they knew it had no chance of passing they knew it would go nowhere but they passed it so then when we came up to this deadline now they could say see we've passed something months ago and now we're waiting on you all and things just unfortunately happened last minute here on capitol hill the negotiations on the republican side in the senate started last weekend but unlike prior packages there is division among republicans in the senate there's not this sense of let's just swallow this bitter pill of this gigantic bill and move forward we're now in the third and fourth round of this and there is less less excitement about growing the deficit by several trillions of dollars republicans myself included are prepared for nothing to pass if it's going to be a bad bill right understood philip wegman jump in here congressman you mentioned the top line items obviously changing unemployment insurance liability reforms things of that nature a lot of your republican colleagues in the senate seem concerned about the size of the bill and you mentioned that but do you think that your constituents back home um are really concerned about an increase in spending right now for instance are they concerned whether or not the funding for a new fbi building is included or do they just want to see something get to the finish line i think they want to see something good get to the finish line but but they're absolutely concerned about their grandchildren and their grandchildren's children paying for large bills that perhaps uh are larger than they need to be today another common concern i get from small business owners across my district is this unemployment number they say we realize we need to have something but the 600 figure is so high that we can't get some of our employees to come back to work because they make more money sitting at home so we need to pass something that encourages people to work and even privately democrats agree with that it makes no sense i'm sure and and when you're talking about 21 trillion dollars in debt yeah you are gonna have to attack this at some point now with rates where they are i can understand some people's not seeing the urgency but at some point you and your colleagues are going to have to come up with a plan to rein in this spending let me ask you about the president touting u.s energy he is traveling to texas today uh touring an oil rig in midland delivering remarks on america's energy dominance congressman your reaction with oil prices at 41 this morning what is the situation in terms of uh our energy potential well our energy potential is unlimited the reason it's so low is because demand is low we're in a crisis obviously but texas has been leading the way the united states is in such a great position because of president trump's willingness to roll back ridiculous excuse me regulations from the obama years and ensure that we don't need to rely on middle east oil and we're in a great place in texas the president's in midland today i know he has a fundraiser later tonight you know all these these old folks allegedly are hurting but i understand the president's already raised five million dollars for his re-election campaign tonight people are enthusiastic about his race i realized that polling today has the president down the president realizes that but we're also 100 days out if there's one thing that everyone democrats and republicans can agree on it's that anything can happen and no one should be surprised about anything in the final two months of the campaign season so do do you think texas is is purple or is texas still still a red state congressman i think texas is still a red state obviously the economy's down uh people are worried about the future our hope is that democrats pour all of their resources into texas and make that fatal mistake ignore the swing states because they think they have them locked down pour all their money into texas and let's see what happens i'm confident president trump will win big and that we'll we'll be moving forward in a good way and we'll be watching congress good to see you this morning thanks so much

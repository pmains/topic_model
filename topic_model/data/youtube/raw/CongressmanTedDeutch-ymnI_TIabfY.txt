a secretary Schenker you said Iraq is a beachhead I think you referring to Iraq as beachhead and confronting Iranian aggression is that right November is the six-month statutory deadline for extending the order departures and you've got to decide the future of US government presence in Iraq are there are there plans to strengthen the security of the US Embassy in Iraq to enable the return of US personnel or tell me where that stands yeah this has been something I spent a great deal of time on maximally safety and security at diplomatic personnel in Iraq in particular why I don't want to get into the details of how he came to a discussions we think the security at the Embassy is adequate actually better than adequate sufficient for the return of personnel to enable US personnel and the resume be new to accomplish the mission yeah and we've got a number of diplomats that we think is is appropriate and I can brief you about this in another setting okay but yeah we are commissioned I would right I would like to do that if we can arrange that and then finally also on the topic of Iran this time in Syria I think if I understood you you said if we curtail our presence it would be more difficult to to prevent effectively the land bridge that was asked last time I asked about earlier did I understand you correctly and when you say if we curtail our presence if we curtail our presence the way we're doing if we could tell our presence beyond what we're doing what what were you referring to um front a bit basically beyond what we're doing but as ambassador Jeffrey said during I believe during this testimony to you our presence is a stabilizing force and to the degree that we are present it's that's better conditions for the right things to happen in Syria so are you so I'll ask so are you are you confident that the current strategy effectively prevents Iran from establishing that landbridge that that we've this committee in particular has worried so much about I think it complicates the Iranian efforts to do so does the administration assess US efforts to prevent the spread of Iranian influence in Syria and Iraq and Lebanon as successful I'm sorry that gets it's a work in progress in Iraq right now a lot of the inter-communal violence that you're seeing is based on our belief is Iranian overreach because Iran is so enmeshed in the society many c---eight they're like everywhere throughout the region are Shiite nationalist and are pushing back on this and so let me just wrap up again on on this this year issue of the lamb bridge so there how many how many troops are in Tanith ton of not at liberty to say but the withdrawal of troops from northern Syria the withdrawal of try to make sure I understand there's still a residual US presence that goes beyond a tunnel and you're confident that whatever that number is that residual presence is sufficient to prevent Iran from established in the land bridge from Tehran through Baghdad and Damascus over to Beirut I think it plays a positive role and on that front I'm sure some is better than none I'm just asking whether it's a sufficient number to prevent Iran from establishing that I really can't comment

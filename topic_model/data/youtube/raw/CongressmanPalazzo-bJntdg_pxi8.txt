real quick you know something that I like to bring up in these hearings whether it's DoD or Homeland Security is a conversation about the Jones Act are you familiar with the Jones Act I am ok I'm familiar with it I think I've been one of the most outspoken advocates in my 10 years of serving in Congress because I believe it to be truly important to our national security but I'd like to briefly here in your own words why do you why do you think the Jones Act is important well similar tend to protect the Jones Act and not to to weaken it with them with waivers right so obviously the Jones Act there is to make sure that we protect US businesses US interests there that provide those capabilities along the coast to offshore facilities and so we have Jones Act there to protect that I'm a supporter of that strong supporter of that obviously CVP has a role when we talk about waivers to that I think historically CVP has offered very very few waivers if at all and a couple of those are in extraordinary circumstances I know it was during some hurricanes back in 17 I believe it was Harvey that we issued one regarding when the pipeline went down to make sure that we can continue to move refined fuel and elsewhere so I'm what you will find as far as my approach is a believer in the Jones Act CBP has to adjudicate each request for a potential waiver coming in I know CBP did make some definitional changes back in October of nineteen I believe working with industry and I think that was a two-year process so happy to continue to have those discussions to see if there's other tweaks that we need to that need to be made I know they engaged a number of constituents before they rolled that out well thank you and I appreciate your comments I know your predecessors were pretty much on the same note that the Jones Act is vitally important to protect an America's maritime industry and it's extremely important to our national security comments Admirals generals have all agreed with your assessment as well real quick board you know we hear border security is national security that is that is so true I've had the pleasure of serving under five different presidents in uniform as a member of the Reserve or the National Guard and I have to tell you that that this president has three short years he made a commitment to rebuild our military strengthen our nation and and put America first and he has fulfilled and he's fulfilling those commitments and and I think the majority of the American people see that and I think it's kind of a shame that you know if some some of the people on the other side of the aisle would put national security in the American people ahead of partisan politics then he wouldn't have to be in the terms of my colleague from Florida using terms like stealing or robbing from DoD he's putting the net he's putting the American people first he's choosing our national security and he's doing what he thinks is right and I agree with him but I do believe if the others would fund the border security the barriers the technology the boots on the ground as well as our needs for our Department of Defense then we really wouldn't be having this conversation but I do know you were somewhat rudely cut off and if you would like to make any comments to my colleagues her remarks or to mine I would say as you indicated president Trump you will find a bigger supporter of both the military and the men and women at the Department of Homeland Security so that's first and foremost and we certainly thank the president for everything that he does for the department I will say again border security is national security and whether it's building a border wall system understanding and and knowing and vetting who's coming into this country the goods that are coming into this country is a job number one for the department and so whether again we're talking about a border wall system where we're talking about potential travel restrictions that have to reduce the threat or the vulnerability of not understanding who's coming in we talked about the refugee program making sure that we have the right security protocols in place that is job number one for the department and for the administration so again the department's doing all that it's can't all that it can to increase the security understanding who's coming into this country there are vulnerabilities out there that we are addressing through a variety of programs but as I said earlier it's not tagline border security is national security and I'm not sure that you know before this administration that was all that was made abundantly clear but again I think under President Trump he has made that abundantly clear time and again I agree border security as national security it's a no-brainer and I'd like to also say that the morale in our nation's military is it's the highest that I've ever seen it under this president because he is focusing on the men and women in uniform their families as well as fulfilling the commitments to our veterans to make sure that they have the health care that they deserve and that they've earned and so I'd like to also just say you know you have a huge mission secure and in protecting our homeland so thank you for your work and thank you to the tens of thousands of dedicated employees under your watch thank you thank you

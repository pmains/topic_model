a new bill has now passed the u.s house that will remove the 10-year time limit on college tuition assistance for families of fallen and disabled veterans that legislation will also give about 12-hundred dollars a month to be used on education assistance or dea scholarship funding to spouses and dependents of fallen veterans what this legislation does is lift that arbitrary limit like like we did in the post 911 gi bill where there there you know are no time limits on that and so this brings parity with this particular scholarship funding for families of veterans with other similar veteran scholarships that bill is now headed to the senate where it will go through a committee hearing

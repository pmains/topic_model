hey wisconsin this is senator ron johnson and i'm here in kenosha wisconsin today and i'm talking to scott carpenter who is the ceo main guy of b l office furniture a business that unfortunately was burned to the ground in downtown kenosha but they've moved out i guess to the suburbs and we're just kind of want to talk to scott a little bit about what what that day and night was like uh what it was like in kenosha how kenosha's recovered scotty welcome and kind of tell us about what happened on that fateful evening yeah that was uh it was quite interesting um it started out you know the day after the first the day after the first protest and and they were assuming that things were going to ramp up a little bit so they requested that businesses in the local area to maybe close down early you know to get home safely which makes you a little nervous and so we closed the store about three o'clock and um we were sitting there in the showroom just thinking well tomorrow you know we're probably gonna have some glass to clean up and um you know so we left and one went home and uh yeah sure enough you know later in the evening um we're starting to hear reports of uh activity down by the store the again we're getting phone calls that the alarm is going off and so we get on the internet and you can find people you know uh posting videos of what's going on and sure enough we're seeing our store right in front of us with um only a couple busted windows but a little fire burning in the corner and as we sit there watching it you know it just got bigger and bigger and called the fire department to let them know our building's on fire and they said we can't get down there it's too unsafe you know when it's safe we'll get there and um as we sat there and watched it for the next hour it was finally pretty much destroyed you know 70 foot flames shooting through the roof and people walking by and waving their arms and chanting and um it was it was pretty sad at that moment again this was the second night correct yeah this night when there were the shootings and a couple of people lost their lives yeah the third night is when that happened okay so this is the years of the night before that yes yeah okay so tell me a little bit about the history of b l office furniture it's been around for a while right started by your father and your mother yeah yeah my dad started it um and uh with my mother uh she more or less ran it dad had a full-time job and this was just something they did to make some extra money on the side started selling some filing cabinets and some office chairs and out of home in the garage and it was about 40 years ago when they started it and then it slowly developed into a store a small storefront in a mall area and they were there till you know late 80s and purchased the building after that and we were there for about 30 years and that's the building that burned on 11 or 160th street and it's about 10 000 square foot so we had pretty good-sized building there and we were there for a long time a lot of people knew who we were and the community and uh never had a problem down there either it was a great area it was on the parade route so it was always fun on the fourth of july weekends yeah yeah so talk to your mom that was kind of a 90 tears i mean just kind of talk about the emotions you see you know a long-term family business just go up in flames and smoke yeah you know it was tough watching it that night ron i got to tell you it was really tough because you're seeing it happen and you just it's all gone you know and you go you tried to go to bed that night and woke up the next morning and my wife's like you know where are you going and i said well i gotta go down to the store and she's like nothing's there and i said i gotta go see what's going on and i got down there um and i was down there by myself and kind of walked around it and you know it was it was gone and um shortly after my parents showed up i saw them pull up and my mom got out and while i was talking to someone else and also i heard her just bawling in tears and she come walking up to me and gave her a big hug you know she's crying and told it's gonna be okay you know it's gonna be okay and yeah that was tough that was tough a lot of memories there you know we it you don't know how you're going to possibly move forward you lost your building you lost all your inventory you had some personal stuff in there that's gone you know there there wasn't no salvageal nothing was salvageable you know dry there was no roof it was gone so again you're a responsible business owner you did carry insurance even business interruption but it still doesn't cover everything does it no it doesn't cover everything you know we were pretty good about making sure that we had insurance we're reliable for other people's safety and property and when the business you got to make sure you're protected and protecting others employees and things but even so you know it doesn't cover everything you're going to have a lot of loss of time down but you you have to do all the leg work too you know the insurance doesn't just step in and say oh you're covered for this much well here's a check there's some leg work you got to get doing you you got to do some research and and getting your ducks in a row you know it's not that simple and then moving forward got to find a new location got to replace all of your inventory and you know we're an office furniture store and we have stuff you know in stock not to mention happening during a pandemic where places aren't open do for us to you know receive shipments and then factories are not all up and running you know making furniture at that time so it was uh it's kind of like a double whammy you know so how long did it take you just to begin operating again and are you pretty much at full operation now yeah we're full full steam ahead um took us about a month or so to get it you know back opened up we started working on it right away we we had customers that needed taken care of in the meantime so you know we reached out to everybody who we had numbers to and uh emails and let them know hey and you know what happened we're still here we we're moving forward and that's exactly what we did started working out of our warehouse so so so talk a little bit about kenosha before during and after and i'll premise it by saying i remember charles krauthammer conservative writer commentators who since passed gave a speech one time in uh in wisconsin here and he started out the speech you always hear minnesota nice i say wisconsin even nicer i come from minnesota people are nice but i agree with that i mean wisconsinites are just nice people they're common sense they they don't want to hurt people no no so tell me a little bit about kenosha is it is that described kenosha before what happened during and how's kenosha recovering as a community yeah kenosha is a great town you know i grew up here lived here pretty much most my life except when i moved away for a short time and uh then back here raising my family um in the very same area where i grew up at i'm bringing my family there and raised them and and they're bringing you know my family's now grown and they're starting their families there too but yeah the city of kenosha is a great city you know people really rallied around us at that time and that shows you how great of a city it actually is but it's multi-racial multi-ethnic was it really division prior to the shooting of jacob lake no not so much i didn't feel it you know i didn't think so i know that you're going to have that division no matter what somewhere but it wasn't like it was strong it was you know you got people that act up and and don't do the right thing no matter what but as far as the city goes yeah no we didn't really really wasn't like that at all you know we work together we work for each other um but that's it's a great it's a great city so it came as a shock i think to you know other wisconsinites but also to the nation you know you know we saw the the rioting in portland in minneapolis but you know this here's kind of small town kenosha wisconsin it happened here yeah so i mean one of the questions certainly on on a lot of people's minds certainly mine as well i mean were these kenosha residents that rioted um have we determined that at all you know i know for a fact that there was kenosha people involved especially the first night you know they that you may have had some people come from neighboring cities to to get involved uh night too but the first night there wasn't much destruction right no not too much there was a car lot that really took a bed that was the first night yeah the first night night one they they fought with the police um out from the police station in the courthouse area and then they dispersed and set a car a lot on fire which was horrible night two more people came that's when we started seeing license plates from other states um the the people who video that i seen of our building being started on um they were from oregon you know um and there were people from ohio and uh i was told what it was they were traveling through on their way to washington and they were in the chicago area this happened they made a detour and came here you saw me you showed me the picture of the people setting your and yeah i think they were white correct yeah yeah it sure looks like it in the picture um you know it doesn't matter what color they were it just it just doesn't make sense you know none of it made sense i don't know where this serves for you know civil justice you know where does this work for your civil rights but i mean where's my civil rights if that's the case you know didn't we deserve to be protected too and but whatever there certainly was some element of people outside of wisconsin coming in here and participating in those riots at least you know the second and third night yeah definitely was there was there were because there were people who couldn't pronunciate the word kenosha they didn't know how to say it you know you're watching which is actually one of the easier there are some that you know are tough yeah like oconomowoc give them that one or something you know um so talk about kenosha now today uh kenosha today you know we're recovering um you can definitely feel a little tension sometimes you know there's a little uncertainty uh but if you go downtown in the stores that are that are down there the boards are off there may be some boards that are still up but that might be because they those stores are temporarily closed um the activities are going outside you know we we were opened up you know people are eating outside at the restaurants they're they're down there having the harbor market is wide open which is awesome camps are taking place um you know i'm getting goosebumps thinking about because it's like we're finally going to get back to normal so we just pray that that we keep it on that pace and let's work together and and not apart from each other and create this division so kenosha's back i know one thing different about kenosha than some of the other places like portland that went on day after day for day we brought first of all there were sheriff's departments from all over the state that came here and helped to share beth but also national guard troops we got enough manpower here that shut it down oh immediately right yeah if now if that would have happened on night two um because obviously you didn't know what night one was gonna bring but night two had we had what came on night three with the support of the troops the national guard the other sheriff's department they they stepped in i don't believe that kenosha would have been crippled the way it was we wouldn't have lost our business other people wouldn't have lost their businesses quite possibly nobody may have even lost their life at this that because of that because they would have shut it down nobody's going to walk up and light a business on fire with the national guard sitting there in front of them watching them you know they did it because they were going to get away with it we wouldn't be doing this podcast i never would have met you i never even heard of bnl office furniture yeah so yeah and it's sad because people like in portland they just let them go to ruins you know aren't you there for the people these leaders and i just don't get it it just doesn't make sense well listen i certainly appreciate you sharing your story um let's hope it never does happen again let's hope that kenosha is back full strength and continues down a a positive path yeah and thank you sir thank you nice to meet you my pleasure

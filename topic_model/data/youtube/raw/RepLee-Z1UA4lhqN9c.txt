let me thank representative VC for hosting for discussion on president-elect Trump's disturbing nominations and for your commitment to defending civil and human rights for all Americans now more than ever the voices of the CBC are so important in this fight I'd also like to recognize our new chair Cedric Richmond as he takes the helm of the CBC during these very challenging times but I know that under his leadership our caucus will continue to fight in a very strong and aggressive way for equality and justice now the president-elect was to speaker ran one of the most divisive and racially tinged campaigns we've witnessed in modern history since winning the presidency president-elect Donald Trump has nominated individuals to serve in his cabinet providing and proving that he will govern just as he campaigned there's no greater example of this disturbing reality than Senator Jeff Sessions nomination to serve as our country's Attorney General mr. speaker the Justice Department is our best tool for protecting civil and human rights and voting rights by appointing senator sessions to lead this department president-elect Donald Trump is making it clear that he will abandon these fundamental values senator sessions has a long history of opposing civil rights and equality he is called the Voting Rights Act a piece of intrusive legislation he said that the Supreme Court's disastrous decision to gut voting rights was good news for the south and in the 1980s he was rejected from serving as a federal judge due to his blatantly racist comments any one of these statements should be disqualifying but in the proposed bigoted Trump administration frankly I'm not surprised but I'm appalled that the president like would choose such an extreme and divisive figure to serve as Attorney General clearly someone who has publicly displayed prejudice and intolerance is not qualified to serve as the Chiefs as our horsemen officer for our civil rights laws by that standard alone one thing is clear senator sessions is wholly unfair to serve as Attorney General senator sessions has forcefully degraded the LGBT community voted against the Violence Against Women Act and undermine the cornerstone of civil rights movement and the Voting Rights Act his nomination really is a chilling indication how a trump administration intends to govern this country has made tremendous progress in the fight to protect preserve and expand civil rights for all Americans we will not allow a trump administration to drag us back into the past now as the conscience of the Congress the Congressional Black Caucus is a voice for the marginalized our message to the Trump administration and to President Donald Trump is simple a vote to confirm Senator Jeff Sessions is a vote against justice we will fight to protect any row back on civil or human rights we will not be silent I call on all of my colleagues to oppose senator sessions nomination as the United States Attorney General because his history his history disqualifies him for this important position thank you again congressman be

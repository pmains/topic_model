mr. chairman during the committee's February 26th oversight hearing on the administration's family separation policy I entered several documents into the record that were turned over by HHS dealing up dealing detailing a high number of alleged sexual assaults of unaccompanied children in the custody of Orr and since the February 26th hearing I've been attempting to work with Orr to identify changes that need to be made to ensure the safety for unaccompanied children being held at facilities across the country on April 22nd our our assisted in arranging a visit and tour of the homestead facility my second visit to the facility the staff staff was accommodating during my visit tour was extremely informative and following up on the tour director Hayes following up on the tour I sent you a letter on June 7th with several questions and requests for documents I just received a response yesterday evening that my letter had been received I'm grateful for that and that the information was being compiled mr. Chairman I ask unanimous consent to submit my letter dated June 7th to director Hayes for the record that objection thanks mr. chairman I'm director Hayes during my visit to homestead the staff they are confirmed that operating a facility like that cost three times as much as operating a permanent facility and unlike temporary influx facilities permanent facilities are subject to federal state and local laws meant to protect the welfare of children so what I like to know when I ask my letter and what I like you to tell us this morning is whether our RS in the process of finding less expensive alternatives to facilities like homestead for unaccompanied minors and I guess fundamentally the question is is are you in the process of closing the homestead facility thank you for the question congressman I want to first give you my commitment that we will respond that to letter just as quickly man you're welcome sir I will say that in as I mentioned in my testimony I want to thank you and the leadership of the House of Representatives for helping get the Supplemental one of the main priorities of myself assistant secretary Lynn Johnson and secretary Hayes our is to absolutely increase the number of permanent state licensed beds available for receiving of children from Customs and Border Protection at HHS that is something that we are equally committed to at both the political and the career leadership of our our and riveting information in the possibility of homes there providing information on when the homestead temporary facility will be shut down so as of this morning Sarah our census at Homestead is down to 829 we have not designated any additional children to homestead since July 3rd and we are in the process of drawing that down given the higher discharge numbers that we're seeing as well as the lower referrals coming across the board meet great let me ask you let me ask you some questions that I asked in my letter but perhaps you can answer them the homestead facility staff stated that General Dynamics has contracted with the facility to provide sexual abuse training and I had asked for copies of the contract with General Dynamics and details regarding that curriculum is that something that you can provide to us quickly I don't know if I can divide it quickly sir but I'll certainly go back to our team and look in six weeks so it's nuts no it's no longer quickly but if you could help with that I'd appreciate it I will check into that sir also the homestead facility staff informed me that DHS Orr and comprehensive health services include the Prison Rape Elimination Act the prea and other standards in their contract provisions we've been trying to get a copy of the contract between between the government sorry and and comprehensive health services we'd also like to see copies of the sub contracts just to see the extent to which those those requirements are incorporated can we get copies of those contracts I will go back to the department and we will look into that sir if I may just add one thing it's not just GDIT that does some of the oversight there was also federal oversight there a state and local official oversight it's a very broad there is fund approach there is there is that's actually there's state local when they submit to them which gets me to my last question yes sir the homestead facility staff gave me a briefing about the database that keeps track a national database that keeps track of every allegation and serious incident that occurs at that facility throughout the country every facility housing unaccompanied minors it tracks when a staff person is fired it tracks what happens when allegations are made can you provide the committee with information from their database on how many assault cases have resulted in the termination of employee of an employee nationwide how many were resolved in disciplinary actions what disciplinary actions were taken against the staff person and most importantly how many cases of sexual abuse are being investigated in our ongoing nationally we will look at that letter sir and respond as quickly and as we are able I will note for this committees information that there are three different types of sexual misconduct there is inappropriate sexual behavior sexual harassment and sexual abuse and I will note that the number of actual sexual abuse is very small and most often involves children amongst children but we will work to get that right as as I said in our mr. chairman as I said it or last hearing one cases too much 100 percent agrees right and please please don't try to make us feel better by suggesting that sexual harassment is somehow less objectionable that we should tolerate sexual harassment that was not my intention sir we're in agreement

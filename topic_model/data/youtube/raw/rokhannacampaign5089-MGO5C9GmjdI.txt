joining me now is Congressman Mike Honda who represents district 17 in Silicon Valley good to see you good to be here thank you you're running for a ninth term in Congress what would you say from where you sit what is the biggest challenge today facing Silicon Valley I think in Silicon Valley um the two big areas are is some the iniquity and salaries for service workers and I think of the others housing housing is such a big issue in our in our district and are those issues that you as a congress member can do something about well there are rules that we can play enough for instance working with HUD I had our King Castro come down for an extra day to visit our our homeless projects to show that there are variety of ways to address the homelessness of not only veterans but also those others who are in the streets and but I wanted to give them also a document I put together is called the inventory of surplus and underutilized lands to look at that as a possible way of building homes but you also represent of course some of the biggest names in the tech industry Apple Facebook Google is around there as well you represent the innovation economy and yet I hear you saying that your biggest concerns are really sort of low income folks is that going to make the tech industry feel a little bit left out I don't think so because the tech industry is one of the leaders in looking at issues around housing and the inequitable salaries and everything else like that they've led the way to increase salaries of their own staff and also Silicon Valley leadership group has put together a housing trust fund where they're pointing together funds I put some federal monies in there to help people first-time buyers and down payment so everybody's working together it's a district where some say that the future is invented it's in the tomorrow business when you think about all the emerging technology coming out of your district in Silicon Valley generally what excites you I think the possibility of being able to communicate with anybody globally and in a very fraction of a second I guess the I is the collapsing of time and distance allows us to be very efficient what about things like driverless cars and robotics that are replacing people well I think that that's the future and people never thought that we'd replace the horse but we did that so that's just just I think it's acknowledges the next step and how we increase the confidence and the reliability of driverless cars another thing will be the issue so you're running a very contentious race with your challenger ro Khanna and both of you have been running television ads and I want to take a look at one of your ads from your campaign we'll come back and talk about it let's take a look show with a history of shutting down companies and destroying jobs I gotta dig this no wonder Khanna's answer their call for tax breaks for millionaires outsourcing jobs overseas in to see what I can do while refusing to protect Social Security corporate interest get enough face time in Washington we don't need Rokon it dialing it up congressman that ad portrays ro Khanna is being unethical beholden to wall street is that what you believe well it's it's a fact that he's received over four hundred fifty thousand dollars from Wall Street when he's a Wall Street do you mean Wall Street you know people who are involved with the financial aspects of this country people that you know normal people like myself don't use access in terms of or don't seek help from them and to say that he saw one of one of the folks said but in purchase himself one way he is not really forthcoming in the kinds of income that he really does portrayal in that ad there is an Indian looking actor playing ro Khanna in the backseat of that limousine did you have any qualms about that as someone who has faced discrimination in your own past sure I think that the last time he accused me of being racist because he said that there was a red dot on the spur on his picture I didn't have anything to do with that but this one I'll take responsibility for it it's saying any any regrets about it or no I think that that's depicting someone like himself taking money for wherever he got on and this is the idea is that he's taking money from Wall Street and he's saying that he's the people's people in one of his ads your opponent ro Khanna alleges that you and all your time in Congress passed one bill that was to name a post office is that a fair charge and what's your reaction well I did have one bill that changed the name of post office to Gordon Chan and I'm proud of that but the thing about Congress is that it's not only about having a name on a bill is that an accurate characterization though that you have your name on just one bill that part is accurate but what we do as congressional members is a lot of other things too and you know we work on different projects different bills and we get those things done so you know with the results that have had over the past 16 years brought in almost a billion dollars worth of revenue and all kinds of other kinds of programs that affect education nonprofits Silicon Valley you're facing your own investigation and questions about ethics the house ethics committee is investigating they voted unanimously to investigate and there are questions about you giving favors to hide owners for things like expediting visas and that sort of thing what's your reaction is not the kind of thing people that you're sort of accusing him about it favoring the rich well it's of the ethics saw issue is what of house rules whether we had violated our house rules in order to adjust I did two things want to let the people know that I made a decision that nobody on our official staff will be participate but there was the conclusion of the report found that there was substantial reason to think that you done right the conclusion reports pass it on to the house Congressional Ethics Committee which is the real community that really takes all their information and they're moving through right now so we're cooperating with them one hundred percent and we're not saying that we're just waiting for the outcome all right the charge I have against my own my own opponent he behaves differently alright and we're going to get a chance to talk with ro Khanna necks but thank you very much for coming

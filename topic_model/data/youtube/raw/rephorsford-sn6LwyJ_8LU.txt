yeah it's possible she's on there it's well did I tell them to change it's horseford Kelly Lisa mcbath foreign [Music] well good afternoon everybody I'm Stephen Horsford from the great state of Nevada 4th congressional district and I very proud uh sponsor of to break the cycle of violence act and I'm proud that it has passed the house 220 to 207 and it is one of four Public Safety bills that were passed today by the House of Representatives that are about reducing crime saving lives and breaking the cycle of violence and I want to personally thank my colleagues congresswoman Robin Kelly Lucy McBeth congresswoman Lisa blunt Rochester and Congressman Joe nagoos for your just unwavering support in making sure that we were able to get uh to this Victory um you know this has been a lot of work uh to ensure that this bill was not left out that the communities that benefit from the community violence intervention funding of over 5 billion dollars over eight years and the 1.5 billion dollars for investment in Opportunity youth that congresswoman Lisa blunt Rochester uh helped to advance I am just so honored and proud to work with all of you and to Senator Corey Booker who is the sponsor in the Senate and of course our chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus Joyce Beatty who was involved in a round-the-clock negotiations over the last few days to ensure that the vote happened that we had the boats to pass the rule and that all four bills moved forward and they did I just want to say that you know crime and violence they don't happen in a vacuum and for for a lot of times we tend to focus on the events after the crime occurs and this legislation is all about doing the hard but necessary work to prevent crimes from happening at all and to stop those crimes from happening in the communities uh that are disproportionately affected um and the work of the organizations um who have led this from the community Justice action fund to Brady to every town to Giffords uh and definitely to the CBI programs like Safe Streets Baltimore who are here I want to say thank you because you exemplify the best of our communities and what it is we're doing which is Saving Lives reducing crime and breaking the cycle of violence I'll just close by saying you know it's personal because uh when I was 19 years old my father was shot and killed when I was a freshman in college I didn't get a chance to say goodbye or to have the opportunity for him to see me graduate from school children to go on to work in my community running non-profit organizations and now to be a member of Congress but to be here to cast such an important significant vote it is an honor not only to my father but to every other family that has lost a loved one to senseless gun violence or any type of violence in our communities but this is not about the pain this is about the opportunity and I want us to focus on the investment in people that is going to create the hope and the aspirations that every person grows up with they just need that chance to get their purpose someone gave me that chance that's why I am standing here today and that is why I am so honored uh to have played a role in getting this legislation over the victory line and we will continue to work and fight uh to keep our communities safe to reduce crime to save lives and to break the cycle of violence and with that I'm going to turn it over to congresswoman uh Robin Kelly my sister from Chicago who is uh just I'll just say from the standpoint I called her in December of 2021 after reading about the amount of violence that had occurred in her City in just one weekend and I said Robin what can I do to help you in your community and what can we do together to make sure that we can break the cycle of violence and I just want to thank you for the work you do because every single day people die and they're not always talked about but they're but they're being remembered by us in this legislation Robin Kelly thank you so much Steve and you have really turned uh pain into passion so proud to be standing alongside you Lucy Macbeth Lisa blunt Rochester and Cory Booker in the Senate because we've done good and we've done so with your leadership and when you think about it we haven't passed a gun violence prevention or any positive gun bill in 30 years and to think you know we just passed the major package 10 days ago or whatever it was and now we pass a major package today so I'm so proud to have been a part of it and I forgot about when Stephen called me that Saturday afternoon when I was trying to relax and he said what are we going to do and I said we're gonna we're gonna do we're gonna have a meeting and then we had a meeting and and just and this is what has happened from all of this from all of my work and all of their hard work and uh this shows that prevention really counts when I think about all the moms that I deal with every week in Chicago that have lost their kids and they're wondering do people still care this is sending a message to them that yes people still care and I operate under the Mantra that we all do better when we all do better and this legislation will help us all do better so I'm so proud to be here um couldn't be with a better group of colleagues for all of their efforts and work and love each and every one of them and all the Advocates standing behind us we couldn't do it without you we could not do it without you you are definitely the wind beneath our wings and above our wings too so with that I'd like to turn it over to my colleague from Delaware Lisa blunt Rochester okay can we do wow I know I know I'm like um I I want to first start off by thanking um Stephen Horsford for your leadership um you know the incredible thing for me is that I get to work with these incredible individuals I don't know if Robin had to catch her plane but has been on the Forefront um before I even got to Congress and Lucy who came after I got to Congress and just kind of picked up the ball and ran and I think what it what it really typifies and what it really symbolizes is that one of us alone can't get these kinds of things done it is truly the collective of all of us and what's so special about break the cycle of violence in this legislation is that it is um not just some pie in the sky idea that somebody had it is truly based on evidence-based best practices it is based on what we heard from that did I hear a clap on the evidence base yeah right right this is like it's evidence-based and it's also from the people the ones who are most impacted ones who are closest to it and can tell us what really works and so I'm just happy to be a part of it I'm glad that our team was able as the former Secretary of Labor in Delaware we know how important opportunities are for young people as well to make sure that they don't turn or be distracted or pulled into a life of violence we want to give them opportunity so the impact grants getting that in was really important to us because again we want to get the money to where the people are so that they can make the change that they need to see so I am grateful to be a part of this um Stephen knows look I was just talking to Lucy as well I always quote a Beyonce song at these things and and the last one was you we might have had lemonade at one point the last one was you won't break our soul and that's exactly why today I'm so excited that we are standing here because we recognize that the only way we win is when when we put Love on Top I'ma turn it now to Lucy McBeth the champion the congresswoman from the great state of Georgia well I couldn't be more pleased to be here and I had a whole script but I'm just going to speak from my heart as my colleagues have done I could not be more proud to stand here with our leader representative Stephen horseford my good friend and Ally Lisa blunt Rochester and my friend that even before I came to Congress Robin Kelly and all of our Community Partners who have been on the front lines in our communities fighting for safer neighborhoods thank you thank you thank you thank you and you know everyone knows my story everyone knows how and why I've come to Congress so I won't go and I won't recount that story but I say thank you for Jordan and I say thank you for Trayvon and I say thank you for a mod Aubry I say thank you for every young black man and woman every individual in our country that has been under under the assault of unnecessary gun violence this is an answer today what we are doing today is an answer we are addressing the social determinants within the communities that need the help the most we're addressing these social determinants we're making sure that they have the resources and the tools and the means that these organizations will have the resources to be able to combat governments violence at its core to detect what you see happening all across our communities all across this great nation so I am so grateful to each and every one of our partners and thank you for those of you that are on the ground each and every single day you make a difference don't stop we need your voices and as we understand and know that the policy that we're able to pass here in Washington it doesn't start from the top down it stops it starts from the bottom up and these are the partners these are the voices that we need to make sure that everyone can live in America safely without unfettered access to violence but once again on behalf of my son Jordan I say thank you Lucy and we've also been joined by congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee who is also the chair of the subcommittee on uh crime and Justice that oversees uh the jurisdiction where a number of these bills went through I want to thank her for her leadership and making sure that these bills remained a priority with the Judiciary Committee and the package that was been done and all the other work that you've done we stand on your shoulders and others in our caucus who have made these issues a priority for a long time congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee I'm honored to stand here with champions for too long victims of crime have felt both lost and lonely the United States Congress has had a reformational change when Lucy Macbeth and Steve horsewood came to the grounds of this place they began to establish the sacredness of realizing that we cannot continue to do nothing and so I wanted to come to let them know that the powerful voices that they have offered through personal stories have been a seismic change on the thinking of the Congress and the White House along with their colleague and friend Lisa blunt Rochester who is a co-sponsor of this legislation all co-sponsors as we have supported the idea and now the mechanism of intervening on violence rather than leaving victims in the Trashy of life wondering does anyone care can anyone stop the violence as Congressman Horford said to me on the floor we want to stop bending over caskets and we want to stop the violence we want to prevent it before it starts 1.5 billion dollars for training of people to know how to intervene to know how to stop the 12 midnight cycle of gun violence in the dark of night or just sheer what we call in our communities the breaking in of houses when people are in them scaring families together and causing a massive loss of life or Taking Lives senselessly or as I was at a community event just getting out of the car and a gang started a gun fight a few feet from me in the street in the neighborhood hearing the gunfire being thrown to the ground because no one knew where it was and let me be very clear Congressman Horsford I had my seven-year-old grandchild because you know how difficult it is to spend time with family so on a public event that I was going to it had children there and I said let me take my grandchild today we both were thrown to the ground but what disturbs me most the impact on other people the impact if you will on a mother who called the police I set it on the floor it was 2 A.M in the morning her husband and child had left allegedly for some purpose of go to a store or some meet up sad to say and she called the police about mid-morning when I say that I'm talking about like in the night 3 A.M I can't find my husband and I can't find my baby in the car seat the husband was found dead at one spot and the car was found in another spot and the toddler was dead 1.5 billion and 5 billion for Community grants I don't know what we could imagine today victims legislation training legislation mental health legislation but the legislation that is a crowning Jewel is the one that says America can do better and we can do better by insisting that violence stops in America whether it's rural or Urban or it is any jurisdiction that you may have I'm ready to go I'm ready for this bill to be signed by the president of the United States and for these grants to come out and for victims and for people and for young people to finally put down the gun and say there's something else to my life I can do something else I'm putting the gun down because Stephen horseford cared Lucy Macbeth cared I joined them in carrying the Democrats joined them in caring uh and we hope that some good thinking people on both sides of y'all recognize that the only way America is going to come to our highest values is when we put down the gun stop the violence and begin to embrace a light of brightness in the future I want to thank you Congressman horseford for your courage and all of the community Justice allies for their courage as well this couldn't be a better day congratulations to you thank you let me just introduce and bring to the podium a phenomenal organizer who's making sure that communities that are impacted in the people who know best how to work with law enforcement with the faith community with non-profits who have the answer to bring the people closest to the pain into the solution Greg Jackson with the community Justice action fund the leadership of the CBI programs across the country thank you that was the best intro ever uh that means a lot um [Music] uh the cycle of violence is something that is frankly destroying our democracy uh destroying our country traumatizing our communities but uh most importantly is breaking the hearts of too many families right now the cycle of gun violence is the number one cause of premature death for black men for all youth the number two cause for black women and the number two cause for Latino men but this is also costing our economy 557 billion dollars every single year and the worst toll of all is that every year over a hundred thousand people are shot or killed by gun violence but this is more uh than stats this same cycle is one that that costs uh representative horseford his father representative at bath her son representative Sheila Jackson Lee and representative uh Kelly excuse me uh their families and communities but it also took the brother of Corey Winfield who stands behind us it took the life of one of my mentees karon brown it took the life of a family friend of ours Trey in Greensboro North Carolina in that same cycle nearly took my life in April of 2013. and that was less than a mile from here less than a mile where the power to break that cycle existed but today we're excited because this is the largest step in American history to break in that cycle of violence 1.5 billion dollars for strategic Workforce programs five billion dollars for violence intervention programs the creation of an office of community violence to lead accountability Innovation and assistance of those who are putting their lives on the line every single day but this step would not happen if it wasn't for the thousands of activists the thousands of leaders of survivors and I got a name drop a few folks the fun peace movement with Erica Ford Dr Chico Amber Goodwin our founder Pastor Mike mcbray bride Arissa Napper Williams Marcus McAllister Dr Antonio City L Dr Shawnee Buggs Anthony Smith Mike de la Rocha Devon and so many others also the invest in US Coalition made up of national organizations from Brady Giffords every town March for our lives Newtown Amnesty International equality Justice color of change NAACP and so many national groups that stood with this and we've been working on this for years years y'all but most importantly this would not happen without the leadership of our members of Congress standing behind us and not just any type of members of Congress these are survivors of gun violence that led the charge and so from the communities in need of justice peace healing and intervention we just want to thank you so much thank all of you for all that you've done and we know most importantly that when survivors are empowered to lead whether that's in the community or in the halls of Congress that we can achieve change so we thank you we thank you for your leadership and we thank you for all the lives that you have saved by making this stride today but that said I want to turn it over to an amazing Ally Angela Pharrell zabala from every town for gun safety thank you thank you thank you I'm Angela Pharrell zabala the senior vice president of movement building at every town for gun safety and Mom is a man action um it's an honor to join gun safety Champions like representative Horsford Macbeth Kelly Rochester Jackson Lee everyone here with us today to celebrate this historic action by the house to pass the break the cycle of violence Act in memory of all the folks and the lives that were taken from us today and also the more than 40 000 Americans lost the gun violence every year and the countless others who are shot and wounded make no mistake about it today's passage is important step forward for the gun violence prevention movement Community gun violence disproportionately impacts black and brown communities and is concentrated in cities with just 127 cities that for more than half of our nation's gun violence and homicides with cities Nationwide experiencing 34 jump and gun homicide in 2020 and persistence gun violence ever since fortunately community-based violence Interruption programs have been working in these cities for decades leveraging their earned trust and credibility to ensure Public Safety within their communities we get evidence-informed strategies strategies which have proven effective at targeting the people and places that drive our gun violence with a public health approach like Street Outreach hospital-based violence intervention programs place-based strategies that create safe and healthy spaces and other community-led and Community Center efforts and Greg shouted out so many people and I would if I try to sit here and and give all the things I would certainly miss miss people but I want to thank Greg and Community Justice action fund Erica Ford Pastor Mike and others who have been on the Forefront of this work for decades and really really I'm thinking about all the work and invest in US Coalition thank you Greg and others for your leadership we are grateful and we're grateful to San Congressman Horsford when he introduced the break the cycle a violence act last year an acknowledgment of these incredible life-saving initiatives in a very urgent hope of sustaining and scaling them Across the Nation to every community in need in this very urgent moment and today we're thrilled to celebrate this important moment as I break the cycle of violence act officially passed the house this will deliver 5 billion in dedicated funding for evidence-informed community-based violence intervention programs working to reduce gun violence and our most vulnerable communities and a new 1.5 billion Federal grant program for year-round job training and Workforce Development and communities disproportionately impacted by gun violence and would make a significant impact and provide much needed support to communities most heavily affected by gun violence in the wake of uh breaking a nearly 30-year Log Jam in Congress earlier this summer with a bipartisan safer communities act and today's meaningful passage in the house we continue on the path to progress to help to ensure a safer future for generations to come we'll still have a lot of work to do don't get me wrong there's still much to do but with today's passage we have a big step that we're taking and getting closer to treating gun violence as a Public Health crisis that it truly is and turning the tide and gun violence in America thanks to all the leaders and the invest in US Coalition and their leadership in inspiring this path forward thank you so much and with that I'd love to bring adzy bokiwa from Giffords thank you so much to representative Horsford Hopson Macbeth Kelly and Jackson Lee as well as a council and Rochester and all the survivors of gun violence who are here today my name is the federal Affairs director at Giffords and it's an honor to be with you all today celebrating the passage of the break the cycle of violence Act last June many of us gathered right here in this very spot for the introduction of the break the cycle of violence Act and since then this Coalition of Advocates survivors and members of Congress has made it our mission to make sure that the people in our communities who are putting their lives on the line to stop gun violence have the financial support they need to do their life-saving work now that the house has passed this bill to provide a historic 5 billion dollar investment in violence intervention programs our mission is one giant step closer to being realized we know all too well that gun violence is an epidemic that takes more than 41 000 lives every year and that epidemic will only end with the comprehensive Community involved whole of government public health approach that the break the cycle of violence act supports five billion dollars for evidence-informed violence intervention programs an additional 1.5 billion dollars for youth Workforce training as well as the creation of a new office of community violence intervention violence intervention programs work but only when they're properly funded and implemented but even without that adequate funding leaders in black and brown communities have consistently given their time efforts and sometimes even their lives to save others the historic Federal funding in this bill will provide these dedicated Outreach workers the resources they require and deserve for their life-saving work this funding will help more cities across the country adopt CVI programs stop gun violence before it ever happens and reverse the dangerous increase in homicides many of our cities have seen over the past few years passing this bill is one of the most significant steps forward we can take to end gun violence so I want to thank all of the members of Congress here today for their support of the bill all 220 members who voted to pass the bill and especially want to thank these members in particular for their years-long advocacy to end gun violence and now it's up to the Senate we ask the Senate to pass this bill as soon as possible thank you sorry I went to oh we have two more speakers uh next we'll introduce Kelly Sampson from Brady foreign good afternoon everyone I'm Kelly Sampson and I'm senior counsel and director of racial Justice at Brady one of the nation's oldest gun violence convention groups and on behalf of my colleagues I want to thank Congressman Horsford for his leadership congresswoman mcbath for her Fierce passion about this issue all the members who voted today more than one in five Americans report that they or someone close to them has had a direct experience with gun violence so it's true that the gun violence epidemic hurts everyone but gun violence is toll on black and brown communities is staggering the gun homicide rate for Hispanics which is the term the data uses is more than double that of white Americans meanwhile black Americans are more than 11 times more likely than white Americans to die by gun homicide which accounts for a four-year reduction in life expectancy for black men many were shocked to learn that gun violence is now the leading cause of death for all children Nationwide but it's long been the leading cause of death for black children and teens who are 14 times more likely than white children to die by gun homicide these disparities are not inevitable the overwhelming share of gun homicides occur in urban communities that systemic racism has segregated oppressed and disenfranchised for decades this couple with easy access to Firearms leads to devastating results being shot shot at or witnessing a shooting doubles the probability that a young person will commit violence in the next two years indeed experiencing violence dramatically increases the risk that the victim may become a perpetrator and the repercussions in black and brown communities reverberate well beyond the victims themselves that's why cycles of generational poverty daily gun violence and retaliation benefit from Community intervention the pervasive nature of gun violence produces Collective trauma and communities burdened by fear and constant shootings must divert their already limited resources for fighting for basic safety rather than investing in education Economic Opportunity and general quality of life Beyond The Staggering toll of human gun violence communities that experience higher levels also face enormous Financial burdens through depopulation decreased commercial activity decreased property values and fewer jobs moreover a single homicide on average cost American taxpayers nearly half a million dollars in direct medical and criminal legal expenses deterring violence and preserving the economic stability of communities thus go hand in hand the break the cycle of violence act will work directly to address these issues by providing historical investments in communities most impacted by cycles of violence and Trauma by taking a public health approach and investing in evidence-based programs we can not only alleviate the daily toll of gun violence but we can also begin to undo years of disinvestment and economic Injustice in the most impacted communities so once again my colleagues and I are so grateful to the members who have put so much effort into passing this bill and now I will pass it over to Corey Winfield from Safe Streets Baltimore all right this this person deserves a big introduction uh so I'm gonna do my best but this money means nothing if it doesn't get to the organizations that are working hard to save lives every day uh every conflict that we've seen in our communities could have been prevented only 30 percent of homicides in the black community are connected to another felony only 11 percent of homicides are connected to gang violence the bulk of gun violence in our communities are interpersonal conflicts that just go too far and we have leaders in our communities that are working hard every day to intervene those conflicts and prevent violence from happening and save lives and they're saving lives every day right now they're saving lives but they're under-resourced under-supported and underfunded and this brother right here when he put his life on the line to start doing violence intervention he was getting paid 11 an hour risking his life every day for 11 an hour because he cared about saving his community and so I'm just extremely proud and honored to introduce Corey Winfield from Safe Streets Baltimore to share more about this life-saving work and what this means for America and for communities today thank you [Applause] thank you um first one this is a touching moment for me um 2006. I've released from Prince from prison after doing over 22 decades six days after I was home my little brother was gunned down in front of our house shot twice in the back twice in the back of the head and two days before that he told me about the altercation that he had with a young man that lived down the street or the basketball game a year before and I blew it off because to me at that time a fight we had countless of fights in the neighborhood but I'm still thinking 20 years ago until we got that call that he was laying in front of our house riddled with bullets it rocked me and it crushed my family and actually sent me back on the verge of going back to prison I wanted to kill the person who killed my brother I seeked out to do that my mother stopped me after a week of me going out every night searching for this person I came in the house two in the morning she tells me please stop I know what you doing I can't lose another baby [Music] we sit on that sofa and cried I've never cried so when I tell you that this means something thank you [Applause] because we did not know where to go I didn't know where to turn [Music] we didn't have a safe streets program at that time we didn't have a gang Intervention Program at that time all I knew is I had to do something because I had to say the next little brother [Music] so when Greg talks about I was making eleven dollars an hour I was 11.23 and I was standing in front of guns every night refusing to move AK-47s pointed at me it's one two o'clock in the morning and the police ain't around it's just me and four or five people and everybody got guns out and they telling me to get the hell out the way and I'm saying no we gonna talk this out let's find a way to resolve this issue and when I get down to the issue it's about I don't like how he looked at me all young black men are dying in these streets because of a look because a step on the shoe you don't know the outcome of that a pastor told me the other day he said man they so disrespectful I was talking to me looking all around I said no sir I said that's respect because in that world looking a man a person eye to eye I get your brains blown up the abnormal is the normal in the black community today that's what's going on in these streets and today we have saved a lot of lives by the passions of this bill [Music] today we are going to make sure that we have bodies out there on the corners on the street corners going door to door addressing issues as they happen I have got up six in the morning five in the morning and stood on bus stops so mothers can go to work because of fear of retaliation because of what their son have done or what their nephew have done in the world came we gonna get your mother [Music] that's what this bill is for that's the prevention that we're talking about that does not get captured on the news me making sure that she can get to work because she said Corey I just started the job I can't take off I said don't worry imma be that [Music] and we watched the car go down the street three times but because I was standing there they kept going and she was dead scared I had to ride all the way to work with her that's the intervention that we're talking about that's the saving the lives that we're talking about so for the first time and yes when I thought it wasn't no hope and I wouldn't give up I kept getting up going to work I kept that I used to wear this shirt so much my girlfriend said I see you in another safe Street shirt but the message had to be told it hasn't been out there gang members called my phone and asked me to settle disputes we have the opportunity of employing people young men and women that can defuse detect situations and intervene and stop gun violence right now in Baltimore City we are over 200 and 50s so are murders and we have 10 sites and I'm gonna tell you that if we didn't have those 10 sites we would probably be at 400 right now so this will make sure that we can get more people and more sites so I can train them and get them out there because their little brothers are dying so when I before I leave I want to say this to everybody that's watching this that promise that you make your loved ones before you leave the house and I'll see you later this bill is going to help me make sure you keep that [Music] there's no better way to end the press conference than those words Corey and you just bring to Heart the real meaning behind this policy and and the lives that it can change and the impact that it can make and we want you know thousands of more quarries all across the country who are trained in this evidence-based uh approach to prevent and intervene on violence not only gun violence but any form of violence so again I just want to thank my colleagues thank all the gun violence prevention groups this was one of four bills um that was passed today by the House of Representatives it builds on the work that we passed in the bipartisan safer communities act where we did invest 250 million dollars in community violence intervention this bill uh goes further with five billion dollars and 1.5 billion to help make sure opportunity youth 16 to 14 24 are also a big part of the solution going forward so thank you for joining us let's go out get the work done and I appreciate everyone being here today God bless you

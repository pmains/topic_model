the Trump administration has told States they have to source equipment on their own that then obstructs them from procuring it on a scale of Wall Street bailout to Tom cotton salary how big a waste of taxpayer money is having States bid on PPE oh this is beyond a waste of money having different states and sometimes medical centers bidding against each other so that the price of a mask that used to be 40 cents goes up to $4 or $15 just means states are shelling out money like crazy money that they don't have to try to protect their people and at the same time who's raking it all in a profit here some kind of manufacturer that is nuts why is being the worst at coronavirus response the thing that we have to be the best at I know I know which is why the 2020 election is so important problem is coronavirus isn't just making toilet paper harder to find it's also making voting harder what is your plan for making sure we can all vote in November because that feels critical yeah really important no I see the election in Wisconsin as sounding an alarm and we all better wake up and put in place procedures so that every American citizen has access to voting without having to make trade-offs about whether it's good for their health or not so here's what I propose here's my plan of course you have a plan of course you always had a plan every state should be required to send a ballot and a postage prepaid envelope to every registered voter in addition people should be able to register online and registration periods should be extended while you're on the campaign trail I didn't get a chance to take a selfie with you but would you take a selfie with me right now  okay let's do it okay thank you so much

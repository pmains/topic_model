so what's going on with the Republican party right now joining me is uh from Baton Rouge is Republican senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana Senator Cassidy it is uh good to see you uh after the election so let me just start with that what did you learn from this election I learned that the American people want a way forward that actually focuses on ideas ideas that will make their lives better not just their lives but that for future Generations those who are most closely aligned with the former president did underperformed uh those who are talking about the future who have managed their states well they over performed the American people want ideas they want a future uh it sounds like you just blamed Donald Trump for the lot for for the Senate at least is that fair no I'm looking at it empirically those that were most closely aligned with the past those are the ones that underperformed we as a party need to have a debate about ideas in that debate we need to explain to the American people uh exactly where we think our country should go and by the way since I think since I think using Market forces to make the individual's life more free more prosperous is the way to go I think we win that debate you know it's interesting you have not been shy about your criticism of Donald Trump you voted to convict him uh after January 6. um when you look at your vote and you look at the votes of some of your colleagues that I we know were thinking about it but decided not to in hindsight how big of a mistake was it not to convict Trump when you had the chance I can't speak to that again that's more of a focus upon the past the American people wish to have a discussion about the future I think they really want to air out ideas as to okay which party has better ideas I'm an ideas guy I welcome that debate I think our party should be pointing to the future I think our country should be and I think that's the only way we give the American voter that that which she or he deserves you know it's interesting there was a bit of a debate between the head of the Senate Campaign Committee Rick Scott and the and the Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell about should the Republicans offer up an agenda to run on uh now Rick Scott offered up something that not every Republican was happy about Mitch McConnell said we'll wait till after the election so where do you sit on that debate we are after the election we've got big problems in our country the degree that both parties duck these big problems is the degree that the voter says pox on both their houses so let's have a debate about the domestic issues about the foreign issues and then let's Implement we've got to get some things done by the way Chuck I think I can say this with some credibility since I have been involved or Eastern frankly either in the mix or leading on issues to to limit surprise medical billing the lower the cost of prescription drugs to do the bipartisan infrastructure bill we can get things done we need to get them done and that's I think what the American voter is looking for you think it's time for a change in leadership among Senate Republicans do you think it's time for Senator McConnell to step down you know I'm actually going to support Mitch I think Mitch kind of pulled the chestnuts out of the fire for candidates who for whatever reason were having a difficult time raising the money that that as you pointed out was required to have a winning campaign and I think um uh uh going forward Mitch will be our leader but that is not to say that we're not going to have a necessary debate about ideas and I think it's it's very again one more time important for us to explain to the American voter why Republicans have a better vision for the future of our country I guess I asked this if if this is the result of these elections but the Republican party still has sort of the same leadership at RNC Ronald McDaniel Kevin McCarthy of House Republicans Mitch McConnell of Senate Republicans and of course Donald Trump is sort of the the leader out there if there's no change there um do you think that's a problem for Republicans going forward first we're not a cult we're not like okay there's one person who leads our party if we have a sitting president she or he will be the leader of our party but we should be a party of ideas and principles and that's what should lead us and I will go back what we've been lacking perhaps is that this that fulsome discussion followed up with the policy initiatives that we worked to pass that will Define who we are again we are not going to have one person anointed uh unless she or he happens to be a sitting President we should have a set of principles and ideas and legislative accomplishments that is our load star if you will that's where we need to go I understand that's where you should go how do you get the party there because you know how hard it is you know the base of this party still loves Donald Trump or do you think that this this midterm could break that spell you know elections are about winning and so if folks want to look at these election results and decide that's where you want us to continue to be then then we're not going to do well if people are going to look at these election results and say Hey listen the Republicans have established themselves ourselves as the anti-woke brand we care about being anti-woke now let's have a series of policy initiatives that actually help people's lives get better I can point to the examples I mentioned earlier that I've been involved with surprise medical billing that legislation has prevented about 11 million surprise medical bills in this year since it was signed into law in January that's fantastic similarly we can go to the the bipartisan infrastructure bill which was uh led by the Senate with with Republicans fully engaged in making sure that the average American for example has access to high-speed affordable internet we can look at those legislative accomplishments get them done build the credibility so that next time next election people decide to vote Republican look Donald Trump's announcing his candidacy for president on Tuesday whether anybody wants him to or not when we understand people have tried to get him to postpone this decision he's not going to do that are you at all concerned that his just mere presence is just going to make it that much harder for Republicans to recover you know we have to be a party about the future and so if we're talking about the future of the American voter she'll make her choice uh and so and if we have results that show these are our ideas now if the left frustrates our our efforts well that will be part of what we will discuss but we just have to make that case I think you see for example a governor like Governor Devine in Ohio who who Who's governed extremely well given an example of putting forward policies that make this people in Ohio's lives better and he had an incredible Victory and we can go around the country and see that so that so if we have a track record if we have the ideas then we will appeal to that voter talking about the future I I look I understand that and I know where you're trying to head here but Donald Trump doesn't want to head in the direction you want to head how do you stop that direction what do you do do you rally around is it time to Rally around Rhonda Sanchez Now by offering an alternate by offering an alternative again the Republican Party should be the party of ideas and principles I think I have attempted to live my political life that way principles ideas that will work to make the American people's lives better who is our next nominee will sort itself out but we have to appeal to those within our party and without our party if we are going to win and they're going to respond to a positive message which says this is how our ideas will make your life better now we should welcome that debate I do I try and live my life with principles and ideas and and and if we do that then we will win can you imagine having to support Donald Trump again if he's the nominee of your party our party should be about the future I think our next candidate will be looking to the Future not to the past and I think our next candidate will win uh and so I anticipate supporting a candidate who's looking to the Future and in fact candidates Donald Trump do you plan on supporting that candidate um you're giving me a theoretical which actually I don't think will come to transpire because we have to be looking to the Future and so you can give me a theoretical after a theoretical okay I will say we should be a party of ideas and principles I welcome that I've tried to live my life that way and I think our next candidate will similarly embody that perspective all right Senator Bill Cassidy republican from Louisiana uh thanks for coming on and sharing your perspective with us appreciate it

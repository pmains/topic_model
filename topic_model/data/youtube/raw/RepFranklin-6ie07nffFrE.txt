thank you mr chairman and i appreciate our witnesses being here today um as a former naval aviator that spent more time than i care to remember in mop gear and uh and now here in congress reading about the threat and understanding how significant it is uh i used to always just the value in those exercises to me was just praying to god that it never happened but you all don't have that luxury you've got to deal with it and it's a very real threat that i fear uh too often is back burned it doesn't get the attention it needs and i know it's not the only things that you have on your plates but it's it's vitally important and if it ever happens it'll probably be one of the worst things that's ever happened to the united states but i do have a a couple of questions and admiral green you and i have had some conversations about the the uh the authorities and helping me understand how all of this shakes out because it's a very complex problem set but i understand socom's coordinating authority on the front end i am curious though who would be the coordinating authority in the event in an actual event after the fact well the coordinating authority does not command it doesn't convene it it recommends so i understand on your end it's it's all it's preparation of you know coordinating the operational plans it's it's helping with the strategies but if if all that fails and we find ourselves with an actual event who who is then and responsible because it seems very complex to me as to who takes charge then yeah i would say simply it's the combatant commanders i mean they execute uh the campaigning day in and day out and they own the the contingency plans and the op plans as we speak general walters owns the ucom aor so this venue the the coordinating authority simply tries to support an understanding of the threat identifying resourcing gaps and then making recommendations across policy uh and enforce provider issues but ultimately it's the combatant commanders okay so so if we had a contaminated environment obviously the the co-com is going to have to execute the battle plan and keep going forward but but how do we go about who coordinates the mitigation efforts to allow them to continue to move forward and whoever might want to answer that it's just i have a hard time understanding how it how it unfolds after the fact so that that would be done um actually on the ground operationally um but by the total by the joint force right there so if you were to have a contaminated environment on say a logistics or a flow-through base that the united states or its allies were using and were they to be contaminated the forces immediately there on the base would be dealing with the decamp the excuse me the to d sorry decontaminate i apologize um that area and the equipment in order for the force to be able to continue to proceed with this mission okay um we saw with great success i think uh during this code pandemic with operation warp speed what dod collaboration with dhs has been able to do i'm interested to know you know what lessons we've learned from that how we're going to perpetuate that going forward so that we can be prepared for future things and then also you know as we deal with adversaries like russia and china where companies are either state-owned or at least sponsored and there's that collaborative effort just by design of how their governments function they're working together in a lot of cross-purpose type technologies how are we and how can we better work with not only our other government agencies like dhs but but on the civilian side with our pharmaceutical companies with our biomedical research you know what are we doing to to get better at that thanks congressman on the on on the first part about the of your question about how the pandemic has given us some lessons learned i think on the highest level the takeaway is the department can't afford to think about bio threats as a nation-state battlefield weapon and has to include pandemic preparedness as well as uh specific agent design preparedness and so the bio posture review that we're undertaking by defense posture review is is is looking at this from a whole spectrum to include that part and i think that's a big that that's a big lesson that we've all i don't know if learned or relearned yeah what i would just add to that congressman is on the research development and acquisition side um one of the things that we are beginning to pivot away from is the focus on a singular agent but rather the reality is is that we are going to have to have more broad spectrum kinds of of both drugs as well as vaccines and our continuous consultation certainly with the pharmaceutical industry is helping us with that and i can go into further detail uh in the closed session as well thank you and i yield back

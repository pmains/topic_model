you know FBI director Muller is your best choice and now he's being twisted and turned you know and threatened essentially with fire and I think the Washington Post story said the Democrat from Baltimore he's being called he but he was appointed you know under Bush and and so I think it's got to be very frustrating to feel this constant influence this undue influence being pushed on the Justice Department when he seems to be really trying to do the right thing and follow through on the investigation and the special counsel he appointed I want to turn now to one of the lawmakers who is at the center of this investigation to broaden out this conversation joining me now remember the Senate Intelligence Committee independent senator angus King of Maine senator thanks so much for being here tonight I want to start with this overarching question that really has been the conversation since that New York Times report broke late last week and these signs that potentially the president has been interested in firing Robert Muller I'm interested in your view first of all of what the Congress needs to do in that instance but do you also feel as though your Republican colleagues are still viewing that as a red line if the president were to take such an action or try well that was the position that I took months ago and I said I basically said it's unthinkable that the president would do that and I think I remember saying on the air if he did there would be a universal uprising in the Congress to re-establish the the position I'm not so sure anymore there's been so much sniping and and deliberate undermining of mr. Muller over the past several months and you know listening to Lindsey Graham and Susan Collins's comment I think I'm starting to fall into that camp because if we don't do something before trying to do something afterwards if there is a firing and then we try to reestablish the office I think that would be quite difficult and maybe it is appropriate now and this is a change of position for me but based upon events of the last several months and particularly of this last week I don't know all the facts and you know all we have is that one story to go on but clearly and but you know the contrary fact is the president keeps saying I'm not gonna fire him his counsel says he's not gonna fire him I think it would be a huge mistake if he did if he did and thought he was putting this thing to bed it would be just the opposite because if muller finishes investigation and there's nothing there he's exonerated it's over he can move on if he fires Muller and it's still perking around this thing is going to haunt him for the rest of his presidency so if I were him if he's innocent as he keeps saying he is let the investigation go forward and get it over with sir I'm curious Senator Schumer has floated the idea of potentially including a bill that would prevent Muller's firing in the overall budget a deal that Congress is not ago she ating is that in your view a good idea from the leader well I think I think it's something that ought to be discussed I mean as you know it's very hard to get any bill by itself through the Congress these days it's it's like watching ships go by you want to be sure you get you get your bill or you get your your your person on that ship that goes by or you may not be able to get it before the Congress at all so I think this is something that's worth some serious discussion over the next few days as I say the problem is if we wait and there's a firing then what we would be able to do to reconstitute the office and restart the investigation I think would be very difficult so maybe this is a case where there ought to be some legislation along the lines of what Lindsey Graham suggested one thing senator that has come from Republicans on the house side is this memo that has now been shown to house members but that is currently being kept to our knowledge from the Senate Intelligence Committee I want to show you a little bit of what some Republicans have had to say about this memo and then ask you about it take a look you want the president to declassify this memo having read this memo I think it would be appropriate that the public has full view of it this memo on answers what I think are really legitimate questions and I do think the FBI should look at it before before it is released it is not a hit piece on the department and the FBI I would not have participated in that's what it was there's plenty of ways you can redact the document to make sure that methods are not revealed but if there are serious concerns about unmasking that happened in the previous administration that I think that the American people should know that so two questions for you senator one do you want to see this memo why hasn't the House Intelligence Committee showed it to you and two should the public see it well the first question I'll answer I don't really understand circulating a memo to members of the house who aren't on the Intelligence Committee and not sharing it with the members of the Senate Intelligence Committee who are cleared to to see a national security information particularly my understanding it's been requested by the Republican chair Richard Burr and he's been denied access that doesn't make sense to me number two I don't know what's in it but certainly it ought to go to the Justice Department when we went through the process on the torture memo four or five years ago we went through it was a six-month process with the administration and the intelligence agencies to redact it and make sure we weren't exposing sources and methods and compromising national security so that's a obvious first step it strikes me as odd and and I don't want to say suspicious but odd that this memo was apparently being shopped around to certain certain congressmen nobody in the Senate seen that nobody in the intelligence community seen it it was produced it's not like it was an internal FBI memo it was produced as I understand it by Republican staff members on the House Intelligence Committee under the direction of Chairman newness who supposedly six months ago recused himself from this discussion so there are a lot of questions surrounding it but at a minimum I think members of my committee in the Senate ought to see at both parties and the intelligence community ought to see it to be sure there isn't something in there that would compromise national security and then we go from there this looks to me frankly the Chairman newness has sort of thrown sand into the gears of this investigation two or three times and this strikes me as another and you've got Clint watt there be sure and ask him about the Russians and release the memo the leading troll hash tag from the Russian troll farm this week is release the memo which tells you a couple of things the Russians are still involved in our politics and trying to influence our policy and you know maybe we ought to ask some questions about this whole thing sure I will make sure to do that once we are out there but really quickly before I let you go Ron Johnson raised the possibility that there were secret societies up within the FBI I was wondering your reaction to that statement from colleague well I heard him on the radio the other day and he sort of walked back from that and and I I think he's he's backed away you know I don't know what to say that the attack on the FBI from various quarters is really disheartening this is a an important institution and and Casey I think we've got to step back and and understand and realize how much our whole system depends upon trust and trust in institutions institutions like the FBI like the Justice Department like the Free Press and as we undermine public trust in those institutions it it really gets at the sort of foundation of what we do we're a country under the law but we're also a country under ideas and and mutual respect and those kinds of things so this idea there's some kind of secret society in the FBI to me it doesn't make much sense the FBI people I've known over the years are absolutely straight shooters they're Patriots that's why they're in the business and by the way there are 35,000 people in the FBI finding one or two who expressed some off-the-wall political opinions I suppose you could find that in any group of 35,000 people but by and large this is a dedicated professional group and trying to undermine that I don't think serves the country or certainly doesn't serve our national security interests senator angus King thank you so much for your time tonight I will see you on Capitol Hill as this very busy week unfolds they absolutely see you around and Clint Watts I'm going to go to you because the senator suggested and I think it is a great question what do we know right now about the hashtag released the memos and

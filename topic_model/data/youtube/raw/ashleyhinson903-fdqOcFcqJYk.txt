Henson congresswoman thank you so much for joining us appreciate your time thanks Jackie for having me of course so I want to pop up on the screen uh just some inflation data here we can dive right into the numbers you know inflation in September hit 8.2 percent compared to last year and some of these categories are just really really bad eggs are up more than 30 percent milk more than 15 fruits and vegetables more than 10 percent coffee more than 15 percent and then the more alarming data I think from this report was if you strip out the volatile food and energy costs core CPI hit a 40-year high at 6.6 percent the president has argued that his policies are working that you know money from the infrastructure law got Supply chains working and uh that some of the other bills they've passed won't take effect until next year so people really have to just wait to see these prices come down taking off your partisan hat for just a moment is there any truth to that absolutely not Jackie and what I'm hearing from Iowans as I'm out on the trail is that this inflation is truly a Pelosi pay cut for Iowans and Americans we simply cannot afford another two years like the last two we warned that this excessive spending binge that the Democrats went on in Washington DC would trigger rampant inflation did they listen absolutely not their solution was to tax more and spend more and look you can call anything any bill you want but these so-called inflation reduction act hires 87 000 new IRS agents the only way they're going to pay for all of this spending that the Democrats are putting forth is to tax you more and to come after hard-working Americans so this Biden Pelosi agenda is simply wrong that's why I believe this election will be about accountability this election is about putting a check on the Biden Administration and it's high time that we take their checkbook away that's what I'm hearing about from Iowans well you've faced some criticism from your opponent in in your race for opposing for instance the uh partisan infrastructure law but welcoming I think it was 829 million dollars in funding that you know would benefit your District locally so how is it is it at all you know hypocritical to welcome that kind of money coming back to your District after voting against it and generally opposing spending I think what it comes down to is what Iowans want me to let that money go elsewhere do they want me to let it go to New York or California when I looked at that spending it was triggering rampant inflation already at that point in the year and the Democrats directly tied that infrastructure Bill to at the time trillions of dollars in Social spending so I said hey I don't think this is the right time to spend this amount of money but it passed anyway so my job as Iowa's voice and Iowa's representative is to get as many of those dollars back to Iowa as possible so that's exactly what I did I know that the the need is there to enhance our Lock and Dam system on the Mississippi River so it was a great opportunity for me to work with Partners across the river and across the aisle to make sure those funds were coming back to benefit my district but when you look at the amount of spending that's been happening over the last 22 months Boy it has put our country on the wrong track so inflation's out of control the energy policies when I'm hearing from farmers who are not only the ultimate environmentalists but they are the ultimate consumers of energy right right they're using diesel they're using fertilizer to help Feed and Fuel the world when I'm hearing from them that their input costs are up 300 percent and this Administration just continues to double down and spend more that's the DC way DC needs to operate a lot more like Iowa and so that's what I'm trying to bring forth is common sense targeted investments in my district and around the country so so the president's claim is that if Republicans take back Congress inflation is going to be worse I want to play a sound bite for you from Thursday and get your reaction take a listen they want to repeal the inflation reduction Act that means they're going to repeal the two thousand dollar cap on prescription drugs gone cap on insulin gone at 35 bucks saving on health care premiums average of 400 a person gone savings on your utility bills gone yeah I covered the White House during the week I hadn't heard the president say that yet do Republicans want to repeal the inflation reduction act and and is it even possible I mean you know as well as I do that it was pretty tough to undo Obamacare for instance so is that even a practical uh solution well we're looking for real solutions not government price fixing schemes which to me what the president just said sounds an awful lot like socialism and what they have done with their spending spree is continue to expand the size and scope of government Iowans tell me all the time they want to be respected by their government they want to embrace their freedom and they want a government that respects that so what we want to do again this is about accountability in the next Congress why we need to fire Nancy Pelosi and hold this President accountable is because Iowans are tired of seeing their paychecks so disrespected so you do and by the folks in Washington DC so um I'm sorry I didn't hear an answer we're running out of time just wanted to get that straight answer from you do do Republicans do you want to repeal the inflation reduction act I hope we can undo as much of it as possible especially the 87 000 new IRS agents okay understood congresswoman Ashley Hansen thanks so much for your time on this Saturday appreciate the discussion hope to have you back again soon thanks Jackie

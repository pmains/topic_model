now with me now is congresswoman Medellin Dean she is a democratic representative from Pennsylvania and a member of the House Judiciary Committee congresswoman good to see you thank you for having me all right so let me begin you know by getting your thoughts on this letter from more than 1,100 former Justice Department officials calling for the US Attorney General to resign do you think he should resign I applaud the more than 1,100 former prosecutors for writing that open letter it did call for attorney general Barr to resign I agree with them that he has disqualified himself the letter went even farther it told all of the members of the Department of Justice across this country if you see something inappropriate if you see more of this doing the bidding of the president's personal political errands say something say something to Congress say something to the Office of Professional Responsibility the letter went even farther and said if you do not get any reaction from that you must act act by resigning and resign publicly it is an extraordinary do you see them doing that knowing the kind of support that bill Barr has received from the president openly and you know the inferences are there that even not openly there has been that kind of you know agreement on action I I do see that because these are extraordinary career public servants not not politicians not Democrats not Republicans and we did see of course the case of four prosecutors on the Roger stone case resigning from the case one resigning from the department you know it reminds me of something that always stood out to me in the magnificent Martin Luther King letter from Birmingham jail he said that history will record the tragedy not of the clamor of bad people but of those who the appalling silence of good people so I give these prosecutors former prosecutors kudos for being patriots and standing up against the appalling silence of some would be good people so Attorney General bar you know gave an interview this week and now you've saw it you know where he said the president's you know tweets make it difficult to do his job impossible was his word you know to do his job we've since learned that bar has now ordered the Justice Department to re-examine the case of former national security adviser Michael Flynn who pleaded guilty to lying to investigators in the Russia probe so do you see in any way or at any time that bar is acting independently or is he you know carrying out the president's wishes he has not acted independently since before he took the position of Attorney General and continuing from day one we saw his appalling behavior at the time of the release of the Mullah report misleading the American public for a month as to the contents of that report he has been doing the political bidding of this president and people are tired I tell you my constituents are awfully tired of the corrupt chaos of this president who utterly disregards the law utterly disregards the independence of the office of the Attorney General and the Department of Justice they would like to go back to a time where people understood the limits of their office and had respect for co-equal branches of government and you think there is a way and we should go back to that I believe there is a way and I think it will be at the ballot box it will be by continuing oversight that Congress must do but ultimately it will be at the ballot box that's what my constituents tell me because they're excited about the things that we are working on last week we passed er a or we got one step closer I'm very excited about for my granddaughter's and my grandson that hopefully one day very soon our Constitution will enshrine equal rights for women of for everybody it's a long time past due we also passed HR three here's a president who said in his State of the Union he cared about prescription drug pricing well if you care about it tell the Senate to take up HR three and then sign it if you care about building our infrastructure if you care about protecting our planet if you care about gun violence do something about it people at the ballot box will want to end the chaos and corruption of this administration so let me ask you you know back to bar you know be while there is so much skepticism you know being expressed about you know his candor or whether that was theater that he said that the president's you know tweets made it impossible to do his job yet you know the next day you know he was willing to reopen in and look further into investigations that are appealing to the president he has also agreed to testify before the House Judiciary Committee that you said you know that committee in which you sit on next month what do you believe his motivation will be in how he answers questions do you believe that his willingness is genuine oh I have no idea we'll be able to judge his credibility when he is before us on March the 31st I'm certainly glad he's coming before us he failed to come last year when he was scheduled to be in front of the House Judiciary Committee of which I am a member but it won't be about what we think his genuine is in his heart it'll be about us making sure that we test the independence of this office of this attorney-general sadly this Attorney General poured away his credibility in terms of Independence and the administration of justice as the top law enforcement officer of this country many many months ago so we'll be able to question him continue our oversight and I just applaud the people who worked for attorneys general in the past who said that we must not be silent when we have a corrupt administration that is using all the levers of power that he possibly has including his own Attorney General to do his own political bidding all right let's turn now to the 2020 Democratic presidential race you know you have yet to endorse a candidate you're you're you know free to do so today if you'd like do you think Joe Biden who is a native of your state you know he's from Scranton Pennsylvania can win the nomination is he the one that you want to throw your support behind well thank you for asking me I have not endorsed any of the candidates I am a fan of Joe Biden for his heart for his public service for his intellect and I see among all of our Democratic candidates extraordinary talent so I'm very excited about that what I will say is I'm excited also that Pennsylvania will be the Keystone State I believe the nation and the world will be watching what happens in Pennsylvania and so I'm looking forward to getting farther down the road having another debate and making sure that we put forward the strongest candidate in the end who will defeat Donald Trump I'm a big fan of Joe Biden I'm not endorsing anybody today but Pennsylvania is the one to watch hmm congresswoman Medellin Dean thank you so much thank you

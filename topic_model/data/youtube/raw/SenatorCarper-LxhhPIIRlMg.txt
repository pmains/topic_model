climate change has become the greatest threat to our planet there are others this is the greatest this image here was right next to me was designed by climate scientists named ed Hawkins from left to right these are called warning stripes in fact this whole work of art it's called warning stripes it visualizes our planet's annual average temperature from 1850 over here to 2018 over there going from deep blue to a brilliant orange and and in red and what this design fails to capture is just how menacing these rising temperatures have been and will continue to be for our planet and what this means for all of us who inhabit this planet today and in will in the years to come a rising seas are already at the highest levels ever recorded our nation's leading scientists have warned us that if we fail to start seriously reducing carbon emissions now by the end of this century we may well witness sea-level rise another six feet I'm six feet tall hi another six feet of sea level rise and puts a large part of the united state and frankly island nations around the world underwater underwater the East Coast West Coast won't look like it does today for America alone now that would result in an estimated three point six trillion that's trillion with the T three point six trillion dollars in Cuba de Levante damages to our country's coastal properties think Gulf Coast think West Coast the East Coast think Great Lakes three point six trillion in cumulative damage to our country's coastal properties in infrastructure over the next 70 years I might add the flood insurance program for our countries as I had last time I checked billions of dollars maybe tens of billions of dollars underwater in the red already well Glanville gold temperatures raw warm ice caps belt sea levels rise we also know that extreme weather is that we're witnessing throughout the world it's not going to get better it's going to get worse the devastating hurricanes and typhoons torrential rains and catastrophic floods the heat waves and droughts fueled wildfires will only become more dangerous and more disruptive to our economy and to our lives so take a look at one of the places where that's how and just last month this is a visual from a real picture from us it's not a movie is a real picture Australia the world watched in horror last month is bushfire scorched millions of acres of forest in Australia an area the size of my native state of West Virginia at least 25 people died in those brush stores including three American firefighters experts additionally estimated that 500 million animals died in those bush brush fires more recently that was doubled to 1 billion animals died 1 billion in one country our country meanwhile has been no stranger to tragedy and devastation caused by wildfires included by fueled by droughts and Heath like those that continue to plague the state of California scientists tell us that by 2050 we could face wildfire seasons that burn up to six times more forest area each year than today I'll say that again wildfire seasons that burn up to six times more forest area each year than today if we do nothing to address carbon emissions the extreme weather events were experiencing now will pale in comparison to the devastation the lies ahead last year some 13 agencies across the Trump administration released a report that predicted that the United States could see climate related losses of up to a half trillion dollars by the end of this century a half trillion dollars we do nothing the effects from climate change could slash up to ten percent of our gross domestic product by the next century more than double the losses of the Great Recession how much is 10 percent of our GDP more than double the losses of the Great Recession this is something provided us for I think by the United Nations and called UN warning in order to avoid the most catastrophic impacts of climate change the world's leading scientists have warned us that we need to limit global warming to more than a half degree increase in Celsius a half degree increase in celcius period to do that humanity would need to collectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions to Net Zero by the next century right now we're not on track to meet that goal I wish we were and we're dangerously close to losing our only shot as the latest United Nations annual emissions gap report made clear a collective global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are falling short and time is running out if we want to avoid the most catastrophic impact of climate change we need to step up we need to step up our game this is a chart that indicates the countries that are not in the Paris Accords it looks like I'm looking all these these countries here I see only one that's in red that must be the only country today that is not in the Paris agreement the climate crisis is one that can be solved only by everyone who shares this plan coming together and working together as one that's why nearly 200 nations came together in common cause to implement for the climate top Paris agreement and why they're working together to find solutions to climate crisis but instead of leading the world in this fight America stands alone we know we know the the EPA already has the authority and tools to reduce greenhouse gas emissions but under the Trump administration EPA's policies have been used to increase harmful emissions not decrease them President Trump is putting America in the slow lane while much of the rest of the world races toward a global clean economy President Trump claims Americans must choose between a healthy economy on one side and a healthier planet on the other side and the words of a good friend of mine that my friends is Milwaukee or in the words of our president that's you can fill in the blank and come up with whatever you do choosing between environmental progress and an economic growth is a false choice on the one hand that we do face a very real choice one was made clear in the UN report released this past December we either act now on climate change or quote we face the consequences of a planet that has been radically altered by climate change close quote I say let's choose to save our one and only planet planet Earth and I say it it's time for the u.s. to once again lead the world in this fight next chart we're going to take a look at something called clean economy Act which we introduced yesterday with over 30 co-sponsors I introduced it with our marcos our colleagues 33 of them actually legislation will put the united states on a path to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 the clean economy act heats the call for bold climate action while fostering economic growth that's fair for everyone but clean economy Act empowers EPA to use the authorities and tools already under Edison's disposal to reach Net Zero greenhouse gas emissions by no later than mid-century my no later than 2050 this is the quickest way we can jump-start government-wide climate action by empowering agencies to you the tools they already have the clean economy Act builds upon successful climate programs and states and cities and private companies and insurers economy-wide climate change action continue regardless of who sits in the Oval Office our legislation sets important guardrails to make sure all Americans reap the benefits as we move our country toward Net Zero emissions and here are just three examples of those protections the clean economy Act minimizes costs first EPA must maximize greenhouse gas emission reductions while minimizing cost to consumers and providing regulatory flexibility to industry our next floor chart basically prioritizes environmental justice EPA must consider under a legislation and protect frontline communities we know climate change disproportionately affects impoverished and disadvantaged communities communities of color in indigenous communities more often not these communities are downstream downwind from dangerous pollution located near industrial facilities or factories or located in areas that are already experiencing flooding and extreme weather fueled by climate change this legislation our legislation will prioritize input from investment in those communities our next chart on a clean economy act prioritizes American workers cleaning up the clean economy act focuses on American competitiveness and on the American worker our legislation compels EPA to use American workers domestic materials and strong labor standards to get the job done relying on our country's challenge to make the transition to net zero emissions by no later than 2050 no later than 2050 the clean economy Act also requires EPA to work with other federal agencies on problems to protect and uplift communities and workers displaced or dislocated by our transition to a cleaner economy in places like West Virginia or my sister and I were born this legislation will not come at the expense of jobs or economic growth moving toward a clean economy will drive innovation create millions of new jobs here at home clean economy act is about realizing our true economic potential potential that under this administration sadly has gone on capped clean economy act a hits what we call the sweet spot the sweet spot between organized labor business community environmental group support and I just want to thank for many organizations who helped us in crafting our bill clean economy Act including the Environmental Defense Fund moms Clean Air Force the League of Conservation Voters in our DC environment America blue green Alliance utility workers I also want to thank the organizations who join me yesterday in unveiling this legislation including the United Steelworkers Sierra Club National Wildlife Federation and Ceres say the least it's disappointing that President Trump has decided to abandon the tremendous economic opportunity to create millions of additional clean energy jobs they're already three million are we three million clean energy jobs there sadly for the folks in West Virginian Wyoming places like that there for them they've lost a lot of coal mining jobs they're down I think in the country were down about 65,000 but folks who can be trained to mine coal can be trained to create windmills windmill farms off of our coast opposed to have the skills to be able to to mine coal have the ability to help create a quarters of fueling stations for hydrogen and natural gas heavily trafficked quarters across our country to to create the charging stations for electric powered vehicles and heavily traveled quarters across our country and while we need to do part of our part of our policy and what we try to do in this legislation is to make sure that we look out for those workers and help make sure they have a place to go and a way to support themselves and their family but at the same time leading us to cleaner air to breathe and a healthier planet to call home I think it's shameful it's not just unfortunate I think it's shameful this president is forsaking our country's leadership in his fight for our one and only planet that this president has banned in our global allies for the sake of misplaced political gain not abdication of leadership will I think be a dark and indelible stain on his legacy but while president Trump may not be up for the climate challenge my colleagues our colleagues and I are here to say that to the world that majority of Americans are ready for it ready for that challenge we have faith in American innovation we have faith in American workers to take on this climate fight and win it cleaner con react will put the United States on the path to once again lead the world in the fight against climate change while lifting up American communities and American workers this bill corrects our president's failure to lead on this issue and directs EPA and other agencies to move swiftly to address this serious problem for the good of our planet and for the strengthening of our economy in the creation of even more new jobs famed economist John Kenneth Galbraith once said these words and I quote him but all the great leaders have one characteristic in common it was a willingness to confront unequivocally for magic the major rather major anxiety of their people in their time this and not much else is the essence of leadership that's worth repeating all the great leaders we have had share one common characteristic that's the willingness to confront unequivocally the major anxiety of their people in their time this and not much else you said is the essence of leadership I'm Tom Carper and I approve that message clean economy act is our message to the rest of the world about climate leadership the United States is preparing to once again lead the fight against this climate crisis America let's roll

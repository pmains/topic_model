mr. Smith you recognized strike the last word Thank You mr. chairman I do have a question for mr. Barr told on the $1.99 a issue there was action that we took I believe in a bipartisan manner as well and to address the the issue that had come to be known as the grain glitch now that that fix of the grain glitch would be permanent with this action is that correct under this legislation that's correct sir right so this legislation would would be necessary in order to make that permanent by making the 199 a provision permanent fix that Congress enacted in February would be made permanent as well yes sir okay thank you very much I appreciate that and I think it shows that we can come together to get some things done here and and I think that the productivity of tax reform certainly speaks for itself with the numbers coming in and there will always be critics probably and probably politically motivated along the way but I hope that we can for the for the good of our country come together and focus on issues that can bring more opportunity to the American people we have a lot of folks on the sidelines of our economy and now is the time to get as many people as we can onto the playing field that we would call the economy and I hear from my constituents up and down the line that they need more employees now is the time not only with this bill but other other pieces of legislation that we come together to address the needs of our country and bring folks off the sidelines of our economy so that they can prosper and have a brighter future thank you I yield back thank

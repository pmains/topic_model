tell me where you were and what it was like the day that King was killed Oh today that King was assassinated I was in chocen April 4th it was a date and when I got the news I was I used to run community development programs I was I went home I was living there from Dalton Avenue in Charleston and I just cried the winner in my house and I sat down in your little recreation area and I turned the video on I don't know if why I didn't turn the TV on but I turned the video and I listened I just sat there the rest of the night the Sun came mill with me sitting there and there's only once or twice in all these years I've thought about that night and this may be the first time I've ever really talked about that night a lot of people don't realize it were king with this year for the first time in 1960 he had been preaching disobeying unjust laws and a schism had developed much like we have little schisms today politically a schism had developed in the civil rights community over the whole issue of whether or not King was practicing what he was preaching he came to meet with us and we sat down with him that night I guess and 9:30 10 o'clock in the dormitory room and when I walk out of the room was 4 o'clock the next morning that was most memorable the most transformational period of time they ever had it was almost like a Saul to Paul transformation in me and that's when I started reading all of Kingston stride toward freedom his first book I just I read that book four or five times just trying to intern I've read it letter from the Birmingham City Jail about 100 times here you are serving in the a States Congress with John Lewis and yours truly how does that make you feel you know I talk about it often it's sometimes you just have to catch yourself because when we grew up in school we studied civil rights and of course I went to Morehouse which is a school very deep in civil rights history and John Lewis was a big name and everybody knows Bloody Sunday everybody knows the picture everybody knows John Lewis but at Morehouse when you start reading more about our history and especially then at Tulane law school then we find out about the other activists that went on and so that's where Clyburn gets introduced and to get elected coming from New Orleans which we have our own significant civil rights history in New Orleans or Homer Plessy a Peter Oh a a number of people knows Douglas so to get elected and come up here and I tell people this all the time is silly it still feels funny to refer to John Lewis as John or to call you Jim because I grew up saying but for them there would be no me so now let me just flip it since we've talked about that so considering your history with the civil rights movement and sitting in being arrested forming snake your friendship with John Lewis your friendship with many times and civil rights activists all around the country so now you're back as Majority Whip the number three person in the Congress highest-ranking african-american elected official in the country right now how does it feel knowing that you're doing it now and you're doing it with a black caucus that is now the biggest black caucus that has ever existed in the United States history well it's a little bit like you said sometimes I pinch myself because quite frankly even when we were sitting in as a lot of people know I met my wife in jail March 15th 1960 when we finally made a successful I would call it successful because we got arrested on that day six weeks after the incident end up in Greensboro North Carolina I often wonder whether I really thought when I was sitting in jail that day whether or not what we were doing had any real redeeming value last time I went to jail was also a very impactful night that I was who we can be spent three nights in jail out a spin but one but because I learned a lesson that time on people getting the rose mixed up I tell the story offer about the guy who was supposed to be racing to bail Misrata I went to jail he had no business in jail that night and because he went to jail he couldn't raise the bail and so we're about so I learned that night that we all have roles to play and shouldn't get these roles mixed up I've used that story boys young people say not stay in their Lane yeah but everybody has to play their role in the dark for the matters no role is more important than other because without everybody playing their role you can't you can't get it done that's exactly right but I think now in the modern-day civil rights movement quest for equality and justice and fairness it's back again because some people's role would be to agitate absolutely some people's role would be to educate the types of eyes but everybody has a role to play to protect this next generation which I am very fearful of what this country is going to look like for them if we don't all play our role and get it right right now this month they believes us to not just study history but to remember George Santayana czar monition that if we fail to learn the lessons of history we're bound to repeat them it's one thing to learn history it's something else to learn the lessons of history and so I would hope that everybody celebrates back just enough this year we'll learn some history lessons and I don't think we will repeat them every day [Music] you

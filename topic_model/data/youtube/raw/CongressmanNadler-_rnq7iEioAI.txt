the gentleman the gentleman from New York mr. Nadler is recognized for five minutes Thank You mr. chairman mayor Castro your testimony and said that we must do at least three things in an immigration reform further strengthen border security streamlined the legal immigration process that law-abiding companies and get the work as they need and create a path to citizenship for the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants it seems to me that there's one further thing that any good immigration reform should do it and that is to eliminate unjustified invidious discrimination that is present in the system and once one such discrimination is certainly the fact that people other than gay and lesbian people can sponsor their spouses for immigration into the United States so that you don't keep them separated whereas under our laws of course gay and lesbian people cannot marry other gay and lesbian people at least the federal government will recognize that a few states will so that the laws work a what I would call a a cruelty on people and unnecessary cruelty because under our laws it may be that the lover or partner of an American citizen can't be here and under the laws of this foreign country it may be that the American can't go there and you were keeping people apart now there is legislation called the uniting American families act which would establish an equivalency so that the question of gay marriage apart which is really a separate question we will not have the cruelty of keeping loving couples apart by allowing a gay person or a lesbian person to sponsor his or her partner for immigration this has bright we're reintroducing that bill today by the way it has broad bipartisan it has support of Republicans as well as Democrats church leaders members Hispanic Caucus and now recently the president the United States do you think this is a good or essential piece of a comprehensive immigration reform I believe that that it would be a good piece for comprehensive immigration reform and as you suggest believe that there would be significant support for that I myself support marriage equality but even for folks who support for instance only civil unions and certain rights that partners would have I believe this is right in that vein and that it makes sense thank you and I just want to make clear that this is not not the question of gay marriage if we had gay marriage you wouldn't it would be moot but this is a question of enabling people to be together who otherwise cannot be for no purpose at all purposeless cruelty which the United States should never engage in I have a second question for you and that you note in your testimony the immigration laws are broken across the board harming businesses and separating families there are some who support the idea of increasing the number of green cards in the employment based system we've heard that but only if a commensurate number of green cards are eliminated from the family based system do you buy into the zero-sum approach and can we be a nation that supports both business groups and keeping families together thank you for the question representative I agree with dr. Aurora that this is not a zero-sum game there's no reason that we need to choose between these I believe that that we should have both employment-based and continue our family based allocation as well as of course addressing the issue of high-skilled immigrants and other skilled immigrants I would also frankly suggest that being able to pick crops in the Sun under the hot Sun for 12 14 hours a day to do back-breaking work is a kind of skill maybe not what we would call a high skill but certainly a skill that many many folks either do not or cannot do and so to answer your question I believe that that that is a false dichotomy thank you and finally have one question for mr. tidal down his title BAM you say that some of the Commission strongest recommendations were against temporary worker programs noting that admitting large numbers of temporary workers in agriculture in other fields would be quote a grievous mistake I must say I'm very ambivalent about this on the one hand I worry about a guest worker programs of bidding down us wages for American workers on the other hand the share of the native-born workforce without a high school diploma was around fifty percent the 1940s and 50s and it's now down to about six percent and as a native-born of growing better educated us workers have been less willing to engage in farm work but the demand for farm labor has not decreased so my question is if we still have a need for on the farm labor but a giant reduction the population of native workers likely to look for work in the sector do we have a need for a guest worker program is it naive to think that if we cut out foreign workers that these jobs will just be filled by American workers and in such a program in fact cutting down on America you know bidding down American wages again this is going to be my thoughts not the Commission the Commission was recommending against large-scale temporary worker programs for the reasons I indicated I agreed with that recommendation I believe it's still to be true there is a very large population in the United States of low and unskilled workers many of whom are unemployed and relatively unemployable the conditions of work offered in some of the jobs you're talking about are really not very attractive compared to their alternative sources of income as citizens and therefore I think you have a situation in which the market disposes towards dependence upon unauthorized migrants in addition you have decisions made by employers as to where to invest or where to plant and what plants to plant are they labor intensive plants or not labor intensive plants based upon the assumption of continued access to this kind of labor so you get a kind of mutual dependency if you will situation in which it is correct as the as the growers might say if you took away my work for us now all my plants all my crops would rot in the field but if you if they were pretty certain they weren't going to have that future work for us in the future they would make different decisions about what crops to grow and we're to grow them but why should they if they assume they're going to have that workforce

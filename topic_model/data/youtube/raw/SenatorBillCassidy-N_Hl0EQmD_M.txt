madam president let me begin by saying that i am proudly pro-second amendment i believe in a god-given right for a law-abiding americans to keep and bear arms and the second amendment has given millions of americans the right to defend their spouse their family their children their home but if you consider yourself a supporter of the second amendment you absolutely want to do something about avaldi to do something about murders related to domestic violence to do something about straw purchases to do something about teen suicide by gun you cannot be pro-second amendment unless you care deeply about these issues that's why we have targeted legislation the safer communities act that develo that addresses specific problems that have led to mass shootings by by restricting access for someone who should not have a weapon but also by providing additional mental health uh resources and by hardening schools this legislation accomplishes these goals without infringing upon a law-abiding citizen's second amendment right and let me repeat that because there's been confusion in speeches from this floor there's been internet exploding there's rumors afloat that somehow this infringes upon the law-abiding citizens right to keep and bear arms that is absolutely false and if anyone says so they are misleading the american people madam president this doesn't do any of that madam president what this legislation says that unless you are adjudicated now adjudicated is a five dollar word that means you go before a judge and the judge looks at the evidence and under this bill if uh if a state puts this into law then they've got to follow due process which says that the person who may lose their second amendment right has the right to an attorney a higher standard for the evidence that must be must be presented that that person has their day in court this was the gold standard that the national rifle association always advocated for as if we were going to take second amendment rights from someone who should not have them and this bill has that gold standard now i've had a couple town halls just to find out what folks back in louisiana were thinking about all this frankly they're talking about inflation and the price of the pump as much as they're talking about this but i got a message they think that we can protect second amendment rights and do something about a tragedy such as uvalde but let me give you some of the comments because it shows you the confusion and it shows you the concerns and it shows you where the american people are chris asks when he dies can he pass his gun to his child if his child is law abiding absolutely that is preserved we don't touch that and by golly chris should be able to do so we're asked by tyler if this raises the age of the ability to purchase a weapon from 18 to 21 it does not it doesn't touch that although apparently tyler had been told to told that was the case i was asked about rj about keeping guns out of the hands of criminals and i say man we got something in there rj that actually addresses that i heard from two people who said we should forbid the purchase of so-called assault weapons and i heard from one guy who said man i live in a tough section of town and if somebody invades my house i don't want it to be a fair fight so i've heard on all sides of these arguments as to what but the message i got we can address we can protect second amendment rights but still do something about vivaldi now it's not just evolving there's other types of gun violence in our society at least four this bill addresses at least four there's the domestic violence there is the suicide by the child there's the gangster buying a gun to shoot people up and then there's the rampage shooting let's talk about each of those when it comes to the domestic violence a guy beats up his girlfriend he comes back with a weapon and shoots her a month later it happens too much i talked to my police chief murphy paul in baton rouge and he tells me that domestic violence and domestic murder spiked under the pandemic this bill does something about it i asked people who oppose this bill what about domestic violence man what about that woman who's threatened shouldn't we do something for her safety this bill does something for her safety and quite likely for her children's safety and quite likely prevents us suicide by the troubled man who goes there in the first place let's talk about crime gangsters straw purchases a boyfriend's got a felony can't buy a weapon the girlfriend buys them one and slips it to him it's against the law now but happens all the time we strengthened rj if you're watching on c-span man i'm channeling you because we took the provision r.j said we should do and we we increased the penalties for that person who buys a weapon merely to pass it to another to hopefully throw her in prison for as much as 10 years if she contributes to a murder con by buying a gun for someone who goes out and commits that murder we talk about rampage shooting you know what's much more common the teenager shooting himself we stop that oh they can still steal a weapon if they want to but there is 12 billion dollars in some form or another for mental health services we do our best to reach that child and by the way suicide rampage shooting's the worst then comes suicide then comes the addiction i'm a doctor i've seen this stuff and after the addiction just becomes the person who's emotionally troubled we're putting in mental health services that can address it all with money for a 988 line so that if somebody is just like oh my gosh i'm desperate they have somebody to call personally i'd like to have an app i'd like to have i'm a troubled teenager app and i need somebody to talk to they're doing this in utah and they tell me that the investment has been tremendous i think they told me they prevent a suicide a week that's off the top of my head called a suicide every two weeks that's a powerful intervention this bill has that capability and lastly there is the information regarding the rampage shooting uvaldi um you know somebody told me you know i searched on the internet i didn't see that this guy was troubled that's precisely the point this man's trouble but he's less than 18. those records are sealed you can't get to them so even though every indication was that this young troubled man would have had a reason not to be able to purchase a weapon it's sealed he turns 18 he's a clean guy and he goes out and buys two assault weapons and starts planning his assault if you're pro-second amendment by golly you want to stop that and what this bill does is it allows the court to look into that and say oh he's clean that's okay or no he's troubled and we need a little extra time to look at this by the way that's a provision that has been distorted and twisted to imply that law abiding 18 to 21 year olds would not be able to purchase a weapon if you're a law abiding you can still purchase that weapon if you're 18. but if not or if there's another indication then the background check has a chance to look at it and if you're a pro second amendment by golly i'll say it one more time you should applaud that provision now let's do a couple other things you know right now a mexican cartel can smuggle weapons to mexico to shoot people up we make that illegal you would think it already would be but it's not how can somebody be against that criminalizing cartels from smuggling weapons to mexico and somehow we're infringing upon second amendment rights of the cartels my gosh i wish we'd do worse to them we increase penalties for illegal gun traffickers criminal criminal gun gun gun increases we are doing something about criminals but have i said it yet we preserve the second amendment rights for the law abiding now i'm a gastroenterologist so i didn't know anything about due process except as a term but speaking of john cornyn who's done a fantastic job in the other attorneys i've learned a little bit about due process madam president um and by the way when everybody somebody calls me up and they say they heard something on the internet i said why don't you read the bill it's 80 pages read the bill and on page 33 you're going to read about due process it says that any state red flag all we don't encourage those red flag laws but if the state decides to do one and they want federal dollars they now got to obey these rules and the rules say it must include at a minimum due process rights that prevent any violation or infringement on the constitution of the united states if you're pro-second amendment you should like that a state can actually have a red flag law right now and not have that in there but under this bill by golly they had better how can anyone object to that the bill also ensures that no no stake in sidestep due process it strengthens the citizens right to due process it increases the evidentiary bar it can't be hearsay can't be a social worker or i'm a little nervous it's got to be before a judge and it's got to have evidence and the person losing their right has go or maybe losing their right has got to have has the ability to have an attorney with him now no offense to my people on the other side of the aisle but of a liberal state puts forth a law that has poor due process they won't get federal dollars and that should be something we are proud about now my state doesn't have a red flag law this bill does not require mandate or incentivize that louisiana develop a red flag law but you know my state does get money for drug courts for enforcing restraint orders so the fellow who's not supposed to go near his wife because they're afraid he'll beat her up again the police have more resources in order to prevent that who can be against that that's in this bill by the way our legislation also hardens schools there's money for the stop school violence school safety program including school resource officers and school hardening there's additional funding for mental health resources drug and violence prevention mentoring crisis intervention high quality training for school personnel on suicide prevention and human trafficking how can someone be against that this is a solution now by the way we have a serious problem in mental health in my career i have been privileged to work with senator murphy and others on solutions for mental health there's increased dollars for medicaid including telehealth services for schools that might be in a rural area otherwise without a mental health professional around it expands mental health services under medicaid school-based mental health services all expanded it reauthorizes the pediatric mental health care access program it gives pediatric providers extra training in mental health and i could go on now there's still a lot of misinformation out there but i would say if you don't know what's in the bill it's online pick it up and read it but if you're pro-second amendment you should be for this bill we can protect second amendment rights we can make an impact on teen suicide upon domestic abuse upon strong purchases landing guns in the hands of criminals and upon rampage shooting and we can do that while protecting the second amendment that's what i'm hearing from the american people that's what this bill does and with that madam president i yield the floor

senator kevin kramer joins us now to discuss the remarks he made this afternoon on the senate floor about president biden's insinuation that because there are around 9 000 approved oil leases going unused the oil industry is refusing to increase production senator thank you for being here well thanks for the opportunity to clarify some um some of the facts shall we say sure now senator is biden's claim that there are 9 000 unused leases that oil companies can be quote drilling right now yesterday last week last year that's what he said is that a smoke screen for energy policies that have had hamstring effects on oil production well thanks josh it is uh a smoke screen and even if it's technically accurate the 9000 leases not being used it's woefully incomplete because there are a number of factors not the least of which is that not every lease has oil or has any minerals under it i mean one of the reasons that oil companies buy multiple leases is because some will be will have a mineral under them some of them will not but it also doesn't tell the rest of the story and that is that there's a whole bunch of other regulatory hurdles that that the company has to go through before the lease becomes permitted to drill and that's really the rest of the story senator when you have an abundant supply of domestic energy the cost of manufacturing agriculture and the cost of living comes down so why do you think the body administration isn't doing more to tap into north dakota's oil yeah you know it's really a important question and it's a peculiar one for the biden administration because they've done everything from looking to despots and iran and venezuela and really some of our worst enemies to help you know to help fill the fill the gap and now they're looking to canada they're asking canada to produce more oil even though they won't approve the keystone xl pipeline um i think for whatever reason the biden administration is so opposed to fossil fuels that they'd rather see somebody else producing them which by the way they would produce at probably a higher cost and certainly with a with a dirtier footprint than we would the strategic petroleum reserve taking a million barrels a day out of the reserve that's about five percent of what the united states produces now or or uses now and so it's not a big amount but it's a further disincentive for investment in the united states if you're if you're an investor in oil and gas and the government says well we've got these big reserves for emergencies we're going to declare an emergency and we're going to displace five percent of private production with this government asset you're really telling the industry you know don't produce more so it completely makes zero sense and in the case of venezuela they are a country on the human rights watch list and when we're not producing oil we're transferring wealth to countries that do not share our interest real quick senator uh we know that producing oil isn't as quick or easy as flipping a switch but we know the administration's policies are sending negative signals to the marketplace remember less but but about two years ago the price of oil was negative you literally had to pay somebody to take your oil and store it for you that's how donald trump filled the strategic petroleum reserve with with very low-cost oil to now take it out at a hundred dollars a barrel means you have to replace it at you know maybe 50 60 to 100 a barrel so it's economically upside down and and then to to get a play going to drill a new well to put up you know all the infrastructure that takes time and it costs millions of dollars and you're not going to invest those millions of dollars if this is going to change within weeks or months or even a matter of a year you need to know and your investors need to know that you're going to be able to make a return on that event investment and why not why not american energy rather than you know venezuelan energy all right senator kevin kramer thank you so much for your time always my pleasure thanks for the opportunity

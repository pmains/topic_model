to happen congressman Ted Deutsch is joining us right now this is his district in Broward County first of all Congress has been our hearts go out to everyone involved you know this area well parkland it's not far from what Boca Raton pompano places that are very very popular in Broward County just north of Fort Lauderdale what the latest you're hearing yeah and kind of thanks thanks wolf this is also it's important to note a wonderful school and a great community it's it's exactly the kind of place you would want to live and raise your kids and today's a reminder that tragedies like this happened too often and can happen anywhere I've spoken with I've been in contact throughout the day with the sheriff from the the superintendent and and local elected officials and and the the news that the shooters been apprehended is is very positive they're trying to to get more information obviously about him there are a number of fatalities I've heard different numbers I don't so I don't I can't confirm the exact number but it's been a horrific day it's a it's been a very grim scene at the school and I've heard from from parents including what if someone on my staff whose daughter was was in the school and wasn't locked down throughout the day just how how horrific the whole thing has been it was a terrible nightmare for those who went through it and for those who have lost their lives and for those who were injured the community is going to be there for for them for their families that's the kind of place this this is we've heard various numbers congressman at least two fatalities two dead the Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel says at least 14 people were transported it's a local hospital as are those roughly the numbers usually they they wind up going up but what do you what are you hearing yeah I've heard the same numbers I've there have been some accounts of of a higher number of fatalities but I don't want to get ahead of that the fact is we know that that there was a mass shooting at a high school at a terrific a terrific high school in a wonderful community and we know that unfortunately this is just one more mass shooting well I I was I was in a hearing when this happened and and didn't and found out about through a text I didn't get a chance to see any of the footage until just recently but when you watch the the images of the kids leaving school with their hands in the air and the first responders rushing in with their guns to try to secure the school in the location what you realize is that the images are just all too familiar we see this far too often and and it shouldn't have to happen I mean for my colleagues here this isn't something that anyone should have to experience in their district for it to matter to them this kind of tragedy that will affect this community not just today but but sadly for for some time to come we have to do everything we can to try to prevent these tragedies from occurring congressman let's hope it stops but clearly it won't unfortunately thank you so much for joining us and good luck to all your constituents down there in Broward County thank you well if I appreciate that Deutsch is the congressman who

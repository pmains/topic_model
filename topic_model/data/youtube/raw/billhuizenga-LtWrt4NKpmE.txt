let's hear it for the congressman bill Huizenga the Republican from West Michigan who's on the other end of our AT&T line nice to talk to you again hey you two MPs I'm not sure I've ever had a bump that's included leather Tuscadero yeah that's how rule that's how it happens around here this isn't meet the press or face the nation or this is real this is people driving to work need a little something in the morning to get him going a little something to know that's why we love to have you here that's why people love your show so it's great thank you very much were you were you in west michigan this weekend yes you didn't happen to go to the bill maher show at devos performance hall did you uh no no I missed missed that when I can take him in very small short doses and then that I'm not sure it would have been worth the money for me to pay to go see that I think you would have walked out it was a hundred and seven minutes long and I think probably in 65 seconds you would have walked out of there based on what I'm reading what he said here and i just read some of this for your reaction this will get your blood going on a monday morning he says the rednecks are riled up because that only did we elect a black president but we re elected him they lost because they were too nutty too nutty even for America when Bob Dole says your party is crazy you know it's crazy now that's classic Bill Maher and and he's way off base is normal so you know he keeps saying those things in the center of the universe for when it comes to to Republican politics certainly in Michigan so I don't think he gets it I don't think he really gets what we're about here in the Midwest he even went so far as to start to make fun of Gerald Ford and that's when the crowd turned on him and he quickly dropped that topic you know he was going to make fun of him for being named for this and that whatever and then he says when you only have two choices it's a choice between the Democrats and the party of mental patients it's not hard to choose the Democrats are lame the Republicans are insane yeah i mean this this is a guy who is obviously out of touch with middle america it doesn't understand the values that we have doesn't understand what motivates us or drives us and it's about making a better country not not a worse country off and at the end of the day I know that's why I'm motivated to do it and I mean look at macewan the world in their right mind would go after Gerald Ford and there's nobody who's more decent and more honest than that guy yeah and just to put the icing on the cake he says the Republican coalition is made up of religious fanatics gun nuts overweight suburban Knights in the super rich which of those four are you I got I got the overweight part i'm working on you are not you could begin me i know you work out at the Capitol every single day uh Terri Lynn land may is gonna announce today I think that she's running for United States Senate she's going to make an announcement one way or another can she win oh I think Kerry definitely could win I think we've got a number of candidates on our side of the aisle that I would make very very good senators and you know we're going to see what's happens we don't get into a smoke-filled room like the other side does we actually let the process work and have a primary election how is Attorney General Eric Holder still in office you've said you're not the only one but you said he ought to resign after all these scandal after scandal after scandal well you hit the you hit the nail on the head there with the question I can't figure out how and why this administration would keep him around you know and and that was something that that was talked about in the new york times i think this this weekend not that i'm a huge new york times reader but when you've got new york times quoting government officials is the White House being apologetic form for a long time but they don't want to you know they don't want to throw their friends under the bus here but you know you know I don't understand how this administration believes he is being helpful to their cause right now but the deal like that for him to step down what's bad for both of them doesn't it hey as you're transitioning into yep first of all who am I to give this administration advice if they had listened to me a long time ago maybe we'd be in a slightly different spot but you know you're transitioning into in a second term and all those kinds of things yeah at the end of the day I'm PS here's what I believe I believe that when you add all these things up from Fast and Furious to Benghazi to AP raid on the phone records now obviously I arrest ski and all that stuff this administration and specifically Attorney General Holder have been I think charitably charitable way of saying is less than open and honest with everybody so that that's that's the really the thing that stems me or brings me to the conclusion that he here ought to resign congressman bill Huizenga is the Attorney General Eric Holder inept or sinister that's a good question you know and when they plead when they plead ignorance on some things that seem awfully awfully self-evident you know it's hard to come to a conclusion other than those two things they're either inept or they're being dishonest and and frankly it's probably a combination of those things one of the interesting tales going around Mackinac Island we were there for the policy conference the other day is that you know congressman mike rogers your colleague there in the michigan delegation well his name was being floated as possible director of the FBI and then came the IRS scandal and and the the other deal last week and they said probably the White House a day there's no way we can have him in there now because that would be like letting a tiger in the cage Oh III think that the more sunshine that is shown on to this administration and and what's been going on the the worse they look and clearly that that hasn't been their mo is to open it up and be a true be transparent and you know I maybe that's one of the reasons why attorney general holders hanging on i'm not sure i don't know i just can tell you the way that he comes to the legislative branch both sides are annoyed because there's there's a lack of respect there's a lack of understanding this is a hard lesson that the republicans in the house had to learn we are in a divided government and we have a role in the legislature the White House has a role as well but at the end of the day what benefits the American people is open openness and honesty and transparency and we're getting none of that out of certainly out of the Attorney General your Democratic colleague from Michigan John Dingell is now the longest-serving member of Congress ever in history we're talking about December 13 1955 he's 86 years old he was making his way around the island he served for fifty seven and a half years no plans to retire do you run across him much and what do you make of his length of service is that to to be commended or perhaps maybe it's an example of abuse of power I don't think it's an abuse of power certainly a chairman Dingell who is still till still referred to doesn't matter when you're in you're in that one whether you're in power out of power he's been nah he's been chairman and has earned the right to have a lot of respect from from people of all political stripes I think it might be a bygone era it might be something that we probably are not going to see much of in the future but I can tell you as you just said you know he's making his way around the island up on Mackinac Island we see him around the Capitol I get into meetings we have Michigan delegation meetings mostly surrounding you know automotive things but you know on occasion other other things as well and I can tell you that he's very impressive in these even in these private meetings he's got a command of the issues clearly has the respect of everybody in the room and in you know the stuff we breathe sure you do but we're glad he's from michigan and glad you're from michigan to its michael patrick shields all across michigan and back in a flash watch the office

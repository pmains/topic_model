that there's one last uh brief question like to uh ask and then we'll proceed with the closing statement but after listening to all the testimony today one thing is being clear it was frankly clear before today's hearing our outdated immigration laws are not working period but in addition to the other impacts of a broken immigration system we attempted to focus today on how it's exacerbating the crisis that is our Healthcare Workforce shortage so uh Miss Peterson can you just comment briefly on how if Congress does not act swiftly to remedy this outdated system what are the implications for the health of Americans across the country thank you chair Padilla I'd like to go on record by saying I think we can do both I think we can deal with our border crisis and deal with the Urgent health Care shortage crisis in the United States because if we don't do both immediately the numbers will continue to grow at the beginning we were talking about you know the 124 000 shortages of doctors over the next several years it's only going to continue to grow and what that translates into is Americans are going to continue to have longer wait times have worse patient outcomes in terms of complications more financial burdens it will continue to compound and it's not just the rural and the underserved anymore it's all of us in the urban areas it's your families and mine thank you thank you actually think that's a great note to begin to conclude on because we can't do both we must do both but to utilize one uh situation policy issue or challenge to keep us from making progress bipartisan progress on a clear crisis is unconscionable I want to before concluding read allow a number of statements that have been submitted into the record and I'll read who they are from we have received statements for the record from the American Association of international Health Care recruitment the American College of Physicians the American Hospital Association American Medical Association the association of American medical colleges the Cato Institute the educational commission for foreign medical graduates the healthcare Leadership Council National hospice and palliative care organization National immigration law Center Southern Illinois Health Care upwardly Global and World Education Services so without objection these statements will be included and the record will close one week from today now as this hearing concludes I want to thank our Witnesses again for joining us today as well as chairman Durbin ranking member cornyn and our fellow committee members as I mentioned at the out today's hearing was not just about fixing our immigration system or about providing support to the health care workers who need it it's about tackling the crisis of our health care Workforce shortage it's about saving lives it was my hope today that in order to address an issue as important as saving American lives that we could stand United to reform our system that was the spirit that all the members of the committee showed up with so I want to make sure I make one thing clear before I close this hearing the Border has nothing I repeat nothing to do with the fact that we will need to hire up to 124 000 doctors by 2034 to fill current Workforce gaps we have a health care Workforce shortage that is affecting millions of Americans and there are productive solutions to address this two bipartisan bills which Ms Peterson raised today Each of which have 25 bipartisan co-sponsors and I'll note I know he just left and this is uh meant respectfully Senator cornyn is the lead on one of them but instead of utilizing our time today to focus on meaningful change we were met with repeatedly a misleading narrative it's a frustrating pattern among many of my Republican colleagues now I too was at the border just a few weeks ago among all the itinerary that day was a border patrol Ride Along in addition to visits to Ports of entry and detention facilities so let me be clear our border is secure let me also be clear about this point people presenting themselves at the border seeking Asylum is a legal right that they have but the reality is it's the process that's broken and it is in need of reform but many of our Republican colleagues are only interested in fear-mongering that's what I keep hearing and if the only solution that the offer is to completely close the border it's a non-starter I was interested in hearing the ranking member speak today about working in good faith we've been able to do so on a number of other issues and he's right we do need Republicans to work in good faith to help millions of Americans and to reform our immigration system but working good faith is acknowledging that we can do two things at once good faith is coming to the table to engage with experts and to respect and recognize data from our departments and agencies good faith is not showing up at a national Workforce shortage hearing and focusing on statistics about gun violence in Chicago but faith is seeing a complex issue facing our Healthcare Workforce and coming together to find common ground that will save lives or to advance Solutions when we've already found that Common Ground solution that enjoy bipartisan support and not find excuses to not move those forward but when Republican colleagues actually want to talk about solutions to improve our immigration system so that we uphold our nation's value and our economy then absolutely I am more than ready and willing to listen and I can say the same for chairman Durbin now that starts with being honest about cruel and misguided policies like title 42 and MPP that are unlawful and have only created more bottlenecks and put more people in danger as I said earlier in the hearing we need to improve the legal migration pathways to undo the pressure on irregular migration legal migration Pathways used to be a part bipartisan issue and they weren't conflated with border reform Once Upon a Time and we have bipartisan Solutions just sitting here in front of us waiting to be passed so it's a shame for this nation it's a disservice frankly and especially those in underserved areas when it comes to Health Care that Republicans won't let us move the needle forward even our solutions they support for the 95 million Americans living in an area with a shortage of Health Care Professionals including those living in Sheriff Martinez's County we cannot afford to wait it's not just Health it's lives that are at stake because every day that this Workforce Gap exists is another day that a loved one has to travel hundreds of miles for a doctor's appointment or a friend has to wait too long for a life-saving preventative screening if they can get to a health care provider at all what we've heard today leaves no doubt we cannot address this shortage without reforming our immigration laws there are thousands of Highly qualified Health Care Professionals already living in the United States who can join our Healthcare Workforce as we've heard from Dr olor immigrant Physicians are eager to serve the rural and underserved areas of our country that so desperately need care and as Miss Peterson pointed out Congress can make reforms to allow more Physicians to not just come to the United States but remain in the United States after they complete their training cogs can make more visas available for health care workers by recapturing unused visas in years past and Congress can make exceptions to numerical caps to specifically address Healthcare Workforce shortages for the sake of our nation's Health we must act swiftly to pass laws that will provide much needed reforms to our broken immigration system and bring care to communities in need so I want to thank again all of our Witnesses for your participation here today all my colleagues who attended and participated here today and with that this hearing is adjourned foreign

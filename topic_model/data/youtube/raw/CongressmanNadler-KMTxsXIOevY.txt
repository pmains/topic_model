all right madam speaker addressing our debt is a critical long-term goal but it's not our immediate problem right now our immediate problem is high unemployment and our economy needs efforts to spur job growth and the expiration of the bush era tax cuts particularly those targeted toward the middle class and the start of unparalleled across the board 1.2 trillion dollar spending cuts mandated by the budget control act sequestration provision threaten further job growth looking just at sequestration there is rare agreement not the president not the congress not anyone ever wanted or expected the sequestration measures to take effect why because we have a jobs problem and the spending cuts demanded by sequestration are a huge jobs killer republicans argue that the steep cut would risk defense to related jobs and they're right according to the economic policy institute these cuts would kill 1.3 million defense jobs in the first three years but the republicans completely ignored that the defense i'm sorry that the domestic spending cuts will also kill an estimated 1.3 million jobs in the same time frame put another way sequestration will kill 2.6 million american jobs in just three years so we simply must stop the sequestration mandated spending cuts disaster but this bill won't do that this bill mandates draining tens of billions of dollars of federal spending next year reducing the already draconian domestic spending caps and doing all this without adding a single dollar of additional revenue so the outcome is virtually the same this republican bill will still kill a couple of million american jobs talk about driving off a cliff basic economics tells us that during good times with low unemployment government should reduce the national debt but that to support job growth government must not reduce spending during recessions now when we suffer from high unemployment the proposed spending cuts particularly those of the magnitude republicans are proposing would be disastrous when we get to five percent unemployment then we should start worrying about spending cuts right now jobs are the issue mr madam speaker i urge you no vote on h.r 6365.

speaker I'm pleased to yield one minute the gentleman from Illinois mr. Schneider the gentleman from Illinois is recognized for one minute Thank You mr. speaker and I thank my colleague today I rise for Jessica this is her story Jessica's second pregnancy was difficult at about 12 weeks she discovered she was bleeding after weeks of calls with midwives visits to specialists and numerous tests it wasn't until 22 weeks five days into her pregnancy when she was told the tragic news that her baby had a rare birth defect and would likely not survive through the two surgeries she would have needed Jessica made the difficult heartbreaking decision to end her pregnancy under this bill there would be nowhere for Jessica to turn Jessica wants lawmakers to know in her own I am so incredibly thankful that my daughter never had to suffer I am still grieving and I think I always will be having an abortion was the most compassionate choice I had available to me my daughter deserved compassion a decision like Jessica's should be between the woman and her doctor' no one else I urge my colleagues to vote no on HR 36 we must stop the bans gentleman yields back his time

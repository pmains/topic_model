thank you madam chair and thank you mr. wolf for being here today we're all aware of the hard drugs that are coming across our border not just at the points of entry but between points of entry we spend a lot of time on this subcommittee in Congress as a whole talking about the southern border and what solutions we can bring to bear to stem this dangerous tie one of the things that is often overlooked is our maritime border intercepting drugs at our land borders is like a goal-line stand at our one-yard line it is great if we get to stop but where we need to be stopping drugs and smuggling is where they begin at their one-yard line I continue to brag on the Coast Guard's national security Cutter but with good reason the Coast Guard is seasoned millions of dollars of drugs routinely on patrols using the National Security Cutter to date this committee has funded 11 of these multi mission ships this asset along with the men and women of our Coast Guard have taken these drugs off the ocean in bulk this isn't a couple kilos of cocaine hidden in a truck or carried on someone's back we were talking about billions of dollars of hard drugs that are destined for our communities the Coast Guard seizes more drugs than all other federal agencies combined over the past four years the Coast Guard has ceased 2 million pounds of cocaine that is an estimated street value of 26 billion dollars we need more focus on the maritime border and the assets to patrol our oceans so mr. wolf I would appreciate if you could talk about your vision and how you plan to utilize appropriated funds to focus operations on drug smuggling in South and Central America well thank you the Coast Guard certainly plays a vital role there so when we look at jayate of south out of Key West and what they do patrolling from an intelligence perspective on the drug flow the drug traffic coming from South America in the Caribbean in the eastern Pacific I'm happy to report that it is the Coast Guard assets that are making those interdictions almost exclusively between the Coast Guard ships helo helicopters as well as CBP helicopters and assets as well while jaya south is an interagency interdepartmental process a number of intelligence comes in to that but the folks on the ground are in this in the sea that are making those interdictions our Coast Guard men and women and so I'm incredibly proud of what they do of course you know I would say that the US government doesn't have enough resources to interdict all of the narcotics coming from South America so I thought what was interesting one time is if you put the outline of the US on the eastern Pacific and the Caribbean that's what the that's what Coast Guard patrols with a handful of ships and we'll continue to do that so but it's a very challenging task now I'll also say that's just one part of it obviously when they interdict the drugs are critically important but it's also the investigators that are then talking to those individuals gleaning information trying to bring them on as sources and the like to again get at the issue at the source so we'll continue to put resources into the interdiction but I would also say the investigation part of that process that again that we do across the country is vitally important and of course DHS plays a role there with ice Homeland Security investigators but also with DEA and other elements of the US government well I agree 100% with your remarks and it just once again reinforces why the National Security Cutter is so important I know several us have disappointed that we had funding this committee appropriated funds for a 12th National Security Cutter only to see the President's budget remove those funds but they also went in addition they froze the the fast response cutters so you know removing these drugs before they make it into Mexico is vitally important once it makes it into the you know Mexico is pretty much in America and you know I think we could afford to you know fun these Coast Guard asks us more because these drugs are destroying our communities they're destabilizing the countries in South and Central America probably leading to the mass migration that we're seeing at our southern border and it's being driven by trans international criminal organizations I'll continue to work with the Commandant as I did during the a little bit of the budget build of this one the Commodores priorities continue to be the polar security cutter again in the budget request is funding to support a second one as well as the offshore patrol cutter so those are to capital investments that the Coast Guard is focused on obviously they still very much believe in the national security cutter and in the mission that they have so it's a it's a budget like any other budget where there's trade-offs that have to be made so we want to make sure that they have capability in the polar region as well as the new shelf shorter offshore patrol cutter capability as well so but we'll continue to work with Congress on what the what the right priorities are going forward I agree the polar security cutter and the offshore patrol cutter are important I think we just need to maybe look at the demands that we're putting on the Coast Guard and what they're doing and protecting our homeland security maybe we need to fund them more so thank you madam chair it's me

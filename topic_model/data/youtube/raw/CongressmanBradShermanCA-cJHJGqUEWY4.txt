meantime let's talk about Isis it's been a rough rough weekend very deadly fresh brutal attack in Iraq today claimed by Isis now responsible for the deaths of 10 people it was a two-car suicide bombing this time at a gas processing plant outside Baghdad the pictures are really dramatic Isis linking the attacks now killing more than a hundred people in just the past few days from suicide bombings explosion gun violence it's an alarming spike of violence happening at the same time the political landscape in Iraq is just a mess with the government trying to survive economy there is in shambles and yet at the same time this is interesting American people who were recently asked their opinion of how the fight against Isis is going forty five percent of people polled say the fight against Isis is going well and that's up from 38% who gave the same answer five months ago I want to talk to congressman brad Sherman about this he is the second ranking Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee congressman thanks for joining us good to be with you Anna first your thoughts on this new wave of Isis violence in Iraq just how hopeful are you that stability can be achieved well we're not going to achieve stability root anytime soon both in the Baghdad government but also taking care of Isis Isis uses guerrilla warfare terrorism and conventional warfare lost about twenty five percent of their territory over the last couple of years but they continue to be a potent at inspiring terrorism the United States conducting terrorism in Europe as well as conducting terrorism in Baghdad and it's going to be a while before before they're destroyed more than a hundred people killed just this week in Iraq Isis claiming responsibility for a series of 20 in attacks that it's much worse than that a hundred people were killed in Baghdad and there are reporters in Baghdad and so we're going to see that but every day of the week Isis is killing hundreds of people raping beheading genocide against the Yazidi people we don't see that because it's not in Baghdad it's nowhere close to a camera but one shouldn't think that Isis is evil is limited to what goes on in Baghdad and what you just described is this a sign that Isis is getting more confidence or are they getting more desperate they're using terrorism as a tactic to try to inspire their followers I think they're in a bit of a downward spiral but not an immediate one they their recruitment is down their territory is down but they're they're effective terrorism both in Europe and in Baghdad is up so we're going to have to continue to conduct operations against them our bombing operation is is much smaller than it tends to be portrayed and it's a we had maybe 700 sorties a day against Saddam Hussein we're doing about 11 a day against Isis and our rules of engagement for dealing with Isis caused us to ignore strategic targets for fear of hitting just one civilian and you just can't conduct strategic strategic bombing that way so there are things we can do without forces on the ground that will help us defeat Isis every day that we shorten Isis's rain we save the people that would otherwise be raped beheaded and and and and starved and subject to a all the harm that you can't photograph for for CNN let's talk about the implications than of this year's election Donald Trump the presumptive GOP nominee wants to ramp up the fight against Isis Hillary Clinton says she'll stay the course how do you see the Obama plan changing next year depending on who the next president is well I saw what Donald Trump had to say and he just declared that he would end Isis very quickly but didn't say how he implied that he had some magic secret plan that would allow us to deal with Isis and I invited him to come before the Foreign Affairs Committee and in confidential session to what his secret plan was I don't think he has a plan I to deal with Isis he just implies that he has a plan in order to get votes given how many people Isis is killing every day if Donald Trump has a plan he ought to share it with the Pentagon and you ought to share it with with Congress in closed session let's change gears and talk a little bit about the environmental disaster in Porter Ranch California your district newly conducted air dust samples they're still not good and the money needed to clean things up has just gone through the roof what are you doing to help get thousands of people back into their home's there well most people have come back I happen to live in Porter Ranch from most of my neighbors are back we need to get SoCal gas to pay for the kind of special cleaning that's going to be needed in homes for at least several miles around the site in order to deal with the dust that has toxic metals in it and that's just one of many steps we also have to make it clear that all the costs of this are not past summers they need to be borne by SoCal gas and its shareholders

Texas congresswoman kay Granger introduced that measure joins us live to explain why she brought it to the House floor good morning thank you for being here thank you for inviting me of course now there are two resolutions why did you decide that this was the right move I did this because the actions of the speaker and tearing up the speech not only violated the decorum it's always been part of the State of the Union address but also the those heroes that were introduced by the president who had such remarkable eyes the Tuskegee Airmen a hundred years old and tearing up the speech sort of tore up their time in the spotlight which they serve certainly needed and recognized I thought it was really a violation of the decorum that recommends what happens in a speech like that and from the House of Representatives the speaker is there and essentially it was a stunt but I thought it should be brought to people's attention so I had a privileged resolution that said that it was a lack of decorum and respect and it was brought for a vote for the house and the Democrats brought that down representative Granger Pelosi's camp is accusing you of playing politics here's what a spokesperson had to say quote it is sad to see a senior member respected on both sides of the aisle have to kneel at the altar of Trump in order to win her primary that's all this is about your response well that is not the situation what it's all about is what I saw at the Specht they say the Union and her her response and we've done this before when someone says did not does not stand up to what we expect from leaders like her and if you watch this over and over again it was a stunt she took that speech and tore it up now we heard from both Nancy Pelosi yesterday and President Trump the president taking a victory lap of course following his Senate impeachment acquittal some people on the other side of the aisle said that it looked like he was in deep psychological distress that it was dark and disturbing what the President had to say yesterday there was a lot of back-and-forth Nancy Pelosi sticking to her guns with what she had to do let's go ahead and take a listen to a little bit of this it was evil it was corrupt this should never ever happened to another president your impeach forever you're never getting rid of that scar to me like he was a little sedated he looked that way last year too we first went through Russia Russia Russia it was all where do we go from here do you think congresswoman well I hope that somehow we go back to working together that could have been done at the State of the Union address when it the normal situation is regardless of parties that you have a respect and attention to what the president saying he had a lot of good news to present you know the welfare rolls are down wages are up it was a good it was a good speech and a good report and now I think as both parties should work together for the American people that's what we were asked to do but to follow up on Jillian's question are we just too far down the field on this one to have any changes I mean just as a lay observer here watching from the outside it just feels like these two parties are so entrenched on their sides there's no common ground like we had a breaking but we had a breaking point right this week in fact yeah what we do or many of us work together on particular issues and that's always been a part of who we are in this situation I think the impeachment really was the most difficult and that my people in my district people say what are they asked they just say move on what is this about and when we saw videos of high-ranking Democrats saying please reelect me so we can we can impeach the president before the president even took office and we saw those videos is a situation where was he ever given a chance to have the respect that the president deserves all right congresswoman thank you so much for joining us we appreciate it thank you

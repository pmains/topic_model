hi i'm ben sass candidate for u.s senate and we're in beatrice nebraska let's talk about energy america is blessed with bountiful natural resources like coal oil and gas and the technology and the know-how that allow us to access these energy reserves cheaply and safely recently stunning discoveries have revealed a total quantity of these resources that is far greater than was previously thought this is a great opportunity if we seize the moment we can create three million new american jobs and reduce our dependence on the unstable middle east unfortunately president obama is so beholden to the most radical environmentalist wing of his party that he has stymied the growth of the american energy sector for more than five years and is anyone really surprised that the you didn't build that president is using the levers of government to get in the way of creating jobs this has to change we can do better we need an all-of-the-above energy strategy and we should have a serious debate about the various kinds of research and development for the future but for now it is a no-brainer that we should be doing three things to simply get the federal government out of the way in oil gas and coal right now first the keystone pipeline should have been approved years ago let's get rid of the multiple redundant federal bureaucratic permitting hurdles some radicals claim that these extra federal layers protect the environment but that's nonsense does anyone really believe that dc cares more about protecting nebraska's beauty and nebraska's environment than nebraskans do of course not governors and state legislatures have been protecting their state's environments for years and it's time to provide secure reliable energy for america for the next century let's build this second we need to return to sensible coal policies and let's remember how many american communities are built on coal last year a senior epa official stunningly summarized team obama's coal approach this way saying quote we think those communities should just go away end quote he actually said this the president himself tried to say the same thing slightly more diplomatically he said quote if somebody wants to build a coal plant they can it's just that they'll go bankrupt because they'll be charged such a huge sum end quote think about this this is our president not talking about americans seizing opportunities to grow the economy but instead talking about trying to bankrupt parts of it well i think it's the bureaucrat sitting around dreaming up ways to bankrupt coal communities that are the people who should be going away we can do better we can simultaneously protect our environment conserve our resources and create jobs third and finally we must innovate to embrace the spectacular natural gas opportunity of this moment according to some estimates the shale opportunity in the united states right now might be as much as four times greater than the total amount of proven oil reserves in all of saudi arabia imagine that unfortunately the same epa team that wants to destroy destroy the coal industry is trying to slow down natural gas as well we need to stop the epa from targeting companies and workers that are fracking and instead let the states handle most of their own enforcement government must stop seeing americans who work in the energy sector as the enemy most of these folks are the good guys look we're nebraskans we descended from people who came here without much more than they could carry in their hands or on their backs or in their wagons and they built this state with their bare hands we face similar opportunities in this land today this energy revolution represents one of the greatest paradigm shifts since the model t we've got the people we've got the talent and most of all we have the will to work the will to pull prosperity out of the ground with our bare hands yet again if we can just get the federal government out of the way and let our people build we've done it before and we can do it again our country is the innovation capital of the world and remaining globally competitive demands that yes we must build this again thanks for listening and for more information please go to sas for nebraska.com thanks

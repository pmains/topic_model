like to thank everybody for joining us today uh to celebrate a huge step forward for making sure that veterans can get access to a proven treatment for their post-traumatic stress you'll have a chance to hear from some veterans whose lives have been transformed when they've been paired with a dog you'll also have a chance to hear from some organizations who are leading the charge to provide work therapy that this bill creates a pilot program for as many of you know this is my last week in congress and it's a great way to go out is to pass a meaningful piece of legislation that will transform people's lives and literally save lives you know over the years there have been lots of delays on this bill first the va was studying the process they took years to study and then we were waiting on um things to come back and uh so finally the va has completed their study and the house has now passed the bill that's consensus bill uh and i'm excited that we got it done uh this is a policy i've been working on since 2015 and since that time we have continued to lose 22 veterans and active duty service members a day to suicide it's a tragic number and i'd like to see us fix this bill and pass it and get it signed into law as soon as we can so that we lose less of our veterans and our service members and that they can get their lives back i want to thank our senate colleagues who are working so hard on this bill and i want to get a chance to introduce the senator from north carolina mr tillis who is leading the charge on this bill i want to thank him right behind me for his hard work and i give you senator tillis congressman stivers thank you so much for your hard work on this bill you've been working on it and you you made in your comments you said let's fix this bill i think you fixed it when you get a unanimous support out of the house representatives on anything it's got to be close to perfect so now our job is to take this bill and get it passed into law i want to just thank all the house members who supported the bill i think the recent va study proved the efficacy of dogs with the kind of training uh the therapeutic effect that it has and we can't forget that this can save lives this is not only improving the quality of life but this is literally an opportunity for us to save lives i think creating the five year pilot program makes sense and now it's just on us to get it done so i i know you're leaving us we're gonna miss you i'd almost like to get this thing done that may be impressed but i don't know what i will commit to everybody here and every veteran who could benefit from the from the relationship that you have with the dog i'm going to work hard in this congress to make sure it gets passed and hopefully set a target to get it done before memorial day so thank you all for the hard work congressman stivers we're going to miss you in congress i wish you the very best and thank you for your tireless work on behalf of veterans thank you thank you thank you i want to quickly introduce the team that helped get us where we are today and i'll introduce them just because they're in this order from left to right but alyssa slott can put in a ton of work she's on the veterans affairs committee put in a ton of work to get democratic co-sponsors worked with the committee staff worked with the community chairman thank you our lead sponsor kathleen wright for kathleen rice from new york who has worked on this bill with me for now two uh two terms so for four years and she's done a ton of work uh congressman mike walls from florida who is going to be taking over the lead on the republican side after our lead to make sure we get this bill continue to move and sheriff ruthford also from florida who has been a he's a sheriff and has been a real voice on this issue because he knows firsthand the difference that those service dogs make and mikey cheryl from new jersey who is from a military family and understands the difference that these service dogs can transform people's lives now i want to turn it over to the lead democratic sponsor kathleen rice thank you so much steve thank you so much for your hard work on this bill you know the senator said it very well any time you can get as many co-sponsors as we were able to get on this bill in this congress that is nothing short of a miracle and i'm not surprised that it is on a bill that will enable us to help the brave men and women our veterans who serve and defend this great democracy of ours we need to be there for them and enabling them to get treatment group dog therapy is just one other tool in our toolbox to help on the brave men and women who serve this country i want to give a shout out to the fabulous trainer of these dogs who become lifelong companions to our veterans they do such an astonishing amazing job getting these animals ready to be lifelong partners to our veterans so i want to thank them so much and i now have the honor of introducing another of our colleagues from florida who served in the army for 24 years and is presently serving in the national guard representative mike wallace thank you [Applause] so as representative rice mentioned i'm a combat veteran myself i've suffered and uh and dealt with ptsd with tbi we need to not be afraid to talk about it we need to not be shy about talking about how devastating it is uh to our veterans community not the ones that have served we still have special operators in 70 to 90 countries on any given day as we speak so two things one that provider in the va should have a full menu besides drugs to provide that veteran whether it's medicinal marijuana whether it is service dogs whether it's hyperbaric chambers we need to expand that menu of options and on service dogs in particular frankly it's ridiculous that the va has taken this long to study their efficacy all of us who have worked with veterans who are veterans uh know that they are beneficial uh know that they are saving lives and the thing that's most striking to me and how many veterans that i talk to that have gone from literally dozens of medications and therapeutics uh to to almost none or none once they get their service dog and i think of you i'd encourage you to take a minute to talk to our veterans that we have here with their dogs the last time we had one of these conferences we had a female veteran who was a heroin addict became a heroin addict after her service to cope with her service and after having her dog not only is she clean she's thriving at her at her job with her family and back in society that's the impact these dogs can have and and will have and it's long past due for the va to provide this as one of the services that they provide to our veterans we cannot sustain the all volunteer military of the future if we have our veterans breaking and we have our families breaking we will have to go to some type of mandatory service if we continue to lose 22 veterans a day to suicide so this isn't just the right thing to do it has national security and strategic implications and i just want to thank uh my wingman sheriff rutherford uh congressman stivers you have just made this a mission and you've got it done not once but twice and a bipartisan fashion no pressure senator and we can get it done you guys yeah you guys can get it done and i look forward to seeing the signed under law and uh and and finally i want to thank k9 for warriors uh just on the edge of my district and congressman rutherford's district for the fantastic work uh they're doing day in day out and the fantastic work they've done up here god bless thanks so much and i am handing off to uh in a bipartisan way from uh we've known each other many years and continue to do a lot of great work together on uh on armed services committee good morning good afternoon everybody thank you congressman waltz um i especially want to thank congressman stivers he's been so committed to passing this bill and i wish him all the best and i want to say as i said yesterday this is really for senator tillis's benefit my biggest issue with working on this bill was not that it was bipartisan was not that congressman stivers was a republican but if i as a michigander can work with someone from ohio [Laughter] if i can tag team with someone who went to ohio state university then anything is possible senator please get this done i will say we have two of these veteran service dog organizations in my district blue star service dogs and veteran service dogs and i have gotten a chance to visit and seen with my own eyes what the impact of a dog plus a veteran who is suffering can have i met people like shane he's a navy vet who adopted and trained his service dog and just to be very specific about it the dog wakes him up from nightmares he picks up things that he's dropped he helps him manage large crowds and get through it um with dignity and the issue is particularly personal to me just because i'm an army wife my stepdaughter is currently active duty my my other stepdaughter is a physician for the va so this issue that i've seen up close and personal and as everyone has said here it's far past time that the va understand this the trainers that are here the veterans that are here they understand the combination of what a service dog and a suffering veteran mean and it's just far past time where the va can mention and notice the same thing i'm very much hoping that we can do this first for uh representative stivers as he heads off into his next job um i feel particularly it's important now more than ever to show a bipartisan effort to get something done it is still possible i think we stand in support of that so with that i will hand it off to representative rutherford good job thank you very much listen i want to say thank you to general strivers because he knows firsthand he's not only a congressman but he's a general and he knows firsthand which i think is why he's so passionate about this issue as well as my good friend mike walsh from the district just below me there in florida we know what these dogs can do the impact that they can have in these veterans lives canines for warriors which is right over here i want to give them a hand they proved us years ago proved to me years ago when i was touring their facility and i actually had a member come up to me and he said you know sheriff but for this dog i wouldn't be here today and he was serious and so not only are we losing 22 a day but these dogs not only stop them from committing suicide but they also allow them to live better lives because they need fewer medications to get through the day and so i'm very proud to be working on this bill with general stivers and mike and all the others you you see here kathleen all these members who really care about our veterans and i'm glad the veterans administration is finally wrapping up their report after years and they're proving what we already knew from canines for warriors these dogs have a very positive impact and now another veteran for you is congresswoman cheryl from new jersey congresswoman thank you [Applause] thank you you know this has been so wonderful so wonderful to work with reps divers and what a crowning achievement to have this get through the house on such a bipartisan basis we don't see that as much as we'd like around here i first came into contact with how helpful service dogs could be for our veterans suffering from ptsd when i was at a firefighter's union picnic and they had passed the hat to get a service dog for a vietnam era veteran from our community so he had been struggling with the after effects of ptsd since his service in vietnam it had gotten to the point where he could barely leave his home but he told us that with this dog he felt comfortable interacting with people again that he got off the multiple medications he was taking and that for the first time in decades he felt like he had his life back and i'll tell you when i think of that it reminds me how critical it is that we act on this quickly so that we can hopefully get so many of our veterans the help they need without them having to suffer for decades so senator tillis if you need any help getting this through the senate i recommend the floor cards that reps divers have at the golden retriever puppy on the bottom i found them very easy to get support for this bill finally i'll say i was just down with our special operators at an exercise yesterday and i talked to classmates of mine from the naval academy who've been on multiple combat tours our military works very very hard to make sure we take care of our operators but with this program we can help ensure another piece of the puzzle to make sure that we're taking care of those who have taken such great care of this nation and of us so thank you so much thanks congresswoman great job and uh as you've gotten a chance to meet all of the leaders in the house on this bill and the leader in the senate and uh kirsten sinema is also a leader in the senate she couldn't be here today but uh she is behind this bill and between what she's going to do and senator tell us is going to do we're going to move it forward in the senate i want to recognize some of our coalition partners on this bill the american legion all-state canines for warriors simple k-9 nestle purina and falls for people it's they've done an incredible job of supporting this legislation as we moved it through now i want to turn it over to mario marquez of the american legion [Applause] good afternoon on behalf of the american legion we'd like to thank you uh for the passage of the puppies assisting wounded service members for veterans therapy act of 2021. it is essential that we get this legislator is nature all the way through as it provides an alternative treatment for veterans serving from mental health conditions such as ptsd offering a wider variety of mental health treatment options encourages help seeking behavior because it allows a veteran to choose their preferred method of treatment and gain a sense of control in their journey to recovering having some sort of normal life our organization is proud to support the efforts to bring this valued resource to the veteran community and we hope that this will make it through the senate with the help of senators my memorial day personally i'm a retired marine sergeant major i retired in december after 31 years and this this piece of legislation is critical to helping those on the inside on the department of defense to have something to look forward to as our veterans transition out and they join the community out here because sometimes it's a lonely journey and i will tell you that my seven month old chocolate labrador retriever who's in training right now has been a life-changing little buddy in my life and so i'm grateful for all of you for everything you're doing thank you so much and let's get this to the finish line please thank you uh now i'd like to introduce desmond spencer from allstate hi everyone i'm desmond spencer from allstate insurance all state is pleased to see the passing of this bill get through the house we sent the letter of support to congress that says as much as a veteran an air force veteran myself i've personally seen the type of benefit that this care can provide to my fellow veterans and family members also as an ohio state graduate and someone someone who is stationed at wright-patterson air force base ohio i'm extremely thrilled to see representative simon so again thank you so much and we look forward to seeing this uh phyllis thanks that's all right now i'd like to introduce bill saltzman from nestle appearance marina [Music] nestle purina petcare is very proud to stand with representatives divers and all the distinguished members today and celebrate the bipartisan passage of the veterans therapy act this bill is important to everyone here because it will mean more veterans will continue on their journey to healing at purina we're driven by a fundamental belief that pets and people are better together we're also a proud military-friendly employer and in 2018 our purina dog chow brand saw the need to train more dogs to be paired with veterans living with ptsd so we created the dog child service dog salute and through this program we work with two outside expert not-for-profits in training the dogs takes a special type of training and we've seen firsthand what the positive impact the life-changing impact is for the veterans and for their families our work continues and over the last three years we have donated 735 000 dollars to train service dogs and we are just getting started so in closing let me emphasize that there is an urgent need to pair more trained service dogs for veterans living with ptsd this training can be costly and it can be time consuming because these dogs learn remarkable skills like reminding the veteran to take their medications and actually laying their body across the veteran to provide a source of comfort when they're having a panic attack um but it's critically important that we continue in this work uh because it is truly life-saving um representative steiners thank you again for being such a courageous and unwavering leader on this important legislation and we're proud to be here with you today now i'd like to bring up patty dodson from canines for warriors good afternoon what a great day this is to be here and celebrate on behalf of canines for warriors our 700 warrior and service dog graduates and also especially our warriors on the wait list the long wait list we want to say how grateful we are to congressman stivers and every member and colleague who has stood shoulder to shoulder with him and has said we can wait no longer to get well-trained service dogs in the hands of our war fighters with ptsd because they served us they protected us valiantly and we owe it to them we are so grateful by congressman stiver's dog determination and his relentless staff has gotten this bill passed again a second time and he has stood with those who said that this is a worthy expenditure and use of our government dollars and not only that we owe that to fulfill this obligation to our veterans so i know and we know there are veterans across the country now aware of this aware of this bill who are out there feeling a renewed sense of hope a renewed sense of faith that hopefully soon they're going to get an opportunity to get into one of these service dog training programs or receive a service dog a well-trained service dog that's going to be complementary to the traditional therapies that have not helped them alone to get past this so we are looking forward to working with the va to show them through rigorous reporting that what we have known beyond a reasonable doubt that these service dogs work there is mounting scientific evidence that show they are not only bringing and restoring life but they're saving lives we have living breathing examples walking this earth we have mindy with tioga and we have jared with tom who because of their service dogs will tell you they're here with us today but more importantly they're with their families and their loved ones as a result of their service dogs so we look forward to working with the senate co-sponsors to get this over the finish line and passed into law and so god bless you all i'd like to to introduce our friends at semper k9 chris beatty chris and his uh a beautiful and amazing wife amanda started semper canines assistance dogs and does similar work that canines the warriors uh does and we [Applause] hello i come to you what i would call the front lines of disabled veterans uh myself canines warriors pause for people pause for pets those excuse me pause for vets we're all working with these veterans coming out of the military trying to transition and dealing with mental health and up until the purdue university in canada's warriors up until the va study and the results came out that you know there there is these signs of empirical evidence these service dogs are directly affecting the lives of our veterans coming out so myself with separate canine as well as canines for warriors and all the the frontline workers service dog providers and organizations out there providing those know that hey pass that the passing of this bill provides direct coverage and direct acceptance of service dogs for veterans dealing with post-traumatic stress traumatic brain injury and military sexual trauma so anything that's helping veterans anything that we consider successful and effective we're all for we look forward to this as well as all the members that have co-sponsored and they're following this bill you know the the results are out there um so definitely uh yeah everybody kind of uh i'm sorry a little emotional in my apologies so um we've seen i've gotten a lot of phone calls a lot of messages from people just just because of this press conference that you know everybody's very excited the entire veteran community is very excited to finally see some some headways of some progress and uh the struggles that the organizations and these veterans are dealing with so thank you very much as well another service on recipient randy powers with pause for vets [Applause] thank you and how many different ways can we say thank you for allowing this bill to go through the past and you're absolutely changing not only veterans but everybody's life it's not just the veteran that benefits by having these dogs and by having a bill which will make it a little bit easier for veterans with pts and other psychological issues you're also saving families you're saving the family unit the children in the family the spouse so what you're doing is helping all of us we appreciate it general congratulations sir thank you ma'am i appreciate everything senator so thank you and we're available for questions if anybody has questions for the senator or any of the any of the speakers anybody any questions you mentioned memorial day have you found any real opposition to this bill we haven't yet you know we have a process that we can go through to hotline it to see if there are any objections and i have the right to offer it up for unanimous consent i would like to make progress on this quickly it's something that you can see you know like i said earlier it'd be hard to get on the suspension counter resolution recognizing that the sky is blue and so they did this and they worked harder over a year so i think it's really on memorial day in particular i think you got to listen to what congressman stauber said and what others have said an average of 22 veterans take their life every single day in this country and this is something that will save lives why wait it

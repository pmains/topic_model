first men garrett graves congressman graves with a background dealing with our coast working heavily with couple issues we're going to talk about today so with that let me welcome in congressman graves good morning hey good morning great to see you uh good to see you as well so congressman's couple issues i want to get in into with you today number one some people are starting to see this as they get flood insurance renewals or maybe if they initiate new policies but fema recently implemented something called risk rating 2.0 with the national flood insurance program can you just tell us a little bit about what that actually is and why fema is doing it yeah so so risk rating 2.0 it is a it is an attempt by fema to to move to what they're calling a risk-based flood insurance premium system this isn't anything new this whole idea came up during the obama administration they realized the flaws in it and and said look we're not going to do this it came up again during the trump administration they said the same thing but now this new administration has moved forward with it and and what's happening is they have begun disconnecting the mapping system for flood risk with the way that they calculate your rates and and i mean this whole idea seems crazy so on the one hand they have a mapping system that says hey here are the people that are vulnerable here are the areas that are going to flood then they use an entirely different calculation to determine what your flood insurance rates are so dr steve what we've seen is in some cases in in the lower portions of south louisiana and in uh areas like lafourche and saint charles we've seen rates going up from 560 600 700 a year up to 7 000 8 000 and almost 9 000 a year and so this is pricing people out of being able to live in these communities forcing your home value to significantly be decreased and it's all about their effort to try to bring the flood insurance program back into solvency back into the black but when you actually go to a deep dive on the program you realize that its finances really aren't out of whack and it's largely been a mismanaged program since you bring that up at last check i'd seen that the flood insurance program was something like maybe over 20 billion dollars in debt and if you look at the numbers they had to borrow 18 billion back in 2005 post katrina to pay a bunch of claims here in louisiana the new orleans area at least we could say was a man-made disaster a lot of people agree on that with the levy failures so how much do we attribute to mismanagement of the program when you think about that the programs over 20 billion in debt right now had to borrow 18 billion back then and is it unfair that louisiana is bearing so much burden with the changes to this program well so i'll answer your first question first on the on the on the borrowing and the debt yes hurricane katrina the corps of engineers came out the head of the corps of engineers came out and said it was a man-made failure it was an engineering failure and it was their fault well look if this were a private contractor that private contractors insurance would be paying for covering the liability in this case just because it's the federal government that means that taxpayers through higher insurance premiums should be paying it that's not really fair the the other major contribution to the debt was hurricane harvey where you had rainfall totals i think approaching 46 inches 46 inches of rain in hurricane harvey and sometimes when you have those one-offs those extraordinary events you you've got to say you know what look this one's so far out of bounds that we can't really consider this being a liability of the flood insurance program and so i think that some of those really extraordinary events we've got to look at differently but dr steve i think we need to be approaching the way that we do this we can't just have a flood insurance program that prices people out of protection over here and have a totally dysfunctional hurricane protection and flood control program and coastal restoration effort over here we've got to connect these things where are there liabilities where is their the greatest potential to have rates increase and let's not go out there and tell these people sorry your house is now just effectively a loss your mortgage is upside down instead come in and say hey here's where we need to prioritize flood protection investments let's make these communities safer to where they don't have these unaffordable rates so that's the strategy we've been trying to pursue is connecting the dots on these two disconnected efforts one of the biggest criticism so far risk rating 2.0 is that fema has not been very transparent with the model they're using to come up with their rates do you know why they're not being transparent and what do you know in terms of how they're calculating these rates so so i started i look we started watching what they were doing in april well i think it was the back in february when we first reached out to them was raising strong concerns in april we had a phone call with them in may we had a phone call with them i was talking to the acting administrator assistant administrator the head of the flood insurance program the fourth phone call they finally said we're going to put you on the phone with our contractor no one could answer our questions they couldn't explain to us the very transparency issue that you just brought up and dr steve one of the things that they said to us over and over again is they said hey look we're never gonna see these rates go up to you know four thousand five thousand six thousand dollars from again five and six hundred dollars and so as soon as we started getting some of these raids coming into us we went through we said hey we're seeing exactly what you said was not going to happen was impossible and they said oh this isn't right only to come back to us and confirm oh oh actually these are right so they don't even have any idea what it is that they're pushing they can't explain it there was a group called first street excuse me 1st street foundation they did an analysis of these new rates found that the state of louisiana was the only state in the country that was being overcharged under this new system i mean the whole thing is fatally flawed the reason that you keep it black box the reason that you don't share data and information is because it is not defendable and and that's what's going on right now i have offered amendments over and over again trying to block this from being implemented trying to allow flood insurance policy holders to choose between the old rate system or the new rate system this thing is not ready for prime time and the fact that both the obama and the trump administration did not implement this is speaks pretty loudly to to suggest that this this whole idea is just foundationally or fundamentally flawed and is not ready for prime time so you talk about louisiana potentially being overcharged here and we're not a very big state population wise but it's something like one in ten national flood insurance policies are right here in louisiana and the advocate the time speaking and they published an article not too long ago they said something they had done analysis and they found something on the order one in ten people might see increases greater than 400 percent on their policies what is that going to do to people you kind of hit on that a little bit and i guess part b is have you heard of any of those sorts of increases happening closer to metro baton rouge or is a little more that more focused farther south and closer to new orleans yeah so so second question first on on we have seen some of these uh exponential or or multiple times rate increases much closer to the capital region uh policies and baton rouge policies in livingston parish some areas of lower ascension as well we've seen some of these rate increases but look these are people that reach out to us that share their data with us and so that's how we're finding out about it because fema is not transparent will not otherwise share data with us so so that's a a major issue and it is a problem in regard to the fact that louisiana has some of the the highest percentages of policies in the nation something you have to keep in mind and it's something fema just just continues to ignore look we're at the bottom of one of the largest watersheds in the world in in our region in the capital region we drain the state of montana we drain the state of new york and we drain parts of canada and so this is again one of the largest watersheds in the world it all comes funneling down to us and so are we at greater risk yeah you can you can absolutely make that argument we've seen record water levels in the mississippi river in the last 10 years you know more than we've ever seen before but it's not because of water we're putting into the river how do you charge us for things we don't have control over how do you charge us for water from nebraska iowa again new york montana and canada you can't do that secondly with the erosion of our coast but the corps of engineers did an incredibly successful flood protection project and that they they were able a navigation project to keep the mississippi river between the levees to have deep draft navigation to no longer have this delta switching or river changing course but it also caused one of the greatest environmental disasters in our nation's history and that's the loss of 2 000 square miles of our coast making the very goal of flood protection in jeopardy because now you've got erosion on the back side of the levees making us more susceptible so we've got challenges in the north all the river water we've got challenges from the south with all the coastal erosion both of which are really caused by the federal government yet they're trying to charge us in louisiana for it that's just not fair it's not just and risk rating 2.0 fails to take that into consideration let me ask you this do we have any idea they're starting to some private flood insurance options are starting to pop up is privatizing the flood insurance program is that the route to go or do you think it would just become too expensive for many of us here in south louisiana if it went that route so it depends on how you do it generally and you know this i mean generally is is the private sector more efficient than the the federal government absolutely the problem with implementing a private system is this if you're a private insurance company and you're looking at insurance policies what you're going to probably do is go cherry pick the low risk and the medium risk policies leaving the higher risk policies alone the the reason insurance works is because you have a diversity of risk in your portfolio you have the high risk and the low risk and they help offset one another um by allowing for the private sector to to really open it up and allow them to step into this area they're probably going to cherry pick again the the low and the moderate risk policies leaving all the high-risk policies which means a lot of people in south louisiana that eliminates your diversity of risk which means that the rates in louisiana would go up even more than we're seeing right now so if you did a an aggressive private sector insurance uh flood insurance which looked the market already exists today to some degree you've got to make sure that they don't come cheering pick that you ensure they have diversity of risk in their portfolio um otherwise louisiana you think rates are high now just wait they're going to get significantly okay so risk rating 2.0 that's one concern headed in uh hurricane season here in south louisiana another is that we're entering another hurricane season without the comey diversion project completed in march 2021 the announcement was made that it looked like we were on track to have it completed by the end of 2022 recently we heard about more delays congressman this was a project that was originally conceived after the 1983 flood as you know right and then taxpayers started paying on it in the year 2000 2001 something like that more than 20 years now how is it that more than 20 years later we're still waiting on this project well look there's a there's a good news here and i want to i want to start with that but the good news is that this project as you just said has been stuck since like 1982-83 and and made very little progress when when i started this job in in 2015 in the first month we were in office we got more money than had i think it was it was like six times more money that had been appropriated over the previous seven years we did that in one month and so um and and then in 2016 before the flood we got another chunk of money for this project in fact i've sent a letter to the governor explaining that if the state didn't put up a match we were going to lose some of the significant federal funds and then we were able to get all of the remaining funds for this project appropriated which at the time was 392 million dollars were able to cobble together those funding sources which was everything that the corps of engineers said was needed i want to remind you that this project actually when it was authorized by congress they said it was going to cost 183 million dollars 183 million we ended up getting 392 million dollars projects moving forward and they told us it was going to be finished by december of 2021 and and i've never seen the corps of engineers hit a deadline that they set themselves but in any case we we said look we've given you all the money we're going to give you the benefit of doubt be optimistic here because normally they get money that kind of trickles in not only uh and look i built these projects much of my life i was watching their progress and i told them well ahead of march of 2021 you are not on track to finish this project on time you're going to oversee you're going to exceed costs you're going to exceed your timeline and they kept telling me i was wrong kept telling me i was wrong finally i sent him a letter and i said i want you to respond in writing they wrote back and said okay we're going to be a year late it's going to be december 2022 which was a 50 increase 50 percent increase in their timeline in their schedule then to have them come back to me and say all right and it's not 392 million we now are 125 million short which look money didn't grow on trees it is very very difficult to get that kind of money appropriated for a single project especially after we had gotten such a huge sum just a few years before despite all those challenges we were able to secure an additional 128 million dollars for this project only to have them come back and tell us okay now we're not on trajectory for 2022 december but probably 2023 december or even later it is infuriating it is absolutely infuriating to watch this look we broke through the administrative hurdles the environmental problems that this project had we broke through the funding issues got all those things done those were the things that stopped this project historically we got them all done and now you've got major problems that the state in my opinion is mishandling and the corps of engineers mishandling regard real estate this gas pipeline there were issues with the railroad that we helped broker the deal on but this is just awful what's going on and and let me let me circle back with some good news dr steve there is a little bit of other good news and that is that the way that this project's being done um you don't have to have the whole thing built before you're going to start seeing flood protection benefits so there are other things that are going on other components of this project where you will see incremental progress and lastly and lastly there are actually other complementary investments that we're making in the capital region uh to the tune when you start adding it all up we're probably approaching a billion dollars of new investment in flood protection in our region that's going to help to to really improve flood protection and make our community safer i know you're busy in the nation's capital just want to ask one or two more questions before we let you go so there there certainly has been some improvement on this comey diversion project even with the latest news and more delays one of my concerns personally is that maybe some people see this as a silver bullet for flooding across parts of the comet and amy to basins and maybe overestimating the impact there was a study in 2016 or or somebody with the meat river basin commission i think said uh post 26 with the 2016 flood had the canal been there uh maybe 20 to 25 percent of the homes that have flooded wouldn't have flooded uh but you're still looking at so 75 that would have do you have concerns about that that people might overestimate the impact of this canal but first this project is is a really important project and just from a plumbing perspective what this does is is as people believe that that we all drain the mississippi river in our region we really don't we largely drained the lake marple lake pontchartrain then in the lake born in the gulf of mexico so you have the the combat river that kind of flows northwest down the southeast yeah they made river that largely flows to northeast to southwest and then they come together and confluences is just over on the on the west side of denham springs and then it continues down as the amid river what this project does is it builds a 12-mile canal running from the coming river over to the west of mississippi it takes large volumes of water out of the comet river and ultimately the amy and sends it over to the mississippi river where you have excess capacity during high rainfall periods in in our region so so this is a game changer in terms of relieving some of these huge flows on the comed river in some cases dr steve as you know this will bring down water levels as much as six feet in some communities in other areas you're exactly right it may just be a few inches but as we learned in the 2016 flood and you know better than i do every storm is not the same it depends on where the storm goes um in a storm that comes in north of baton rouge this will be a game changer type project for for storms that come in south of baton rouge this is not going to have that big of an impact that's why it's important and i mentioned that this is one project in a larger portfolio of an estimated billion dollars in new flood protection investments in our region everything from what we refer to as the five values project a quarter of a billion dollars the highway 22 project another 50 million dollars we gave 112 million dollars to east baton rouge parish for for flood mitigation projects 68 million dollars in livingston parish for flood mitigation projects another 65 million dollars in in livingston parish for they've cleaned out nearly 400 miles clearing and snagging rivers ditches canals bayous this is all part of a portfolio of projects designed to address our flooding problems and one of them i didn't bring up is that that whole alligator bayou bayou paul area over at edwardville ascension in east baton rouge parishes that have flooded down there in the south of you club saint gabe earlier we've got to address that as well and we've got solutions moving forward there on bayou manchester as we speak so look really important you're exactly right that you can't prepare for the last storm you've got to be thinking about all of these different scenarios and i think this billion dollars of new investment it takes us a major step in the right direction and is going to ultimately make our community safer and lower flooded church rates i think that's a key point no two storms are alike everyone is different all right so hurricane season the start is a couple days away any last words for people here in south louisiana watching as another season approaches coming off of two record-setting seasons uh here in louisiana right louisiana south louisiana is one of the greatest places in the nation to live but along with all those great things that we love about our community there are some challenges and hurricanes and major storms is one of them the best thing in the world that we can do is make sure that you have a good strategy the state's got the website get a gayplan.org i think it's really important that you be safe i talk to more people after hurricane ida more people in my entire life that said that they regretted staying that they regretted staying and trying to ride out that storm and uh so i think it's really good advice that uh the best thing we can do is to be safe take our families and go places that are safe and make sure that you have a strategy to do that and don't get caught flat footed as we saw with many folks in the aftermath of hurricane katrina we hear that so often about regretting staying after the storm congressman garrett graves joins us from washington d.c where he's busy at work thank you so much for the time that you've given us this morning you bet dr steve thank you

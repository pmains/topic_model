uh the cdc has been referenced uh by my colleagues but i i i think we should all take seriously this report recently published by the cdc that found that there is little evidence that schools have contributed meaningfully to increase community transmission of cobit as any concerned parent would do i went to my own pediatrician i have a nine-year-old and a seven-year-old and i asked my own pediatrician i said tell me doctor what what about this cdc study and what about dr fauci who says we should safely return students to classrooms is this true or or what does the american academy of pediatrics have to say about this and he said it is absolutely a a disaster that local school boards states governors continue in the in in the face of uh the cumulative scientific evidence uh to continue to shut down schools when the weight of the science is that it's doing much more harm than good the biden administration and my colleagues uh on the other side of the aisle on this committee are saying that even more needs to be done uh despite the insight from experts and beyond that of the billions of dollars we have already appropriated to schools though i would say that this amendment is needed because the science from the pediatricians is get the kids back in school because they are a extremely low transmission risk to teachers they don't transmit um my pediatrician said that that most of the kids who get covet they get it because they're home because they're more at risk of getting coveted trent of contracting covet from adults uh in in the household as opposed to the lower risk at schools so i don't know why we don't listen to pediatricians in this country anymore why we don't listen to concerned parents why we don't listen to uh mental health experts why don't we listen to economists who say that these kids are gonna lose out in the long run in terms of economic opportunity why we're listening to teachers unions instead of actual scientists and pediatricians we need to open the schools we need to open them now i urge my colleagues to think of the kids and the cats uh and and vote for my friend georgia and hispanics

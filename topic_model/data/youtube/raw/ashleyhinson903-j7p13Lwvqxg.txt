first of all when it comes to arpa they called it the American Rescue plan and I voted against a bill that included massive amounts of spending that didn't go to covid-19 only about nine percent of that bill actually went to Public Health which is what it was intended to do and so I think that's wrong it was sending checks to prisoners people like the Boston Marathon bummer that's your paycheck in Nancy Pelosi's hands going to prisoners so I voted against that

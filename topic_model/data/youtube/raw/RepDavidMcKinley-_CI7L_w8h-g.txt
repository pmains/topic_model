Thank You mr. chairman Deb mr. Thompson I'm just I want to focus him back in on the enhanced oil recovery you aware that earlier this year there was an amendment on the floor that was adopted by congressman Connolly they cut the research funding in the enhanced oil recovery I'm not familiar with that yeah the so when we hear the folks on the other side are talking about this they if we know this is going to be part of the solution this is where we need to be focusing on but yet all these members of mr. Doyle one of them that voted to cut the funding I find that very interesting but let me let me build on that just a little bit in fact all the Democrats did if the if the oil industry if you owe industry because I'm somewhat aware of this process so if the oil industry finds us as a possibility of an increased recovery instead of well how many of them are contributing from the oil industry how many of them are contributing to the carbon capture research so that that would enable that to occur to provide them with a supply of material or any oil companies contributing to the CCS research sure Michelle among others is do you have it you have numbers for that how much are they continue reading a million or they treat had no major dollars no i don't but what I'd be happy to do is after the I think I'd like to understand more about really happy to is there going to be the ones you're going to benefit from this I think they are the ones who should be contributing the money for it let's go back now dr. lash off I'm just curious if you it was touched on just a minute ago about the co2 emissions are you aware that the co2 emissions and are in across North America down 20 / it down to a low that hasn't been seen in 20 years yes I am I published a report on that month or so ago and so with that you use you think we ought to go even need to continue this this message is this fight well the amount of co2 in the atmosphere is twenty-five percent higher than was one in the year i was born with 1959 and what we need to do is stabilize that level the US needs to reduce further certainly china and india also need to reduce the USS to provide leadership because what you're saying is it's the main culprit i think i heard you say that's the main culprit of global warming carbon dioxide traps heat in the atmosphere it would be remarkable if it weren't causing global warming and in fact we're seeing global so you do you disagree with with dr. Lewis a how Louis went when he resigned from his position with the American physicist society when he said this is the greatest pseudoscience fraud perpetrated on America yeah I totally disagree with that I would assume you do but I think several others have joined him in resigning with it but because there are other scientists who disagree with you on that that this is being used for other purposes so I look at what how Lewis is said and if you look back at the Milankovitch back there Serbian physicists back in the last generate last century that by virtue of his own studies have predicted that this is what was going to happen at this gent this time in our history are you aware of that I am I look scientists will always disagree with each other that's what they do that's how they make a living is writing papers to disagree with other scientists if we predicated policy on unanimity among scientists on any issue we would never do anything you recognize true that the National Geographic just came out with a study that says we're we're just coming out of an ice age of mini ice age and therefore we should it be expecting higher temperatures today I haven't seen that particular National Geographic article but the fact is that the amount of heat-trapping that the excess co2 that we put into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels is now a much bigger factor in influencing the Earth's climate than the Milankovitch cycles and that and and what we've had historically we've entered a new era that many scientists call the so my point here is given that there's not unit ebony and I remember earlier last year when Lisa Jackson came before she said it's all it's all been decided that global warming is anthropogenic global warming is man-made cause and it's its co2 driven that there is no argument anymore but but you also just acknowledge that that's not that the science is still up in the air over that issue so I accept that that there is not there is not a lack of unanimity on it because what we're about to do here is allow the EPA to impose a regulation that's the purpose of my bill which wait just hold back if we had the scientific maze at ways to do anything to go ahead and implement it but when we don't have the technology available let's hold back because there's enough evidence that possibly co2 is not contributing to as much of the problem as you're suggesting that it is so let's just hold back I've run out my lover my link in the bank just answer quickly I didn't I don't agree that the science is up in the air I said that there's not unanimity among scientists and there won't be but the National Academy of Science said that the idea that carbon dioxide is contributing to climate change is as well proven as gravity and I think that's a strong basis for making policy the gentleman's time has expired the gentleman from Massachusetts is recognized for five minutes could you recognize someone from the minority and then come back to me is that possible mr. Sherman the gentleman yields back will you wait okay thank you yes back okay well he needs me reading and mr. chairman well the gentleman yield for 30 seconds no well I i I'm ready to go if the gentleman if the minority doesn't do a majority rather the majority does not have need tab to time so here's what I here's what i would say thank you mr. chairman here's what i would say that coal has dropped from 51% of electrical generation down to thirty five percent over the last five years but there's a concomitant trend as well which is in operating simultaneously which is that natural gas has risen from twenty one percent to thirty percent so there's a war between fossil fuels going on in our country right now by the way the same thing is happening on home heating oil in new england the market for home heating oil is collapsing as the price of natural gas is rising now why is that because natural gas is so much less expensive than home he'd know the price of natural gas has collapsed in terms of

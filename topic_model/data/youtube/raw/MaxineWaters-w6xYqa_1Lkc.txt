who really the cronies are and who really lines up with the oil industry for more let me bring in california congresswoman maxine waters she wants to prohibit any new drilling and impose a moratorium on all offshore drilling congresswoman good to have you with us tonight thanks so much delighted to be with you and i thank you so very much for giving me an opportunity to join with many others who are just outraged at this environmental disaster the worst in our history as it relates to oil drilling and to not only keep the pressure on vp but to talk about this whole claims process i was down there and i talked with the small oyster fisherman and i don't want them to have to jump through all kind of hoops in order to be uh paid the first thing they did with these claims was they tried to make them settlements and of course we had some smart pro bono lawyers down there who changed that and wouldn't allow them to sign anything that looked like a settlement we forced them to bring the claims office closer to these small fishermen and we've got to make sure that they don't give them so many uh hoops to jump through in order to get a claim resolved uh that they never get anything so we want the federal government to do some oversight on that also uh well what is the federal government congresswoman how would this be administered i mean i've heard comments coming from politicians saying that vp is going to make the people of the region whole now who in the heck is going to have the oversight of that this is going to go on for years if not even a decade or two i mean how are you going to make it we have to number one what we have to do is quickly construct a system by which we not only use our government resources and power to put together claims process that will force them to have to pay the money uh and even if we have to step in we have to make sure they have a system where we get our money back from them but the first thing to do is to make sure that these billions of dollars that it's going to cost them will be paid in the claims process in a way that's expedited to keep them from having to jump through through many hooks that's why when they do that okay well uh so you can order a multinational corporation via legislation for them to write checks i mean this is going to be interesting and i'm all sure we can but okay well it didn't happen with the exxon valdez i mean that as a matter of fact what the judge was well let me just say this all of those members of congress and public policy makers who have been standing up for the oil companies and making sure that they protected them you know screaming about our dependence on foreign oil and talking about drill baby drill their mouths are being shut now with this disaster they cannot credibly stand up and support them they're going to have to vote uh to have a claims process that makes good sense and that will reimburse all of these small fishermen whose livelihoods depend on this and so we're in a good position to demand a moratorium at this point okay good part let's talk about offshore drilling there's a cbs news poll out there and it seems that a week ago 46 45 of the people favored it now it's down to 40 and the opposition is growing from 46 now up to 51 percent of the american people to pose offshore drilling what does this mean if you listen to bobby jindal if you listen to uh malanson the congressman from down there and also haley barbour he doesn't even think there's a spill going on down there i mean you listen to some of these republicans and some democrats that they want to continue to drill exactly what do you want to do now that public opinion is on your side we want the moratorium uh listen let me tell you these people that you're referring to no they're late in catching up with what the public is saying i was at a senior citizens meeting where i went to talk about medicare the senior said ah we want to talk about this oil spill and they said we don't want the citizens to have to pay for it we want bp to have to pay for it and so they want us to set up a process where we can force bp to pay for it these people will probably end up making about what 27 billion dollars this year what we have to be careful about is they're going to set aside amount uh you know to pay dividends and all of that but we can't let them come back to us and say oh oh we run out of money no we can't allow that to happen congresswoman waters great to have you with us tonight thanks for keeping up

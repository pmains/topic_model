very much mr. chairman I think I'm gonna ask this question of you mister Glick it seems to me the the President and Secretary Perry are doubling down on this common sense defying plan to blow up the energy markets by issuing an emergency order to subsidize uncompetitive energy facilities and this strikes me as real abuse of power but when I want to get into with you specifically is what this is going to mean for consumers bills I mean what is this going to mean for households across America because when you have set aside all the lingo that we use around here the chair and I used to talk about it when I was chairman of this committee half the time you can't even figure out what language is being discussed here but I can tell you people in homes they understand what it means for their bills now we looked at one analysis I gather they are pretty widely respected the PJM people I guess they also are connected to the market monitor and they determined that the average family would pay about two hundred and fifty dollars more per year and wouldn't be getting anything do you generally share that view senator thanks for the question the numbers I've seen suggest that there's been a wide range but suggest that the the proposal if it's implemented the proposal in the memo could actually increase rates nationwide up to 65 billion dollars now that's that may be on the high mark but still it's pretty good it's gonna be pretty significant what the memo essentially is calling for okay let me stop you there cuz I want to hear it so if anything your take right now is that amount could be low what I just asked about no no I'm not I think that's an upper upper boundary okay so give us the range the ballpark for the sumer what you think is most likely well again I haven't done haven't seen the actual I'll read all the now say stone and what we know because we've got this independent watchdog which is widely respected so go ahead sure so basically what the memo is requiring is if the memo was implemented would require essentially that instead of lower-cost energy being dispatched they dispatched higher cost energy it's clearly going to raise rates the question is how much I've seen any estimates between thirty billion and sixty five billion in terms of what what the impact might be it's something I saw yesterday but we could provide greater example for the record I wanna if Senator if I can get back to your point because basically you made the right point which is you have to actually create a record you have to have evidence in the record when I was at the Department of Energy during the Western energy crisis during 1999 and 2000 we actually invoked both statutes that the memo suggests invoking one of them is the 202 C of the federal Power Act the other ones the defense production Act in both cases there was a clearly an emergency at west as you will recall companies weren't selling power into California because the California px and other purchasers of power weren't creditworthy and so we created a record we had the record there truly was an emergency we issued several orders primarily using the federal Power Act to require generators to sell power into California and once requiring a natural gas provider to sell natural gas into into California because there was an emergency regarding supplying a defense facility up there but again there was right there was evidence in the record in this case I think what we're trying to do is get to the solution before we actually build the records she's adjusting that there's actually an emergency I think that is way too logical and clearly that is not what's being done but I'm just going to close with with this and I'm very anxious to work with my colleagues senator Manchin my friend is here when I was chair I came to West Virginia and there were plenty of things we can work you know together on what I'm troubled about cuz I just had town meetings at home nobody said hey run we need to have an emergency here that requires that you go out and raise our you know power bills and that is I think what people are gonna take away from this so we're going to continue our dialogue and work with colleagues on both both sides and I especially appreciate that last point that you made is that this is really jumping the gun here that there really aren't the facts on the record that would justify treating this as an emergency and if you're gonna raise people's power bills which you know Americans understand if you're in a national emergency in the country's well-being everybody whether learn West Virginia or again we step up because we're for the red white and blue but I sure don't see any evidence of an emergency here that justifies raising people's power bills along the lines of what you've described and I thank you and thank you madam chair Thank You senator

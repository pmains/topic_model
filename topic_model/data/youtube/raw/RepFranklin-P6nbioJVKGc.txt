thank you mr chairman and in the interest of time i do have a couple questions for uh general mackenzie uh first following up on um representative walt's dialogue earlier regarding basing in the region and the changes we're now going to face with afghanistan not being there with physical presence on the ground i think back to just after 9 11 i was in bahrain we were planning some of those initial strikes into afghanistan the challenge we had with was long distances to make those happen and we had carrier uh pilots that were flying eight to ten hour missions with multiple refuelings to get there um that's obviously going to be a challenge if we find ourselves having to go back in and that kind of scale in the future but in your testimony you had mentioned pursuing opportunities to enhance expeditionary basing in less vulnerable areas of the aor could you expand a little bit on those and where they may stand certainly when we talk about that i am primarily talking about the iran problem and the fact that our bases now such as al ud al-dhafra monoma bahrain as you noted have the virtue of being close to the area you might want to fight they also have the problem being very close to the iranians so we would seek to do is examine alternatives further to the west and the arabian peninsula that would make it more difficult for the iranians to target our bases there it would increase the reins many of their weapons would not actually have the range to reach out there and and get to those bases the problem would be the tanker bill that's associated with that on the other hand if the tanker can survive out to the west it's probably better than it being close where it can be struck so there's a trade-off that we make and we look to our partners to help us on this with these bases and we've never looked at base permanently there rather you'd like to have the ability to go in there as you noted in an expeditionary manner in a time of crisis or in a time of war just to make it harder for an opponent to threaten the force great thank you switching gears to the displaced persons camps in northeast syria particularly al-nal i guess from your testimony general we talked about 61 000 people there 94 women and children two-thirds under 18. i mean in addition to the obvious humanitarian crisis i know there's a big problem with the radicalization of a lot of these children so this i guess would be a question for you general mackenzie and also ms dory what's the way ahead in that how do we fix this problem i know a lot of the countries that these people are coming from don't want them back what's the end game for this sure so i'll defer to ms dory here in just a minute but i will say it is not a military problem but it will manifest itself in five to ten years as a military problem unless we solve it now because the children are going to grow up radicalized and we're going to see them on battlefields fighting us so it is an international problem it requires repatriation it requires nations to step up to the plate claim their citizens bring them home reintegrate them back into their communities and it demands de-radicalization which is extremely difficult to do it is best done and practiced by nations in the region who have a cultural affinity for the people that are largely in this camps it is it's a tough problem our diplomats department of state usaid and a lot of ngos are working at this very hard it is one of the most pressing problems we have in the centcom region right now with that i'll defer to ms dory for anything she'd like to add i think general mckenzie put it beautifully it's not a military problem it is an interagency issue and it's a question of political will in terms of uh host nations for the individuals who are in the camps so what pressure do we have that we can apply to to get these folks to step up and accept these people and we can't leave them there in the desert forever i think it depends on which countries you're talking about in the state of the dialogue with them what what uh forms of dialogue and leverage we have at our disposal to to encourage stepping up to that responsibility okay thank you mr chairman and you're back

thank you madam chair and I appreciate the opportunity to come down and speak about a very important issue that I know as important to you as well as myself because the Great Lakes are facing a crisis right now the Great Lakes navigation system is a critical international waterway that extends from the western part of Lake Superior in fact that point and in the western part of Lake Superior is further west than st. Louis Missouri further west in st. Louis Missouri the Gateway to the West and it extends all the way along the st. Lawrence Seaway to the Atlantic Ocean a distance of over 2,400 miles 2,400 miles in this portion this us portion of the systems includes a hundred and forty harbors 60 of which aren't as quote commercial and 80 as recreational and harbors of refuge and over 600 miles of maintained navigation channels the system can handle 200 million tons of cargo that generate and sustain nearly 130,000 good-paying jobs in the eight great lakes States not to mention what happens to our friends to the north and east and in the Canadian provinces and how important that relationship is with our with that trade that goes on and while the army corps event corps of engineers national operations and maintenance account has increased by twenty percent from 1995 through 2012 the annual budget for the cores maintenance of harbors and navigation channels in the Great Lakes has remained virtually unchanged during that same period well we all know that those challenges that we're facing as a nation financially and fiscally but that madam chair does not seem right or fair to me and it certainly is not a knowledge Minh of the importance of the Great Lakes to our vital economy you know there's 18 million cubic yards of sentiment right now clogging the Great Lakes ports and waterways and which has reduced the amount of cargo ship by over 500,000 tons over the course of the navigation season to put this number in the context i own a gravel pit alright i have dump trucks that that go out and around and a normal size standard dump truck is 10 yards if you're going out there to put in context 18 million yards of cont√© of sediment that would be like 1.8 million dump trucks loads of sediment that is out there right now and in fiscal year 12 the core received 45 million for maintenance dredging and 95 million for navigation structural maintenance in the Great Lakes but it's going to cost more than 200 million dollars to restore ports and waterways to what their design depth and width is in order to make up that shortfall of state of Michigan recently authorized over 20 million dollars state funds only and emergency dredging funds to ensure that commerce tourism and jobs remained available in port cities big and small I commend the state of Michigan however the federal government has a constitutional requirement to maintain those interstate commerce through those ports and in and among the states as well as internationally the the funds that come from the harbor maintenance trust fund are paid for as a user fee of point sorry 0.125 percent on the value of cargo ship and the previous year that equated to 1.7 billion dollars which was paid into the fund but only eight hundred and four million dollars was used for dredging and maintenance of our harbors because the trench the trust fund frankly has been rated over over the years to pay for other projects an unrelated project sometimes but I'd like to thank my colleague for working towards a solution to this problem by reprioritizing spending which is really what this is all about we know that we have to reapply reprioritize and reflect a billion-dollar disbursed disbursement from the harbor maintenance trust fund to the bill and encourage funding in the future and I know that there's some specific language in madam chair had I've been able to beam down here I would have offered an amendment that that would have clarified making sure that 30 million dollars that is put in for small ports and susta subsistence ports would have would have been more clear but in the meantime we must act before the crisis and the Great Lakes grows worse and I thank my friend from New Jersey for the work that he has done on this bill and while i'd prefer more clarity i'm satisfied with the intent of the committee to our ports big and small for that I yield back gentleman yields back his time Madame Girard New Jersey move to strike the last word gentleman's probably five minutes let me say the gentleman from Michigan I want to thank him for being a strong advocate force sufficiently maintaining his waterways in the nation's waterways so these ports and channels are very important not only to the Great Lakes economy but to our national economy and I want to commend him too for his attention to the needs of his constituents he's extremely knowledgeable from a professional point of view and certainly as a member of Congress devoted to the needs of his constituents the committee heard from many members including those from the Great Lakes concerned that the administration's budget processing has left small remote substance and ports across the nation unable to continue to conduct business due to inadequate or oftentimes non-existence maintenance these are what prompted the committee to include a minimum of 30 million dollars to be made available to such reports the Great Lakes ports will certainly be eligible for this funding I believe our bill addresses his concerns to the greatest priority possible in light of other priorities which he mentioned in our bill which is obviously balancing the federal budget and controlling spending I want to thank our colleague for bringing the concerns the great like ports to our attention will do our level best to work with you we honor your request and I yield back the balance of my time

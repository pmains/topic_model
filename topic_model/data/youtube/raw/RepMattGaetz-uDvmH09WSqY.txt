it's just technology for you yes thank the gentleman for yielding and with all due respect the gentleman from Arizona he's very weird in that he runs his congressional office like a think-tank where people contemplate the ways the technology can improve healthcare in the environment in a non-partisan way because these are not issues that have anything to do with whether someone is a Republican or a Democrat but just so many of these ideas that we the gentleman and I've discussed for years failed to make their way into a the most dynamic economy and market place in the world which is the United States of America and so my question for the gentleman is how do we go from the innovative space of great American's coming up with sensor technology to action in the Congress or within our government that is that is worthy of the great people we serve and I yield back to the gentleman and thank him for the gentleman be willing to enter into a colloquy so we can just go back and forth I would okay look you're one of my buddies from Florida you actually get this but you also know I actually love the technology disruptions because none of us have figured out if it's Republican or Democrat yet which actually makes it possible for us to do it now eventually we will break it into partisan because everything has become weaponized and partisan around this body but right now think of this this is a natural gas electric facility it can power 5,000 homes it is up and running outside Houston it doesn't have a smokestack all the a co2 so all the carbon is captured they actually came up with this brilliant technology that the carbon actually flows through and I believe in fact my understanding of the engineering it helps spin the turbines and then the excess carbon that's that's generated is saved and so it is my sincere hope that this is a discussion that we can have with members of Congress from urban districts rural districts liberal members conservative members because as the gentleman correctly points out these are actually solutions that do not lend themselves to a partisan tilt and I'm sincerely hopeful that the gentleman will continue to lead on the subject I yield back and I thank the gentleman you're very kind thank you for the colloquy

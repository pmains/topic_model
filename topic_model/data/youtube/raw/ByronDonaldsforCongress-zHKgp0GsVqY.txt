when it comes to health care there is one principle that we all have to live by that's the federal government has no role in your health care the federal government should get out of the health care business this is why we should repeal and replace obamacare but what's the replace what should we do we should have actually a couple of simple principles number one let people buy insurance across state lines number two if you're an individual buying insurance by yourself we should actually make sure that the risk pool is actually a large risk pool at least a thousand people so you can actually share the risk with other people buying insurance in the individual market but number three for small businesses we should let small businesses partner together to find health insurance um that is cheaper for their employees and in other like businesses you see right now a small businesses of small business that has three people in it has to compete against bank of america so of course if you're an employee of bank of america your health insurance is kind of cheap whereas if you're a person that works in a small mom-and-pop business it's very expensive we should let small businesses be able to partner with each other that would actually help to bring down the cost of insurance overall and then we can start really focusing in on prescription drugs and the cost of health care overall [Music]

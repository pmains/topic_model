Thank You mr. chairman I rise in opposition to this amendment it's interesting to listen to the various arguments here but certainly there's unfair competition if ul it's hard to even call it competition overseas but we have unfair trade practices and in sugar policy here helps us defend ourselves these are manufacturing jobs in western Nebraska that utilize very responsibly our natural resources and I think it's only reasonable to continue a policy that does not is not so generally a cost to taxpayers I urge opposition to this amendment I yield back

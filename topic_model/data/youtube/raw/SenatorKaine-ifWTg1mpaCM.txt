we are all familiar with the budget battle taking place between senate democrats and house republicans but there hasn't been a lot of talk about the fight between senate democrats and senate republicans but less than two hours ago virginia's two democratic senators took the fight to the floor tenant your sides artcom monitored that discussion and joins us now from the newsroom with the very latest art stephanie it's been 46 days since the senate passed their version of the budget for 2014. that budget still has not gone to the house for discussion because senate republicans not happy with the budget refused to vote on budget conferees to discuss the spending plan and move it to the house in conference now until the conferees are appointed the senate's budget goes nowhere i don't understand why uh my colleagues on their other side won't take yes for an answer uh warner referring to the fact that the senate did what its republican members and house republicans even kept urging them to do they passed a budget warner along with senator tim kaine is now appealing to those same senate republicans to allow the measure to go to conference in the house you would think that having passed a budget everyone would be excited and would be willing now to move forward to try to find a compromise for the good of the nation instead what we have is an abuse of a senate rule uh an individual senator standing up and even though they had a chance to vote against a budget and to vote on a hundred amendments about a budget they're utilizing uh and really abusing a prerogative to block a budget conference and i hope in the coming days that uh there'll be a change of heart that there'll be regular order will be allowed to proceed that conferees will be named from both in the house and senate and that we can reach this agreement on this issue that i think is important not only to the future of our economy but quite honestly now has taken on a metaphor for whether our institutions can actually function in the 21st century yeah this whole thing taking place because senate republicans trying to force their democratic colleagues to back off the proposals for tax hikes and to move forward with more spending cuts until they get it settled the senate budget goes nowhere and sequestration remains the law of the land it'll loom even larger in 2014. live from the newsroom artcon 10 on your

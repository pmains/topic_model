joining us now Democratic senator Tim Kaine from Virginia he serves on the armed services and Foreign Relations Committee Senator it's always a pleasure to see you I very much appreciate your time just glad to you know thanks wondering you know your thoughts I mean there's a majority of Americans that no doubt support supplying Ukraine with arms however the public Center is divided on whether Washington should urge Ukraine to settle for peace as soon as possible according to a new poll just wondering what your thoughts on that you know Jose I saw that I saw that poll I mean I've been really gratified by the strong support of a bipartisan super majority in both houses of Congress for supporting Ukraine and as I travel around Virginia and as you know we're a very military state with so many installations the support for Ukraine is very strong our attitude has been you know nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine they need to set the terms for peace and they and they need to be at the table exploring ways to bring this war to an end for humanitarian purposes but remember this war is not a an you know equally on both parties Russia has staged an illegal Invasion violating all the Norms of international law and so it's not like Ukraine is the party that's got to build the bridge to peace here this is really more on Russia and the the we will more likely get Russia to a place where they will do the right thing if we keep providing very very strong and unwavering support for Ukraine's ability to defend itself that's what we would want if we were under attack we would want our Ally Allied Nations to support our right to defend ourselves and that's what we need to that's where we need to be with Ukraine and Senator turning to another crisis you and your colleagues just introduced bipartisan legislation to support human rights in Venezuela what does that mean senator no there is a U.N fact-finding mission in Venezuela that has done a really good job under tough circumstances of documenting human rights abuses by the Maduro regime that mission is set to expire these missions are set up with you know a time frame and what the the main focus of this bill that I've introduced is bipartisan is get the U.S to exercise leadership at the United Nations to continue the U.N Mission so that we can continue to document and hopefully by documenting reduce human rights abuses this is going hand in hand with the resumption of talks between the Maduro regime and opposition leaders in Mexico City to find a path forward those talks have led to at least one positive so far which is a U.N humanitarian fund that can be used administered by the U.N and used to help people facing dire consequences lack of access to medicines in vaccines hunger disease outbreaks so there is some after after a long period of really no progress in these negotiations there's some forward movement but we don't want to take the pressure off of this Spotlight that the U.N has had on human rights abuses we need to keep that pressure front and center and meanwhile Senators Senators cinnamon Tillis have proposed a path to citizenship for dreamers in exchange for 25 billion dollars for border security at an extension of title 42. what's your take on that proposal Senator well I have not seen the details my first thought when I read about it was deja vu all over again you might remember in February of 2018 we had a bipartisan proposal on the table that got a vote we had eight Republican co-sponsors and eight Democratic co-sponsors I was key to negotiating it and it was protection for dreamers in exchange for 25 billion dollars of border security over 10 years not building the wall but using that money to do security the right way we had a bipartisan agreement we also had president Trump saying you put a bipartisan agreement on my desk and I'll sign it within a day after announcing the deal he and the White House chose to blow the deal up I don't know how different the Tillis Cinema proposal is to what we had before I'm not sure that it is as expansive in protecting dream and it also includes the whole title 42 question which was not an issue in in February of 2018. so the devil's in the details we have to take a look I'm but I am I'm always glad when there's a discussion about can we find a path for dreamers and we'll see if this is one that you know has the right elements to it Senator Tim Kaine it's always a pleasure to see you I thank you so much for being with us this morning I say glad to be with you

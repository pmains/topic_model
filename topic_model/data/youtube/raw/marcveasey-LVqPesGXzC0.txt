had this a smart PC of a 33rd congressional district in Dallas and Fort Worth and as many of you know several years ago the Supreme Court got it to the Voting Rights Act and what it did was unleash many states particularly my home state of Texas to try and advance voting laws that would hurt minorities and her participation and our country's electoral process we have to fight back against that when you start looking at states doing things like thinking it harder for homes to stay in bed and moving around polling locations voter ID laws and other things that really make it hard for people to vote we haven't seen this level of intimidation and in this level of legal voter suppression since the Voting Rights Act was enacted in the 1960s well we're fighting back now and as many of you have been following the House of Representatives led under Nancy Pelosi and John Lewis our leader and civil rights is going to pass what is known as the Voting Rights advancement Act also known as HR for this act is the first step in stopping Republicans around the country from trying to enact laws that make it harder for people of color both similar to the laws they can that were passed back in the 1960s so I hope that everybody this is following this will understand and push for once this bill passes out the house representatives for it to end up on the Senate side and for Mitch McConnell to do the right thing and send this to Trump's office so we can like get this sign it's right to send it for free right and now is the time to do so

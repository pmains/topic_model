I know that all of you want to provide for the health and well-being of our service members to that end I want to get your thoughts on how to link and create interoperability obviously we have a problem with medical records between the VA and the Department of Defense but also we have interoperability problems between the DHA and the services and perhaps one of the reasons is because we don't have a command right now I suspect it you don't have a defense health command as you don't have so you don't have clarity of command and it seems to me that that would be important especially in a military setting if something happens and that we don't want to have happen and you need to move quickly wouldn't it be better to have a command than it would be to have the type of situation that you're setting up at the present time I don't know who's a right person to answer that question but somebody please so congressman Calvert I'll take the first stab actually the NDAA of 19 has asked the department to ask that question exactly so we are in the middle of looking at what is it feasible to consider some type of either defense health command a unified medical command it's been a concept that's been debated for several years we are putting together three or four options for the department to consider and then we later this year we are reported Congress identifying those options our assessment in terms of feasibility and making those recommendations for not only the department but for Congress to consider but in the interim and I'll my colleagues can chime in and add to this your issue of interoperability one of the things that we are trying to do in terms of where appropriate standardizing things across the Britt military-run healthcare facility networks is indeed on enterprise level do it in a consolidated way so for example and medical logistics our goal would be that the same types of medical supplies devices that are used in our MT F's are the same ones that our providers are using downrange whether it's Army Navy or Air Force and so that we have an effectiveness not only in our purchasing but in terms of training that we're training all of our providers on a common set of tools so that's an example of one of the things that these reforms would try to get at is is facilitate that kind of international

[Music] it never occurred to me to contact my congressional representative's office for a personal concern however the frustration of a missing irs refund that prevented settling my deceased mother's estate led me to try something i had never considered doing before within three months of contacting congresswoman spanberger's office the issue that had hamstrung me for almost a year was settled the estate was closed thank you congresswoman spanberger for employing staff that take your constituents seriously listen carefully ask clarifying questions and give precise direction about what your office can do they are an invaluable resource for every individual and family in your district the renown of your office for constituent services is well deserved

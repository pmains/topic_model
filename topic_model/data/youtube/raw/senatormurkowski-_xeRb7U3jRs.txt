it's gonna be a great summer people are getting outside they're they're camping they're hiking they're recreating but we have to be very very fire aware and alaskans everywhere from down on the kenai peninsula to all the way up here we're almost to cantwell and we're seeing we're seeing this kind of beetle kill all the way up in the infrastructure bill we had a resiliency piece that focused on wildland fire management what we need to do not only here in alaska to protect from wildland fires but of course all the way across the country to have a level of awareness in terms of our responsibility as as individuals let's take that seriously because we we all know that there is plenty that comes to us that is not man-made here in alaska on a hot summer day in the interior you can have a thousand lightning strikes a day and when you look at conditions like this that are dry that have been sitting sitting all winter long practically crispy under your feet it doesn't take much to have a fire that that goes out of control just like that so it's costly it is a threat to life and it is everything that we should be doing to try to be responsible

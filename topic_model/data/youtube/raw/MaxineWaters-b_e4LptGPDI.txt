recognized for me thank you very much mr. speaker members I am pleased and proud to stand here today in support of this most significant piece of legislation that is before this house again I thank chairman Frank for his leadership and I'm especially proud that this work of the conference committee was done by such a diverse group on this side of the aisle I'm especially proud that members of alpha the conference committee included not only women but african-americans and Latinos and Anglos it was truly diverse and you can see that work reflected and what came out of the conference report for example the CPC members of the Financial Services Committee worked on a number of these issues over the past several years and we came up with those things that have been brought to our attention year in and year out that are finally paid attention to in the conference report the federal insurance office we will be asking them to gather information about the ability of minorities and low-income persons to access affordable insurance products to give consideration and mitigation of the impact of landing down a systemically risky institution on minorities and low-income communities the expansion of the Consumer Financial Protection bureaus advisory board to include experts in civil rights community development communities impacted by high-priced loans and others and perhaps most importantly the establishment of the offices of minority and women inclusion at each of the federal financial services agencies these offices would provide for diversity and the employment management and business activities of these agencies the data for the need for these offices speaks for itself diversity is lacking in the financial services industry within the GAO reporting that from 1990 3 2 2004 the level of minority participation in the financial services professions only increased marginally from eleven percent to fifteen point five percent we took care of that in this bill and now we have the opportunity to not only give oversight to diversity but to have these agencies understand how to do outreach how to appeal or two different communities so that we can get the kind of employees that will create the diversity to pay attention to all of the needs of the people of this country in addition mr. chairman I am pleased to note that this conference report includes a provision that I champion to allow the SEC to issue rules on proxy access given the nation's pension funds and long-term institutional investors a say in the governing of the companies in which they own stop additionally I'm pleased that this bill addresses foreclosures which have single-handedly inflicted tremendous damage on neighborhoods in my district in California and across the country it has long been my position that this bill would be incomplete without directly addressing the needs of America's homeowners and neighborhoods that is why I fought for an additional 1 billion dollars in funds for the Neighborhood Stabilization program a program whose authorizing legislation I wrote in 2008 and it is helping neighborhoods all across this country who have foreclosed properties and rundown properties that are driving down the price of other homes in that community now we can rehabilitate those properties and keep the values up of the homes in the neighborhood until please than an additional 1 billion dollars in emergency assistance for unemployed homeowners was included in this bill report to indicate that sixty percent of individuals seeking help and abiding foreclosures thank you are doing so because they are unemployed this funding will provide a critical bridge for homeowners doing periods of joblessness and allow them to maintain stable housing for their children this 2 billion combined with an additional six billion I have secured for NSB through two rounds of funding is another step toward addressing the foreclosure crisis but more needs to be done that is why I'm pleased that the Treasury has committed to providing another two billion for unemployed homeowners in addition to the amounts provided under this bill and that is why I will continue to fight for both additional funding and for loss mitigation legislation which would make it mandatory for banks to offer real sustainable loan modification offers mr. chairman thank you for your systems thank you for your support thank you for your leadership I'm proud be a part of this Congress so proud to have been a part of the conference committee and I think we're doing all Americans justice in this bill as we pay attention to needs that have been so long overlooked

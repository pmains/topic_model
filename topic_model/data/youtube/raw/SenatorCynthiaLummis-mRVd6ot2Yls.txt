mr president i also rise to protest the manner in which funding for the people of ukraine has been strapped to this omnibus spending bill thereby delaying aid to ukraine and strapping it to a bill that is going to need days to get to the president's desk so it is in good shape i have been following just as you have the unfolding humanitarian crisis in ukraine and i'm incredibly concerned for the people there the women and children who've been murdered in the streets by vladimir putin's bombs the housing complexes that have been destroyed the maternity hospital that was bombed just yesterday all from unprovoked russian aggression we want to help these people the people of wyoming who i represent want to help these people because of this i was particularly appalled at the decision by congressional democrats to include ukraine aid funding in the massive government funding omnibus bill that we're starting to consider we could get this ukraine money on its way today we could get it to the president's desk today we most of us agree i think it would be unanimous to send the money to ukraine as a former house member and a long-time legislator i know that any big piece of legislation has good pieces and bad or as former u.s senator al simpson used to say some spinach but this is a cynical approach to legislating it forces members of congress to make an unnecessary choice choose between helping ukraine people and further indebting our own constituents it's a cynical ploy and it's cynical because of what's in the rest of the bill the omnibus spending bill at a time when the united states is over 30 trillion in debt instead of taking a serious look at our budget we're piling on we're increasing non-defense discretionary spending by seven percent even though inflation this year is more than 7 we're still the omnibus continues to fund president biden's vaccine mandates even after the president himself called for a return to normal this bill also contains anti-second amendment provisions that threaten the rights of law-abiding citizens in wyoming finally after banning the practice for years this omnibus contains around 10 billion in earmarks for pet projects around the country here's the book of earmarks look how thick this is it's printed on both sides in about four point font you almost have to have a looking glass to see what's in here 4 000 earmarks after we've gotten away from this i'm sympathetic to the argument that earmarks are a more direct way of addressing problems around the country but historically they've been abused as a way for leadership to with but votes on bad legislation and a way to fund unnecessary pet projects to curry favor back home but instead of having a debate about these and other concerns of the massive spending bill ukraine funding was dropped in here in an effort to get members to vote for a bad bill so we can get funding to ukraine we should have a standalone vote on the aid for the people of ukraine this issue is entirely separate from the omnibus spending bill that congress is considering and should be recognized as such on the senate floor anything less does a disservice to the people we're trying to help and to the american people we serve i'm proud of senator rick scott for calling for a separate vote to help the people of ukraine mr president i yield back

president explaining to him why i felt i needed to make that cut i'm one of 47 people in the house of representatives that have voted for every single cut and every amendment that has come across our across our desks and we are we are so outside the bounds of our spending that we need to dial it back everywhere and when it comes and when it comes to helping the poor and when it comes to helping those that are disadvantaged we need to have a government safety net however i need to be i'll put the onerous on me but i'll challenge you as well we need to be that first line of defense all right this means this means that i need to step up this needs means i need to make sure i'm taking care of people in my church in my community and other places that's why my family volunteers that's why we make donations that's why we do all those things it can't just be kicked off to the government government is not a charity the salvation army and the rescue mission and all those those are charities and that that is that is where i believe my dollar is high it used to its highest and best use so there there are going to be a plenty of programs that you're going to be able to pick out that yes i cut there's other plenty of other programs that yes i supported i just i hope you understand that i believe that we have to have cuts that are going to reach into every budget and every department uh hello congressman my name is brandon i'm from here in grand haven thank you for coming all right um first of all i want to thank you for your uh libya vote i don't haven't heard much of that tonight but i thought that was the right thing anyway i believe in a government that governs lee's government's best government used to have nothing to do with marriage whatsoever i think dr paul has made some very good points that its involvement in marriage has caused nothing but problems shouldn't the government just get out of marriage all together and let free people in a free country contract as they please thank you all right that's uh yeah and that that is you're probably referring to doma uh the uh defense of uh no i believe that the state by defining and we had this we had this vote in the state of michigan as well uh definition of marriage uh and the doma act is the is the proper role uh for defining what what is uh there are plenty of other legal contracts and legal uh relationships that people can have horrors of attorney and all those other things that they can hit a lot of those i just think the definition of marriage is one man and one woman hi my name is barbara cullen i'm from spring lake um i liked how you began speaking about your three your three five children five children um i have two children my second daughter was born with a genetic blood disorder she's also developmentally delayed i'm a teacher i work very hard while also raising my children i have a very good health insurance at the moment i have mesa which will take care of her even um past eight the age of 26 because she is she has special needs um there have been i also have a pension and i have it right now um i have also felt like i've been working so that she's gonna be okay after i'm no longer i know i'm i think that she will live longer than i will live it there's been a lot of things that have made me feel secure and those things in the last several months have been taken away from me one of those things is social security which i don't know what's going to happen with that another one is medicare i don't know what's going to happen with that so my the future of my daughter when i'm gone i can't i don't know if i can you say that there's going to be these people who are going to supply charity for her i with the with knowing that there were programs in the government that would take care of her made me feel secure made me feel that i when when it's my time can leave but at this point it is very very hard for me to think of my daughter's future and i believe that as a country we need to we need to figure out what our priorities are one of my priorities is taking care of people that need it i might i didn't do any my daughter didn't choose to be developmentally disabled she didn't choose to have health problems and she is the happiest person in the world she is an amazing individual and i want to know that she's going to be taken care of and when you're take when you're talking about not putting not having my country the country that i i've lived in the the country my grandfather he had so social security when when i don't have that security when you're telling me that that no i can't that we cannot ask the top one of the people who make the most in the in the world help with people who are not as fortunate i do not understand this this is not the america i was born into i commend you i i've done a fair amount of work with special needs kids and i know that you have some unique challenges and and continuing to walk away um that's right that's right and so the thoughts go to you and your family on that and this is where we have not taken social security away we've not taken medicare or medicaid away there is a situation though if we don't figure out how we are going to modify them in a way that is going to be guaranteeing that they're in existence when your daughter how old is she 22 i'm 42. actuarials will tell you those systems aren't going to be in place when i retire 25 years from now all right we're trying to fix them to make sure that they are there for your daughter and for for people in my generation and for my kids and things that are happening it we cannot suspend the laws of mathematics here all right the the uh the simple fact is when social security was put in place there was over 16 people for every retiree it's a 3.2 right now and it's on its way to two and a half people per retiree right we are going to have to modify the system and this goes to to your point and maybe the point of a few of you are also making i personally don't think that bill gates and warren buffett and george soros need to collect the social security check or qualify for medicare frankly all right so if we want to talk about how we're going to change that system that is one of those ways and i am willing and open to take a look at that um actuarials will tell you people that pay into the system far out see a far out exceed what they've paid in they typically will pull out more than that they have paid into those systems right government is not an insurance program because what it does is it takes all that money and it takes that extra money and it doesn't invest it you know it doesn't have an accountable schwab it spends it and where it has been spent i have yet to go see it but paul ryan uh paul ryan's become a good friend and uh he uh he has seen it he's going to take me and a group of others to go see this there's literally a final cabinet full of ious for those systems that is wrong we've got to figure out how we're going to preserve that system for your daughter and my kids as well yeah that's that is that is not possibly one of those things that uh that that could happen hi i'm pat from spring light thanks for coming um there's been some pretty deep questions here i've just got a really simple question i hope it doesn't sound stupid but why does our government borrow money and turn around and give it to countries around the world doesn't that seem fascinating that is uh there's a number of programs that that are out there that are like that that's the kind of stuff that we have to review and figure out now i don't disagree it's bad right sorry i don't disagree pat but let's eliminate that let's let's completely take it off the table no funding for africa or aid relief or anybody it is a rounding error yet frankly it is a rounding of what we spend totally the three big drivers of our spending are social security medicaid and medicare the for all the moment and the fourth one the fourth one is defense the fifth one any guesses interest on the debt that's right interest on the debt and if we simply even return to the historic norms of the 90s not even the 80s but the 90s uh that that slice of the pie is just going to grow even bigger all right that's not without spending more money or or spending you know in the into more debt that's just simply servicing the debt that we've got if we if those interest rates go up we're going to be spending even more on our interest payments so they they believe in the next 10 years interest alone is going to out uh outpace defense spending so but there are i've i've also voted for those cuts i've voted for cuts to the un i voted for cuts to aid i voted for pets for a number of those things so sir i was i was kind of pleased to see when you were elected because you went to the same college that i did and i hoped you took the same economics 101 but i've been disappointed in your in your voting record to follow very carefully you started out with a couple stories may i do too please what first is do you know what cardiomyopathy is yes i've heard of it you know how much that cost i did not know that my wife acquired that somehow my nephew was a surgeon totally maybe through a virus or something she smoked a half a cigarette in her whole life she had none of the the problems that could cause that didn't drink alcohol but i got a huge bill what i'm driving at is i'm really concerned about your position on health care and i know i don't give a rip because i'm covered and your newsletter told me that but i am concerned about my kids and i got a bill for a lot more than the voucher program that governor ryan has spoken about that's my first story okay second is i was drafted on the same college that you went to and sent to korea we still have troops in korea do you know how many troops we have all over the world and how many how many countries why does that continue we have troops in germany that i'm just very concerned about all that we spend on that but that is that feeds in nicely with exactly the kind of conversations that we are having every day and i will tell you there was 96 freshmen that were elected nine democrats and 87 republicans all right uh out of that out of those 87 in the in the caucus you can imagine that's a it's it is a sizable influence of those 87 22 of them are retired military one of them is actually still active reserves he's a he's a fighter pilot he's flown both in afghanistan and iraq um a lot of them are retired lieutenant colonels or full bird colonels these are these are the men and women that make stuff happen in the military they typically are the first ones up at the mic saying we need to look at how we are spending our defense dollars we we need to rethink this um i think you're going to see a continued conversation about that as we are moving forward it's about it's about making sure that we we are using those defense dollars wisely prudently and frankly constitutionally what are we supposed to be doing so um your your healthcare uh concern and question my my problem uh that that i think is a challenge for all of us is we have a system that frankly shields us from actual costs and expenses i don't know about you uh but with five kids we take a fair amount of trips to the emergency room all right and how we uh how we had paid for that when i was a state representative is i had a blue cross blue shield card right in between doing that and doing this and i will tell you again i now have a blue cross blue shield card it's the same card and the same program um i had a health savings account i was working at zeeland christian school uh doing uh doing some work with them and that's actually where i had a chance to work with our special needs students having an hsa radically changes how you view health care and your access to health care because you have to spend it like it is yours unfortunately for for us with this system i don't know the difference between an x-ray an mri or a cat scan i bet you don't either unless you have some sort of specific medical background and you talk you talk that you talk to health care providers time and time again and we all come in and now i want the blue pill or the purple pill or whatever pill i just saw advertised no don't give me an x-ray i know you say that's okay but i want the mri you know we we are expecting the highest and best um we have not uh we have not put in any kind of tort reform uh so guess what doctors oftentimes and i've got a brother-in-law who's a doctor in full disclosure he's an mr uh uh sorry a rehabilitation doctor i always forget the acronyms um uh and and when he went to medical school in west virginia uh he went to uh he went to med school down there west virginia actually had a period of time i think it was about four months where they could not insure an ob gyn not one because of the lawsuits that were going on and so that to me is a real danger as well it's about access my wife's from canada originally i'm very familiar with the canadian system the canadian system exists and can function only in one way it's 30 million people with a vast majority of their population masked along the border that accesses health care in rochester minnesota out in seattle detroit pittsburgh buffalo all you gotta do is sir my mother-in-law who radically disagrees with me on those things uh worked for social services in ontario and was telling me how ontario pays for every single heart problem brain problem serious eye issue and there was like a fourth one they send them to buffalo why because they don't have the facilities available in toronto toronto right this this this is how screwed up it is a few years ago they had a blue ribbon commission because the wait time to get an mri was six months in ontario so some enterprising doctors said hey let's just go buy our own mri machine let's start providing mris on private pay they put together a blue ribbon commission and after six months determined that that wasn't fair so therefore they shut it down and would not allow them to to function that way and talk about dumb you got people who are willing to take money out of their pocket relieve the wait time the wait time was cut in half pretty much so guess what those people do instead of going to their to their local mri place in toronto they drive a buffalo to go get them because they don't want to wait six months and i don't blame them excuse me for just asking a second question why then is the united states spending 17 percent of our gdp canada 10 or 11 and their how their health outcomes are better than ours there's there's there's a lot of different yeah there's a there's a lot there's a lot of different statistics on that and we can go back and forth on on on whether that's true or not true because there's other studies that show we and we just we this is true we spend a disproportionate amount percentage-wise of our uh of our total gdp on health care uh we also provide the best health best health care in the entire world that's why people come here so it's not it's not just if you have insurance all you gotta do is go to a hospital they cannot refuse treatment to anybody legally they cannot refuse treatment thank you i'm barred from grand haven township and earlier you made a comment about supporting cost cutting measures across the board but some government programs some expenditure actually saves money for the country in the long run so i guess i would like to point out something like energy conservation projects that maybe have a two-year payback that would save lots of money over the long term and for the state of michigan we spend a billion dollars a year on fossil fuels keeping that money in michigan would be a great economic stimulus for us so i guess i'm asking would you then refrain from using a term or a phrase like you support cost cutting across the board when some of it would actually be to the government of the state i guess i should have been more specific on that what i meant specifically by that is that i have voted for virtually every budget amendment that has included cost cutting so it doesn't matter to me whether it was defense whether it was department of interior whether it was epa whatever i mean so that that's what i meant quite honestly i'm not a huge fan of across the board hey we're going to take 15 from everybody's budgets because here's one of the things it does do it it preserves really bad programs just at a reduced amount and it cuts really good programs at that by that same amount so i do think we need to be more judicious than that uh and that's where that's where i think you know even as as tough as this could be if if they do do those uh if they do do those across the board cuts and i'll point out that still only 150 billion dollars a year over 10 years 1.5 trillion um you can be selective in that and that's wise so thanks sir ron tysinski of robinson township i was wondering if it's true that there's a provision in the obama health care plan called caps law that authorized the federal government to go directly into your 401 k and take out between three and eight percent depending on inflation and what was likely that actually could actually happen um this is not the first i've heard of it but i have not seen and what did you call it the it's called capsule cats law so we will we will check into i know there were some provisions and how they were talking about being able to uh yeah go in and garnish basically uh bank accounts and some of those so i'm not sure if it's specifically if you could do that into a 401k that would surprise me typically of course protected retirement funds but we can look at it if we've got your name if you want to where's greg this is greg i've been working right back here he is my district director um some of you may recognize that the markham name is his uh dad jerry van workum was a state senator out of uh muskegon greg had this funny notion that moving back from washington and actually being able to afford a house and have a garage back here in west michigan was a good idea so uh he uh he has come and uh has been working for me as my district director here so um if we can get your name and number and or email or whatever we'll uh we'll make sure that we uh communicate with you thank you because i read one of the earlier versions of the bill and i saw something yep okay and we we have uh we have a series of sort of those frequently asked question type things and and we are happy to put those in our links and all those other things so thank you yep we will do that ma'am hi i'm linda slate i'm from norton shores um talking i have a couple questions but one is talking about taxes currently as i understand it less than half of the households in the united states actually pay taxes and that if we tax the rich for their entire incomes it might last a month so i don't think that i think we need to share the burden even if we have people on welfare or i don't know the politically correct term is these days but if we have people involved raise their welfare 10 and tax in 10 so that they are part of so they see that it's not all free that's one thing the other thing is with obamacare we also are getting additional taxes which nobody really talks about in any of this discussion about taxes and spending there are already tax increases on the way now personally i think we should get rid of obamacare but if we don't let's get rid of the waivers and let's put congress under the same medical problem let me address the last one first i wholeheartedly agree frankly we need to lead uh on this whether it's cutting our own budgets which we've done since i've been there in six months with i voted to cut my own budget 11.5 which means there's probably fewer mailings you may be happy about that i don't know but but what in all seriousness that that is it's a total of about 165 000 out of the out of the budget which is our ability to have people answering phones and emails and getting you letters and responses and that kind of thing so that that we have to do that we have to live under those same goals and that frankly i think every single company that would be living these and these waivers are a farce as far as i'm concerned i mean it is it's a joke that you are going to be able to have all of these various waivers and only a cynic would think that they might be a little political who's going to who's going to agree who's going to be granted those those waivers so um yes i would agree but um this morning i met with a group of investment professionals and cpas this is the kind of fun information that they give you uh sorry to any of my uh financial planner or cpa friends in the audience tonight this is the share of income tax burdens for the 2009 tax year it's an adjusted gross income chart for 2009 which is the apparently the most recent of those that are complete uh and 12.4 percent of the total number of returns filed supply 74.7 percent of all tax revenue that is adjusted gross income over one hundred thousand dollars uh under uh under a hundred thousand dollars uh would be the is 87.6 of the uh of the total files and that's not including obviously all those that don't file anything uh they provide 25.3 percent of all the tax money that is uh that is put in place so we put this up on our website as well um my staff is going to be busy in the next uh next few days but uh we'll give we'll get you this this is uh it's all numbers from department of treasury i'm sorry this is this is the total number of returns filed we're talking about we're talking about income taxes that are fun obviously everybody well most people pay sales tax uh gas taxes any of those things that's kind of the debate we're having too i mean consumption taxes and that's the whole fair tax flat tax the number of those other tax uh uh structures that were uh that are being talked about so thank you don fredericks allendale bill good to see you i think if there's any one thing that most of us agree on is the fact that the government simply spends too much money um when our country not not everybody disagrees i understand i said most of it uh when our country was founded there were actually three federal laws now there are over four thousand the code of federal regulations is over a hundred and fifty seven thousand pages cost us billions of dollars every year to police that it's rare that any law or regulation is ever returned or repealed or returned has anyone ever considered as much as they don't want another government committee has anyone ever thought of having a commitment committee that did nothing but repeal regulations actually in the state of michigan they had one of those a few years ago and it dug up some interesting things i think that would be a great idea i i know i i try to i try to vary all of my information i watch msnbc and a number of the other cnbc and a number of others uh channels i don't always agree with because i want to know what people are saying and thinking and hearing one of the things i heard on msnbc was somebody from one of the trading floors i actually don't think it was in

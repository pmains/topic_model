mr. speaker tax day is approaching on April 15th and I again rise to state my support for the state local tax deduction there were many positive aspects to the the tax bill that I voted against I support reducing the corporate tax rate but it should not have been done by increasing personal taxes on any hard-working middle-income Long Islander in my district of the $10,000 cap that was made to the Salt adduction was a punch in the gut to middle-class taxpayers in my district there were positive aspects as I said up the tax bill expanding the medical expense deduction preserving education and student deductions doubling child tax credit the AMT changes and as I stated changing the corporate tax rate helps make the United States more competitive globally to improve our business climate to help create more jobs but it should not be done by raising taxes on the personal income side I've been working closely with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to address this issue I've been working with Democratic Representative Josh got hammer of New Jersey I co-sponsor legislation between Peter King a Republican and Tom Suozzi a Democrat HR 257 Nita Lowey introduced the bill that I co-sponsor HR 188 I encourage all my colleagues in this chamber to work together to address this important issue because it's important to deliver tax relief to all Americans now I do have an important message though to the governor of New York the mayor of New York City those who are running state and local governments in states like mine and the reason why our state local tax deduction was as high as it was is because their state local taxes are as high as they are so everybody needs to look in the mirror and figure out what we can do to do our part because all levels of government need to deliver tax relief my home state of New York is some of the high taxes in the entire country it's ranked as the second worst state in the entire nation to do business you couple that with the loss of the Salt adduction and it has only sped up the amount of businesses and individuals who are choosing to to leave our state I was very upsetting to see an effort by elected officials some here in Congress others in the state legislature to push away 25,000 good-paying amazon jobs that would have been coming to Long Island City now we all must do our part the state local tax deduction has been around in some way since you could say Abraham Lincoln's administration he used this state local tax deduction to help keep this Union together and and fight the Civil War it was a tough debate over a year ago now when the tax law was passed through both chambers and signed by the president but next month as April 15th approaches and people have to pay their taxes they're going to be seeing less in their return many will be seeing less in their return where I'm from some will be getting more and that's great I didn't oppose this bill because all of my constituents were going to see a tax increase it was that too many were going to see a tax increase now all when they're getting their tax return need to understand it throughout the year money was added to their paycheck because of a change in the way that taxes were calculated with withholdings through the year so that's something else to factor in when trying to figure out the impact of the tax bill again some people will be seeing less that they owe others will be seeing more this chamber the halls of the New York State Capitol the halls of state capitols everywhere in city halls and county and town governments all throughout America we I'll need to do our part to deliver tax relief because all levels of government really it's it's not a revenue issue that has been leading to the situation that we face as a country and and in our local governments it's been an expenditure issue and whether you could save a dollar a million dollars a billion dollars wherever you can find money to save we need to get better and how we tax and spend the people's money we need to spend it as if it is our own so there's a message here to my colleagues in this chamber as I ask for your support of this legislation multiple bills that have been introduced I make that plea to the Senate to the administration and also all of those representatives a state local government responsible for the fact the reason why our deduction was as high as it was was because our state local taxes were as high as they were but we need to do our part here in this chamber I yield back

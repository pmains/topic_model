well thank you madam chair and most certainly we appreciate the opportunity to work with you in addressing rural issues and in particular this is one that i think affects our states in the midwest just as it does states throughout the country but very important that we address this and and and we make sure that the dollars are spent in an appropriate fashion i want to begin by also thanking uh our witnesses for taking the time to attend today's hearing and to share their expertise with us last year president biden signed into law the infrastructure investment and jobs act which allocated an unprecedented amount of taxpayer dollars to transit systems across the country this law provided a 67 percent increase in annual federal funding for public transportation when compared to the annual amount provided in the previous authorization this is not including the 69.5 billion dollars for transit in the response to coven 19 nor the 340 million dollars provided through the public transportation relief program now of the 108 billion authorized and appropriated through the infrastructure and investment and jobs act excuse me for public transportation it is important to note that just 4.56 billion was allocated for the rural formula program all the while states like new york and california are estimated to receive 11 billion and 10 billion respectively with this investment comes a need for critical oversight to make certain that this money is spent on fixes that will make the most impact therefore as we move to implement this legislation it is important to discuss the challenges facing rural communities in offering safe affordable and reliable methods of transportation rural areas cover 97 percent of u.s land area and most rural residents still rely on their own vehicles as their main means of transportation overall rural residents travel about 33 percent more rural workers travel 38 percent more and lower income rural workers 59 more annual miles than those in urban areas rural residents spend more time and money on transportation and are more vulnerable to transportation problems like vehicle maintenance issues they lose their ability to drive or fuel prices spike as they have right now therefore rural roads are heavily traveled and rural and critical for maintaining the way of life in south dakota and the rest of rural america the frequency of travel on some of these rural roads has further increased over the past years as tourism has become a growing business in the rural us most of the country's national parks are located in rural regions like mount rushmore in south dakota which draws a large number of visitors each year in addition with agricultural with agriculture dominating most rural communities much of the nation's food industry relies on the transportation of products over long distances on rural roads and highways the safety and structural integrity of these roads is important to maintain an interconnected transportation system with few communities in south dakota having an actual fixed route bus system a majority of rural transit offerings are modes of paratransit which provide transportation for the elderly and or persons with disabilities roughly 31 of the populations in rural communities are either elderly or disabled and these two demographics within a community often need transportation services for doctors appointments or to complete grocery shopping due to the need to travel long distances driver shortages and lower ridership providing it on on-demand rides in rural areas can be extremely expensive as we implement the infrastructure investment jobs act i think we should explore ways to utilize public-private partnerships to make local state and federal dollars go further we should also be looking at new ways to use technology just as an example in the sioux falls south dakota the the sioux area metro known as sam is trying out a sam on demand phone app which allows riders to request rides on their smartphones to increase ridership and efficiency during implementation of the infrastructure law it is also critical to reduce the regulatory burden as much as possible for the truly small communities around the country in south dakota and in rural minnesota our rural transit agencies servicing small towns do not have the capacity to wade through endless red tape rural communities must have the freedom to use the funding in ways that serve them not be forced into a one-size-fits-all approach to manage these issues resources must be allocated to the most vital areas of the transport system and i think our subcommittee should remain focused on the oversight of those resources i look forward to hearing from our witnesses today and learning more about ways rural america can best utilize the resources of the infrastructure law i would simply close by thanking our chairman for having this meeting today i think it's important that we start out on the right area and focus appropriately on the funding that is available and where it is going to thank you madam chair thank you senator rounds

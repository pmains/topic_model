there's here but first a special guest let's go to Capitol Hill congresswoman Karen bass joins us Democrat from California and chair of the Congressional Black Caucus I'd love your thoughts on this vote and and are you as surprised as I am are you beyond surprised that there's not any Republican support for it at this moment well sadly I'm not surprised at all because they are so frightened of him that they have decided to essentially hand him their dignity and their integrity I look forward to taking this vote it's so sad though that we seem to be here every few weeks and the only thing that I could think of is that he decided to throw this bomb to divert us away from Muller's impending hearing in a week and also the failed raids that he said we're going to take place he always throws a racist bomb at a strategic time when he wants to divert our attention congresswoman do you believe that there's any danger in the constant stream of upping the ante that seems to come from this White House and this president his words have a long tail there echoed in conservative media outlets he had social media provocateurs at the White House last week and celebrated what are usually false attacks one of them had put out a false attack against Senator Carla Harris are you concerned that this debate is getting out of control well I absolutely am and one of them also had put out a really anti-semitic political cartoon as well and he was welcomed into the White House I will tell you that I am seriously worried about the lives of our four colleagues two of which are members of the Congressional Black Caucus but these four women go through death threats every single day they don't talk about it very often I'm very worried that one of them might be injured if not killed and you remember when the guy went in and shot up the synagogue remember who he cited he said that the president said that they were getting funding to encourage Central Americans to come over to the United States I believe that his race ik hate racist hateful rhetoric absolutely has consequences all he needs to do is trigger somebody who is mentally unstable or who is a bigger racist than he is and somebody else is going to get hurt I believe people have already been hurt because of his racist rhetoric curse woman I just want to get you on the record and make sure that I understand exactly what you're saying do you believe that other than endangering the lives of these four Congresswomen that he targeted in those racist tweets do you believe he's putting do you believe he'd have blood on his hands that there were a racially inspired attack on us absolutely believes that yes but you know remember now before our last election we had four acts of domestic terrorism you remember the guy that delivered the bombs do you remember his bout his van was covered in pro-trump bumper stickers and posters so I think that he's already had that effect and I'm very very concerned that it'll continue I have been afraid for my colleague safety for a long time now and I think what he did over this weekend just puts them in further danger Congresswoman are you old enough to remember when there was there were two channels on Capitol Hill the public sentiment and the private conversations are you able to speak privately with any Republicans about what you just shared on our air I mean I have to tell you sadly typically they do come up and say oh my god what he said now I've not heard that today I haven't none of them have come up and spoken to me the way they usually have you know a lot of times they're embarrassed they kind of hold their head down and say you know I wish he would stop saying those things you know it's a remarkable decline though I mean there are some people who think this was always the face in the heart of the Republican Party but we showed that tape of three years ago when he was running for president Republicans were walking those halls behind you condemning racist attacks do you think the gender of these four Congress women comes into play as well oh you know a caucus that has a hundred and ninety nine members and fourteen of which are women absolutely I think gender is always front and center but remember now even more important than the rhetoric are the policies and frankly whether they whether my colleagues will come up to me afterwards and kind of disassociate themselves with his rhetoric their policies have been very consistent and their policies absolutely have a disproportionate negative impact on communities of color congressman will you do me a favor and come on back if you have any news in the next 51 minutes or any inkling that Republicans in public or private would like to support this resolution tonight you know what I'll go talk to a few right now on the floor and if they tell me privately I won't disclose their names but I won't eat them back on the air and tell you will keep their secret thank you so much Chris baby the time with us were grateful absolutely

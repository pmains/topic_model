this tool could save their life it's going to be a game changer you're going to be able to find out before you leave your doctor's office where you can get your medication and how much it's going to cost it is especially good to be talking about something that we turned into law this real-time benefits act came from people coming to talk to me about the price of prescription drugs and about how crazy it is that you don't get to know the price of your prescription drug pretty much until you get up to the counter at the pharmacy so this is the tool that your doctor is going to have on their computer screen the ability to tell you the price of that drug the price of alternatives generics a different name brand and the place in the local area that it's the cheapest there is no other product in your life that you buy that you don't get to know the price until you show up at the register so often people go without care simply because they don't have the time or they don't have the resources to try to do all the investigative work that it takes to get that medication to find out where the affordable place is it's not right that someone should have to make a choice do i stay healthy or do i stay housed or do i stay clothed or fed i think this is a great move forward when you want to buy anything you compare your prices and this tool will give you that opportunity to make a decision about the best place for you cost wise this is just really important empowerment for the patient

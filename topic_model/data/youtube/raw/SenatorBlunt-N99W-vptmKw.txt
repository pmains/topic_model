well the the targeted bill that we're for you've heard the list already back to work back to school back to child care uh senator ernst and senator loffler had legislation on that we had it in our original bill we've got twice as much money for child care assistance as we had as the democrats had in the heroes act but also back to better health the the shark tank idea senator i talked to dr collins at nih earlier today 16 different tests now have gotten through the shark tank and advancing to more production they believe out of the shark tank they'll be the capacity for 60 million tests a month by october abbott labs announced independently that they'll be producing 40 million tests a month by october and so 100 million tests a month gets us to the test that millions of people can take dozens of times whether that's at work or at school or on a on a campus all that likely possible in a much quicker way than it would have been but we still need the money we're appropriating this bill for more vaccine development more manufacturing and more distribution to have a vaccine and not be able to get it out there would be a huge mistake at a july 2nd hearing that i chaired i challenged cdc and others to have a plan by october 1. it looks like they're going to miss that but they're only going to miss it by a month they've asked the states now to respond to the framework they put together for their state plans during the month of october and there's no reason to wait until you have a vaccine to have a plan to distribute the vaccine or have a priority of how you're going to allow people to get the be first in line for that vaccine we need those things to happen before we have a vaccine i'm glad to see the administration moving toward a plan in place by november one no matter when the vaccine's available almost everybody now thinks it'll be available in significant numbers right around the first of the year but then it's still going to take some weeks and months for enough people have had the vaccine that we've got societal immunity to this disease so tests are still going to matter but how you get that vaccine out who gets it really matters i'm glad that we're a little beyond the deadline i would have liked to have seen but certainly a reasonable deadline to have a plan to distribute the vaccine before you have the vaccine

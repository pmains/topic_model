thank you madam speaker i would like to state for the record that the prior remarks shared were inaccurate the fact of the matter is uh tax cuts and jobs act actually resulted in more revenues to the to the treasury let's not forget that and the fact of the matter is a growing economy will do far more for the american people than new government programs that we can't afford we're standing here now of course i i think we should make good on our on our debt make good on our obligations this bill is not the solution instead of focusing on the basics of governing the majority has chosen to spend the past 10 months kind of arguing here and there are a lot actually first passing their two trillion dollar inflation catalyst at the beginning of the year and now arguing among themselves how to spend another five trillion this bill is clearly not the solution this bill isn't bipartisan it was brought to the fore solely by democrats and reflects their take it or leave it approach to governing it does nothing to our to address our nation's spending problem it's a blank check which allows the majority to spend as much as they want in the coming months unrestrained by true a true debt limit for the duration of this congress democrats control government and can immediately raise the debt ceiling right now there's a better way however than this this particular bill i urge a no vote and i yield back

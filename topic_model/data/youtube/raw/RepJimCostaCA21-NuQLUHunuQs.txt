finally the budget deal that was agreed on a bipartisan basis over the weekend is important not only is it relates to our discretionary and non-discretionary spending for the next two years lifting the budget cap but in addition to that to ensuring that we produce a budget on time that we avoid government shutdown that we ensure that our men and women serving in American armed forces have the adequate funding that they need that our veterans get the support and our VA hospitals that we have promised them these are the things that are a part of an overall budget deal if avoids the kind of circus that we had over the last years where we had government shut down government shut down we should never have we should never have that impact on our economy our federal workers to be expected whether they be an air traffic control or food safety to go to work and not to receive a check that is irresponsible so the budget deal is good it's a bipartisan effort it frankly gives the sort of discretion that Congress needs to make budget decisions to prioritize our needs in America so for that I thank the Congress and I yield back the balance of my time

chairman tester and ranking member moran i want to thank you for the kind consideration i want to thank you for holding this hearing and for all the work that you all have done together to find a consensus on this issue and it's extremely important i've always said that the military and our veterans is what holds our country together it rallies all of us democrats and republicans and and that's the best thing that i can tell you that we do here is when you all come and tell us the concerns you have and how we can be of help uh it's our duty to take care of all the brave men and women who have selflessly fought to defend the nation many of our veterans in west virginia and across america who are exposed to open air burn pits are now facing health complications without health care coverage and benefits and millions have been exposed to toxic materials and that number is only rising our committee is unique in taking care of the veterans and it's not a partisan issue it is simply our responsibility so i know that we can find a solution and we'll get this done i also appreciate secretary you being here and to share with us your thoughts recommendations for honoring the pact act and how we can get our veterans the care they need as soon as possible a couple of things i wanted to ask you sir i'm very pleased to see the collaboration including the and honoring the pact act between the va and the department of defense and the provisions of the bill on interagency research and to toxic exposure especially the important further understanding of this correlation between explosion and adverse health index so does the bill as it currently stands adequately divide the responsibility between the va and dod um [Music] you know what i think that's a good question i want to say to you yes but i also want to take the question to make sure that i get come back you can because we can make some adjustments to the building make it work the way it should work i know all of our intention is to do that but sometimes when you write a bill you have you don't clear that you have no clarity and there's an overlapping and you got you get nothing accomplished so we want to make sure that that is clear also can the va and the dod collaborate further and get ahead of the curve to ensure that our veterans are not exposed to toxins in the course of their service going forward have we been able to separate understanding the danger we're putting them in by changing how we operate in the field and that would come back from you all yep giving your information to the uh to the dod yeah look i uh you've heard me say in this room before and you've heard me say this to you privately that i i think secretary austin is uniquely uh focused on uh and generously so on how to care for our vets this is an issue that we've had conversations about i don't want to make any kind of operational commitments uh uh or even raise operational things that i don't have a say in but i know that dod is very focused on this well let me in all the agencies we have we have challenges we all mean well but things go wrong at times and you know that when you took over there was a you had a tremendous backlog to work and getting us up to speed and and and i think all of you heard the story about the va in west virginia and the deaths we had just totally it's mind-boggling today i can't even the horror that the families are going through uh but i i can tell you we put through great legislation to correct a lot of the things and the whole thing is holding accountability yeah so in addition to accountability we need to make sure implementation that measures that no veterans are being left behind so my question would be do you feel that honoring our pec or pac act currently has enough standards for accountability and implementation and if not where could we fix any gaps and if you haven't gone in or your staff can give us the adjustments that might be needed we need to identify that now yeah because i don't want any of you all to leave here thinking that we've got a perfect piece of legislation and we fixed everything that was wrong and we find out the language is not there to do it it's fair it's a fair question a good question and uh i i don't have anything specific with me today on accountability but i'll take that well there's different iterations of the bills you know we had one on our side they had them on their side and this and that was try to start blending that and you got dod responsibility and you got va responsibility and if they're not correlated and i know you had that ability your previous job you had to make a lot of things happen i know you can make this happen but if you need us to help write that language or make the adjustments that makes your job easier and better my hunch is that we have a lot of useful accountability tools including one that you all gave us in 2018 that would apply obviously to this going forward but uh i think it's a good question i've taken a note on it and we'll make sure i can assure you as far as the bipartisan effort that we're all making right here whatever you recommend that we can help to make this really happen because it's a big undertaking and i know we want to get it right thank you mr chairman i appreciate your patience thank you

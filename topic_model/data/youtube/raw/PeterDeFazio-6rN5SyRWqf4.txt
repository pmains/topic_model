Oregon is recognized for one minute well they're too real crises before us and the republican response was the misbegotten legislation whisper on yesterday as it should have been but the other wasn't even on the table in any form 236 new fire started in the western United States last night there are 44 large fire 31 large fires that are uncontained and the Forest Service and the BLM are running out of money and in the Senate bill which granted didn't pass but in the president's proposal was emergency firefighting money but somehow the Republicans here don't think those fires an emergency and they don't care about the loss of resources the potential loss of life and the loss of property that's going to result when those agencies run out of money they can't stop fighting the fires but they have to cut back on programs of preparedness and things that would mitigate the disaster of future fires deal with forest health fuel reduction and all those things but they could care less they're taking no action they didn't even put forward a lame proposal on that unlike their very lame proposal on the border from Oklahoma human me at yield myself such time as I may consume

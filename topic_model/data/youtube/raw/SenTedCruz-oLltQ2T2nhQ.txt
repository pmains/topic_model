my friend from Delaware admitted a fondness for Game of Thrones which which I will confess I have the same predilection but I will give a friendly warning that if he actually admits publicly he liked the final episode that will manifest itself surely in attack ads in an xray election thank you everyone for joining us at this hearing I want to start by talking about Google Google as I have observed before is now larger than Standard Oil was when it was broken up and it's larger than AT&T was what it was broken up the size power market cap that Google has is unprecedented and in fact just two months ago the European Commission ordered Google to pay roughly 1.7 billion dollar fine because it engaged in quote abusive practices and online advertising there are many on this committee and including myself concerned about potential anti-competitive conduct from Google in the judgement of the witnesses what current practices at Google potentially raises the greatest threats to competition let me jump in on that thank you for the question my company competed directly with Google for over a decade we lost business often because we were trying to sell an advertising platform and they would say well you can do that but you'll lose access to all of our search ads you'll lose access to YouTube you know on Android we're going to prefer our own services in certain ways by the way we own the browser so they have to so many different pieces that for us to compete even with hundreds of millions of dollars of R&D and I personally invented and patented many of the fundamental technologies they were using we could not compete waiting for regulators to catch up I'm glad they finally got fined in Europe I had to sell my company I couldn't wait for that and I'm certainly not waiting for the u.s. to take action so I think we have to figure out how to keep their different businesses separate they can't share data across them they have to treat each other at arm's length YouTube should be open to any advertising platform their search data which is the property of the advertiser or the consumer should be available to any platform or no platform I think that's a very clear way to either break them up or force them to act fairly yes I agree with that if if you have this situation where one big company creates this cascade of monopolies by taking Network effects it's got all these people bought in over here and then it just dumps them on to some virgin territory over there and all the little mom-and-pop shops go go bang that's clearly a problem one way to solve this though is to let the individual user the market of users in a sense to have the decision on which bits of Google get to use their data for what right now you've no decision you know one of the aspects of Google's market power and this is true across a lot of big tech is concerned that a lot of Americans have that they are also using that market power to engage in political censorship to favor political views that that comport with the predilections of the company and to silence those views that don't just recently Google refused The Claremont Institute the ability to purchase advertising for its 40th anniversary gala because the president of the Institute had written an essay that Google disagreed with that I believe is is a significant threat to our democratic process and the ability of free speech of the marketplace of ideas to operate one of the great challenges however is there is little to no transparency so the Constitution subcommittee of this committee which I chaired we have held hearings where when we try to find out how many voices are you silencing how many voices are you shadow banning how many are on one side of the political spectrum or the other what degree of ideological bias is there we are consistently told no answers are forthcoming trust us we are a black box and but trust how we use our power does anyone in this panel a share those concerns or be have insights into how the public could have some basic data and transparency about the degree to which censorship is occurring I think that the censorship question is thorny and the option I wish I had was to be able to choose among sites and then if one had a reputation for being better I subscribe to the New York Times I find it to be an excellent quality newspaper if it were not I would subscribe to a different newspaper and I think that that having competition in the marketplace the competition on the basis of reputation ideas quality would go a long way toward making us not too worried about what the platform was putting on at the platform or less worried I shouldn't say not to worry and I agree with that I worry about your transparency point we don't know enough to hate Google I'll use a chick-fil-a example I love chick-fil-a but when they made some anti-gay maneuvers many years ago people decided to boycott because that was out in the public sphere now I personally couldn't stop eating it and many people had the same thing but that's a choice we make is the chicken so good I'm gonna go anyway and I could eat hamburgers so I think we need the same level of transparency from Google that we have from other big entities I want to know how they're lobbying I want to know these decisions they're making and I want that even more from Facebook and other platforms also on the transparency front when it comes to advertising is there any a mechanism to discover whether Google Facebook Twitter or other big tech companies are charging differential rates on advertising based on viewpoint put another way would it be concerning if we discovered that those companies charged Democrats 10 times more than they charge Republicans or vice-versa would would using advertising rates in an ideological and viewpoint driven perspective raise concerns having built ad platforms one the biggest concerns is that a lot of that pricing is based on competition for a given ad spot and so prices will go up with supply and demand so you'll see a Democratic primary where there are many Democrats vying for the same spot and price will go crazy but if there's really only one Republican who wants a certain subset of audience you wouldn't see a price change the question is how are humans applying heuristics to those decisions if you told me that they had their thumb on the scale and that they were saying yeah let's charge the Republican more - that would be a big problem but to get to that we'd have to really see inside the systems and this is a broader problem than just advertising this is all machine learning and artificial intelligence that goes to the former point about housing that goes to all of these issues where are we charging people more are we showing ads to people because of human interaction and bias or because they're just better at responding to those particular ads thank you just

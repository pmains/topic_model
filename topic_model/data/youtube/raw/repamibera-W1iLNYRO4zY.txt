Thank You mr. speaker the speaker i rise today in opposition of another bill that's aimed to come between a woman and her doctor' heard a lot of people talk about laws in California and so forth in what we're doing this is my license to practice medicine in California as a doctor quarter the oath I took as a doctor were three things to do good to do no harm and the third plank and the ethics that guided how we practice is patient autonomy that's what I want to talk about steak is what's buried in our Constitution as individual rights individual liberties and there is no right more sacred than what we do with our own bodies now my job as a doctor is to sit in that exam room answer the questions and empower my patients to make the decisions that best impact their lives that's why I find the conscious Protection Act so objectionable because it takes away a patient's right to make the decisions about their own health care let me give you an example that actually happened in our state in Northern California earlier this year a woman was going to have a baby she wanted to have that baby she was scheduled to have a c-section but she already had prior kids and she wanted to get a tubal ligation after the the c-section her doctor thought that was the most prudent thing to do that's totally acceptable that's standard of medical care the problem was her hospital said she couldn't do it because they consciously objected to it now to me that isn't a healthcare provider making a decision that isn't taking best medical practice and making a decision there wasn't anything an objection about about that that is why we need to get the government out of our health care system we need to get politicians out of the exam room we need to make these decisions about that sacred bond between a patient and their physician because she needs to make their decision the gentleman is recognized for 30 seconds this is about honoring that sacred oath between a patient and their physician let's protect patients rights let's make our patients and women able to make the decisions that best impact their lives and that is what this is about individual liberties and individual rights thank you and I yield back

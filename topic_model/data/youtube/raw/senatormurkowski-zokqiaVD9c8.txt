well i want to see what we're what we're looking at here oh this is this is alaska statewide in alaska so we're we're here today to talk about um what everybody's talking about and that is record high gas prices and whether you're here in washington dc or whether you are up north in alaska everyone everyone is seeing the impact for nine days now we have seen the national average of our gas prices above the highest ever levels if that doesn't get folks attention i'm not quite sure what will i come from a state where yeah we're an energy producer we recognize that but yet we pay some of the highest energy costs in in the country and right now our gas prices are the sixth highest in the country statewide regular gas has increased by more than 50 percent over last year it's actually been 52 percent as of yesterday alaska's at statewide average was five dollars a gallon this is the highest ever average in our state and again we're used to somewhat high prices but when it's on average over five dollars in places like anchorage and fairbanks think about what that means to our rural rural communities over 80 percent of our communities are not connected by road so fuel comes in by barge fuel comes in by air in fort yukon up the uh yukon river gas is uh seven dollars and 25 cents a gallon up in no tack just above the arctic circle it's a stunning 11 a gallon and so think about what that means it's not just what you're paying when you fill up your your your car it's everything else that is associated with it if you're a fisherman in cordova alaska we had a we had a conversation with a fisherman who said that last year at this time he fueled up his boat paid 2500 to fuel up his vessel to go out and uh and fish for black cod this year same time one year later he paid exactly double he paid five thousand dollars to fuel his vessel in the meantime the costs for food and for his crew have gone up by 10 percent and the cost for insurance has gone up by 30 percent what hasn't gone up is the prices that he's paid for his black cod so you look at this and this is absolutely unsustainable it's so it's it's not just the price that you're paying at the pump is what you're paying to keep your homes warm in no attack where again you've got pretty high oil prices think about what that means for your home heating fuel twelve hundred dollars a month how how is any of this sustainable how can you have sustainable communities so we're we're now at uh at a very exciting time in our in our in our state's calendar it's spring spring brings the uh a break up along the river system and the ice goes out in the sound but it's equally exciting because that's when the barges come so you haven't had fuel for since since the fall so think about what that means to these communities whether you're for yukon at seven dollars and 25 cents a gallon or no attack at 11 a gallon and you're now locked into a spring fuel barge delivery where they're anticipating that the increases will be a dollar fifty but not just a dollar fifty that you're you're transitioning into but you flip the switch on that now these are the everyday realities that people are facing so you can't afford to to fuel your boat to go fishing you can't afford to put fuel into a snow machine or a four-wheeler to go hunting so this is real this is real now you're gonna hear my colleagues talk a lot about the prices in their state which are impacting the people that they represent but alaskans are saying all right we're dealing with this right now what are you doing in washington dc to to address all of this they want to know what's the plan here right now we've got an administration whose plan is to blame anybody but them and their policies they're quick to blame it all on putin yes there is a war yes we recognize that but this these price increases started long before putin crossed into ukraine this is this is not something where you can just blame big oil and go after price gouging this is not this is not something where you can attack others when it is failed policies that this administration has put in place it it really comes down to basic supply and demand and we know that supply matters and domestic supply matters if we're not learning anything from from ukraine and russia and what we're seeing in eastern europe domestic supply matters so the biden administration needs to reverse its anti-supply actions it needs to take its bad ideas off the table it needs to restart our development programs it needs to start approving crucial projects that deliver greater supply it's a pretty simple choice here we can pick alaska over iran we can pick wyoming over venezuela so it's pretty easy here my colleagues are going to have a great deal more to say about this so i will turn to the senator from wyoming the ranking member of the energy and natural resources committee who's been leading on these issues for a long time senator brasso

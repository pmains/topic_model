thank you i want to thank my colleague for hosting this critical special order to discuss the ongoing impact of enhanced unemployment benefits on main street businesses the american workforce and our economic recovery like many of my colleagues i've seen help wanted signs all over my district i've heard from local job creators about the difficulties they face in hiring workers they need just to stay open many have told me they can't even get people to show up for an interview enhanced federal unemployment benefits made sense last year as a way to keep those who lost the job and to reduce the economic impact of government-imposed business closures and stay-at-home orders but now we're facing a much different situation today safe and effective vaccines are bringing us closer to defeating cobot 19. employers have updated their facilities and operations so workers can safely return back to work businesses are fully operating now is the time to put reconnected unemployment employment workers with their jobs but enhanced jobless benefits are discouraging americans from returning to work making it impossible for businesses to hire the democrats partisan 1.9 trillion dollar spending bill extended supplement supplemental unemployment benefits of three hundred dollars per week until september sixth at this level nearly forty percent of jobless americans can make more unemployment than they can by returning to work main street businesses shouldn't have to compete with the federal government for workers in fact they can't compete with the federal government for workers the labor shortage currently is crushing small business which are fighting to keep their businesses alive coming out of the pandemic in late march i hosted a virtual round table and heard from a hoosier who owns a small installation company he told me quote it's been quite the burden to have all these tools on hand and all these trucks in the driveway to put people in the seats to get them to be able to drive to homes to provide insulation when nobody wants to come to work and just last week we saw the undeniable impact of these misguided policies when a monthly jobs report showed hiring slowing to a crawl in april in this country despite millions of job openings my biggest fear is that we'll see permanent job loss across this country our economy and small businesses will close their doors because they can't hire workers that they need but it's not too late to avoid this outcome i recently joined ways and means republican leader kevin brady in introducing the reopening america by supporting workers in business act our bill would turn extra unemployment benefits into a back to work bonus that would incentivize these workers to come back to work instead of staying on unemployment the legislation would also reinstate the federal requirement that those receiving unemployment benefits be engaged in actively searching for a job the american people have faced unprecedented challenges since last spring now safe and effective vaccines have renewed us in our hope that we can defeat covet 19 rebuild our economy and return to normal life let's not put our recovery at risk by pushing workers to the sidelines of this economy let's get americans back to work main street businesses back on their feet and the american dream back on track for every single american thank you and i yield back

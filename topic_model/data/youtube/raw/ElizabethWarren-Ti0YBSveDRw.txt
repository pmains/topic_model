they're a high school for dogs i don't know there might be no if there is believe me bailey would be running around in high school right now hi i'm elizabeth warren and this is bailey bailey and i have been answering kids questions about the coronavirus today i wanted you to meet someone special her name is ramona i met ramona and her mom in indiana a while ago and her mom told me that ramona's battling brain cancer and she asked me to keep fighting for universal health care i've carried their story with me ever since ramona's dad works in a hospital so she hasn't been able to see him in case he gets the virus she's got to stay safe so she sent me a video to tell me what's been going on i'm feeling sad because i don't know when i'm gonna get to see my dad again so today is ramona's birthday and i thought what we do bailey and i is that we give ramona a call and wish her a happy birthday hello hey say hello to ramona come on say hi bailey happy birthday thank you what are you doing that's special i made one velvet cake from everything that's a good move that's a good move have you seen your grandchildren no but we but we've done zoom they sang happy birthday to bruce my husband bruce had a birthday just recently we got on zoom and we all figured out how to change her background yes so we did a bunch of crazy crazy green screens and had a lot of fun but that's the only way i could see them because i'm in massachusetts and they're clear out in california so we don't we don't get to go back and forth have you been able to see your grandparents at all one of my grandmas was right with me now actually came to grandma's house about six weeks ago oh well that's good yeah ramona had brain scans um last week and we wanted to make sure that she would be clear to be scanned good because she had a covent test and everything yeah well her dad works healthcare he's a ct tech so he's exposed pretty regularly and we want to make sure that ramona wasn't he's one of the essential workers one of the people who's on the front lines out there it's really important work that he does and i'm grateful for it and so is everyone else did you want to ask us a few other questions what could we have done to be better prepared for this country it's a good question ramona you know we knew long long time ago long before you were even born that at different times uh viruses sweep or all the way around the world and so one of the things that uh it is the responsibility of our government to do is to watch for these to put money into the research so that when one of them comes that we'll be ready for it now with this coronavirus we spotted it late last year and by early january it was clear this thing was a real problem and it was coming all around the country so what could we have done we could have done a lot more planning early on you know get ready uh stockpile the masks to make sure there are plenty of them so everybody who needs them has got access to them same thing for the gowns same things for the ventilators that's a big part of what i think is government's responsibility is to plan there's a lot we could have done earlier what matters is what we're going to do going forward so what i'm going to keep working on is making sure that we have enough money and put it in to our hospitals to our health care workers also to people who are out of work into small businesses that have had to close down and to make sure that we keep all those pieces working because it's really important and bailey has finally worn out i don't think you can see him he's he's only down there in my lap but he's going to have a birthday tomorrow so you and bailey are just practically birthday buddies here how old is is bailey two two which i think in in dog years makes him a teenager is there a high school for dogs i don't know if there is believe me bailey would be running around in high school right now all right so take care have a happy birthday luna i will okay it's good to see you bailey can you wave goodbye yeah bye-bye [Music]

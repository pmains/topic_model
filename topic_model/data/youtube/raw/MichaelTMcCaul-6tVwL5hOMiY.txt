axe Isis now has demonstrated great capability beyond the Caliphate before they were focused on the caliphate itself now we've seen three external operations in just a matter of weeks to me it's very disturbing the mastermind of the Paris attacks mr. Abboud recently bragged about traveling to and from the conflict zone without getting caught and recently he was quoted in The Beat Magazine which is the ISIS publication basically saying quote I was able to leave and come despite being chased after by so many intelligence agencies my name and picture were all over the news yet I was able to stay in their homeland plan operations against them and least safely when doing so became necessary Isis is blatantly seeking to exploit security gaps into the West they are also looking at refugee routes as a pathway for the jihadists and in fact Isis in their own words stated that they will exploit the refugee process to infiltrate the West and indeed one of the Paris attackers if not to now we at now have found work sporting the refugee process to get in to Paris to perpetrate the devastating attacks FBI director Comey recently testified before my committee basically saying that we can query our databases until the cows come home but nothing will show up because we have no record of them yesterday I introduced a bill it will put the brakes on this Syrian refugee program until the FBI director of the DNI and Secretary of Homeland Security can demonstrate test that these individuals can be properly vetted and that they do not pose a threat to this country my question first mr. also is we are compassionate nation but we also need to protect the lives of Americans do you agree that before any Syrian refugees are brought into this country that Congress and the American people must be assured that first they can be properly vetted and second do not pose a national security risk to the United States mr. chairman certainly that proposition is is a is accurate and true and I agree with it in other words that the vetting process that is in place for any individual coming here through the refugee program needs to be as stringent as possible and all possible assurances need to be in place that the person doesn't pose a threat I think that the longer answer to your question mr. chairman is that any process is going to bear some it's going to include some risk so it's it is impossible to eliminate all risk for every single person coming into this country that's just a fact of of any process like this but the process that's in place for for these refugees is quite extensive and as you pointed out earlier during the opening statements involves multiple layers well you know in the briefings we've had we have if you don't have information on the individuals is very indie don't know who they are it's it's difficult to vet them I think we were like better assurances general Keane do you have any thoughts on them I don't know how the United States of American can possibly say no to people who were point out of that country given the horror of what's taken place and given our contribution to that horror frankly when we had significant opportunities to to create some huge momentum against the Assad regime and for four plus years he's been more roaring over that population killing 250,000 creating 11 million displaced and some of those obviously have the opportunity to come here I'm absolutely convinced that you're doing the right thing by pausing and making certain that the Congress takes a look at the executive branch's plans and make certain that is some it's reasonable what we're doing in terms of a vetting process we have had three million people come here since the 70s we had a million come here since nine eleven all seeking political asylum this is who we are I we can manage this thing and listen some of the voices that are out there about this I'll playing right into Isis hands when we talk about let's only take Christians I mean that's a horrific statement that is playing right into ice this is what Isis wants Isis wants fragmentation between Muslims and non-muslims and we we have that's an irresponsible statement to make we are a country with Muslims in it and why wouldn't we welcome Muslims and others from around the world like we've always done who were being persecuted we didn't care about their religion or the nationality well we cared about is they were humans running from suffering and death and it was a home for people like that in America come on this is America I mean we can do this right we're smart enough to figure out how to bring thousands of people into this country and make sure they're not going to hurt us we anyway let me in we will continue to have this refugee crisis until the root problem is resolved and that is a conflict in Syria what are your thoughts general on the article 5 invocation potential with the France weather with the role NATO could be with respect to Syria and now with Russia in the region further complicating the issue how do you see the path forward us that i'm a chairman yes sir ok i think the NATO issue is largely Francis decision I don't think we should have an advocacy for it except to support it if they make the case for it I mean clearly what we have looked at terrorism in the past and particularly in NATO countries in Europe it has grown out of their own countries by their own citizens largely what makes this different is that there is the ilanic state which is motivating inspiring and in this particular case as director Olsen said may in fact have been directing it that does change it I believe in terms of article 5 and they certainly have the right to invoke it I don't expect much from the Europeans to be quite frankly about this I mean I think the Europeans have lost national ole even the fight for themselves much less for somebody else and I think the French will stand up and do what they need to do just our British friends for example just think about this the Islamic state is declared itself and it's the border between Syria and Iraq does not exist anymore and the Brits are attacking in Iraq but not attacking in Syria I mean what an absurdity that is and not going after the enemy that's declared itself the Islamic state I'm not hopeful that NATO will do much of anything here frankly a quick question and a short answer the administration seems to be taking its eye off the ball in Syria and now we're in a room we're in a mess right now to what extent do you think the Iran negotiations had any influence on our inability to deal with Assad in the Syrian situation I think they have everything to deal with perpetuating the civil war in Syria I think it has always been the elephant in the room when many of the moderate rebels came here in 2011 that's when they began when the war began and they were seeking assistance and the administration was saying no they met probably some of you they may even met with me that's how desperate they were and and then in 2012 remember this Clinton Panetta Petraeus and Dempsey recommend to the administration that we need to arm the Syrian moderate rebels robustly and train them the president said no and that is a competent security team making that recommendation in my judgment in 2013 as a result of the crossing the chemical line the chemical red line we did not take the action which we if we had taken it we would have shut down asad's air power and what do we get for that serious still has pemmican production capability serious still has chemical weapons admittedly nothing on the scale that they did have but we said they would never get rid of all of that I believe those decisions were largely driven by the Iranian nuclear deal that we did not want to disrupt it and it's still driving our policy in the Middle East it is that decision that has lost the our allies confidence in the region in us and to this day they're not convinced even right now as we're speaking they are not convinced that the United States of America is serious about going after Isis and that's out of their mouths that's what they believe that we are not serious and and what they have seen is the intensity of the u.s. effort for three years it's been about trying to establish a strategic alliance with Iran and the vehicle to do that is in nuclear disarm weapons deal and it the price that that has caused us is is pretty significant Thank You general chair recognizes chairman Royce the general I think there's another casualty in terms of that deference that

I think the chair good morning welcome everyone to the consumer protection and commerce subcommittee hearing on counterfeit products I first want to recognize how President Trump and his administration are leading to combat counterfeit and pirated goods online the president has made this a priority which is clear in phase one of the us-china trade deal for instance China agreed to provide enforcement procedures to facilitate effective and quick takedowns consider revoking ecommerce operating licenses for repeated failures take action to stop the manufacturing of pirated and counterfeit products take enforcement action against counterfeit medicines and other products that have made a significant impact on public health or safety and increase the number of trained professionals to inspect detain and destroy any counterfeit goods found at the Chinese border in addition on January 24th the Department of Homeland Security released its first report required by president Trump's April 2019 memorandum on combating trafficking in counterfeit and pirated goods this is a call to action to fight against cheaters and bad actors gaming the e-commerce system the report recommends where the government should take action and best practices for e-commerce pot platforms and other third party marketplaces among the best practices the administration is calling on companies to enhance the vetting of third-party sellers limit high risk risk products clear transactions through banks that comply with US law and provide rapid and rapid notice and takedown procedures following the report president Trump signed an executive order to ensure safe and lawful eep product e-commerce products people and guard against intellectual property abuse I commend the administration for their leadership as I've said before to win the future and beat China America must be the global leader in the 21st century economy just like we must lead to promote artificial intelligence and deploy autonomous vehicles America must also lead to stop counterfeit goods and protect our intellectual property if we don't step up China will dictate the terms and the rules for the future the Chinese Communist Party will win with the PlayBook they've always used by undermining human rights stealing from our innovators and cheating and harming Americans America innovates and creates while China's cheats and steals according to a report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development China is quote the single largest producing market of counterfeit and pirated products administration officials estimate the more than a hundred thousand packages from China arrive in America a day that could harm and defraud people more than 85% of all contraband seized at our borders come from China and Hong Kong while the administration is taking to fight decisive action the government and regulations cannot solve this issue alone the best way to predict the future is to invent it American innovators must be equipped to win the future and beat China in artificial intelligence blockchain IOT and other emerging technologies companies today are leveraging AI to analyze data points to discover counterfeit listings and repeat offenders IOT provides identification and traceability functions that can be used to address and track counterfeit sales blockchain may provide a unique solution to this complex problem for example a tamper-proof chain of custody that uses smart tags can ensure only authentic products are included in the blockchain and sold as a DHS report suggests we should leverage public-private partnerships to develop a national awareness campaign we should educate people about the risk of counterfeits as well as the various ways they can spot and report counterfeits online details in Spokane Valley Washington is also working with businesses to navigate online marketplaces and protect their brands from actors they do so by helping small businesses conduct test buys documenting counterfeits and filing complaints among other services it's proactive Pro innovative and pro consumer and actions like this should be concurrent commerce sites that are convenient for people and create more opportunity for small businesses to succeed I thank the leaders at like details for taking action for the health and safety of customers and I encourage this committee to lead by harnessing not holding back the innovation and the agility of the private sector to address this pervasive problem of counterfeit products thank you and I yield back

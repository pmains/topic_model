[Applause] wow thank you uh thank you guys thank you mr president i love saying that uh thanks to the black caucus i'm not gonna call out all the fraternities and sororities because that just get me in trouble i'm not gonna go there um but seriously thank you thank you all for having me back again i will always come to this celebration this moment of remembering our past we're here because of a story right we're here because of something that happened in galveston texas in 1865 when a group of african americans learned that the civil war indeed was over and they were in fact free but we're also here to remember the history that came before that and the history that came after that and the history we are still making today and i want to emphasize history right now because let's be honest we're living in a time in america when history is making some people uncomfortable we see what's happening in the states across this country you all saw what happened in florida where they passed a law that says you cannot talk honestly about our country's history in schools where they actually get this they banned mathematics textbooks because they included biographies of african-american mathematicians that's happening in america in the year 2022 well i think we got to talk about our history honestly and when we ask our kids to study our history honestly what they're going to learn is that this great country was founded on a promise on a beautiful perfect promise that was immediately broken and the whole story of our country is a story of people coming together to struggle to find a way to keep that promise to make us better to build a more perfect union the reason i'm proud to be an american is that this is a country where we look in the mirror where we look at each other honestly where we always strive to be better today than we were tomorrow and the thing that amazes me about america you know what amazes me about this country it's that the people who we persecuted the most believe in the promise of our country the most it is our african-american community after they after slavery was over before they got the basic rights of citizenship who marched again and again and again not just for themselves but for everybody else to open those doors to freedom to everybody it is the descendants of those slaves before they were granted when they were still being denied the basic rights of citizenship who advocated for the right to vote for everyone and to this day in parts of america stand for hours for hours just to exercise the right to vote is what amazes me that is something that makes me proud to be an american not that they have to wait hours to vote but there is still such dedication such passion for defending what's best about our country so we got a lot more to do and i know we're having this meeting at a time of great anxiety in our country we're just a few weeks from one of the worst mass shootings of children which followed one of the worst racist mass shootings that we have seen in years in buffalo new york and i know there are people who say well you know what it was evil that did that and i agree but i happen to think i prefer to live in a country where evil is not armed with an ar-15 where racism is not armed with an ar-15 can we do something about that and we're trying to do something about that in congress we've got educational disparities that we got to do something about we've got an environmental justice agenda that we have got to fight for we've got to fight and act for greater equality but there's one suggestion that i always make on june 19th that has to do with holidays and it has to do with the history that we are celebrating and marking today it was a wonderful thing that we got this holiday marking what happened more than 150 years ago i think there's one more holiday that we could use in the united states that would give meaning to the struggle of all the people who are liberated on that day and that is to make election day a national holiday in our country so that we have voting rights so that we enable people who work 12 15 20 hours a day who have to come home and take care of their kids to be able to exercise that basic right without having to line up for hours that's what i would like to do to add to june 19th and to give this day meaning thank you very very much

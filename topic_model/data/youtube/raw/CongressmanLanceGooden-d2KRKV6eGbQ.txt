and now to the growing international crisis with Iran and what that has to do with Texas we are 7,200 miles away from where a US air strike killed a top Iranian general several days ago since then stocks are down gas prices are up and anxiety has many on edge this is our first topic for congressman Lance Gooden this morning the Republican from taro represents the fifth congressional district which stretches through seven counties from Dallas White Rock Lake down to Palestine and he is in studio congressman good to see you thanks for having me let's start with start with you Ron happy New Year to you as well - thank you hard to believe the new year has been so long ago as well - let's start with Iran though the president campaigned on getting troops out of the Middle East and here we are sending thousands more back to the Middle East do you support that I support the president a hundred percent this president is the first president in a while that has actually made good on his promises we have created an environment where America is not respected by our enemies and Donald Trump has changed that and in the last week I think we've seen evidence of that this president said he would protect American lives abroad and American interests and he's done that and executing that general was absolutely the right thing to do it should have been done long ago do you support a war with Iran absolutely not and neither does the president no one wants a war I don't even know that Iran wants a war but I think we're getting to the point where Iran is going to have to make decisions about what they're gonna do next they have limited options the regime there in Iran is losing support there are uprisings just a few months ago hundreds of their own citizens were actually killed by this regime because they're so worried about losing power so that's something to watch as the days move on but they're they're worried over in Iran about how they're going to respond and make good on their promise to strike back knowing that there will be further consequences what is the likely retaliation do you think cyber attack or is it attack enough maybe one military base or what in the last few hours I believe the Iranian government has said that their intention is to attack military another military attack on us but again their options are limited because of the weak support at home for that Iran in regime well let me ask you about this with everything there's nothing that's black and white what happens if Iraq expels the US military from you know the country over there wouldn't that put us at a disadvantage in fighting Iran or in fighting the Islamic state which remains a threat today sure there's a lot of bad things that could happen but one of the worst things I can think of would be to do nothing and let people or let countries terrorist sponsors continue to just march all over us which is what they have done for years the reason this general was stepping off the plane at the Baghdad Airport so freely is because he'd done it for years most terrorist leaders like him have fly under the radar but this one for years brazenly just flew around the world knowing that there were no repercussions and this was this was enough for for the President to say this this can't continue to happen and these attacks on the embassy a few weeks ago the attack on the contractors they started all this the president wants to end this and he said let's take some action and I'm happy he did let's shift gears and talk about impeachment the House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has not seen it seems like old news doesn't it has been a long time there's a lot has happened between then but the speaker has not said when she'll send over the articles of impeachment to the Senate the Senate must consider it but does it have any options while it's just kind of hanging in limbo here yeah one of the great options which is why I'm just thrilled for her to sit on as long as she wants is that Senator McConnell can continue to push through nominations of all these judicial conferees the president has a lot of names out there and I suspect you'll see throughout the month of January the Senate will be confirming judicial nominees if speaker Pelosi chooses to sit on the impeachment articles but I think the big issue with these with this question about what does Speaker gonna do is who cares this whole process was illegitimate she can sit on it she can send to the to the Senate I don't know that anyone cares what she does because anything she does as far as I'm concerned is illegitimate at this point and by the Senate taking up all these judicial nominees and the other 250 appointments that are out there right how would that affect Democrats well they're gonna have a tough decision to make do they put aside their hatred for the president send these impeachment articles over to the Senate knowing he's going to be acquitted and is going to campaign on that or do they focus on these these judicial nominees do they just accept that they're gonna have some decisions to make but I think what's interesting to me is that Republicans were totally shut out of the process on the house side and now all the sudden Democrats want to be in on the process on the Senate side speaker Pelosi has said since day one this is about the Constitution no where in the Constitution does it say the Speaker of the US House tells the US Senate how to run their trial for an impeachment we're gonna wait to see what happens on that but I want to ask you in the final moments here too you were the first congressman to get an endorsement for re-election from the president why in the world did he picked you out well I have earned his trust since I took office I have executed on my campaign promises and that was to support the make America great again agenda support the president my district is a trump district we are Trump country the heart of Trump country and the person who's called you several times right out that door all the way to East Texas yes he has we flew together on Air Force One here to the rally just outside these in October in October and really got to know each other and we spoken several times since then he called me the day after my father passed in December and he's a wonderful man well sorry to hear about your father and congratulations on the successful first term it sounds like and happy New Year to you Thank You congressman Thank You Lance good and the congressman from the fifth congressional district from Dallas White Rock Lake all the way down to Palestine thanks for coming in thanks

next please to join with mr. Poe as the lead democratic sponsor of the combat terrorist use of social media act three things about the bill the State Department's current strategy for countering Isis and other extremist groups online is obviously not working that's not my opinion that's a state department's internal opinion which concluded in june of this year when it comes to the external message our narrative is being trumped by Isis we are losing a popularity contest to people that behead women public information also so the State Department strategy isn't working the think again turn away Twitter campaign has 24 thousand followers in order to reach out to those who might be swayed by Isis you're going to need a much bigger following the this bill requires a state department to reassess their approach and come up with a better more effective strategy second I'm hoping that this bill will prod the State Department to hire experts in Islamic theology and in is Islamic jurisprudence uh not everybody they hire has to be a graduate of an Ivy League school or a top American school we need just a couple of folks over there graduates of Allah's our University in Egypt I'm not saying the State Department can issue a fatwa but somebody at the State Department should be paid because they're an expert at knowing who should be issuing a fatwa and how to make our arguments consistent with all of the interests intricacies of Islamic law and Islamic jurisprudence finally the social media companies have played a role in this I believe Facebook YouTube and Twitter have a responsibility to make sure that their platforms are not used by terrorists Facebook YouTube and with some from members of this committee Twitter have made changes to take down bad content but that won't work effectively if the State Department isn't identifying the bad content the only thing worse than playing whack Amole is to not whack the moles and every time one of these terrorist sites pops up we should see it before the attended audience and have it taken down before they attended intended audience so um I look forward to the passage of that legislation and to a much better strategy from the State Department finally as far as arming the Kurdish regional government it's about time we wouldn't have to do it if Baghdad had been reasonable but if the Baghdad government had been reasonable we wouldn't even have Isis to begin with I yield back thank you we grown out of mr.

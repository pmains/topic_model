those two gop lawmakers congressman scott franklin and congressman fred keller join me now uh i'm gonna go to you first congressman keller how did this happen well the uh the wall was being built uh when president biden uh dropper got sworn in he signed an executive order holding construction while still i mean i don't fault the contractors for for not not putting up the wall and still getting paid they signed a contract but president biden stopped construction and if we're going to pay at tax dollar pair dollars invested in materials that protect our border we met with ranchers and heartbreaking stories the one ranch family farming for over a hundred years if their family farmed the land they're afraid to be on their property and they tell us what what the people from the the customs and border patrol tell us the wall worked they were pleading with us to get the byte administration to begin construction of the wall again and finish the job that was started that is helpful to protect americans on their own property congressman franklin i want to go to you because when i talk with american citizens in the airport and when i'm traveling into different districts they're frustrated by this because they realize that this is impacting the congress the president former president trump was able to get a lot of this done through executive action taking some of that money to build the wall but he never got the funding from congress to be able to get this done this is why the biden administration was able to stop this so what are the republicans going to do when they get back in power to make sure we have the funding for the wall well i can assure you if i'm any part of that solution it's going to be to get the wall built right away it's it's the number one thing to try to you know close down the border and the areas away from the detention facilities and really what this is is a big distraction that's created by the cartels if the public sees any of this at all they're seeing the children in detention facilities and as tragic as that is the bigger problem that's going to have long-term impact for us are literally hundreds of thousands of really bad people that are coming across the borders that don't want to be caught these are the ones that aren't wearing biden for president t-shirts and showing up with their hands in the air and it's the folks that are coming across some camouflage and ski mask and automatic weapons that are smuggling drugs smuggling children and terrorists illegal weapons and there's nothing to stop them there without the law yeah i want to switch gears with you guys because this is the nation is on edge in minnesota maxine waters was there on saturday this is what she had to say quote i would like to see the bill in congress pass on police reform but i know what the right wing the racists are opposed they are opposed to it and i don't know what's going to happen to it this is guilty for murder i don't know whether it's the first degree but as far as i'm concerned is first degree murder we got to stay on the street and we've got to get more active we've got to get more confrontational we've got to make sure that they know that we mean business uh congressman um franklin what is your quick reaction to the just the hypocrisy and the dangerous rhetoric that she's spewing it's not helpful doesn't help the country it's not helping us heal and uh i'm just ready to see the rest of the mainstream media call this out for the hypocrisy that it is congressman keller there has to be an alternative to this message what are the republicans going to do because businesses are suffering people are dying in the street there has to be a balance between justice and peace and accountability what's your message well the message first i would say to representative waters is that there is a bill out there or senator scott has a a reform bill that would do what we need to do and provide law enforcement with the tools they need in the communities and community policing it does all that and her talking points and encouraging people to lash out at others is certainly not a message of unity if that's what they're about what we need to do is we need to start talking about what is great in america are there things we need to fix absolutely but there is legislation out there and the senator scott's bill is certainly an answer and a way to start getting us to that point congressman thank you so much i appreciate it jet

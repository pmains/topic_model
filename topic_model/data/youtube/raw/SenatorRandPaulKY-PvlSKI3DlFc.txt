the office of civil rights uh sent a letter to connecticut saying that uh boys can't compete with girls in in sports or it shouldn't be forced to allow boys to compete in girls sports uh if you're confirmed will you enforce that office of civil rights opinion hello senator uh thank you for the question i understand that there are a lot of concerns about that it's it's if confirmed it's my responsibility and my uh privilege to make sure that we're following uh our civil rights of all students and that includes activities that they may engage in in high school or in athletics what do you think in general about boys running in girls track mates like they've been doing in connecticut i think that it's critically important that educated education systems and educators respect the rights of all students including students who are transgender and that they are afforded the opportunities that every other student has to uh participate in extracurricular activity does it bother you that like the top 20 of boys running in track meets beat all of the girls in the state and that it you know would you know completely destroy girls athletics the girls are being pushed out um they don't make the finals in the state meet they don't get college scholarships that it's really detrimental to girls sports do you worry about having boys running girls track trackmates you know i i recognize and appreciate the concerns um and the frustrations that are expressed i've as commissioner of education have had conversations with families uh who have felt the way you just described it in families of uh students who are transgender so i understand that this is a challenge i look forward to working with you and others to do you think it's fair you need to have boys running in the girls track mate i think it's appropriate for i think it's it's the legal responsibility of schools to provide opportunities for students to uh participate in activities and this includes students who are transgender so you don't have a problem then with boys running in the girls track meet swimming meets name it you're okay then with boys competing with girls respectfully senator i think i answered the question i believe schools should offer the opportunity for students to engage in extracurricular activities even if they're transgender i think that's they're right all right well a lot of us think that that's bizarre you know not very fair you know i come from a family that has a lot of girls who have been have competed in college athletics have been state champions and frankly you know some boy that's six foot two competing against my five foot four niece doesn't sound very fair i think most people in the country think it's bizarre you know that it's just completely bizarre and unfair that people and you're gonna run the department of education you've got no problem with it um that concerns me and i i think it's this kind of thing is going to lead to really just the vast majority of america just wondering who are these people that think it's okay from what planet are you from i mean to think it's okay that boys would compete with girls and attract me that that somehow would be fair um i wonder where feminists are on this i wonder where the people who supported women's sports are on this i mean we all going to be okay with hulking six foot four guys you know wrestling against girls do it you know com it just makes no sense whatsoever and so i think the fact that you seem to be afraid to answer the question or you basically do answer the question by saying it's okay without saying it's okay really is a statement to a real problem we have and a disconnect between what middle america and what most americans actually believe i even think most democrats don't believe girls should run in the boys track meet you know boys should run the girls track meet so i'm disappointed in the answer and i just can't imagine that we're going to have a policy like that nationally

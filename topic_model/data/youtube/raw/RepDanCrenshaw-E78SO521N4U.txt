we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created as a member of congress i get to have a lot of really interesting people in the office experts on what they're talking about this is the podcast for insights into the issues china bioterrorism medicare for all in-depth discussions breaking it down into simple terms we old we hold we hold these truths we hold these truths with dan crenshaw all right welcome back guys uh important topic today opioid addiction um a lot of causes of death these days the united states like a thousand ways to die um unfortunately opioids is one of our worst and it's getting worse and worse and worse i think in 2017 uh 47 000 americans died as a result of opioid overdose the most recent numbers from 2020 is 93 000. i think about two-thirds three-quarters of that is fentanyl overdoses um it's a real problem and so where did this start in the late 1990s pharmaceutical companies reassured the medical community that patients would not become addicted to prescription opioid pain relievers this is things like oxycontin healthcare providers began to prescribe them at greater rates because they work really well this subsequently led to widespread diversion and misuse of these medications before it became clear that these medications could indeed be highly addictive opioid overdose rates began to increase like i said 2017 to 2020 they've more than doubled um and so it's gotten worse too because what happens is a lot of people get to get from their prescription opioids and they move on to heroin and a lot of new drugs are now laced with fentanyl which is coming into our country in droves to help us with this conversation i want to bring on um uh somebody who's really on the front lines of this daniel powell daniel thanks so much for being on thank you it's an honor so you're the ceo of um spark biomedical and we know each other because you are one of the speakers and guests at uh my annual health care summit and brought you on because you've just got this device that's really incredible you're based in houston which makes you more incredible of course and um we we demonstrated this and i i was pretty taken aback by it and uh pretty taken aback by the the video testimony that you had from one of your patients this woman who is terribly addicted to opioids and um so this basically saved her within a matter of days which is which is really incredible as as i think americans are really desperate to search for something that works on this on this issue i mean it's killing tens of thousands of people it's ruining lives uh and and especially it's very regionalized too i mean it's which it almost makes it worse because it's just not diffused throughout the country and there's entire towns that seem to be hit by this um you know depending on what high school you go to if if it was if if your high school was infiltrated by a drug dealer and got everybody addicted to opioids we're seeing those kids they might get off of it they might get back on it but we're seeing them live normal lives you know have multiple kids and then overdose right because they just they go back on it it never leaves them that sort of that demon inside it just never leaves them and then they're and then they're gone and they leave a family behind i've seen multiple cases of this especially in the northeast where my wife is from um so tell us about your journey on on this issue and how you can how you how you came upon your device and what it does and you know to your your point the amount of orphans that are in the system because of overdose is beyond tragic especially in west virginia ohio some of the the ground zeroes of it but for me my journey um you know it began a little opposite that we had addiction in my uh my close family and we didn't talk about it and you know i had the same stigma of opinions about it that a lot of people do it wasn't until you know i i saw the effects of neurostimulation on somebody coming out of withdrawal and the lights turned on they're using acupuncture and which are the same networks uh we address pictures real quick because i i kind of left it a mystery to the audience so let's really quickly say what the device is it's neurostimulation it's a device that you basically put around your ear and it stimulates the brain and um and and somehow removes the addiction i just want to let the audience kind of know what how to envision what we're talking about so yeah in the background for me i've been a neurostimulation uh for about 20 years we put wires in people's brains for um movement disorders and wires in people's spinal cord near their spinal cord to block pain signals so it was very familiar with this so understanding how you can modulate the nervous system was close but then seeing the profound effect uh saw a video that wasn't our patient of somebody and this girl went from a just a complete mess it's not coming down her face shaking it's just the agitation and then 45 minutes just turned into a completely different person visually and i was like this this is amazing so the more we dug into it me and my partners the more we really understood how this affects the brain we understand to learn more about you know what a diseased uh brain that's suffering uh substance a substance uh use disorder and then how we can really start to affect it i will say we're not we're not curing addiction yet uh right now the fda has approved us to mitigate withdrawal symptoms the big step we are doing is can we really heal the brain over time which may be considered curative of addiction that's a pretty bold statement i don't want to i don't want to overstep without the science yeah well but tell us more about this patient that you're that you're talking about um and deep withdrawals and and maybe give us an idea of how this device works is does it actually it it's not physically sticking wires into your brain in this case right or is it correct correct which amazingly enough uh on all the morning news this morning out of west virginia the rockefeller institute was showing their first patient that they put wires in the brain to curb cravings doing deep brain stimulation so i it's um serendipitous we're talking today because this is far less invasive than that procedure so a brain that's become addicted to opioids gets changed over time it functionally doesn't operate the same anymore and uh is severely dependent meaning you will go into really bad withdrawals without the drug what we're able to do is essentially jump start the brain to start to produce its own endorphins so opioids are an exogenous endorphin the body's lazy the moment you give your body if if a bodybuilder takes steroids they stop producing testosterone and then when they stop taking steroids they don't start producing testosterone like the systems are asleep and take a long time it's exactly what the brain's doing it's a sleep it's been getting all these wonderful exogenous endorphins in the form of opioids and so your body's ability to produce the chemicals to manage stress fear are all gone and then on top of that you're going through painful painful physical withdrawals so it's a long story to get that there's a disorder of the systems we drive the production of endogenous endorphins bring down this primal fight or flight and these are direct signals into the brain into the center of the brain that's controlling these mechanisms and it's is it tailored towards the i guess uh bioelectric signals i don't know i just made up that word by electric signals uh is is it basically tailored towards the individual in that sense um it's tailored towards the nerves language we're speaking to so different nerves talk at different speeds and frequencies and like different intensities so we're we're touching two different nerves the trigeminal nerve and the vagus nerve both have a branch that comes up near the ear which is why we have an earpiece that goes on and those signals go into basically a junction box in the brain that activates these uh different mechanisms what how much does this thing cost i want to buy one right now so if if you're going through a one-week detox that's about 1500 wow so how does that compare to what a normal detox is these days well detox so detox that can mean a lot of things i understand but yeah so there's one and only one pill on the market so chemicals that is 1500 a week to manage withdrawal symptoms there really is no other solution for withdrawal we're working on we don't have fda approval but the next step in the evolution is to wear the device for three months because once if you just because you detox you haven't beat addiction you're still gonna feel bad you still have you know the the underlying traumas that probably caused it uh you're gonna have long-term withdrawal uh they call it post-acute withdrawal so we think if we in cravings cravings being the big reason for relapse so that's our next evolution which is an nih funded study okay but i mean as far as cost goes just you know a policy maker so i think in terms of that and it's 1500 to just to make the device i mean it's the cost of the device so it shouldn't if you wear for three months or one week should it cost a lot more is there other treatments associated with this oh it's just the disposable components you have a disposable earpiece so it's more of a daily disposable yeah right so it's so i mean the main point here is it's cheaper it's cheaper than going into rehab for three months yeah and it increases your chance of success the worst thing to do is not make it through rehab and go have to do it again right that you know especially if you're going cold turkey and you don't make it you're repeating all those costs all over again right how did you did is this particular issue um personal to you in any way or is it is it more your your background in in neurostimulation that led you here i would say neurostimulation first like i said um addiction had touched close family members it became far more personal during the journey when i asked uh i'll keep it a little anonymous for fairness sake but you know i asked the dad of the person addicted you know how's this been because we just didn't talk about it and he said you just have no idea and and he goes what we spend the fear and it actually you know really just having an honest conversation uh about what it did to his family and uh having a kid go through this and it it's still going on to this day uh and and then i have i have other family members that have been on long-term opioids for pain management um and my mom my mom won't mind me telling she's been on methadone for lyme disease for seven eighteen years it doesn't work for lyme disease she can't stop taking it um she's stuck taking it so i've seen it on the pain side where you're just over prescribed she doesn't abuse you want to call her an addict but she's stuck for life on this um hopefully our device can change that uh it has become pretty personal and it softened my opinion of it quite a bit and that's an important point i mean maybe that'll lead us into another discussion of of how we should again as policy makers how we should treat people who are addicted to drugs and what works and what doesn't there's there's still a lot of debate over that you know does it in the most let's mean to make this a political thing but but let's say in the most liberal of senses the idea is just just have places where heroin addicts can go shoot up now conservatives say yeah but you're just you're really just enabling it at this point you're not helping them in any way yeah you're doing it safely you know is that really the right path um should you really be putting and then but i think both sides probably agree we should really be done with putting people in jail just because they're drug users now to be fair i think a very small proportion of our jails are filled up with people who are just drug users it's a bit of a criminal justice myth but it's it shouldn't happen either way it shouldn't i and there's there's bipartisan agreement on that so i mean just from from you studying this issue what i mean besides creating an amazing device that seems to work pretty well uh what else what else should we be doing and and what other changes could we make what other treatment changes could we make that you think might be more effective well you know in the last 30 years we came out of the dark dark ages of behavioral health we went from you know suck it up have willpower just quit to realizing the real way out of addiction is having a sense of community having a purpose having hope so if you get a felony because you get caught the first time and you will never have a real job again you will never have a potential meaningful contribution to society or we put you in jail there goes your familiar support those things are all opposite of healing from addiction the stick doesn't work it just doesn't so at least that's become my my my discovery and i would have been on the i was on the up opposite side of this opinion before uh starting spark um i you know throw them all in jail could have been something i said as in debate class as a teenager right yeah and there's got to be a difference between the user and the dealer you know like i said like i i can point to really specific schools where there was just one dealer um who infiltrated it got all these kids addicted they didn't kill them right away but these kids are dying they're not kids anymore they're dying as adults uh because and that's the other thing about opioids people don't realize if you get addicted when you're 18 or 16 it's very different from from when you're 28 i mean the first you know and i speak as somebody who's had a lot of opioids i i'm very accident-prone very injury-prone i've had my jaw broken i've had my leg broken i've had my hand crushed and of course i've been blown up uh and and more recently i was uh i've been blinded by a retinal detachment so it was a really gruesome surgery afterwards so i am very familiar with how this stuff feels and what it's like and you know but i can deal with it but i also never i was never exposed to it until um [Music] uh maybe 26. and that seems to be the cutoff according to the scientific journals that i've i've looked at on this is that correct not a cut off but like it's just you're just you're more prone to serious serious long-term addiction if you get on it younger is that is certainly younger certainly younger is going to be more susceptible that i've seen as well and um yeah you hit several points there i would you said something very important though and that was evidence-based solutions and um i think i think it's good to dig into maybe not policy but there's a lot of bad rehab centers they get the money they take it eighty percent of people relapse in the first month or two and they're you know they're just not really science-based yeah there are models in like uh portugal and switzerland did safe injection sites and you say well how much is that enabling well you when you're addicted you're going to get it no matter what now you're going to from a shady source and you don't have counseling resources people using heroin majority of them they don't want to do it they hate it they are not you there's no more euphoria after the first couple weeks you're just running from withdrawal that's that's the real problem you're being chased by withdrawal and my family member said that this is actually his words he's like every five to seven hours you know i i have to use or else it's gonna get me and it's a primal overwhelming drive of fear and anybody doing is say they think they're going to die conservatives do you think conservatives should be more open to these uh safe injection sites as long as there's so maybe some good counseling resources around it that sort of take the place of these crappy addiction centers five years from now i'm gonna run from office and somebody's gonna find this clip and go you said yeah it's it's not that controversial of a topic there's much more controversial i think we're all just trying to find a solution everything's worth piloting let's let's put one let's pilot one don't go gangbusters don't go all the way off i don't go like oregon where you can just have heroin in the streets that's yeah so well that's a good example because that's kind of the only place in the u.s that it's really doing some weird stuff um and they're like right like so they just want gangbusters they're it's all legal there do they have safe injection is there any place in the us where we could where we could point to and say this got piloted or in canada i don't know i should know that i don't know the answer to that yeah but but it is interesting that you're as as you've gotten closer to the subject um your own thoughts on it have changed and i i agree i just think we have to look at people differently it's fascinating if you take somebody just as living their normal life to walk in a rehab center which i now have i mean i was in one in downtown st louis rough part of town and this girl came in she was just she was rough and um just the matter of fact take out it just doesn't the conversation doesn't flow like normal the guy the counselor sits her down says okay what are you taking she said fentanyl okay when'd you take about seven a.m this morning okay what do we got to do here it was so just there was no beating around the bush no stigma no he as a matter of fact what are you on she's honest i and that was the other interesting thing her answer was fentanyl and afterwards i was like and he goes well no it's heroin with fentanyl but it's really mostly fentanyl now and so she's just jumping right to it which that was the first time i heard that because i always heard it fentanyl was lacing things right but they're getting to the point they're just hey i want fentanyl which is is a nude well they don't really say that but it's is the new twist i think yeah it's kind of terrifying i mean dea just uh issued some kind of emergency authorization because of the massive amounts of fentanyl coming across our border being supplied by china it's a real problem um you know and they're they're just the stuff they seize is is just by the by the poundage is usually enough to kill every american period i mean which it's this stuff is extremely powerful which is why it's usually lacing things and i god i can't i don't know what taking it looks like because i'm pretty sure like more than a tiny little speck is deadly yeah exactly well this is so this is the diabolical thing um because they're putting in another drug so they're putting it in meth they're putting it in cocaine they're putting it in xanax and nobody knows they're making all those drugs because it's so cheap there's no cost to it and so they're making all those other drugs more addictive right and you think well i'm not i'm not bad i don't do opioids which are really addictive i just want to chill out with some xanax and you don't know now you're getting getting fentanyl xanax and of course not safely you know not in a good right a laboratory production and so so the incentive for dealers to do that is to get you addicted and keep you coming back to that dealer because i've always kind of wondered why like why why go through the extra effort to lace these things like why not just sell the easiest thing that has to be it you know that has to be the incentive is yes so somebody listening uh to this right now has a family member or they themselves are suffering from addiction and they're like okay how do i get this device you're talking about let me just try it um where are we at here in the process with fda and cms and for listeners cms is an important part of this because it's the government agency that controls medicare and medicaid and when it comes to reimbursement for medical devices and drugs um medicare's you know still sort of our number one driver of that and so anyway longer discussion uh maybe for the next podcast but where are we at with your device on that you know because it's unfortunately it's not the case that somebody can just go on amazon and order this uh for 1500 bucks so how do we how would we get this so they can reach out to spark through our website and we have a patient link and we can put them in touch with a facility hopefully near them that is using our device that's adoption adopted we've had fda approval for about eight months now and are in about 20 or 25 centers across the us we're in this gap though where you know it is patient pay and uh and so and it's we're we're still growing as a company getting out there the the key word we're using right now is we're trying to get widespread adoption which is a key term for cms to you know give us a legitimate chance at getting coding and coverage so we have not applied for that yet because the standards between the fda and cms are completely different you can have a hundred patients worth of data and fda says that's safe and efficacious you're approved go forth and cms says yeah but i want to see a thousand patients worth of data to see if this meets the health care economics and is worth you know as reasonable uh to reimburse and you know it's just the plight medical device companies we knew we had to tackle this plight coming into this but it is you're not you really can't pay for a thousand you know you just pay for the cost it takes to develop and get fda approval first and then you invest because if you don't get through fda investing all the money and reimbursement's not worth it so it's a unfortunately it's a series not a parallel uh path tell us about the the girl when you when you um did your presentation you played a video of one of your patients can you just tell us about that situation how is she doing now she's doing good uh she spent about a year in a sober living house in austin after that um she so is the the facility where we're running the clinical trial called us up and they said we have somebody she's saying she wants to meet the company and she wants to do a testimonial video because she felt so good and then you saw she was so honest and open and articulate so we i look you know live in houston packed up the video equipment and zoomed you know straight to austin and met her and filmed that um it's hard to keep up because of privacy and all but we were able to hear back from her her doctor later down the road and and she is doing well and she had been through rehab several times and that was sort of the big aha the video is she went into she went into rehab saying fine i'll detox and then i'm out of here to her parents and that's all she was going to do and she didn't want to be there and she was angry and within a couple hours the the withdrawal abated and then by the second day she was feeling so good and clear because she didn't have a bunch of chemicals in her uh a bunch of other potential opioids mitigating the withdrawal and she made a big life decision to really make a change there so it's we're probably part of that yeah i was i was really struck from that video how when i heard that it was within a few hours and the second day and that that's that's really impressive for something that's a non-invasive device a non-pharmaceutical device which is i mean that's just an impressive result does she still have to use the device because so it's creating endorphins and this is i guess my layman's question here is does it create its own form of addiction because you've got this device that's like sending signals to making you produce more endorphins and endorphins are awesome so do you do people have this desire to keep wearing it yeah we have not seen that at all uh so far um we obviously monitor for it i think of it more of we're not giving you a chemical that you then need more of right we're actually up regulating the natural body's ability to work and and then it's kind of pictured when you're teaching your kid to ride a bike and you're behind them and you're pushing pushing then finally you can let them go when they pedal on their own that's that's my mental model of what i hope we can prove so we haven't fully proved that because we haven't finished our long-term addiction and recovery study now how long how long is that what is a long term mean in years uh so we're doing 90 days so the majority of counselors and always say if you can stay clean 90 days your percentage chance of beating it is you kind of cross that you have a real good fighting chance like 80 of people relapse in the first 30 days right um okay so so if it's 90 days then maybe we'll see some results pretty soon yeah mid next year i hope right um what from a policy perspective you know in your dealings with the fda and uh cms i mean what coming from the innovator side what would you like to see different i think for well clearly if cms and fda would sync up which they had synced up on the breakthrough device designation which was a whole category where you were supposed to get uh coding and coverage uh in payment for four years if you were so as if you were novel and noon is it was whole thing was built to innovate and last week they uh they uh they killed the whole process of fast-forwarding reimbursement yeah that's so yeah i'm aware of that or we wrote letters about that because the trump administration came up with us we all liked it for some reason the blind administration is is killed or at least paused it so we're trying to fix that yeah so we have breakthrough on our neonatal device so we've built a system for babies and have breakthrough on it but it's not it's not fda approved yet but from a policy perspective yeah it'd be real nice if those two were closer in sync clearly everybody's been saying this for a long time um also cms you know tends to want a lot more data and weigh back in on safety and efficacy it'd be nice if they didn't reopen that can of worms and so the reason we haven't applied to cms yet is if you get a bad answer undoing a bad answer is way harder than getting a good answer so if we went and wanted a code and we had applied here in july and we weren't ready because we didn't have widespread adoption we couldn't show so we got to show people are using this all over the country and we have widespread and we don't we were only four months in if we'd applied and then they were like nope you're a tens unit and you know you get 35 bucks for your device and we'll pay for double a batteries you know it's like we're dead yeah yeah then that's going to cost millions to undo and you know it from an as an observer um but as a as an observer kind of on the inside it seems to me that instead of fda and cms both look both looking at the safe and efficacy side of things it seems like fda should focus on the safety side and i can see why cms might focus because it's about reimbursement i can see why they would focus on efficacy you know so i understand the difference in a little bit of the difference but it is frustrating that they're the outcomes they're looking for are exactly the same but they both feel the need to go through their entirely different approaches to get there and it's really hurting our innovative abilities because it's hard to to create a a biotech startup and all of our innovation is built off of these small startups like yours you know i i see it all over the place and it's frustrating that it's it's really just the government policies that are getting in the way of that instead of fostering it we're really one of the only countries in the world still doing this in in such large quantities obviously it does happen in other places but we we really are the leaders and we don't want to lose that yep um what else do you have to add uh about the problem about the the broader look at this well one thing yeah one thing that one thing that would help us if politicians or congress persons around the country wanted to had problems in their districts and want can reach out to us we would love to pilot a program to help widespread adoption will will subsidize the cost of the device significantly to get more more communities served so that's you and your colleagues if there's a need and they want to reach out and they have a clinic they want that wants to do it in their area we'll we'll make sure it happens and and help help constituents in that district that's a great point i mean you know i you know representative david trone a democrat in maryland a friend of mine he basically only ran for congress because he cares about opioids uh so i'll put you in touch with him that'd be a good uh and maryland has a serious issue with this so i i think that's a great point and uh i'd love to link you guys up well daniel thanks thanks for thanks for being on uh it's great conversation very informative to people and um may have given a few listeners hope for some family members as well i appreciate it and you actually said the key word there i we really want to bring hope this is not a life sentence and uh we're gonna we're gonna work tirelessly to move the science as far as it'll go great so thank you appreciate it thanks daniel

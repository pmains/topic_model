the whole the whole thing is really very simple when the president took office we were losing 780 800,000 jobs a month a month we did the American Recovery Act which we no longer called the stimulus bill because the Republican propaganda we did the American Recovery Act we did we save the car industry we did a few other things and turned it around so that so that we were gaining 250,000 jobs a month by the beginning by the middle of 2010 250,000 we turned around a million jobs a month and then the present realizing that the stimulus was designed to be when they have two year stimulus bill said all right we've got to continue this we've got to accelerate continue and accelerate the job recovery and he offered the American Jobs Act of 2011 and the Republican Congress killed it and every single other attempt to keep the recovery going so the real the real narrative is the Republicans created the catastrophe the president and the Democratic Congress started fixing it and turned it around they're poking Congress stopped the progress and yes is why which is why I'm not at all surprised the job growth in 2011 was at was greater than average job growth in 2012 because we were still working off with the Democratic Congress with President Obama accomplished and now they have blocked every attempt to keep this going

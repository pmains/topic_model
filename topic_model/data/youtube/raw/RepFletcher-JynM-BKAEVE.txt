Thank you, Madam Speaker. I rise today with a heavy heart to honor the life of one of my constituents, David Castro. Born and raised in Houston over the last 17 years, David was tragically killed in a road rage incident on his way home from an Astros game, just earlier this month.  He had a bright future ahead of himâ€”a National Merit scholar semifinalist, he excelled in math and physics. He was a percussionist in the Westside High School Marching Band. Today, as I extend my deep condolences to David's family and friends for their loss, I rise to share their wish that our community and our country remember David through random acts of kindness. What a beautiful way to memorialize him. David Castro will be missed, but never forgotten, and will live on in acts of kindness across this country. Thank you, Madam Speaker. I yield back.

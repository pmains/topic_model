R BOOKER SAID MADE THIS DAY POSSIBLE. BUT THAT WASN'T THE LAST TIME THAT JUDGE JACKSON FOUGHT BACK TEARS TODAY. THE JUNIOR SENATOR FROM CALIFORNIA, ALEX PADILLA, IS THE SECOND MOST JUNIOR THE TRAGIC MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE AND SO HE ALWAYS SPEAKS TOWARDS THE END OF THE HEARINGS. ALEX PADILLA'S PARENTS CAME TO CALIFORNIA FROM MEXICO AND WATCH THEIR SON GO OFF TO COLLEGE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COUNTRY AT MIT, THE MOST SELECTIVE SCIENCE ORIENTED UNIVERSITY IN THE WORLD. HE TOLD JUDGE JACKSON TODAY THAT, JUST AS SHE WAS DISCOURAGED BY SOME FROM APPLYING TO HARVARD, HE WAS DISCOURAGED BY SOME OF HIS HIGH SCHOOL TEACHERS FROM APPLYING TO MIT. AND THEN HE ASKED HER WHAT SHE SAYS TO YOUNG PEOPLE WHO DOUBT THAT THEY CAN ACHIEVE WHAT SHE HAS ACHIEVED. >> I HOPE TO INSPIRE PEOPLE TO TRY TO FOLLOW. TO FOLLOW THIS PATH. BECAUSE I LOVE THIS COUNTRY. BECAUSE I LOVE THE LAW. ... BECAUSE I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE ALL INVEST. INVEST IN OUR FUTURE. AND THE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE THE FUTURE. AND SO I WANT THEM TO KNOW THAT THEY CAN DO AND BE ANYTHING. AND I WILL JUST SAY THAT I WILL TELL THEM WIDEN ANONYMOUS PERSON SAID IT TO ME ONCE. I WAS WALKING THROUGH. HARVARD YARD, THROUGH THEY, ARE MY FRESHMAN YEAR. AS I MENTIONED, I WENT TO PUBLIC SCHOOL. AND I DID NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT HARVARD UNTIL MY DEBATE COACH TOOK ME THERE TO ENTER A SPEECH COMPETITION. AND I THOUGHT, HEY, THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY, A GREAT UNIVERSITY, ONE OF THE ONLY ONES I HAD SEEN, AND SAID MAYBE WILL I I WILL APPLY WHEN I'M A SENIOR. BUT I GET THERE AND, WHOA, IT'S SO DIFFERENT. I AM FROM MIAMI, FLORIDA. BOSTON IS VERY COLD. [LAUGHS] IT WAS ROUGH. IT WAS DIFFERENT FROM ANYTHING I HAD KNOWN. THERE WERE LOTS OF STUDENTS THERE WHO WERE PREP SCHOOL KIDS, LIKE MY HUSBAND. WHO WE KNEW ALL ABOUT -- [LAUGHS] NEW ALL ABOUT HARVARD. AND THAT WAS NOT ME. AND I THINK THE FIRST SEMESTER I WAS REALLY HOMESICK, I WAS REALLY QUESTIONING, DO I BELONG HERE? CAN I MAKE IT IN THIS ENVIRONMENT? AND ALWAYS WALKING THROUGH THE YARD IN THE EVENING AND A BLACK WOMAN I DID NOT KNOW WAS PASSING ME ON THE SIDEWALK. AND SHE LOOKED AT ME AND I GUESS SHE KNEW HOW I WAS FEELING. AND SHE LEANED OVER, AS WE CROSSED, AND SAID, PERSEVERE.

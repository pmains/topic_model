thank you I'm time's up I yield a pledge five minutes thank you very much mr. chairman and thank you all so much for being here today you know with leadership comes responsibility if in fact we are the leaders of the world we need to take some responsibility if indeed we still are of all the things we could cut we would cut food we have become complicit or will become complicit in the starvation of hungry women and children how many guns do we need how much ammunition do we need it is immoral it is heartless and it is not even strategic for our world relations it cuts jobs in this country it is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard if we are leaders it comes with some responsibilities Monsieur the mcgovern-dole program does provide agricultural commodities to reduce hunger and promote literacy for young girls in these developing countries the program has shown some additional benefits could you address that please thank you so the mcgovern-dole program is a really smart and important program we have I'll give you an example of a mcgovern-dole program that we have in Mozambique it supports thousands of children to go to school and and support school feeding for those children and and the the outcomes then are improved nutrition for those children more girls in school and improve literacy rates so it is one of the most critical programs that we can we can do we all care about the well-being of children around the world and the programs I've seen that improve literacy rates for example you know it's amazing what you find when kids can read and parents their peer you ask the kids can you read and they hold up book and they they're so proud that they can read and their parents are peering in the window and I've seen this all over Africa this is a fantastic way to spend our money so being able to go to school having good nutrition it helps learning outcomes it's a fantastic and important way to use US government resources thank you very much and I'm really not going to ask any other questions I just want to close with this when we question the viability of NATO where we no longer want to be in the Paris Accord when we pick fights with mayors that we don't need to pick fights with at some point it will not be America first it will be America alone I yield back

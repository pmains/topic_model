we turn now to Virginia Democratic Senator Mark Warner today he's in with vil Virginia getting ready to go canvass for Democrats in Virginia including his colleague Tim Kaine good morning senator you're gonna be knocking on doors what mortgage well my pitch is this election people need to get out and vote if they are concerned about what's going on in Washington if they're concerned about a president that doesn't act very presidential when we see moments of crisis over the last few weeks they need to have their votes counted and frankly even folks who may agree that the economy is going pretty good I think many many people who realize we need a check on this president and we've seen evidence of that in the last three weeks when this president was not able to bring the country together after the shootings or the bombing attempts we saw it when the president you know kind of randomly said that he could override the Constitution with a stroke of a pen people know that we have rule of law in this country and then in the last couple of days where he said that he's gonna take 15,000 of our military troops take him out of Iraq and Afganistan no plan move them to the border and then allow those troops to fire on kids who might be throwing stones but that's pretty remarkable my thinking and mr. president just one last point John I don't think he understands that words matter in the last 48 hours in Nigeria troops shot on students throwing rocks and they said they turned to president Trump's words as a vindication well let me come back here at home the jobs report on Friday was even better than forecasters expected employers added 250,000 jobs and unemployment rate is 3.7 wages grew 3.1 percent they haven't been doing that if we focus on the James Carville maximum it's the economy stupid you named a couple a lot of things but the economy is strong why should people want to change course you accepting all the things you said why would they want to change course with the economy humming like this because I think one thing people realize is that we're in a sense riding a sugar high from a two trillion dollar tax cut that was unpaid for now the economy's doing pretty well right now that I think the hangovers going to be pretty bad as we go into next year but we can debate that later what I think people are concerned about is they're concerned about this president that frankly even if you agree that the economy is going well that we need to have some level of check on him the founders set up a system of checks and balance we got a president and Donald Trump that it's totally unchecked at this point and rule of law and frankly America's standing in the world is being undermined I want to ask you about election security but quickly on the Intelligence Committee report your own report do you think that's gonna come out before the end of the year that's my hope we've still got a number of individuals that we have to see many of the ones who frankly pled already out with Muller we need to see some of these or principles but I want this to be done because at the end of the day the American public needs to know not only what happened in 2016 in terms of Russian interference but how we're better prepared to make sure it never happens again on this election security question how secure will the elections be on Tuesday well John I think we've made great progress particularly at the individual polling stations and in the tabulation of votes so I think people should go out and vote with confidence I am concerned that this White House though has frankly held back we've got a broadly based bipartisan election security bill that I think would have gotten 90 votes in the Senate that would have made sure that every polling station had a paper ballot to audit after the fact if there was ever any kind of intervention and unfortunately the White House sent stopped that legislation are you expecting any kind of an attack on Tuesday what would that even look like and is the u.s. in a position to respond I think we are much better DHS has been worked doing a very good job in terms of working with individual election registrar's in fact that we have a federal state and local circumstance and election means it's these are lots of different lines of control but there is a good cooperative relationship I think it would have been better if in the aftermath of 2016 this White House after that kind of attack I'm actually appointed someone in charge of election security unfortunate mr. Trump has not done that matter of fact - even eliminated the position of cyber security at the White House which i think is a totally wrong move because we're we're potentially vulnerable is the ability of Russia or some other foreign actor to either break into some of the voter files at the at the kind of at the national level or at the vendor level and then also what I'm more concerned about is a flood of fake accounts or fake manipulation through social media where again we've made some progress but the companies have not moved as far as they need to move finally senator quickly you received a briefing this week on the murder of columnist Jamal khashoggi following that you said there's enough evidence for Congress to act even if the President does and what kind of action are you expecting Congress to take well first of all John I have not received that full briefing the whole gang of eight will but I believe that it is that the evidence that the Turks have pointed out that Khashoggi was brutally murdered in the Saudi consulate and frankly John I don't think under President Reagan under president bush or Obama or Clinton that any so-called ally would have taken that kind of action because they know America at that point stood for a free press and human rights again the president's words matter and I think that you're seeing our so-called allies take pretty unusual actions I think Congress will act whether it's cutback on arms sales whether it's looking in terms of some of our nuclear Accords I do think there's an opportunity here and I commend secretary Pompeo and mattis we're trying to urge the Saudi Arabians to in this brutal war in Yemen and if there's an opportunity in this moment to get that done that would be a step forward all right senator Warner we thank you so much for being with us thank you John

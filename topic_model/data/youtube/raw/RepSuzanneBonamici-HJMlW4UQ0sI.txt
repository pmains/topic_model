you madam Speaker I rise today in strong support of this resolution to remove the arbitrary deadline to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment this year is the centennial of the 19th amendment yet women are still fighting fighting for full and equal rights under the law women continue to face many barriers to true equality including pregnancy and gender discrimination unequal pay and a lack of access to a full range of reproductive health care services the Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution would provide for fundamental equality for women regardless of who is president who was on the Supreme Court or changes in federal law Congress first approved the e ra in 1972 and my home state of Oregon was quick to ratify at the following year and now 38 states the required three-fourths under the Constitution have ratified the amendment and today Congress will stand with our states and make it clear that it is time actually way past time to adopt the Equal Rights Amendment it's not too late to do the right thing it's not too late for equality I urge all of my colleagues to support this resolution and I yield back the balance of my time

Thank You mr. chairman and mr. secretary thank you for being here today mr. secretary haven't been at least a part-time Florida resident I think you understand very well that commercial and recreational fishing and state and federal Gulf of Mexico waters is very important to the national and our regional economies and as everyone here knows NOAA announced earlier this month that the recreational fishermen along the coast would have a mere three days red snapper in federal waters over the past decade recreational private sector has seen annual seasons reduce from a hundred ninety four days in 2007 to just eleven days in 2016 - three days and 2017 now I'm not going to get in the weeds on this with one with things like total allowable state versus federal data coal I think my Gulf Coast colleagues have outlined those issues fairly intensively at this point in the several letters that we've sent you or your department in 2017 I understand that in the absence of legislation they do is limited how on forward can you assure us that you will use whatever tools you have to provide some relief to our recreational anglers now and down the road work with Congress up a long term solution to address these issues impacting our recreational fishing and coastal communities I'm quite aware of the situation and there was a letter sent by some 15 congressmen on the topic led by whip the Scalise and just last night Errol Comstock from my office who's our director of policy had a meeting with many of those members I don't know mr. pallazzo if you were a sir I wasn't a part of it I think where he pledged and I pledge but we will try to make sure that there is an equitable solution to the conundrum of recreational fishing versus commercial fishing but you're quite right in saying that our resources in the sense of powers is relatively limited in that area so we are going to making a very fulsome request of note for the underlying data they base the decision just to give three that one three-day weekend for creational red snapper catching it seems on the skimpy side but we're not the fish expert so I promised to we will follow up and we will do the best we can to balance the needs of the recreational with the needs of the commercial well mr. secretary I appreciate that and I look forward to working with you and your team to help the recreational anglers be able to enjoy what pretty much you know is their heritage and what they enjoy to do and be able to get out on the waters and make memories that will last a lifetime so thank you sir

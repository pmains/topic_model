thank you mr speaker and and uh i've got a radical idea a radical idea for the people of america let's use harbor maintenance trust funds for harbor maintenance for 25 years we've been robbing peter to pay paul but in reality that seven billion dollars that we have taken away from that has really been robbing places like manistee michigan where this weekend in my district a ship ran aground and had to get towed off and the damage that happened to it we have 11 harbors in the second district hundreds in the great lakes and countless in the nation on both the coast and in the in the gulf of mexico enough money has been collected every year to pay for all of this maintenance that has to happen but unfortunately congress has been skimming it to help pay for other programs it's time that act i appreciate my friend from louisiana mr bustani his leadership with the ramp act mr upton chairman upton from michigan and leading this in the great lakes but we know this is the right thing to do for america and for our transportation needs our infrastructure needs our great lakes need it the coasts need it our harbors need it our economy needs this to happen and i thank you very much and strongly support this amendment today

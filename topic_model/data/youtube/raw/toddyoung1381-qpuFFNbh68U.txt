welcome Mr Washington thank you sir I I really appreciate your military service as someone who wore the uniform for a bit of time myself I really have great respect for uh what you accomplished in the military I have to tell you as we look at your nomination to serve in this capacity uh I'm quite concerned about Aviation and Aviation safety experience and uh oh I this Administration has been on watch when we've seen our first Nationwide ground stop since 9 11. and this was due to problems with the faa's very own system so that's the organization that you've been nominated to lead we've had multiple near misses in recent months the faa's own website states that the faa's mission is to provide the safest most efficient Aerospace system in the world in the world so we need someone who can ensure that it fulfills that mission the most efficient safest Aerospace system in the world as you know Federal Law requires that the FAA administrator that position you've been nominated for must among other things have experience in the field directly directly related to Aviation and I'm looking at your as resume it's it's right here and it's really impressive so I let the world know that the man before this committee is is really impressive an honorable record of service and and without blemishes to my knowledge but it's thin by my reading as as it pertains to this direct Aviation experience he spent a lot a lot of time in the U.S army your career was focused on uh per your resume Logistics HR training and operations you weren't an army pilot uh you didn't work in aviation units your very first roughly 40 years ago your very first assignment as an enlisted Soldier was an air defense artillery unit I worked with an unmanned aerial vehicle Squadron when I was in the U.S Marine Corps that certainly didn't qualify me to my mind to be FAA administrator uh in in recent years you spent a few years as uh CEO of LA Metro transport Authority but but they oversaw a rail and and bus transit it doesn't no mention here at least of Aviation responsibilities and then for the last roughly 18 months you you've been CEO of Denver International Airport and I've visited with CEOs of airports and they vary in expertise and accomplishment and proficiency and uh but I know that so much of that job involves ensuring that the tenants in that shopping area with multiple purposes in addition to Aviation remain happy and that it that the customers going in and out are happy but I I so 18 months maybe there's been an 18-month marination in aviation since you've been CEO of Denver airport but I'm going to give you an opportunity as as so often does not happen in these hearings uh to explain concisely if you will why you are qualified for this job sir thank you for the question uh Senator I think about a few things in running ground transportation units I was not a train operator either but I was named the best Transit Transportation public transportation CEO in this country I think about traits like leadership I think about traits like managing I think about traits like convening people to get things done I think about what I call adaptive leadership Aviation right now we cannot think about uh doing things the old way and so I think that a fresh perspective is needed obviously safety is number one and as I said earlier leaning and trusting and directing our safety experts is part of the job but I think that there is my broad Transportation knowledge in real world leadership experience of both military and transportation infrastructure systems serve me well and I have no doubt sir that you are in in many respects a plug and play leader and manager this is something that our senior enlisted and and and and much of our officer core uh I think can correctly and accurately identify as so uh I I want to sort of validate that for what it's worth I will say that statutorily this position requires having experience in the field that is directly related directly related to Aviation words have meaning statutes have meaning and and uh I'm it's unclear at this point we'll continue to do homework give you an opportunity maybe after this hearing to elaborate on on what you've just said it's unclear that your background as I've laid it out is is directly related to Aviation so thank you very much sir thank you

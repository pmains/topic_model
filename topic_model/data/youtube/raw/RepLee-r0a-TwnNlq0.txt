Thank You mr. Speaker I rise to join my colleagues and decrying this man-made disaster that's affecting the residents and city of flint michigan every day we learn more about how the governor michigan public officials made decisions that sacrifice the health and futures of Flint residents in order to save a few dollars that's just plain wrong the people of Flint deserved better we cannot stand silent while Americans while children are poisoned Flint is a majority african-american city and the average household income is just twenty four thousand eight hundred and thirty four dollars that's a year which is barely half of Michigan's average household incomes with the same decisions had been made had this been an affluent community I doubted earlier today this house passed a bipartisan Safe Drinking Water Act improved compliance awareness act but we can and must do more to prevent this from ever happening again our response must be comprehensive and urgent it is a state of emergency that requires members of Congress to find all of the federal resources possible to demonstrate that we are really and truly our brothers and sisters keeper

influenced our lives my wife Joanna and I cherished the times we are with the senator dick durbin and his wife Loretta in the ten years since our founding we at J Street have known Senator Durbin as a strong friend and Ally he has been a proud and outspoken advocate of a sane rational diplomacy first foreign policy that stands in absolute contrast to the policies being advanced by the current administration Senator Durbin supports policies that advance our nation's security by promoting the values of peace freedom democracy and tolerance he is the top ranking Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee and that Subcommittee on defense which allocates nearly half of our nation's discretionary budget he was in a salute Lee essential champion of President Obama's diplomacy with Iran in late summer 2015 when many predicted that the nuclear agreement with Iran would be gutted by a Senate resolution of disapproval Senator Durbin with our help orchestrated a David versus Goliath battle to preserve the Accord an article in The Washington Post was titled quote how Senator Durbin spent his summer saving the Iran deal close quote he continues to stand in the way of reckless efforts by the Trump administration and congressional Hawks to undermine and tear up this successful pact in 2002 Senator Durbin was one of only 23 senators who voted against the avait invasion of Iraq when he talks about the dangers of an unnecessary march to war and touts the importance of diplomacy he knows what he is talking about we know we can count on him to be a steadfast and passionate voice against the likes of John Bolton and Mike Pompeo as they tried to push our country down that path once again as a rock solid supporter of the State of Israel Senator Durbin understands that the only way to secure its future as a democracy and as a homeland for the Jewish people is through a two-state agreement with the Palestinians he demonstrated his commitment to that essential goal last year when he added his voice to a letter from ten senators to Prime Minister Netanyahu opposing demolitions and settlement expansion in the West Bank the Senators wrote to the Israeli leaders quote we urge you to change course so that you do not foreclose the possibility of establishing two states for two peoples close quote it friends let's now give a J Street welcome to our guest my senator and friend dick Durbin [Applause] hey it's good to see you hello good to see you thank you very much let me thank bill singer and also acknowledge George Mitchell is going to be a critical part of your program this evening and i see my colleague angus king and the lights of keeping me from reaching out there's former senator Mitchell good to see you George you're gonna be a great part of this program this evening Ilyse Hogue Morton Halperin many friends who are gathered here ten years ago as Jeremy has just recently recounted he had a vision for what it meant to be a true friend of Israel a vision that echoed the words of former Secretary of State John Kerry when he spoke about the United Nations resolution condemning Israeli settlements here's what John said some seem to believe that the u.s. must accept any policy regardless of our own interest our own positions our own words our own principles even after urging again and again that the policy must change friends need to tell each other the hard truths and friendships require mutual respect as we mark the 70th anniversary of Israel's War of Independence it's necessary that we continue to tell the hard and sometimes uncomfortable truth to our friends I want to tell Jeremy and all of you who made Jay Street a reality you've been such an important part of the dialogue here in Washington you have changed the conversation you have moved us forward in a new dialogue as a nation a nation in support of Israel but a nation that is dedicated to a vision of a two-state solution two years ago I came to J Street to thank you for supporting President Obama when he called for an historic understanding with Iran it was an incredible achievement not just for the President and the United States but for Israel for the world and you were part of it here's what this deal did it put in place the most intrusive monitoring regime on any nation's nuclear program since the nuclear non-proliferation treaty it reduced Iran's ability to produce a nuclear weapon by reducing its centrifuge and uranium stockpile and it extend the breakout time to produce a nuclear bomb I didn't know that I was going to be personally engaged in the whippin of this although I do that for a living in the Senate but as it turned out there was some uncertainty in the beginning as to which Democratic senator would take the lead and Harry Reid gave me a nod in my direction and said proceed do your best and I did I reached out to my colleagues on the Democratic side to try to measure where they were and what was going through their minds and there were a couple things we did which were a little different one of the first things I realized was that August is a deadly month it's deadly because the members of the Senate and House dispersed around the world some of the greatest ideas in politics died in August people sitting on beaches sipping drinks forget all about this place and don't want to be bothered and so I decided to become the pest that every wimp must be and to figure out where every Democratic senator was at every day of the month of August and periodically to call and ask them how are things with the family been thinking about the nuclear agreement with Iran can you make it back for a briefing the CIA would like to talk to you number of agencies and so we kept people at least in conversation and as I was doing this members were speaking among themselves groups of them interested in this issue they came back from the August break and if you'll remember the dominant theme at that point was not this Iran nuclear agreement those who opposed it didn't say we're against the agreement they just said oh we can do better than this and so I decided to try something I had not seen before and I invited to meet the Senate Democratic caucus the ambassadors from the p5 plus one nations they said at a table the ambassador's of chana China Russia sitting next to one another ambassadors from Great Britain France European Union Germany they were all there and our caucus asked them questions in a very informal way and the first question of course was will the next agreement be better which led to laughter from these ambassadors they reminded our caucus do you know how long we've worked on this do you know what it took to reach this moment if you naively believe that tomorrow they'll better be a better agreement you're wrong and then I can recall the Ambassador from one of the countries I won't name said do I understand that you are going to turn on your own president and vote against him really members of the Senate Democratic caucus thought about those answers and they brought in the experts and asked hard questions as well and the net result of it was 42 members of the 46 members of the Senate Democratic caucus supporting the Iran nuclear agreement it was a historic moment I don't think I imagine if the outset then it would turn out the way it did but it did and you played a big role in that you may not realize it but I hope you do because you were the other voice in the room you were people speaking up for Israel and for the agreement you were those who believed those who are gathered here this evening and others who believed that what we are seeking to achieve with you and nuclear agreement was clearly not only in the best interest of the Middle East in the world but in the best interest of Israel too that they would have a safe neighborhood to live in well that was then and this is now a new president a new situation we have a president who surrounds himself with chaos who on in any given day could say or do almost anything he doesn't appear to be driven by philosophy or any moral compass sadly one of the few constants in his erratic tweets and rants is his insistence that the United States should pull out of this landmark nuclear agreement with Iran and this reckless move seems more driven by an obsession of undoing anything achieved by President Obama than by any sound policy can anyone imagine that it is an effective negotiating strategy with nuclear North Korea to arbitrarily walk away from the Iran nuclear agreement as we face a May 12th deadline thank you as we face the May 12th deadline for extending us sanction waivers on Iran we face a man-made president made crisis created entirely by the White House there is no telling what Teran Tehran would do if the u.s. tears up the deal but Iranian officials have warned they will resume production of 20 percent enriched uranium which could trigger a confrontation and one of the most volatile regions of the world and we will have lost that unique global coalition that came together to create this agreement rather than trying to undermine and kill this deal we should build on it use years of compliance to advance follow-on measures and work with nations around the world to make certain we do everything we can to bring peace to the Middle East more than anything J Street has been focused on the peace process in Israel nothing is more central to peace than solving the israeli-palestinian question rhetoric of course matters and this president's rhetoric and policies are making peace harder to achieve he's moat made no serious effort to bridge the two sides instead he focuses on petty and sometimes provocative measures that do nothing to advance the larger peace process defunding the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees in the near East which provides funding for Palestinian refugees are moving the u.s. embassy to Jerusalem in the absence of a larger peace agreement are not strategies for peace we used to know we used to know because it was the accepted foreign policy in the United States what a peace agreement would eventually look like a negotiated two-state solution requiring mutual recognition of Israel as a homeland for the Jewish people and Palestine is the homeland for the Palestinian people one that definitely assured Israel's security yet for the first time since the Oslo Accords a recent poll shows Israeli and Palestinian support for a two-state solution to be below fifty percent and it gets worse 77 percent of Palestinians now oppose the position that the future State of Palestine will be a demilitarized nation protected by a multinational force 77 percent of Israelis now opposed East Jerusalem as the Palestinian capital among younger Palestinians polling suggests their preferred option is a one state solution with equality and no longer just as a fallback position the good news is that there's still a plurality some forty six percent of Israelis and Palestinians who prefer the two-state solution dr. Deborah Shushan put it best when she paraphrased a Winston Churchill tweet in a tweet I should say she said that would have been something can you imagine mad thank you here's what she said in a tweet Israelis and Palestinians are two states as two states may be the worst solution except for all the others I still believe in order for a fair and lasting peace the two-state solution is the right place to be the alternative is the status quo which is in no one's best interest and because of changing demographics threatens to undermine Israel's democracy over the long term so in order to restart negotiations with the United States playing the role as mediator and honest peace broker here's what this administration needs to do come out strongly in favor of two-state solution reiterate and clarify what the president said in his Jerusalem announcement we are not taking a position on any final status issue including the specific boundaries of the Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem or the resolution of contested borders we need political will on both sides to Israel and Palestine and the United States is uniquely situated may be the only nation in the world situated to make this happen if this administration truly wants to preserve a path toward a two-state solution it has to speak out against the consistently expanding settlements in the West Bank that threatened the viability of any future Palestinian state but it should be even-handed and speak out as well about the Palestinian government's failure to reform hold elections and address Hamas stranglehold on Gaza and it should work and it should work with the extraordinary leaders in Jordan and other countries in the Middle East Jordan you know as an incredible story when I think of the debate in the United States of America over bringing in 50,000 refugees 50,000 as we face the worst refugee crisis in the history of the world I cannot help but think about Jordan today and the refugees that they have accepted a diverse group of refugees from all over the Middle East Middle East an extraordinary show of courage and leadership on their part let me close by saying this it's been 55 years to the day that Martin Luther King wrote his letter from the Birmingham jail 55 years ago and he said that famous line is letter injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere now for the time being the Trump administration is forfeited the United States Authority is a neutral broker and given up on a two-state solution which may be the only way to bring real peace in the hearts and minds of the Palestinian people we have abandoned our standing and influence in this peace process the result Israel is less secure it is the ultimate betrayal to Israel and peace today justice everywhere is truly threatened it is hard and the outlook may be bleak but we cannot and will not give up on the possibility of peace or those marching to secure peace in his final speech Yitzhak Rabine who died fighting for peace said for Israel there is no path that is without pain but the path of peace is preferable to the path of war Rabine was right then and he is right again today thank you for allowing me to speak and let me just close by saying my friends at J Street if I can just one word and closing you're such a critically important voice in this political process I hope you appreciate that when members of the Senate and House sit down to make some of the toughest decisions they remember things that you've said they remember your friendship they remember your encouragement what you have achieved in 10 years is truly extraordinary a commitment to the future of Israel and a commitment to peace in the Middle East thank you all so much for a lot of his legacy thank you [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]

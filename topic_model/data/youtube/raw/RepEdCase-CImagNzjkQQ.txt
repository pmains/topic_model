mr sherman let me now recognize my good friend he's really been a champion on issues of the pacific islands um the congressman from hawaii mr ed case thank you very much mr chair-ranking member um i really appreciate your you're allowing me to be a part of this this critical hearing um i think as we've all recognized uh just uh just recognizing the pacific islands and showing up even in a virtual hearing like this is critical to our presence in the pacific islands and i really am grateful for your partnership and in founding and maintaining the congressional pacific islands uh caucus which you uh both of you are our co-chairs of and as well as in introducing and forwarding uh the major bills that we're pursuing from from honoring oceania to the civic act which are both moving at this point and i think are responsive to many of the concerns that our witnesses have have raised here so all of that is is is a good solid uh start but a lot of work still to be done obviously i want to go back to the pacific islands forum because i guess my big question is um are we just going to let it go we collectively by the way i mean not our country but all of us that care care about the pacific islands and care about the future of the pacific islands uh of course um i i think and believe we would all agree um that um the regional uh uh cooperation coordination and as we say in hawaii ohana uh family the regional family of the pacific islands is forwarded by by a an organization the pacific islands farm has has served that purpose and and so i hope we would all agree that that the risk to the forum posed right now is is not a good thing and would be taken advantage of by adversaries um and yet i i think i hear a little bit of a disagreement among our our panelists as to whether whether we should just let it go or or continue to work to try to try to hold it together so um um ambassador are you are you still able to comment on that is it too late for the forum or or uh do we need to consider alternative uh approaches with the with the forum um and i agree with your comments by the way i don't i don't personally want to i want to see it replaced by you know three sub-regional uh forums kind of uh sub forums although i guess they might have some advantages but not in replacement for an overall forum style approach ambassador sevkin are you are you available otherwise i will go to ms pascal what's your view of it i think you seem to have a little bit more pessimistic view and i want to flesh that out a little bit yes and i and i should be clear i'm not saying abandon the firm i'm saying that you know it's looking like the forum is becoming what it was essentially originally which was the south pacific forum so it would be the countries of melanesia and polynesia and then micronesia is separate so it's not saying get rid of the forum and say but there are pan regional organizations like the sbc or spreep for example that do knit the countries together what we're talking about mostly is kind of a political uh cohesion uh in terms of things like for example china and i think that the operational realities of micronesia are very very different than those in the south pacific so there is a an argument to be made that you can uh strengthen the family by giving different members of the family uh more control over their own say the voice as we saw with the vote in the marshall islands we speak to anybody uh who's sitting in one of those embassies in washington they feel like they they never got their voice heard and if they don't get their voice heard we don't know what their problems are and if we don't know where the problems are we can't help them resolve it they were australia and new zealand were acting as an intermediary for this for that messaging so i think that you know that might make sense for melanesia and polynesia but in terms of micronesia where there are the freely associated states and guam and saipan there is no you know they let new caledonia and french polynesian but they didn't let american samoa in you know so i think that there is an argument to be made that uh actually the region becomes stronger if you've got that political grouping division but then with things like training and collaboration stuff that goes through the spc or goes through street okay so you have a do you have a view on this well i i don't think we should let it sit and but it you know it would take um nor do i know some nuance in terms of how we engage oh um and you know part of it is we're not a member in the way that we can influence from within in a direct fashion so it's indirect and what it would take for us is to work closely with um you know uh other parts of the region to to try to help them realize that when they're divided like this that they all um lower the their their volume of their voice and that they should work together it this would this would take a process and it would take a lot of face to face that's very difficult with covid right now but i agree with you we should we should not just set aside we should try to actively uh get back together well we're not we're not a member but it seems to me we've been awfully passive about it um and that's the distinction i mean we we can we cannot be a member we can respect um the decisions of the pacific islands on on how to work through the the forum related issues um but we we obviously have um an interest in in a in a regional organization that works um and and my concern is that sometimes we've been too passive on trying to get every trying to work with um with everybody to see whether there's a way out of this as opposed to just letting the forum fall apart so that's that's that's perhaps my my concern there anyway my time has expired i really appreciate it uh again chair and ranking member and and all of our witnesses that i've worked with uh very well all already in terms of the stake islands this has been a great hearing great thank you mr case

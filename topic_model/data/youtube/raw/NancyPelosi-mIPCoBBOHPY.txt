pelosi for one minute the gentlelady is recognized thank you madam Speaker I thank the gentleman for yielding I appreciate his leadership on to helping us honor what our founders put forth in our founding documents which is a life liberty and the pursuit of happiness and that is exactly what the Affordable Care Act helps to guarantee a healthier life the liberty to of and to pursue happiness free of the constraints that lack of health care might provide to family if you want to be a photographer a writer and artist a musician you can do so if you want to start a business if you want to change jobs under the Affordable Care Act you have that ability that liberty to pursue your happiness and so that is why I'm so pleased that this week we can celebrate the two-year anniversary of the Affordable Care Act and I want to mention some of the provisions that are in it but not before mentioning that the legislation on the floor today is a feeble attempt to unravel legislation that makes a big difference in the lives of America's families you be the judge if you are a family with the child with asthma diabetes is bipolar at existing medical condition up until this bill your child could be discriminated against for life of ever receiving affordable health insurance and therefore care but already even though the full thrust of the law does not take place until 2014 right away the month for months now to no child in America maybe it can be denied health coverage because of a pre-existing condition and soon all Americans will have that same protection for the first time in American history millions of American and seniors have access to free preventive health services services that prevent that our early intervention to detect a possible illness in a person 86 million Americans have already received key preventive health benefits under the law and more than 5 million seniors have saved over 3.2 billion dollars in prescription drug expenses already 3.2 billion dollars in prescription drug benefits because of provisions of the law that are already in effect so if you're a senior and you're caught in the doughnut hole or you would have been you have already and already benefiting from this law and that's what the Republicans are trying to take away from you from your family from your life from your liberty from your pursuit of happiness the last point about seniors in prescription drug is particular point important because it fits it fits in with our consistent commitment from them as authors of Medicare in the 60s it because it's with our consistent commitment to always strengthen Medicare for American seniors never weaken it indeed america as i mentioned democrats created Medicare sustain Medicare and Democrats will always protect Medicare even from language that is so misleading as to make one wonder Republicans on the other hand have voted to end Medicare and Medicare guarantee they have said that their goal for Medicare is for it to wither on the vine and tonight's legislation is a part of the withering on the vine it's important for you to know that if you care about Medicare if you depend on Medicare this is the wither on the vine scenario and just in fact yesterday Republicans release their budget which would end Medicare guarantee shift costs to seniors and the guarantee what does that mean shift costs to seniors perhaps up to sixty four hundred dollars for most seniors a year and again let Medicare wither on the vine that's why today's legislation is such a cynical political ploy and I know that America seniors will not be fooled by it today Republicans had brought to the floor legislation that has known as iPad to repeal what is known as iPad Independent Payment Advisory Board independent independent of political influence over decisions that are made this piece of the legislation was a bend the curve to reduce the cost of health care in America Republicans are desperate to distract seniors from the real record on Medicare and that's what they're trying to do today I say that without any fear of contradiction without any hesitation because nothing less is at stake than the well-being of our seniors their health their personal health their economic health and that means their security further in this bill Republicans have recycled their old medical malpractice liability legislation that undermines states rights and hurts the rights of injured patients to obtain just compensation I can put more in the record but I'll just say this because of the impact on America's states of what they're trying to do in this bill the bipartisan and I repeat bipartisan National Conference of State Legislatures has strongly opposed this bill that bipartisan group says that after a careful review it had reached quote the resounding bipartisan conclusion there are words that federal medical malpractice legislation is unnecessary again mr. madam Speaker this week we celebrate the two-year anniversary of the fordable Care Act for what is it embodies it's about innovation it's about not just health care in America but a healthier America it's about prevention innovation it's about customized personalized care it's about electronic medical records it's about lowering costs expanding access and improving quality so much misleading information is put out there about it that it's important to keep repeating the difference the transformative transformative nature of the legislation in fact it has already begun to transform the lives of America's children by saying no longer will they be need I coverage because they have existing medical condition and soon we can fully say that no longer being a woman is a pre-existing medical condition where women are discriminated against the tune of a billion dollars a year in cost of premiums not to mention exclusion from obtaining a coverage and so I proudly celebrate the two-year anniversary and I emphatically oppose the legislation on the floor if you want to unravel Medicare vote I if you want to support Medicare if you think health care is a right for the many not just a privilege for the few vote no with that I your back the balance of my time the gentleman gentleman woman yields back gentleman

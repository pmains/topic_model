state of play also this morning tweeting this come on Republican senators you can do it on health care after seven years this is your chance to shine don't let the American people down there you have it joining me now to discuss the state of play Democratic congressman and Minority Whip in the house congressman Steny Hoyer congressman it's great to see you thanks for coming in it's good to be with you kid so it's can you repeal if it's passed in the Senate it gets you all to Constance to conference what then well I don't know what then but this is not a skinny repeal in terms of the adverse impact that's going to have on millions of Americans CBO says immediately sixteen million people can lose their insurance but millions and millions more are going to see their premiums substantially increased even those that have employer-based insurance so that the impact there is going to be very substantial but what it indicates is it's certainly not repeal either it's what the Republicans after seven years of trying to put something together that the only thing that they'd been able to put together that may pass the Senate I hope it doesn't pass the Senate very frankly I'd be surprised if Rand Paul votes for this who said he was for repeal this is not repealed and I'd be surprised that more moderate senators who are very worried about the impact in their states and on people would vote for this so we'll see but obviously what they want to do is to get to conference they get to conference my view is they'll get an even worse bill than has been proposed so far nothing they have come up with has been appealing to the American public or not been harmful to millions and millions of people who need and want health care levels again let's see what plays out today and where it has after this this morning I have to ask you trying for the reports of the White House in fighting exploded on CNN the president's director of communications he's upset about leaks coming from the White House saying that if the chief of staff is not a leaker Reince Priebus should explain that for himself what is your take on it from the by looking in well this administration has for seven months brought us chaos and confrontation this is another stark example of that how any organization can operate with the conflict and confrontation that has been a daily occurrence in the White House I'm not too upset that it's harmful to frankly the White House staff but what I am very concerned about is the risk that it puts our country out and the undermining of our president and the White House's attention to critical manners confronting this nation both on the national security level and on the domestic level but it's just extraordinary six years Kate as you know I've never seen anything like this out of any White House Republican or Democrat it is a stark demonstration of the inability of this White House and this administration to lead this country in a constructive way see what happens on Twitter next on Russia sanctions congressman the House and Senate will soon be sending the sanctions bill to the president for his signature this is though again the White House communications director Anthony scare Moochie this is what he said about the sanctions bill this morning listen to this he may sign this you may sign the sanctions exactly the way they are or he may veto the sanctions and negotiate a even tougher deal against the Russian he may veto it for a tougher deal against the brothers what you're after that my reaction is that is totally calculated what the president's been talking about for the last year and a half and how Putin is a good president he's popular he's a tough leader he wants to work with him I don't know where the communications director got this thought but the president has given any indication that he wants to make sanctions tougher so we'll see whether he signs the bill but frankly if he doesn't sign the bill I think the Congress will clearly and quickly override his veto this bill is a result of the Congress's conviction that the sanctions levied on the Russians and very and on the Iranians as well as the North Koreans are appropriate and should be stay in place until a deal is made that has Putin back off from Crimea from Ukraine from this and from Syria and the Iranians has stopped their human rights abuses in their support of terrorism and the North Koreans stopped pursuing nuclear weapons and the ability to deliver those weapons so I think it's very clear that the Congress in a very bipartisan fashion 98 to 419 to 1 overwhelming the 1419 to 3 in the house on the sanctions bill that the Congress overwhelmingly is concerned that this president might lift sanctions and not make them tougher lift sanctions and wants to make sure that that's not done without the Congress's participation we're getting we are we're just getting some breaking news and from Barbara Starr involving the president's announcement banning transgender people from serving in the US military Barbara Starr is reporting that the Joint Chiefs did not know that the announcement was coming and the amount and also she wrote a statement from the chairman saying that they're not going to implement the changes until they hear directly from the president and it's in consultation with the Secretary of Defense there are a lot of questions right now about what all this actually means do you know I don't know but it is another indication of chaos conflict and confrontation the president in putting out his tweets which I think were of appeal to prejudice and division and not consistent with what the Armed Forces were asking for nevertheless said well the generals have told me I don't know which generals he's talking about but when I hear chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff had no idea that he was going to do this it's another indication the only reason this was done to appeal to some House members and the heart slurs of the Congress who wanted to and offered an amendment to discriminate against those transgender members of the Armed Forces which was rejected by a bipartisan vote of the Congress this was an effort to go around the Congress to not have the courage to face this one more time on the floor of the House of Representatives in which that amendment would have lost and do indirectly what they couldn't do directly it's a shame it's wrong and it's shocking that this was not done in consultation with and with the agreement of the leaders of our armed forces arson spending horror of really appreciate your time thank you so much you're back Kate thanks a lot thank you

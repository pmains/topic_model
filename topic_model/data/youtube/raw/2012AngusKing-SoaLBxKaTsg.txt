so I don't have a good segue for this so it's good a net neutrality what do you think I'm for it I don't think I don't think people who own the pipe should be able to say who gets to drive faster on the pipes is that does that make any sense if you owned a highway and you also happen to be ford motor and you said okay anybody can use my highway but Ford's can go 80 and everybody else has to go 20 that wouldn't do much for innovation it wouldn't do much for broad use of the highway plus it's also it's not only us as consumers but it's somebody in Maine creates a website and wants to start a business I don't think they ought to be discriminated against because they don't have some special deal cut with with verizon or comcast the amazing thing about the Internet is the ability to start a business and and make a success of it without a huge capital investment and and and you could you know you can start it right right here in Maine okay so that really leads us into the next conversation around around internet regulation sort of feeds into that what do you weigh thoughts about regulating the internet yeah I can do it I can state my position on government regulation of the Internet as follows you get it I think we have to tread very carefully because in the name of protecting intellectual property we end up you know just casting a wet blanket over the whole deal my my view is a government should should help to facilitate the building out of the infrastructure but then get out of the way what is it specifically about peop sis plus open acta those types of internet regulation legislations that you are opposed to and how would you as a senator try to stop further bills of that variety coming down the pipeline is this a quiz do I have to tell you what they all stand now you do not stop online piracy act as SOPA PIPA is the protection of intellectual property act those are again that's what i was talking about it's it's a legitimate issue I don't have the solution but I but those bills that you mentioned went too far they they went too far in the in the toward the side they basically shifted the responsibility to the website I think my instinct would be to do what I did when I was governor quite often is lock them in a room and tell them to work something out the googles and the facebooks and the and the yahoos of the world and Hollywood and the Recording Industry and see if there isn't a way that they can find where neither one gets everything they want but that we don't really compromise we can't stifle this enormous enormous engine of human creativity in the name of protecting a specialized human creativity I think there's a solution there that can respect both

when our fellow Americans deposit their earnings in u.s. in a US bank or entrust the government with their tax dollars they do so assuming that their money will not be used in ways which undermine the security of our very nation and frankly of the world the legislation we are debating tonight is a package of bills designed to prevent the Obama administration from further undermining the trust of the American people and the security of our nation as well as the security of our allies under President Obama's nuclear deal with Iran formerly known as the joint comprehensive plan of action or the jcpoa the administration agreed to authorize the export of civilian aircraft to iran what the jcpoa jcpoa did not include was authorization for us financing of those sales as Treasury secretary Jack Lew said in April at a Council of Foreign Relations speech quote Iran complied with the nuclear agreement therefore the nuclear sanctions are lifted I think that that is a process that is becoming more and more clear keep our part of the bargain there but the US financial system is not open to Iran and that is not something that is going to change end quote and again that was secretary Jack Lew in April this past year well mr. speaker something changed in September Treasuries Office of Foreign Assets Control issued licenses to Airbus and two Boeing permitting the sale of up to 97 airplanes to Iran air the country's flagship state-owned carrier these licenses didn't stop there however by going beyond the scope of the jcpoa they also authorized US financial institutions to quote engage in all transactions necessary to provide financing or other financial services close quote related to the Iranian Air orders my bill HR 57 11 would prohibit the secretary of treasury from authorizing us financing through american banks in connection with the export of commercial aircraft to iran just as the administration claimed was US policy to begin with this bill would keep americans deposits away from a country that the president's own eight Department calls quote the world's foam foremost state sponsor of terrorism and which Treasury has designated as quote a jurisdiction of primary money-laundering concern let me repeat that the State Department itself says this is the world's foremost state punt sponsor of terrorism and the Treasury Department has designated a jurisdiction of primary money-laundering concern how many more red flags need to go up under this bill Americans would not have to fear for that their savings are being channeled to Iran air which was sanctioned by Treasury in 2011 for ferrying soldiers and weapons of war to Syria the site of a five-year conflict that has claimed half a million lives and displaced millions more this is the same Iran air that a UN report concluded had shared ballistic military ties with North Korea and the same Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps whose deputy commander called for an end to Israel making note of more than a hundred thousand missiles that are were ready quote for the annihilation the wiping out and the collapse of the Zionist regime end quote additionally research by the foundation for defense of democracies shows that Iran air support of the Assad regime continues to this very day why should US banks and their customers be implicated in Iranian atrocities I would submit that there is no reasonable answer to this which is why this common-sense prohibition when offered as an amendment to this year's financial services appropriations bill was passed by this very body the House of Representatives by voice vote however this bill goes even further mr. speaker not only will HR 57 11 protect Americans bank accounts it will prevent their tax dollars from being used through the export-import bank to subsidize aircraft sales to Iran it would be through direct transactions or third-party leasing which is becoming more and more common this codifies in strengthens an existing XM prohibition that is renewed in annual appropriations bills for that reason this measure enjoyed the support of XM supporters and critics alike when it came before the Financial Services Committee HR 57 11 combines the text of two bills reported by the Committee on financial services one of them sponsored by myself and the other by congressman Roskam of Illinois both pieces of legislation were co-sponsored by our Democrat colleague congressman Sherman of California who has devoted years to Iran policy both as a member of the Financial Services Committee and the Foreign Affairs Committee and I'd like to thank representative Sherman and representative Roskam for working with me on this very important legislation package and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this important bill and I reserve the balance of my time

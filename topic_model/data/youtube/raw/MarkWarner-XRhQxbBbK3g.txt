[Applause] please welcome the Honorable Mark Warner United States Senator and former governor of Virginia to offer special remarks good morning it is a real honor for me to join so many friends on this platform and so many friends in this audience to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the first African landing I think as other speakers have already mentioned this commemoration challenges us to reject the simplistic versions of our history and quite honestly confront a complicated truth the truth is our Commonwealth is both the birthplace of representative democracy and of American slavery our nation's Constitution enshrines both the ideals of liberty and justice as well as America's original sin frederick douglass spoke about this contradiction a few weeks after the Dred Scott decision he said that American slavery endured not because of any paper Constitution but in the moral blindness the moral blindness of the American people now in today and this programs over this weekend we remember the first landings of enslaved Africans we come face to face with that moral blindness that existed not only in 1619 or in 1776 but unfortunately even today the truth is our founders idea of of democracy did not include looking at this audience most of you are sitting out there today but if they knew that the descendants of the people America enslaved would one day be free and that they would challenge our nation to finally live up to our founding ideals well that might give us all a little bit of comfort we honor the heroes of that struggle today as well as the men and women whose stories are lost to history we recognized that 1619 also marks the first chapter in the 400 years story of the african-american history and as Tim just mentioned that african-american history is absolutely central and essential to both the history of Virginia and the history of our country finally what we do here today is a recognition that's long overdue she made mention of some of the time that he was governor I remember when I was governor and my youngest daughter was at that point in second grade was walking around Capitol Square with my wife and Capitol squares kind of the front yard for any of us who had the honor to live in the governor's mansion and as my daughter walked around looking at all these statues and this was not 200 years ago 100 years ago this was not 20th century this was 21st century she looked around and said well where is the statue of Rosa Parks well my wife Lisa thought quickly and she said well Rosa Parks is not from Virginia but capital square in 2002 the only memorials the only statues were of dead white men and the majority of them Confederates that's not 1960s that's not 1770s that's not 1619 that's 2002 so with Senator Henry Marsh we set about and built the Virginia civil rights memorial and when it was unveiled back in 2008 it was a historic occasion but it was also fairly bittersweet the truth is it shouldn't have taken more than 50 years to honor Barbara John's in Capitol Square but it's also equally true that there should have never had to be an occasion where Barbara John's had to walk out of a dilapidated moat in high school to ask for equal rights as well in Virginia it's a reminder that no monument or no legislation or no court case can erase the stain of slavery it will never be that easy the truth is an American democracy where all men and women are entitled to equal citizenship is actually a very recent creation as others have mentioned as well it was in our Commonwealth we're in places like Prince Edward County communities shut down their schools rather than be integrated during massive resistance now we have made progress as a nation but the progress is recent it is incomplete and that progress will only endure as long as all of us remain committed to both defending it and promoting it two years ago two years ago in a country where we thought again in the Commonwealth where we thought we'd made so much progress we saw violent forces of hate and backlash displayed in Charlottesville this tragedy had a lot of us asking is this who we are will they hit that history confronts us today it reminds us that the answer is complicated but one answer is absolutely true what happened in Charlottesville is not who we should be and I believe all of our leaders all of our leaders have a moral responsibility to speak up and demand America deliver on its promise of liberty and justice for all that's why this commemoration and the national conversation its fostering is so important if we're gonna be a country that truly lives up to our founding principles then we need to tell the whole truth about our history the good the bad and yes the ugly as well so as we mark this 400 year commemoration of the first African landing it is my hope that this will be a moment to both comfort the afflicted but also afflict the comfortable thank you so much for letting me be part of this important ceremony today thank you to share special remarks please welcome the Honorable Karen our bass the United States House of Representatives for the 37th congressional district of California and chair of the Congressional Black Caucus [Applause]

Thank You mr. chairman recently mr. collum the IRS determined that affordability is going to be based on the cost of a workers individual coverage not the cost of family coverage so we're going to have millions of spouses and dependents in a kind of regulatory no man's land and during the health care debate this issue was looked at the whole question of affordability particularly affordability for families and a provision was added that would have allowed an employee to take their employers contribution their employers contribution either individual or family and then be able to shop for a policy that best fit their needs at a price that they can afford now this is no longer available as of now this is no longer available so come January of 2014 we're going to have millions of families not my characterisations been in the New York Times all kinds other places millions of families really pinch they're really in this kind of no-man's land where they are unable to afford the family coverage offered through their employers and ineligible for subsidies that could be used by dependence on the exchange what I'd like to know is what you all are open to doing in terms of helping these people this is not an abstract question either people are going to get pounded here middle-class you know families here in a relatively short period of time and it seems to me at a minimum what you all ought to be doing now is looking at ways to give the states through the exchanges some flexibility to help people are you willing to do that yes we are okay now I'd like you to get back to me in writing with respect to specific ways in which you'd like to work with the state to help people and I'm encouraged by your answer I know that this is something that you probably didn't know what would come up today but in effect what we be especially interested in his ways in which the state would allow an employee to take an employer's contribution to the exchange and be in a position to get more value for themselves and their family can you take a look specifically at that idea for me we'd be happy to take a look at note I don't have an answer for you today but we'll be happy to take a look at that all right how long do you think it'll take for you to get an answer to me on that can we say within a month oh I would think so okay very good

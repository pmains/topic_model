so welcome everyone this is J Street at 10 and I'm Dan Kahl ik I am the senior political advisor at move on which is the largest independent progressive political organization in the country but that is not why they came and had me talk here today I've only been a move on for three months in the eight and a half years before that time I spent as a staff member of J Street first as our national political director and later as the chief of staff and what we're trying to do with this conference and what we're trying to dig into at this panel is why did we create J Street ten years ago and it's our birthday so how are we doing have we made progress in ten years where do we need to go from here over the next ten years and where are things going and so what this panel in particular is going to explore is two of the main areas that J Street has focused on the hill and the campaign trail and luckily we have someone who's involved in both of that here today but you know we really when we came together a little over ten years ago and started talking about the concept of J Street what we thought was missing from those advocating for more diplomatic approach to the Middle East was that there was a broken politics in this country here in the United States about how people running for office and how people sitting in Congress talked and thought about issues related to Israel in the Middle East and issues related to the American Jewish community and there was this simplification sold to a lot of people who are my good friends because campaign consultants can be a little bit lazy when it comes to dealing with small groups and populations around this country and they said if you want support from the American Jewish community here is what your position needs to be on these key issues and there wasn't a lot of room for people to really look at not supporting Israel meaning whatever the current coalition government puts forward is what my position is on what it means to be personal but what is actually in Israel's long-term interest to be the Jewish and democratic home that so many of us spend time and have cousins there and believe in and believe is essential for its survival over the next its next 70 years and so we you know we built an organization that tried to demonstrate to members of Congress and to people running that there was a deep and meaningful support from the thousands of people that are here in DC and hundreds of thousands around the country that would vote for you that would volunteer for your campaign and that would donate money to you specifically to bring forward that nuanced pro-israel pro-peace message that we now see is the mainstream in my view positioning and posture of the Democratic Party as it approaches issues and foreign peace issues of a two-state solution and of course as we saw the historic signing of a diplomatic deal with Iran that was able to prevent a nuclear nuclear proliferation deal that was able to prevent Iran from going nuclear without firing a single shot and I think for those of us who got involved in politics specifically around the Iraq war and probably the worst foreign policy mistake we've seen in 50 years to see the absolute opposite move forward and for Democrats to stand strong and understand that the politics was with them to do that was a seminal moment for this organization so you definitely did not come here to just listen to me babble you know how you all probably know my email and my cell phone so call me later but we're here with two esteemed panelists starting all the way over the left we have congressman Jamie Raskin from Maryland's 8th congressional district right up here in Maryland he's very popular one because many of his constituents can get here very easily and too because he is one of the most important rising voices for the progressives on a whole host of issues in Congress and in his short time there has made a huge impact and a lot of us see him as as our future hope to really drive the party to a place that we can believe in he spent 10 years prior to this in the state Senate in Maryland as the voice in Maryland pushing forward a whole host of a great progressive issues and he's also a constitutional law scholar not just a non-practicing lawyer like myself next to Jamie is Nancy Soderbergh who will be joining him very shortly because she's running for Congress in Florida's 6th congressional district this is a seat left vacant by a much smaller and lesser person who it will not be in Congress next time which is great and this is one of those seats you know people always say we need 23 to win we need 23 to win back to the house well the truth is if you want any chance in getting to 23 you really need to put 40 or 50 seats in play because we don't know where those 23 are exactly gonna come from it's not just those the so-called Hillary seats and this is that exact type of seat in Florida that is going to be extremely competitive and if we win seats like that we are going to be able to pull the emergency brake on some of Donald Trump's worst policies and I'm very excited to work with Nancy Soderberg when she is a congresswoman next time what we should know about Nancy is that she spent 30 years working on the intersection of foreign policy and politics she was Bill Clinton's deputy national security adviser she was the ambassador to the UN she runs a consulting firm now she also teaches as a professor in Florida on these issues she's worked on four presidential campaigns she worked for Ted Kennedy in the Senate she understands more than most people in this room how policy on how foreign policy decisions are made and what if any political influence can shape both the decision process but also how its message and brought out to the public so I'm very excited to hear from from Nancy here as well today and to work with her when she's in Congress and I move on so with that let's let's start with where things let's start with where things were and then go to where things are at does that work for you guys are you want to start then go backwards you know care so congressman Raskin you're on the hill today how do you see issues related to to Israel two-state solution members of Congress relate to the American Jewish community playing out today and and was the J Street experiment did it work or is it have things changed do people see a more nuanced view do they understand that they can be pro Israel without being anti Palestinian or anti-arab first thank you for having me I'm just delighted to be here with everybody from J Street and happy birthday J Street 10th birthday is a big birthday I should also say then what before starting that Jeremy ben-ami and a bunch of the other leaders of J Street live in my district so I I'm their representative I also have a lot of the leadership of AIPAC that lives in my district and so for me solving the Middle East crisis is a form of constituent service so I got to get that done while I'm in office so the answer to your question is yes I think that you know that these are these are tough times these are these are dark times but I'm quoting my dad here who used to say that that if if you think you're in a situation that's hopeless you're the hope and so the people in this room or the hope in a dark time you're the light you are the light and so I'm thrilled to be here with you I would say that that J Street's first ten years has been a very successful experiment for American politics for Middle East policy and for the State of Israel I think I think for all of it J Street has opened up conceptual space it's opened up political space and it's opened up ethical space and the conceptual space is simply to say that you can be a very staunch champion of the State of Israel and also be in serious authentic pursuit of a two-state solution and a meaningful peace process and politically it has created the space for people to say that and to fight for that and to make that safe both within the halls of government and also within people's congressional districts and when they're out arguing and ethically I think it has made it a lot easier for people to bring their politics and their conscience together in the field you know I grew up with rabbi Hillel is dictum if I am NOT for myself who will be for me but if I am for myself only then Who am I and if not now when and the last line underscoring the urgency of thinking about ourselves our own security our own peace and also the security and the peace of others which go together so I would say that the stage is set for some big breakthroughs I want to believe that with respect not just to the Mideast but all over the world do you guys know that democracy is under attack liberal principles are under attack human rights are under attack from Putin's Russia to to tear tase Philippines to air diwan's Turkey to the Saudi Kingdom you name it everywhere liberal democracy is under attack so the movement for democracy and human rights and peace in the Middle East is a movement for democracy and human rights in peace everywhere and we know that the dictators the autocrats the kleptocrats the bullies have found each other and that means that the movements for peace and social justice and human rights all over the world we've got to find each other to Hey Thank You congressman uh when I my first couple months at J Street and they said Dan just go do politics there was like eight of us and we were sitting around a small office that we sublet and so I started cold calling first time congressional candidates and I said we are J Street we're interested in talking to you about your campaign and our views on Israel and diplomacy in the Middle East and then most people said who then they googled us and then they hung up the phone when I left J Street four months ago every single Democrat and some Republicans but every single Democrat who is running for the House and there are more candidates running this cycle than ever before every single sitting member of the Democratic caucus every single sitting senator running in places like North Dakota and Indiana and Missouri were knocking down J streets door to try and meet with me I don't think I'm that interesting a person to meet with but something clearly had changed in the last 10 years about how Democrats thought about an organization that said were very much pro-israel but we're also pro-peace we want to support your campaign from who are you why should I talk to you I'm told that this is some sort of toxic new organization - how can I get a meeting how can I get your support so I guess you're running for Congress right now and you're endorsed by Jay Street PAC why did you call and sit with Ilya and Aaron and why did you want the J Street endorsement and what do you think that means for candidates running in today's environment well first of all thank you for having me and thank you very much for the support the endorsement and the extraordinary crowd there it's always fun to see - Jamie I remember very well when Jeremy ben-ami called me ten years ago probably 11 now saying we're Athey I think we're gonna do this and I think he tapped into a need to open up space to kind of have a different point of view but also to try and create a movement that is no longer an experiment this is a 10-year decades of building support for goals and shared values that represent as as Jamie was saying a core fundamental American value as a candidate for Congress I have a lot of Jewish constituents I went to the Jewish Heritage Festival for the upcoming 70th anniversary and in Florida yesterday and I think people are nervous about what's happening in the Middle East they're nervous about what's happening with Iran in particular we've just handed Syria over to the Iranians on a silver platter and I think the the more you can have experts who can say here's how to look at it here's the facts that can be there so I called on J Street because I believe in the mission and I believe in the support I've followed you for 10 years and running for Congress you need all the help you can get this is a difficult seat for myself running in a Republican leaning district and so I'm doing absolutely everything I can but I also want to take care of my hat off for the 10 years of record of success having worked on four presidential campaigns the Senate the White House politics never drive a real decision and I've never seen all the folks that I've worked for honestly we're trying to do what was best for America and groups like J Street can help put those in context but in my view most importantly raised the red flag when you need to know about something coming up because it's like a fire hose when you're running for office and when you're in office and so the more you can have relationships and people come in and say you know this is really important and here's the three talking points so you don't have to spend all night writing them yourself can just be crucial and I think you've developed a real role in American politics and foreign policy that will continue not just the next ten years but well well past our time in politics Thank You congressman I'd like you to talk about the political side as well I mean you ran in what I believe at the time was the most expensive congressional primary in history you had about 37 opponents if I remember correctly and you emerged victorious and it was it was a really interesting race is as we're seeing these candidates running across the country really trying to find some daylight between them and their candidates how can we use foreign policy as one tool to really show and demonstrate that you're the real progressive champion fighter that's gonna get you through a Democratic primary in today's environment so yes for those eighth District Marylanders were out there you will recall we had the most yes go cd8 thank you thank you all for being here yeah I've got the greatest constituents in the world and we yes it was the most expensive primary in US history I think it was 21 million dollars spent in the primary not by me I hasten to add we were outspent 9 to 1 we were outspent 50 to 1 on TV we only had one TV ad the last week of the campaign just so we could say we had a TV ad but nobody saw it but so but what we had a very strong progressive grassroots organizing campaign and we went door-to-door we had 169 events in people's living rooms in their backyards where we would have real conversations about complicated things like climate change and gun violence in the Middle East the things that you can't do in a 30-second attack ad against somebody but but we have a very politically engaged and educated constituency and so people were paying attention and and got the the point about it and and I was listed as one of the J Street people too and that that meant a lot to me to have that that validation from J Street so you know I think that you know we live in a time of tremendous flux in transition and it helps as Nancy was saying to connect people who are running for office who have very little time to think you know much less read and write seriously with people who are thinking and reading and writing deeply about about the field and you know I think that that's gonna make an important difference for me you know going back to kind of what I started by saying in terms of political and ethical space my grandfather who some people here know is ambassador Sam Kaplan still in the room yes you guys noted the great sam kaplan from Minnesota who was ambassador to Morocco but he's a big-time force in Minnesota politics my grandfather was the first Jewish person ever elected to the Minnesota State Legislature back in the 1930s and he was DFL our democracy farm Democrat farm Labour Party he was a progressive new dealer he was friends with you know Mondale and Humphrey and the Minnesota progressive tradition he was a strong labor person and he was a strong progressive Zionist and for me meeting the people from J Street allowed me to reconnect with the roots of my grandfather who was somebody who was deeply involved in progressive politics throughout the 20th century and felt that his passion and his commitment for Israel were very much connected to the kind of world that he was fighting to build in America and everywhere else I follow up a little bit last night you said something that really struck me which is no one in this room questions that you can be pro-american and at the same time in your pro-american as' attack Donald Trump in his policies why can't we be pro-israel and attack the certain policies of the curtain Netanyahu coalition government and what it decides to do you speak to that I couldn't have said it better myself that I I agree with it even more hearing you say it you know the your patriotism in America is not determined by how much you support Donald Trump or the incumbent regime on the contrary the the first imperative of Patriots is to support their country against their government when their governments wrong that's what it means to be a patriot and so if if we don't have to support our own president when our president is wrong why do we have to support anybody else's president or prime minister when they're wrong that that can't be the test of anybody's loyalty to human rights or democracy or justice on earth and you know if I if I wouldn't want if I don't if I wouldn't want to support Trump or Netanyahu the policies in America why do I have to support Trump or Netanyahu policies in Israel I think it's my obligation as a progressive person to stand up for progressive movements and forces and human rights and peace all over the world thank you getting a little more policy heavy the Iran nuclear deal it was very hard to negotiate that involve many countries it took a very long time I don't think anyone views the deal as perfect but most people that you talk to in the proliferation space say this is the gold standard of what you have ever seen someone agreed to in terms of the types of verification and the types of real accountability to prevent Iran from going nuclear and the entire world has put its stamp of approval so I guess my question to you is what can we do of supporters of the deal knowing that we the only thing that stands from us and a removal from it is Donald Trump I mean what messages should we be sending what should we be staying on the trail which we'll be saying in Congress and what you'll be saying has activists to me the biggest threat we face right now is the fact an Iranian nuclear state and the nuclear deal I think stopped it dead in its track deferred it you know at least a decade I'd like to see it a permanent I'd like to see it negotiated so that it includes the ballistic missile program it's some port for Hamas and Hezbollah its human rights record but every single one of those problems will be worse if Iran has a nuclear weapon if we pull out of that deal unilaterally the targets been going to be on our back and Iran will be free to get a nuclear weapon and I think that's just wrong so I would encourage everyone in J Street to mobilize to make sure that we pressure us to not pull out of that deal it's not a perfect deal nobody no deal is perfect but the United States is more secure with us in that deal than without now the president put 120 day time clock ticking that's going to happen in May I honestly have given up predicting what this presidents going to do but I think there's a really good chance that he could pull out of it and I think it's going to be dependent on our allies in the Middle East everyone in the region to say don't and I would urge you to right now is the time to do it get out and and talk to the administration talk to the members of Congress talk to Europeans to Israelis we do not want we have to find a way to get off that cliff and to me that's something that I think J Street has already played an important role in supporting the Iran nuclear deal and I think now is the time to do that in spades I'm very worried about this and I think what's happening in Syria is just giving the region Tehran and a silver platter as I said and we need to all mobilize to try and stop that today and I think everyone in this room can have a role in that that is critical thank you uh when Donald Trump ran for president he went around the country and he said I'm gonna get us out of all these dumb Wars we should be putting money to building bridges here and not wasting trillions of dollars abroad he just made John Bolton his national security adviser Mike Pompeo is about to go to the Senate for confirmation as a Secretary of State Gina Haspel is going to be at least likely replacing him at the CIA congressman what does where do we see Trump going with his foreign policy and how can we make an issue of the I mean should we make a complete issue of the hypocrisy of what he ran on what he's doing now or are there better messages to call him out for unpopular positions and to really take back the mantle of what a reasonable foreign policy looks like in the world how would you advise Democrats on that yeah I don't know how much mileage there really is in the hypocrisy point I mean I think people who are looking for consistency in foreign policy or domestic policy or even in just statements from minute to minute long ago abandoned Donald Trump you know the the most ferocious militaristic hawkish wing of the Republican Party now seems to have ensconce itself in the administration they're taking over so I think that we have to make on our side of the aisle we have to make as much common cause as we can with the Republicans who are interested in maintaining peace and you know preventing the outbreak of World War I mean look at what's going on in Syria today I mean how many nuclear powers are involved in that there's Russia there's the US there's France there's a UK it could have been a Ron I mean had we not had the Iran nuclear agreement but I mean things are a tinderbox all over the world so I think that we have to blow the whistle on militarism explain that you know this is an administration that lost the popular vote by three million votes probably the peak of its popularity and it is representing a small minority of the country in terms of views on domestic and foreign policy and you know as mr. comas been pointing out the last few days we simply can't put the fate of the country much less the whole earth in the hands of this one guy so we've got to do whatever we can to pull back from the brink around the world we this is a moment where we need the wisest possible leadership not not the most foolish leadership that there is this is an individual who is assaulting our democracy on so many levels like many of you I've spent my career promoting democracy and human rights around the world I never thought I'd have to do it here at home but our democracy is at risk not just on the foreign policy and the potential the military first approach as opposed to diplomacy first I look at it as a scene at the end of The Wizard of Oz when Dorothy finally gets to the wizard show that's going on there and he said don't look at what's going on with that man behind the curtain I want to know what's going on behind the curtain because it frightens me we're trying to privatize public education and Visser eight are are EPA trying to essentially run the gambit the the playbook the dictators around the world have had we're beating up on the press corruption and trying to eviscerate our courts but it's not gonna work here I am so proud of the American public standing up to this presidency look at our press they're fighting him look at our courts they're fighting him and the American people are gonna send him the strongest message in November that this is wrong and we know what's right you can feel this wave of taking it back across the country women are running Emily's this was working with a thousand women in 2016 they're working with 34,000 women this time 34,000 women and those kids those kids there's four million of those kids who are seventeen now and who are gonna vote in November and it is a movement like I've never seen and on the foreign policy front I have great fear because they've he's Donald Trump is kicked out the the voices of reason around him but I do think the American public and the Congress are gonna say no and he it's always whoever was the last person to talk to others in the room they're going to all of a sudden get back into TPP it's a little late we're gonna renegotiate NAFTA so we'll see what he does in the Iran deal but I think it's the the voices of the American people standing up are making a difference so be loud be active go vote and flip the house to that point as much as this president wants to feel he's the king of this country he's not and there are checks and balances in our Constitution and in our Congress ken can play a role even in the minority and if he wants to assemble a War Cabinet he doesn't get to put whoever he wants into those positions and Pompeyo will be the first one that's voted on Rand Paul has already said he's gonna vote no so there is bipartisan potential rejection of his nominee for Secretary of State and I know those of you who are staying here on Tuesday to lobby with J Street will be asking senators vote no on Pompeo and if all of the Democratic Democratic caucus with Democrats join Rand Paul that's enough votes to stop a Secretary of State nomination it would be a historic moment it's an uphill battle but I think it will send a signal that some of these views of being you know pro of regime change in Iran North Korea the anti-muslim rhetoric the anti-lgbt rhetoric the Global gag rule you know on steroids I mean these are things that are outside of the mainstream foreign policy that we should not accept and I think as citizens we can stand up with J Street and 180 other groups that have opposed Pompeii owes nomination and really send a signal and I think it's important to do it even in an election year that's my commentary one more question I do want to we do want to get to let me ask one more question and then this is your warning that you should start thinking now of your questions we are gonna go to audience questions we have a microphone in the center of the room and the normal caveat that please don't give a speech give a question have it end in a question mark and we'll try to get to as many of those as possible but it was something that came up in the last panel for those who are here Mika pointed out from Third Way you know the long-standing gap between the Democratic Party in the Republican Party in terms of who you trust on foreign policy you know the so-called mommy and daddy parties images of the Democratic Party and that there's been a couple times where we've we've broken through but over the course of 40 years that's a pretty consistent thing and it's a something that she fears may impact us even in good elections coming up so I guess I'll ask I'll ask you as someone on the campaign trail how do we how do we break through how do we narrow that gap and how can someone like you with such a deep and rich foreign policy background be a good messenger on those messages it's one of the things that drive me absolutely crazy having worked on foreign policy campaigns for the last thirty years and certainly after the biggest debacle we made in going into Iraq that that still persists is a failure in the democratic party to try and put our message out more coherently I mean we're not as good as the robot messaging and I love that who would want to be part of a party that did that but I think that it's it's the same thing on the narrative on fiscally conservative when's the last time a Republican balanced the budget and this tax cut that we just got you know 1.5 trillion dollars added to the deficit and having watched Bill Clinton balance the budget and leave a surplus it was painful to see it squandered away and we're back to square one so I think Democrats have to be a little bit more rigorous about what is our message the Republican you know goes from president's tweet to Fox News to the members ear and we need a little bit stronger more honed message of where the party that keeps America safe where the party that keeps us safe and it's gonna have some opportunities there I don't know what's going to happen in this summit in North Korea but it's not going to solve the problem they as I said I'm worried about Iran and Syria is increasingly a major threat to the US interests and to Israel's interest in the region so I think we need to be much more vocal about we are the party of security safety and will stand up for American values and I think that resonates with the American people so I think we all have to get there May it does matter who's in the White House in terms of our own security but let me just add to that I think that we need to hone the message it's true but the messages is reflective of what the program is and I think we need to hone the program the politics that create the message in 2016 Donald Trump ran to Hillary Clinton's left on a whole bunch of issues when he went to Pennsylvania in Ohio and Indiana and Wisconsin he was attacking the free trade agreement saying that the Democrats have sold you out with NAFTA and GATT in TPP he was attacking the Iraq war and Hillary Clinton's vote for the Iraq war he was attacking her on Wall Street there's a lot of confusion in the public about where the parties stood on different things we have to make clear that we recover our roots as the Progressive Party of the New Deal that built Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid and the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act we built the last half century of progress for America and that's where we clearly have to stand and we need a program that continues in that tradition and the message will go out to the people that the Democratic Party is here to stamp for the vast majority of Americans and not for the 1% that made off with the trillion and a half dollars in the tax bill I said on the floor on Friday I said that they came to town saying that they were gonna drain the swamp they actually moved into the swamp and they drained the Treasury instead all right we're gonna go to audience questions starting with that Whitten yes I want to make a short comment on the way we frame the objectives of J Street because I feel the point of J Street isn't to criticize certain policies of the Israeli government but to explain to our policymakers in our country that we've been dissatisfied with US policies that do not effectively advance a two-state solution and promote our values in resolving the israeli-palestinian conflicts as a J Street member since the inception my interest has always been to criticize my own government's ineffective policies and that's why I've been with J Street that's a very good point Larry go ahead I'm standing here looking at the J Street sign that says a political home for pro-israel pro-peace Americans and since I've been involved with J Street the two-state solution and our advocacy for the two-state solution has basically been the mantra yesterday Peter Beinart got on the stage and said the two-state solution is on life support and we have to come to grips with other issues I've always felt that J Street was a home for values based Jewish Americans on a whole broad range of issues where we can state our honest opinions without being thrown out of the room if we say the wrong thing so my question is as we look toward the next 10 years and the landscape on the ground and the issues we're facing today most of the conversation today has been about Trump and policies not about Israel and I think and would like to know how you feel about J Street redefining and perhaps rebranding itself as a home for values you know people in the country who define themselves in terms of our values as opposed to in terms of victimhood and our external vulnerabilities as other pro-israel organizations do I'll answer why not ah look I think that you know oh I'm sorry uh because look we created J Street because there were millions of American Jews that felt our voice was not being heard in Washington and one of the reasons was because of the distortion created by groups on the right around the Israel issue and most of us come here and Drive and care deeply about Israel its future in a two-state solution and that's never gonna not be a part of what J Street does but that doesn't mean the J Street can't make sure that our voices aren't heard on a whole host of issues that we care about because we are a political an advocacy operation built to lift up voices that were just not present in the wash in conversation they represented the majority of the community so I think it's a both/and to the Larry question and sorry is moderator dance a question but I'll jump in so you don't have only one answer on that but I think that I mean I I was involved in discussions when Jay Street started as well and it was very much on the Israeli issue but it was also a broad values issue and look at your mantra right now his voice for today vision for tomorrow so I would absolutely encourage J Street to be a voice for democracy and human rights throughout the United States and the world it is important and all of our interests in Israel are threatened if all those other things are going in the wrong direction and I'm deeply concerned about the direction that this country is taking right now and across the world the xenophobe ISM the anti-semitism when you have the you know this wave of Nazism and fascism I've got people dropping Klu Klux Klan leaflets in Daytona Beach in 2018 that's just wrong so I can't encourage you enough to take on the broader issues because they're all come back to who we are as a people and it does also relate to Israel as your initial you know Helen quote in kind so I I would welcome that suggestion I'm not on the board or part of the those who decide it but I think absolutely that should be part of the next 10 years hello hi I'm Terri Altera I'm a senior at American University um I just wanted to ask quickly on the unmake me not quickly but I just want to ask while J Street has definitely gained more influence among the Democratic Party there's still been like a few holdouts in a few tense situations where J Street has not been able to break through most recently we saw this in Illinois ster district and I'm sorry if this brings some of the panelists in in a comfortable situation which I apologize in advance where we had Mary Newman who was endorsed by J Street challenged dan Lipinski was more with the mainline AIPAC position in all that - and she unfortunately lost however as a result of her loss some people have argued that it basically reiterates a message that we can't really like go too far to the left on certain topics such as Israel and I was just wondering like what you thought of this narrative and are there ways to like counter this narrative because I know like Connor Lam got J Streets endorsement and he won his district so yeah thanks for the question I want to tell you a story about the Center in politics because I know this is sort of the the lingua franca of politics are you too far to the right to fourth left who's in the center and so on and so with the very first time I ran for office was in 2006 and I've been a law professor for my whole career I've done it now for more than a quarter century and so and I've written a you know dozens of Law Review articles and books and stuff like that so my positions were pretty well known and so when I made my announcement that I was gonna run I laid out everything that I wanted to do I wanted in Maryland and and I was running against a rather conservative Democrat who had introduced a Pro Iraq war resolution had been introduced electricity deregulation that made everybody's bills go up had been you know blockading marriage equality and so on so I laid out everything I wanted I said I wanted to pass marriage equality I wanted to abolish the death penalty in our state I wanted to restore voting rights for the former felons I wanted to pass the toughest gun safety law in America I wanted to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions and I went through the whole thing and when we came up to me afterwards she said Jamie great speech I loved your speech but one thing take out all that stuff you've got in there about gay marriage this is in 2006 city because it's not gonna happen you know it's not gonna happen everybody's opposed to it even the gay candidates won't talk about it and it makes you sound like you're really extreme and like you're not in the political center and so I had to kind of swallow hard because I was running against a 32 you're incumbent who is president pro-tem in the Maryland Senate and I didn't have that many supporters with me that day and I didn't want to offend her but I said you know thank you for telling me that because it makes me realize that it's not my ambition to be in the political center it's my ambition to be in the moral Center and that's why I'm a progressive and that's why I'm a Democrat our job is to try to find what's right the best we can and bring the political center to us even if it's not there yet politics at its best is about education and moving people there so I don't know the the details of the race that you're referring to I think that candidate got something like 47 or 48 percent of the vote their very first time running which is extraordinary that's hardly a stinging rebuke or defeat from the people and on every single thing that I said I wanted to work on in Maryland we did it we abolished the death penalty we became the first state in Union to pass marriage equality without being told we had to do so by our state Supreme Court we restored voting rights tax felons we banned assault weapons we ban high-capacity magazines right down line we got it all done and that's how I ran for Congress and it's why I ran for Congress because I think that we can actually get these things done when we get the right people in office Jason Berger is from San Diego I wanted to piggyback off of that a little bit um Haaretz had a good write-up about this this morning when they were comparing what cv leaf and he said yesterday versus what the the president chase tree you said I know Israel Policy Forum has kind of had a good write-up about this as well it seems like in many cases we look at Gaza and the Israelis are saying we're defending ourselves and you have a lot of people here in the states that are saying he has are killing too many Gaza ins as an elected official who's voting on legislation or as a candidate how can we potentially bridge that gap using legislation and using messaging where maybe this isn't all Israel doing everything wrong this isn't the Gosselin's doing everything wrong but there's multiple elements that are doing things wrong and we have to find a way to bridge that so love to hear it legislatively as also as a candidate well did thank you for the question you know the the purpose of politics of course is not to cast blame and point fingers and talk about how bad everything is and all the dangers and perils that exist but to try to find a pathway forward to try to find the light that's in the darkness and obviously if the peace process is completely frozen and at a standstill and there's no forward motion that's a recipe for disaster I was in Israel and we were in Israel in Jordan in Afghanistan the week before the marches began at Gaza and people were telling us that Gaza was a tinderbox and that there was going to be a terrible conflagration there based on you know 50% youth unemployment or higher and the terrible situation that existed obviously Israel has a right and a duty to defend itself but it also has the duty to use proportionate force in dealing with any kind of threat to the country like every other country on earth so the real issue is what we can do to get out of a situation of complete deadlock to move the peace process forward and to move the dynamics towards a real two-state solution while we're trying to respect everybody's right to peace and security and civil rights as we get there I would just add that these things are virtually well nothing's ever impossible but it's very hard to address those issues through legislation and in my experience in the Senate and the White House and the UN it really is incumbent on the u.s. to lead on these issues and I think we've got a void right now maybe the president's coming up with a plan that it will actually move things forward I actually hope they do I think Jerry Koosman is probably a little distracted right now but it's important and I think it incumbent on everyone in this room to try and keep the pressure for where is the plan what is the plan where is the president's leadership on this because we need it voids don't help in these kinds of situations and I think we need to get back to trying to have a peace plan that actually has a hope of going somewhere and I'm afraid it's going in the wrong direction right now I'm Debra Fogle from the Boston area I heard yesterday for the first time a rather horrifying acronym PEP progressive except for Palestine and I'm wondering if the candidate and member of Congress could comment on how much of a force you find that among the voters that you meet and what you think the best way of dealing with it is and I also have a question for Dan you mentioned that there are some Republicans who are looking for J Street endorsements I just wondered if you could talk about that a little bit more if you have an opportunity thank you so the what we was PEP progressed had not heard that was working so okay look um Israel exists an extremely dangerous and turbulent region there is no doubt about it and it is faced mortal and lethal threats to its existence since 1948 when it was first recognized and so and the arab-israeli conflict is obviously gone through a number of different periods of turbulence and conflict with different aggressors and different enemies and so on and so I think that you know lots of people like for example my late grandfather saw Israel very much as the underdog and is besieged and and had to put not just Israeli security first but almost exclusively in their mind that's all that they were you know thinking about today obviously Israel is a major military power on earth it also has been able to make friends with lots of the Arab states and you know other than Iran which continues to be you know the a destabilizing influence in the region as well as a huge human rights threat to its own people Israel's security is far more secure than it you know it's far stronger than it was before but look I think that the the public and especially the National Jewish community can handle both thoughts that Israel's security has got to be made effective and paramount so that it is safe as a state at the same time that the situation of the Palestinians is seriously and meaningfully addressed and that there's peace movement forward towards a two-state solution and that movement towards the two states Lou as one that solidifies is really security rather than undermines it I think people are ready to have that conversation and I think people are serious about it and understand the very complicated dynamics of the region in the history hi my name is Bennett Decker I'm a student at Columbia University first of all I want to thank you both for being here today this was really amazing you talked earlier congressman about making the moral center also the political center and I guess my question is how I know that that's a I recognizes a big question but I read the poster behind you the political home for pro-israel pro-peace Americans if I read that poster to most of the people on my campus I think they would go yeah and yet J Street has not as wide of the reach as I think the people in this room would like it to have um and beyond that I'm I'm coming from a more right-wing Israel background up until this point that I'm in the process of recovering from it's been a long road I used to be very involved with AIPAC and I think that a lot of the people who adamantly oppose and slander or J Street at AIPAC conferences would probably agree with that without the logo of the J with the arrow on top and I wonder how it is we're able to detach the stigma that exists around J Street from the work that J story actually does because I I'll be honest and I'll be blunt I think that it's lunacy to propose that the center is anywhere other than a two-state solution and I think that allowing room for people who don't support the two-state solution to call themself centrists is fundamentally detrimental to the entire project at work here and so I want to know your thoughts on how we make that happen I know that's a big question well do you want go first Nancy I would just say get more youth like you involved I was I'm a professor and I feel that you know we're not gonna funda might change the nature of this globe anymore but your generation is and I am so proud of this generation they don't question climate change they don't question what your sexual preferences they don't question anything but getting out there and doing it and they're gonna be voting in November so talk to your friends talk to your colleagues start building that movement because you can do it it's I mean J streets already built itself up ten years where it's made a huge impact but get involved and you know get some of it's up to the youth of this country to change it honestly so thank you for being here that's my answer too and I just want to add a specific recommendation because my campaigns have always been built around high school and college aged students and we're taking I I don't I don't have that I don't have vigorous opposition in my my first reelection run here although the Washington Post called me and said what do you think about your opponent I wasn't aware I had an opponent that point I said who's my opponent they said it's somebody named spring/summer and I said well I'm a candidate for all seasons so that's it but so but what I'm doing because our situation is so serious here is I'm taking the project that I've always had as part of my campaign which is called democracy summer where we educate young people about the history of social change and the role young people have played in it and we educate them about climate change and about income inequality and gun violence and so on and then we teach them how to organize it to online organizing to phone banking door-knocking voter registration and we're taking that from Maryland and we're going to be in Virginia where we helped in 2017 with that spectacular victory for the Democrats there we're going to New Jersey going to Pennsylvania which is Ground Zero because of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's great decision on redistricting and we're going to Iowa so if come to Florida well actually that's our next stop we got to raise the money from Florida but I talked to Ted deutschen the parkland students and they're definitely very interested in our coming to Florida too and we know the nancy's race a number of races there are really winnable races so this is the opportunity to do it you know we can somebody showed me a picture of some graffiti which said if you don't like the news go out and make some of your own and and that that that's up to your generation and working together we can do it Biggs Nancy's right you've gotten beyond racism and anti-semitism and homophobia you guys don't read a lot of books you read a lot of tweets but maybe we can get you guys reading some more books uh you guys are going to be the the model generation for all design my my niece said to me the other day she said Nancy I really admire your generation so Thank You Frasier why she goes cuz you know all that stuff and you don't have Siri so we're running low on time so let's take the last two questions and then if you guys can respond to both of them and any closing remarks you have i'm bruce cook a proud constituent jamie raskin my question is have you or will you sponsor legislation to set aside from the US assistance to Israel as an amount of money into an escrow account that the equally in the amount of money that the Israeli government spends on settlements roads and infrastructure in the West Bank have this legislation required that it be monitored and reported by congressional research organizations either the Congressional Budget Office or the Government Accountability Office thus bypassing the Trump administration in 2007 I worked on a similar issue in which senator Levin asked us to look at the Iraqi budget and see whether or not the United States should continue to provide assistance to the government of Iraq and I was working the GAO and we found 42 to 52 billion dollars that the government of Iraq had squirreled away some of it was being invested in US government Treasury bonds so they were receiving interest from us so I'm interested in whether or not you will be willing to sponsor this type of legislation let's take the last question and then we'll answer both so the question is legislation to put funds in escrow equal to the money that goes to settlements what's the last question first of all thank you on the panel thank you for all your good work I'm a Democrat have been my whole life give a lot to democratic causes I'm also been involved in J Street from the very beginning I'm also an opinion researcher and I live in Massachusetts but I grew up in a Republican district so I understood before the election that there was a lot going on that wasn't being understood by the Republican by the Democratic Party I also watched in horror as the Democratic Party shot itself regularly in the foot despite all the horrible things that you know this ignorant sociopath we have as a president now did there was lots of stuff that went on yesterday Peter Beinart said in a moment of anger if Chuck Schumer doesn't respond to what we feel we have to get rid of Chuck Schumer and there was a lot of clap for that that to me signals again what I fear which is what you sort of talked about that somehow the Democratic Party doesn't get across its message that somehow the Democratic Party involves itself in internecine kind of conflict how do we prevent that how do we focus on what's important to be quite frank about issues of Israel right now in this upcoming election I'm desperately more concerned about near Gorsuch about health care about the environment of my country then right now I am concerned about J Street issues and I want to know what the Democratic Party is going to do to win and prevent itself from killing itself as it regular engaging in fratricidal kind of crap that has impeded us in the past one thing I'll say on the last question there I've worked on as I mentioned earlier I'd worked on four presidential campaigns and the party leadership has to cover from the left to the right the blue dogs to the extreme left and so you kind of get mush but when you have a presidential nominee that's the person who drives the agenda and it's different than the way the Republicans do it because they just take their orders in salute and so you have to look at what is the Democratic Party leadership gonna look like in 2020 and there are so many fantastic candidates this president is going to be a one-term president we're going to take back the house and 2018 and take back the White House in 2020 with a narrative that answers your question who that's going to be from Joe Biden to Bernie Sanders to the young Joe Kennedy and the mayor of Los Angeles we have so many great candidates that are running but until you have somebody who can grasp that narrative it's Bill Clinton did it in 92 Barack Obama did it in 2008 it's really frustrating in the meantime but you're gonna be I think ecstatic about who the nominee is in 2020 and they're going to drive a message that is clear and value-based and putting us back on the right side of history again having veered so far off to the wrong side I'm very bullish about where we're headed in this country [Applause] so well let's see first about the escrow fund thing by all means bring me bring me you know your your bill your legislation on if anybody's working that I would love to take a look at it I should tell you and something Nancy will discover when she comes to Congress we're very committee focused so I am NOT on the Foreign Relations Committee I'm not an Armed Services Committee I'm on the House Judiciary Committee I'm on the Committee on Government Oversight and Reform and so you know any proposal relating Mideast is going to have the most success coming out of the Committees of jurisdiction also that my only other political caveat for you to think about there is that I have seen so many proposals as I've gotten to Congress come in that immediately become polarized and divisive that are on particular components of what's going on in the region I would love to see something that can bring everybody together to get us back on track towards the peace process in the two-state solution and maybe that's it I don't know whether it's it or not so on the political question I don't know where my friend is who is asking that question but there yeah thank you for that question I think it's the essential one that we have to answer over the next seven seven or eight months but let me tell you the signs are great and I'll tell you why because I know how Republicans win Republicans they don't have voter registration drives at country clubs okay they just go register okay they raise as much money as they can from Koch brothers and you know all of the different sources and then they spend it on propaganda to drive fear and anxiety in the public okay we can't be the mirror image of that we're not we cannot and should not be able to win by raising as much money as possible and going and spending on TV Democrats win when Democrats organize and go door-to-door and we did it in Virginia and we have a Democratic governor and Lieutenant Governor and Attorney General in Virginia now we did it in New Jersey we did it in Alabama where we beat Roy Moore and we have a u.s. senator Alabama we did it in Minnesota we did it in western Pennsylvania with Connor lamb people running and working locally coming together the way that people did in Connor lamps district he was he was sworn in this last week and talked about how the law all these labor unions that had always been fighting and divided it came together for him to say we are gonna get behind a candidate who stands up for America's middle class for Social Security for Medicare for Medicaid for the things that America's built so I think that we're in the process of doing that and I think that the indivisible groups that do the most good all of these pop up talk villians civil society groups that have formed since Trump is elected have shown us the way organize show us that you're serious okay and it's not just a question of giving money into consultants and pollsters and coming back with a few magic words that's not the kind of politics we're fighting for we're fighting for a progressive politics where people are in motion all over the country where people get into office are accountable to people voted for them and we're making progress together so I think that we're in the middle of it it's happening I put in a 1 final plug for a democracy summer because I think that we've got to invest in the energy and the idealism of the young people connect them to prior generations who have made so much good stuff happen and I will close by quoting my favorite Tom Paine who said and I'm gonna just update the language a little bit for modern sensibilities but he said these are the times that try men's and women's souls these are the times that try our souls the summer soldier in the sunshine patriot will shrink at this moment from the from the service of their cause in their country but everyone who stands with us now will win the love and the favor and the affection of every man and every woman for all time tyranny like hell is not easily conquered but we have this saving consolation the more difficult to struggle the more glorious in the end is our victory that victory will be ours in November but that seems like a good note to close on the national thank you again to our panelists then Susan Rice our former national security advisor will be speaking in the main ballroom in about seven or nine minutes so make your way over there and thank you all

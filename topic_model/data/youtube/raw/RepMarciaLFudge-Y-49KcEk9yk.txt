country at this time I yield to my friend from Ohio the new ranking member on the committee on Subcommittee on childhood education childhood elementary and secondary education miss fudge I thank the gentleman for yielding and I thank you mr. speaker more than twenty one percent of American children live in poverty more than 15 million children live in food insecure households in fact households with children are more likely to be food insecure than those without in my home state of Ohio 16.9 percent of households experience food insecurity in Ohio's rate is higher than the national average of fourteen point three percent programs that affect child nutrition such as National School Lunch Program the National School Breakfast Program and the Summer Food Service Program are essential tools in the fight to end child hunger access to healthy foods during the school day and throughout summer feeding programs is essential to helping children thrive both academically and developmentally the improving child nutrition and education act would increase the burden on schools with new verification requirements and increased community eligibility thresholds or CEP I represent one of the nation's most impoverished districts with nearly 200,000 people living in poverty out of 435 districts and the District of Columbia my district rakes ranks 400 20th only 16 of the districts in the United States fare worse than mine if passed the changes to CEP alone could result in children across the country losing access to free and reduced-price meals at school and that is unacceptable mr. speaker the bill fails to make critical investments in the summer meal program Mills served through the summer feeding program may be the only one some children have in a day if the sponsors of the bill truly wanted to improve child nutrition they would invest in summer meals to ensure eligible children do not go hungry during the summer months as we move towards reauthorization we must strengthen and expand child nutrition programs our children's health and education are not budget saving gimmicks I firmly believe that any attempt to reauthorize I reauthorize child nutrition programs must improve access to healthy foods year-round this bill does not even come close to meeting the minimum requirement we must engage in bipartisan conversations about how to best meet the needs of all children but I think again the gentleman for yielding

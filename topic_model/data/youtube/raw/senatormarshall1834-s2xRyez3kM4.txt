madam president senator from kansas at a time when vladimir putin is killing ukrainians my democrat colleagues want to kill more unborn american children for any reason up until the moment the baby takes its first breath up until the moment the baby takes its first breath indeed this bill should be called the abortion on demand until birth act this is the most egregious horrific attack on the lives of unborn children and the health of moms in american history in fact if my democrat colleagues had their way this baby that i delivered years ago could have been murdered aborted the moment prior to the caesarean section listen just for a moment what this bill would do number one it goes far and beyond roe v wade by invalidating state laws that protect the unborn child and the health and the well-being of moms it would likely lead to taxpayer-funded abortions at home and abroad it will tie up faith-based hospitals in courts for not offering abortion services this bill fully blows open the door to sex-based abortions it eliminates the requirement for informed consent or parental consent and eliminates conscious protections and i can tell you as a physician myself i wouldn't be surprised if half of the medical students in the nation half of the nursing students in the nation would quit medical school or nursing school if they were going to be forced into participating in abortions this bill is a total regard disregard for women's health instead of the standards of a surgery center this bill would allow for these services to be offered in a garage or a back room apartment rather than the standards of a surgery center and the bill provides the right to provide abortions by any health care provider no longer would it take a physician to do abortions it would allow nurse midwives nurse practitioners and physicians assistants to do abortions madam president i had to take care of women with a miscarriage at every gestational age and this is not a job for a nurse midwife a physician assistant a nurse practitioner before we would let residents take care of this type of a miscarriage they would have went through four years of medical school and most likely were in their second or third year of training before we would have entrusted them to this to this type of procedure again for a woman who had had a miscarriage the risk of infection of hemorrhage and creating infertility are too great this bill would allow states to res to to go unrestricted any type of telehealth abortions abortion by phone in my opinion it's malpractice to prescribe such a medicine without examining the patient seeing how big the uterus is seeing what the size of the baby is this procedure is wrought with complications i'm the person that had to take care of those complications wichita kansas was one of the homes doing the biggest abortion clinics in the country and just two hours down the road was great then america and time after time patients would show up in our emergency room with complications from the procedure or this pill i never i never ever imagined when i came to the senate that i'd be fighting harder on the senate floor to save the lives of moms and babies than i did in the emergency room and the delivery room before i close i want to say a heartfelt thanks to all the pro-life advocates across the country who work so hard especially those folks that are part of kansans for life and all the pro-life advocates in kansas who have worked so hard to pass previous legislation to protect the lives of moms and unborn babies that this bill would wipe out with one one swoop and i'm so proud of the kansans for life and their advocacy for the value of them both amendment again protecting the life of the mom and the baby but our work's not done yet we can't let up we've got more work to do and i can promise you all i've only just begun to fight to protect the lives of unborn babies and protect the health and well-being of mothers i urge my colleagues tonight to vote no on this most extreme anti-life legislation thank you madam president and i yield back

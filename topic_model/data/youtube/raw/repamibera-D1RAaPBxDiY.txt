the secretary terror for Kerry for joining us today yeah we don't agree on a lot in this town but I would say certainly on this committee throughout Congress and i believe the the administration and to quote your words we all agree on one issue which is Iran must not and will not acquire a nuclear weapon I think there's general consensus on that he on Saturday the president when when being asked Saban Institute would he envisioned the final agreement might look like he talked about an agreement that would let Iran enrich enough nuclear material for energy but with enough in the way of restrictions to assure the United States and Israel that it could not produce a nuclear weapon i think i'm quoting that correctly when asked this chances of success of getting to that agreement what the president I wouldn't say it's more than 5050 but we have to try I think we agree that we should try because the outcome of failure is probably one double that we don't want to see but given Iran's history you know many of us in this body on this committee and myself personally remained very skeptical and certainly as you approach the negotiations you've expressed the healthy set of skepticism as well but again we have to try any agreement that that we enter into has to and again I think to quote you it has to halt their progress and roll it back and it has to lengthen the time to nuclear breakout so with this model of test and verify how can we guarantee that you know that they aren't continuing to enrich they aren't continuing to enrich above the three percent threshold or above the fiber that it's really good and do yeah within the context do they understand how skeptical members of this body are and how you know if there is any backsliding you know we've already in a unanimous way supported increased sanctions over in the Senate you know they're probably very close to you know if there progress how close they are how close they are how how skeptical we are within this body about their intentions and yeah well look the answer is that the purpose of our first step is to know with certainty what they're doing and they have said to us maybe that is part of their proper to us if they say it's going to be a peaceful program they say we will allow you unlimited access we will allow restraints we will make these things happen and that's sort of what we have to put to the test now now we will now have access to this secret underground facility we haven't had that that's a big deal we will now have access to know tons and we will know what they're doing there we will have sufficient access to the heavy water reactor now as we the road here they're going to have to be built in very significant intrusive verification mechanisms so that we know to a certainty when I say to a certainty you know Prime Minister Netanyahu's going to sit there and say to us and others King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia the Emirates you know Mohammed bin Zayed they're going to look at us and say are we really protected and we have a responsibility as an administration and negotiated agreement where we can come to all of you and withstand appropriate scrutiny of what the framework of this agreement is does it answer the question that you know what they're doing does it give you adequate insight on going is it possible for them to somehow be cheating on you and you don't know it is there a way that you can you know fail-safe guarantee that there's no hidden enrichment taking place is there a guarantee that you're able to say this program is to a certainty a peaceful program now as I said there are other countries that engage in peaceful pro and we have inspectors and inspection and in level of intrusion it'll take around a period of time obviously where that's going to have to be greater for them why because of the record here because of the history that has raised these sanctions to the level they are that has brought the global community together in this effort and and it's up to Iran really to decide how fast they want to prove this and how far they're willing to go to make it clear that it is certain if it isn't certain we have a problem

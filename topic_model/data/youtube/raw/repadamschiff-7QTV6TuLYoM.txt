us who better to ask than congressman adam schiff of california he led the prosecution in the first impeachment trial of donald trump he's the chair of the house intelligence committee and author of midnight in washington chairman schiff thank you very much for coming back to the sunday show it's good to be with you well chairmanship you are never far from donald trump's mind let me play what he had to say about you at yesterday's cpac whatever that was like adam shifty shift where do you meet people like this he actually made up a story about my phone call with the president of ukraine who by the way is a brave man he's hanging in he's a brave man now chairman chef you're used to the you're used to the name calling but this idea that that phone call with president zielinski was a perfect phone call is ridiculous isn't it it is ridiculous and you know as you say just a reminder for folks of what that first impeachment was about uh first of all it's important for people to recognize that ukraine has been at war with russia for a long time uh back during that impeachment there were ukrainians fighting and dying every day or every week at the hands of russia and russian-backed separatists and at that time donald trump was withholding about 400 million in military aid to ukraine in order to extort the same president zielinski of ukraine uh into helping him smear his opponent joe biden uh he cared that little about ukraine its future its democracy that is willing to to just use that country withhold its military support to get that political help uh and and so if you were president today uh you know again he would view ukraine as is assembling uh simply a disposable tool in his hand uh to better himself with with putin who he so admires he would be calling putin a genius as he is today and you know god help the people ukraine if he were the president right now talk about how important it is to have the united states the european union and nato in lockstep in pushing back against russia because that when donald trump was president that was not assured no it wasn't at all uh he was you know donald trump was busy during his four years denigrating nato uh isolating us from our allies it would have been a very different world uh if the united states right now wasn't able to rally nato and europe together to oppose this russian aggression uh i you know i have to give hats off to the by the administration as jen saki was saying in persuading europe and her other allies to join in really unprecedented sanctions against russia something that you would only have to point to iran as the only other example of maybe north korea of even stronger sanctions regimes uh cutting them off their their central bank and their other banks uh employing the swift uh system and uh you know essentially divorcing them from that system with respect to a lot of their banks uh the the abundant military financial aid we're giving ukraine it's really astonishing how the world has come together to oppose this naked aggression by putin you know not to another thing that uh donald trump said yesterday in that speech he of course had to talk about the january 6 select committee you are a member of that committee um he called you all a collection of quote unquote thugs he accused you guys of persecution that's a quote from him of him and his family he called it a witch hunt any of that true of course not but this is a continuation of trump saying that russia was a witch hunt that ukraine was a witch hunt that january 6's which i'm lucky he takes the position that the election itself was the insurrection uh and that the the january 6th attack on the capital was somehow legitimate in his upside down world uh this is how he views things but but these are not disconnected uh what's going on in ukraine and and donald trump's presidency and his attacks aren't a democracy we're in a struggle a global struggle right now with the future of democracy putin recognizes that as we do ukraine poses a real threat to putin because ukraine has the potential of being a thriving democracy on russian borders giving an example to the russian people why they don't have to live under the despotism of vladimir putin donald trump was weakening ukraine and he was weakening the united states on our own democracy in this in this struggle this global struggle over whether we're going to be an autocratic world or a democratic one so these these phenomena are not disconnected from each other they all go to the the future of our democracy two quick questions chairmanship before i let you go as chair of the intelligence committee how concerned are you by the news from the national archives that among the papers taken by donald trump from the white house were classified as some of them even more stamped top secret well it's very concerning and the fact that as is being publicly reported some of those documents may be so highly classified they may be even compartmented which it means only very small numbers of people can see them and they can't even describe them according to public reporting in a public document even in a veiled way that's very concerning and of course what really leaps out at you is the hypocrisy of donald trump for years attacking hillary clinton over her emails and what does he do he brings boxes of documents some uh at the perhaps highest levels of classification it just grabs you by the throat the sheer hypocrisy of it all and uh last question as a member of the january six select committee can you tell us when will televised hearings start i think they'll start within the next couple months uh certainly i hope so uh what we're trying to do is uh have a series of hearings uh that tell the story of what happened on january 6th and what happened in the run-up to that terrible day all the multiple lines of effort to overturn the election and there's a natural progression we'd like those hearings to take place in but we want to make sure that we can get our interviews and our depositions largely out of the way before then so there's nothing disclosed publicly that would in any way undercut what we're doing in these depositions congressman adam chef chair of the house intelligence committee member of the january 6 select committee thank you as always for coming to the sunday show thanks john

five minutes thank you madam chairwoman for holding this meeting I'd like to start by thanking my co-chair from California Doris Matsui we've worked on the spectrum caucus together it seems like every meeting we have here we talk about spectrum but it's so important and I just want to point out in the right bomb act there was also just nuances of technology policies amazing we had that we had actually put in there the spectrum auction deposits act just so they could deposit bank deposits for selling of spectrum that was asked for by chairman pie and the chairwoman was great to work with us and have this in the mark so that we can move forward and appreciate you doing that I'm also pleased with the Commission's work on mid band license and unlicensed bands that can help us keep the us on the cutting edge of 5g rather than letting China or any other person try to beat us to that so mr. forte and I'm Stu mr. Aiken I might ask you to comment but the question for mr. Ford I but if you would come in starting with the spectrum question I know that you're trying to provide service for unserved areas by using fixed wireless technology and you say in your testimony that you need access to more spectrum in order to to accomplish that charter is doing similar things in Kentucky so thanks for your efforts in for mr. 4t mr. Aiken how much spectrum do you think is needed for fixed wireless and what will be the results for consumers and what can we do on this for what more can we do on this front start mr. 40 and then I mean certainly you know access to more spectrum most importantly you know the type of spectrum that works best for our customers and our people in in rural areas so you know we need to make sure that the spectrum that is offered you know provides interference you know protection out there know the c-band has been talked a little bit about today but we are of course an existing cable television provider and we use that see ban to provide television service to tens of thousands of customers across all the all the states that we serve and that's the only option that we have so if we were to look at that band for fixed wireless we need to make sure that that is also protected and one of the bands that that isn't being used as much in our area is the 2.5 the educational broadband and one of the reasons we really like that spectrum is because it's able to go penetrate dense forests tree lines things like that and get through those those obstacles and obviously it does have a certain educational benefit I mean I live in a very rural area my kids go to a school in the country five miles from my house and I'm amazed even at their their young age how much work that is you know destined on having that that good reliable internet connection so yeah I think we need more spectrum and in all these areas to accomplish the project accomplish it but let's make sure it works for everybody thank you Mr Aitken thanks for the question congressman yeah I would I would echo what what mr. 4t said were we're looking at a lot of mid band spectrum so the same sort of spectrum bands that that mr. 4t mentioned the EBS spectrum at 2.5 gigahertz the 3.5 gigahertz spectrum the CBR s band which the FCC is currently considering as well as the the 3.72 24.2 spectrum band at that mid band spectrum has has great characteristics to be able to you know go a long ways and carry a significant amount of bandwidth which is which is perfect for radios that have to go many miles to houses in in rural America it's another concern and I have a district that could be a little bit of Bob lad I just said his as flat as a table some of the best farmland in the country and I have some that doesn't have the mountains quite that that my fervent organ has but beautiful mountains and lakes and a mammoth cave anybody wants to visit is there as well so it's a beautiful place but it is rule and also has suburban and urban I live in Bowling Green which is kind of a boom tied in with the work our chairwoman's done in Middle Tennessee to make that area such a boomtown we're kind of tied in with that I'm an hour from Nashville and if you look at mapping so I'm talking about if you look at my you would say we're Bowling Green is covered with broadband and we have some friends from out here from connected nation who's a local hometown group who does the mapping but it depends on where you live even have very rural counties that that is exactly what we're talking about but even where I live and some people won't develop they can't move forward because people don't want to buy a house at home that doesn't have broadband access moving forward so just in mapping getting more specific in mapping I think we were talking about it's just too broad to say that one County's cover or not so my question is for the panel and it'll give you much time but we're recommission recommendations you have to improve the granularity in accuracy of the data collected and what recognitions you have to improve it and sit into a coordinate with the Commission or there are other ideas by giving it to NTIA solely anybody oh we had a few seconds so one of you want to get that just a making mapping better certainly I would start with ensuring that the information is up-to-date we've recognized that given the advances in the satellite industry the fact that we do provide 25:3 coverage is not included in the current map and one other technology that I would acknowledge that I think will be useful in terms of the broadband mapping is technology that's being deployed that allows for RF mapping from space and ultimately I would recommend that that companies technology they're launching their first three satellites this year because it'd be considered to be able to identify where there was actually a signal rather than just identification of hopes that there was a signal thank you and I'd rather tell you better miss Matsui youngman's Thank You mr. chairman thank you for holding this emitting and think you all for being here this first one's for commissioner all Olhausen last Congress introduced it was HR 53 15 which is the clear act which we had a serious part of a series of bills that we put forward on Commission process reform and I think it was almost a year ago that the Commission announced itself that it was going to look at a announced a set of reforms for consumer protection investigations and was reportedly looking to reforms for competitive investigations as well has there been progress made so yes yes there has been progress that's been made so we had our civil investigative demand reforms that I talked about at the beginning of my testimony that tried to give recipients clearer information and better guidance we also reduced the the time for a civil investigative demand gave a little more time to respond we've gone through under my leadership and we closed a number of investigations but one of the other things that we did is we went through and looked at all our data security investigations the ones that and privacy the ones that we closed and we distilled from that lessons about what steps companies had taken where we found it gave reasonable security and we issued that an updated guidance called stick with security it gave us ten additional lessons to supplement or start with security brochure okay well thank you and mr. chairman do you have any comments on the issues the committee should be considering and just terms of process reform as well of a process also on the on the on the competition side hmm so one of the things that's been reported publicly is that the merger investigation seemed to have gotten longer at least according to some measures so one of the things we're looking at is actually tracking developing any tracking mechanism to see how long they are in fact taking and why they are taking as long as they are and then allow us to determine what we can do to make them more efficient and less burdensome thank you very much and I'm most shift gears to the chairman as well I know that we we have it's pretty good with older folks we've advertised and talked I mean our office to try to put out when somebody calls you never give your any information over the phone hey we're your bank we need to fix your account or whatever if we do that but the concern that I have is these these fake websites when you go online and you're seeking it the information and you're trying to engage with it a hotel chain or to get a reservation or whatever and you got to give information to confirm rental-car any of that though any consumer actually retail business so just just interested in how we know the identity of a website one is there how could its committee I know the committee is looking at how websites are identities confirmed and if your question is what tools can consumers use to confirm they on a real website where they intended to go instead of a phishing site and as the green I think it's the green lock padlock that should be next to the site is that secure is that something we should look for oh anything I want it to anybody that's in that area look for that talk about that journey talk about secure websites is a under that here okay yes that's not congressman if I may just very briefly you had asked about other process reforms I think I would be remiss not to bring up the Sunshine Act all that law has a really great name the way it operates today it inhibits our ability as a commission to talk to each other and so I just forward that for your consider how how's that detrimental a well I'm just I'm not challenged I'm asking to view sure so an example of you would like to talk with each other three of us want to talk together about an important issue or four of us want to talk together unless we you know of Commission business unless we publicly notice it in advance we can't meet and while there are some really important meetings that take place that are noticed the daily back and forth can also be important yeah the informal you know the ability to informally meet without having to in advance schedule a full commission meeting would be enormous ly helpful okay so it allows us to kind of work through issues much more quickly and without delay as opposed to actually scheduling a formal meeting so the idea was if you're gonna take any action that it would be noticed and and but you can't even have to vote we'd have to vote okay any actually important let's say that to be clear what we're talking about informal conversations they were taking a legal action yeah of course you can't have seen City Commission's over in a room or something like oh we got one commissions need to step other and do I talk about something happens and that's what so there only can be two instead of three up when I'm doing talking to them about different businesses I've seen that before and they literally do that they don't think of an is a sense of my other rooms they don't have the quorum or so I'm moving forward but it does seem like him and I just talk about what issues are important to the city that's not an action that's being taken and moving forward I see your point to that you'll back here much the gentleman yields back the dollars of his time and the chair now recognizes the gentlelady from New York

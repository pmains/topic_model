MR. MANCHIN: MADAM PRESIDENT? THE PRESIDING OFFICER: THE SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA. MR. MANCHIN: MADAM PRESIDENT, I RISE TODAY TO EXPRESS MY EXTREME DISBELIEF AND DISAPPOINTMENT THAT THE UNITED STATES SENATE WILL CONFIRM ROBERT M.CALIFF. I CAME TO THE FLOOR TO URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO OPPOSE DR. CALIFF'S NOMINATION TO SERVE UNDER THEN PRESIDENT OBAMA IN THIS SAME ROLE. IN THE FIVE YEARS SINCE DR. CALIFF WAS CONFIRMED, MORE THAN 400,000 AMERICANS AND 5,000 WEST VIRGINIANS HAVE DIED FROM DRUG-RELATED OVERDOSES, AND 2020 WAS THE DEADLIEST YEAR ON RECORD FOR DRUG-RELATED OVERDOSES. 1,2386 WEST VIRGINIANS AND NEARLY -- 1,386 WEST VIRGINIANS DIED FROM A DRUG-RELATED OVERDOSE. THAT NUMBER IS INCREASING WITH OVER 100,000 AMERICANS HAVING DIED FROM OVERDOSE BETWEEN APRIL 2020 AND APRIL 2021. LET'S NOT BEAT AROUND THE BUSH. DR. CALIFF BEARS A GREAT DEAL OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR THESE DEATHS. WE HAVE THE LUXURY WITH THIS NOMINATION THAT WE ARE NOT USUALLY GRANTED BECAUSE DR. CALIFF HAS ALREADY SERVED AS THE F.D.A. COMMISSIONER. WE HAVE INSIGHT AS TO HOW HE WILL LEAD THE AGENCY. DR. CALIFF'S PREVIOUS TENURE DRUG-RELATED OVERDOSES WENT UP. FIVE YEARS LATER THEY WENT UP AGAIN, AND THIS TIME AT RECORD NUMBERS. DESPITE HIS PLEDGE TO OVERHAUL THE F.D.A.'S POLICY DURING HIS TENURE AND IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING IT IT THE F.D.A. APPROVED FIVE NEW OPIATES FOR MARKET. IN THAT SAME TIME, THEY REMOVED ONLY ONE. THE WISE DR. MAYA ANGELOU FAMOUSLY SAID, WHEN SOMEONE SHOWS YOU WHO THEY ARE, BELIEVE THEM. WELL, DR. CALIFF HAS SHOWN US WHO HE IS, AND HE HAS SHOWN A COMPLETE LACK OF INTEREST OF IN ACTUALLY MAKING THE DIFFICULT DECISIONS THAT WE NEED THE LEADER OF THE F.D.A. TO MAKE. NOTHING THAT DR. CALIFF HAS SAID OR DONE HAS LED ME TO BELIEVE HE WILL OPERATE THE F.D.A. ANY DIFFERENTLY THAN HE DID DURING HIS PREVIOUS TENURE. AS IF THIS IS NOT ENOUGH, REPORTS HAVE CIRCULATED THAT DR. CALIFF INTENDS TO KEEP DR. JANET WOODCOCK ON BOARD AS A SENIOR ADVISOR AT THE F.D.A., IF CONFIRMED. DR. WOODCOCK BEARS MORE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE OPIATE EPIDEMIC IN OUR COUNTRY THAN ANY OTHER PERSON AT THE F.D.A. BECAUSE OF HER OVERSIGHT ROLE AND THE APPROVAL OF EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THE OPIATES THAT WENT ON TO RATIFIISH COMMUNITIES LIKE OUR -- RAVAGE COMMUNITIES LIKE OURS IN WEST VIRGINIA. SHE WAS ON BOARD WHEN THE F.D.A. APPROVED OXYCONTIN. IN 2014, SHE IGNORED THE ADVICE OF THE F.D.A. ADVISORY COMMITTEE THAT VOTED OVERWHELMINGLY BY A VOTE OF 11-2 AGAINST APPROVING ZOHIDRO. SHE DECIDED TO APPROVE ZOHYDRO ANYWAYS AT A TIME WHEN WE NEEDED LESS OPIATES NOT MORE. IT IS A STRONG DRUG WITH A STRONG RISK OF OVERDOSE AND DEATH. EXPERTS ESTIMATED THAT JUST TWO PURE PILLS CAN KILL AN INDIVIDUAL. THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY HAS GREATLY BENEFITED FROM THE STATUS QUO THAT PEOPLE LIKE DR. CALIFF AND DR. WOODCOCK HAVE ESTABLISHED AT THE F.D.A. IN FACT, DR. CALIFF HIMSELF JOINED THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS FOR A PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING HIS TENURE AS THE F.D.A. -- AT THE F.D.A. HE PROSPERED FINANCIALLY IN THAT POSITION AS THOUSANDS MORE DIED OF OVERDOSES. DUE TO THE CONTINUED NEGLIGENCE OF THE F.D.A., MORE THAN 400,000 AMERICANS HAVE DIED SINCE DR. CALIFF FIRST SERVED. AMONG THOSE AMERICANS WAS MS. COLE FROM MORGANTOWN. HER FATHER GRACIOUSLY ALLOWED ME TO SHARE HER STORY WITH ALL OF YOU. LAUREN WAS THE DEFINITION OF THE GIRL NEXT DOOR, A PERSON WHO IS APPROACHABLE, DEPENDABLE, AND EVERYONE SAW HER AS THEIR BEST FRIEND. SHE WAS ALSO A FIERCE COMPETITOR WITH A STRONG WILL TO BE THE BEST. THE LITTLE GIRL THAT BECAME A COMPETITIVE ATHLETE WAS SWIMMING AT TWO, TUMBLING AS THREE AND SKIING AT AGE FOUR. IN COLLEGE, SHE REPRESENTED WEST VIRGINIA UNIVERSITY AT THE NATIONAL CHEERLEADERS ASSOCIATION COLLEGIATE CHEER NATIONALS TWO YEARS IN A ROW. EVERYTHING LAUREN DID LOOKED EFFORTLESS. AFTER COMPLETING HER BACHELOR'S DEGREE IN SOCIAL WORK, SHE WORKED WITH FOSTER CARE AND RECOVERING ADDICTS WHILE PURSUING HER MASTER'S DEGREE IN SOCIAL WORK. SHE ALSO A TRUE HELPERS -- SHE HAD A TRUE HELPERS HEART. THIS LIFE STORY SOUNDS LIKE A GIRL WHO HAD IT ALL, A GIRL WHO WAS HAPPY AND CONTENT. SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL, SMART, FUNNY, ATHLETIC, WELL-LIKED BIER HER FRIENDS AND LOVED -- WE WILL-LIKED BY HER FRIENDS AND LOVED BY HER FAMILY. SHE APPEARED TO NOT HAVE A CARE IN THE WORLD BUT SHE HAD BEEN FACING AN EPIC BATTLES SINCE SHE WAS 18. ONE EVENING SHE EXPERIMENTED WITH OPIATES WITH HER BOYFRIEND AND A FEW FRIENDS. LAUREN SAID ONCE THAT SHE THOUGHT IT WAS RECREATIONAL, LIKE MARIJUANA. SHE WAS EMBARRASSED AND FOUGHT THIS DISEASE ALONE FOR TWO YEARS WHILE MAINTAINING GOOD GRADES, EXCELLING IN SPORTS AND TAKING COLLEGE COURSES WHILE IN HIGH SCHOOL. SHE KEPT THIS SECRET FROM HER FAMILY, HER TEACHERS, HER COACHES, AND HER FRIENDS. TOWARDS THE END OF HER FIRST SEMESTER OF COLLEGE, SHE HAD TO SWALLOW HER PRIDE AND ASK HER PARENTS FOR HELP. SHE SENT HER TO A PRESTIGIOUS REHAB CENTER. THEY WERE WILLING TO TRY EVERY OPPORTUNITY AVAILABLE TO THEM. LAUREN IT WAS IN IT FOR THE LONG HAUL. SHE WAS CONSTANTLY MAKING GOOD CHOICES ABOUT HER LIFE. SHE WAS WORKING ON HER MASTER'S DEGREE IN SOCIAL WORK AND KNEW THAT SHE COULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD. ON JULY 5, 2020, AFTER A TEN-YEAR BATTLE WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER, LAUREN LEARNED THAT HER GYM WORKOUT PARTNER HAD TESTED POSITIVE FOR COVID-19. THIS MEANT THAT LAUREN HAD TO SELF-QUARANTINE UNTIL SHE COULD BE TESTED. SHE COULD NOT WORK, SHE COULD NOT GO TO THE GYM, SHE COULD NOT VOLUNTEER, AND SHE COULD NOT EVEN VISIT HER FAMILY AND FRIENDS. SHE CONTACTED HER DAD AND ASKED HIM TO FIND A COVID TEST AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. UNFORTUNATELY, THERE WERE NONE TO BE FOUND UNTIL THAT THURSDAY, JULY 9. HER DAD, MICHAEL, TEXTED AND CALLED LAUREN ALL MORNING AND MIDAFTERNOON THAT DAY BUT COULD NOT REACH HER. SHE LEFT WORK TO GO TO HER APARTMENT TO TELL HER THAT HE HAD LOCATED COVID TESTS. WHEN HE PULLED INTO THE PARKING LOT, HE FOUND HER SLUMPED OVER IN HER CAR. HE IMMEDIATELY CALLED 911. HE RUSHED OVER AND PULLED HER OUT OF THE CAR. HE TRIED TO RESUSCITATE HER BUT IT WAS TOO LATE. LAUREN HAD A SLIPUP THAT TOOK AWAY HER CHANCE TO LIVE UP TO HER FULL POTENTIAL. IT WAS A SUNNY AFTERNOON WHEN SHE DIED OF A FENTANYL POISON SOMETHING AT THE AGE OF 26. FENTANYL, WHICH IS ANOTHER APPROVED OPIATE UNDER THE F.D.A. SHE WAS ALONE IN HER CAR HIDING FROM THE STIGMA OF ADDICTION. HER ABILITY TO RECOVER WAS STOLEN FROM HER. APPROXIMATELY THREE WEEKS BEFORE SHE RELAPSED, SHE CAME HOME TO TALK TO HER DAD. SHE SAID, DAD, THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM ADDICTION THAT NEED AND WANT HELP, BUT THEY JUST DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES OR A FAMILY LIKE MINE TO GET IT. DO YOU THINK THAT WHEN YOU RETIRE, WE CAN DO SOMETHING TO HELP THEM? HER PARENTS TOOK THAT WISH TO HEART AND HAVE CREATED LAUREN'S WISH, AN ORGANIZATION WORKING TO ESTABLISH LONG-TERM WOMEN'S RESIDENTIAL SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT FACILITY IN WEST VIRGINIA. LAUREN MAY NO LONGER BE WITH US, BUT HER STORY WILL CONTINUE TO INSPIRE ACTION AND CHANGE IN WEST VIRGINIA AND ACROSS OUR NATION. DR. CALIFF'S NOMINATION IS AN INSULT TO LAUREN'S MEMORY AND TO THE MILLIONS OF FAMILIES WHO HAVE LOST A LOVED ONE AT THE HANDS OF THIS EPIDEMIC, AND I CANNOT FOR THE LIFE OF ME UNDERSTAND WHY THIS ADMINISTRATION IS SO COMMITTED TO ASKING EACH OF US IN THE SENATE TO RECONFIRM A PERSON WHO HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE BUT SHOWED US WHO HE REALLY WAS. DO NOT EXPECT A DIFFERENT OUTCOME IF HE IS GIVEN ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO LEAD THE F.D.A. THAT WON'T HAPPEN. I WILL VOTE NO ON DR. CALIFF'S NOMINATION, AND I HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE PROFOUNDLY CONFIDENT OF A VOTE I'M GOING TO CAPITAL THAN I AM RIGHT NOW -- CAPITAL THAN I AM RIGHT NOW. I STRONGLY URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO EXAMINE THE DEVASTATION THE OPIATE EPIDEMIC WREAKED ON YOUR HOME STATE AND YOUR LOVED ONES AND THOSE YOU KNOW AND THOSE OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS AND THE LIVES THAT ARE LOST AND ALL THE FAMILIES THAT ARE LEFT HEARTBROKEN AND JOINED ME IN VOTING AGAINST KOH H. DR. CALIFF'S -- AGAINST DR. COY LIVE'S CONFIRMATION AND SEND THE MESSAGE TO THIS ADMINISTRATION, TO OUR PRESIDENT THAT WE NEED A NEW DIRECTION AT THE F.D.A. WE NEED PEOPLE THAT WANT TO PROTECT YOU NOT PEOPLE WHO ALLOW DRUGS TO DESTROY US. THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. -- THANK YOU, MADAM PRESIDENT.

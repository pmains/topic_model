Florin first things first what do you need to do to get the money well Keith for those who don't usually file a tax return some people will have to give the IRS some information but you can now do that on the IRS website you can also check on your payment status to see when that money is coming to you and for those who usually do file a tax return you're good but you can now go on that website and sign up to have direct deposit that could speed things up because it could take weeks more to get a paper check the money is on the way maybe it's even in your account I just received it today yes through the direct deposit direct deposit is the fastest way to get the stimulus payments from the federal government and if you don't already have it set up with the IRS there's now a place on the website to put in your information click to get my payment button first wave will be all of these direct deposits hopefully they will hit as quickly as possible and then the mail checks which will be slower and I worry about that either way you get the money congresswoman Madeline Dean says it's clear this won't be enough how long would you expect these stimulants payments to hold people we don't know you know if you and I had talked six or eight weeks ago it would have been a hard fight to get $1200 per person that would have seemed like a very lot of money now it doesn't feel that way anymore she'd like to see more payments I believe it should be a repeat payment at a minimum quarterly through this pandemic and this economic crisis and it should be measured smartly against unemployment for the money we know is coming the IRS says it plans to send you a letter in the mail fifteen days after it's send your payment as a security measure to protect against scams keep in mind that the IRS will not call text email or contact you on social media asking for personal or bank information you get bounced call asking for information and whether it Bank B if they're saying they're the IRS almost regardless you should never kind of use those inbounding calls to deliver information Jaime Hopkins is director of retirement research at Carson group he says watch out for corona virus related scams and fraudulent messages can look authentic so be careful watch me that's the way that people easily get you they say hey this is the IRS hey this is your local bank officer and we need this information and these emails look really legitimate LT and congresswoman Deane who I spoke with says not only would she like to see more payments she would also like to see this expanded to people who will not be getting these stimulus payments at all that includes college students who are claimed as dependents by their parents the parents won't get any stimulus money for kids who are 17 years old and older so these college students there's basically no money out there for them at all live in Montgomery County Bureau I'm Boren make NBC 10 News

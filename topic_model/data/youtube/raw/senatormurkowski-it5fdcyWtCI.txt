most significant memorial day commemoration that i've ever participated in or been to is here at buyers like it is a purposeful mission it is about love of country memorial day it's time for reflection a day we openly show our deepest appreciation to those men and women in uniform who served and to those who gave their last full measure of devotion you are gathering in a place that i think is about as spiritual as we could possibly find out in the trees with an extraordinary view of the great one reminding us of the land that we love the country that we serve and how important that service is and for those who have given that last full measure so that our country can not only be free but can be that beacon of freedom for others around the world it is our veterans it is the men and women who have served that have made this country as great as it is and will continue to serve as that beacon that light of freedom around the world this is what memorial day is about this is why we all take that time make that effort to stop and say thank you god bless you [Music] you

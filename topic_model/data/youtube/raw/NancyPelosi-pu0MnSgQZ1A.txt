mrs. Pelosi from the great state of California the gentlewoman is recognized Thank You mr. Levin for your compliment to my great state of California Thank You mr. speaker mr. speaker when I first heard that this legislation was coming to the floor I anticipated with some positive thoughts of yes this is the right thing to do America must pay its bills we know how to do that we want to go forward assuring the American people oh that when we decide not to default on our ledges head that we are showing our strength even though it made difficulty difficult for people to support that then I heard of that it was going to come up like this on Sunday they told us it would be up on Tuesday and that the bill is predicated on a false premise that says the Congress finds that the President's budget proposed budget of the United States government fiscal year 2012 necessitates an increase in the statuary debt about 2.4 trillion dollars well that's just absolutely not the case first of all that bill never passed the health and it never passed the United States Senate what did pass the house though was the Republican budget plan which abolish is Medicare gives tax breaks to big oil gives tax breaks to corporations sending jobs overseas a week ends of the middle class and does not create jobs and in fact increases the deficit by one point nine trillion dollars one point nine trillion dollars increases the deficit so what are we doing here today what are we doing Republicans have introduced a bill which they have now resoundingly said they will oppose so where is the good-faith effort here we are I believe in good faith efforts in a bipartisan way House and Senate Democrats and Republicans with Vice President Biden to find ways to make sure we don't find ourselves in this situation again as a mother and as a grandmother have absolutely no intention of passing any bills personal or official on to my children or grandchildren and let me say that Democrats know how to clean the debt we've had to do it before the reagan-bush debt that sent that President Clinton inherited it was a massive debt and because we took the vote for the economic a plan and to a 1993 we were on a path to fiscal soundness the last four budgets of the Clinton administration were in balance or in surplus i believe the Democratic whip mr. Hoyer addressed these numbers earlier and I associate myself with his remarks and his passion on the subject coming into the bush years President Clinton put us on a path of five point six trillion dollars a trajectory of pi point six trillion dollars in surplus one of the biggest turnarounds in fiscal this fiscal situation in our country happened under President Bush so all this talk about deficits and their immorality and the rest I agree but where was everybody when president bush was giving tax breaks to wealthiest people in our country which did not create jobs we're giving a giving away the store to the pharmaceutical industry and the Medicare Part D bill at the cost to tremendous cost to the deficit and not paying for the wars again we place our men and women in uniform in harm's way they make us the home of the brave the land of the free we want them to have what they need they want us to pay for it we owe them an obligation the future worthy of their sacrifice in that future does not contain unlimited growing debt unlimited going debt never before in the history of our country have we lowered taxes for the rich while we were at war this isn't all time first so here we are we inherit this death of the Bush administration that's why we're in the situation we're in so as our colleagues try to characterize this as we're raising the debt limit so there can be more spending no we're not we're avoiding default of the massive debts accrued during the Bush administration that's why we are here so to predicate this legislation which I really coming out of last week's thought maybe that was something I would support unencumbered a legislation so that we would pay our bills and not be a deadbeat nation instead they predicated again on a false premise the facts are these the Republican budget did pass this house the Republican budget they just want to change subject for Medicare that's all they just want to change the subject of Medicare so let's bring this up the drop of a hat in the first hours back from Memorial Day they want to change the subject for Medicare but the facts are these in their Republican budget which is the predicate for this this legislation they abolish Medicare not only that they make prescription drugs more expensive for seniors they eliminate prevention services for seniors which make them healthier and lower cost to us they do all of this while also as far as our children are concerned cutting education for our children reading teachers for a children making college more expensive for 10 nearly 10 million young adults all of this a travesty in terms of the adhan aspirations of middle-class middle-income families in our country and then to add insult to that injury they come in here with a bill that they have to bring up immediately so they can oppose it well even the Chamber of Commerce has said we're all in on the joke but just isn't that funny if you're struggling family in America hoping to keep your job your home be able to send your children to college save for the future have some confidence about your economic secured if you're senior and you depend or others who depend on Medicare to have it abolished hurts your economic as well as your health security so this is about priorities a budget should be a statement of our national values what is important to us as a country the education of our children respect of the dignified retirement for our seniors job creation that we have a moral obligation to create jobs so we have jobs for our workers and they can have their better future as well as make our country more competitive reducing the deficit we've done it once it Democrats did we can do it again hopefully in a bipartisan way under the auspices that have been created for this purpose we're right in the middle of it we come in and say okay let's introduce a bill based on a false premise and then let's all oppose it well I'm glad you're opposing it because you're opposing the false premise that you have in this bill but let's get serious let's get serious about this American people are crying out for help do you know that the tax cuts on which this deficit has grown to tax cuts to the wealth did not create jobs that increase the deficit they did not create jobs more jobs were created in the second year of the Obama administration in the private actor than in the eight years of the Bush administration so this talk that tax cuts for the high-end are going to create jobs it just didn't happen so we don't want to talk about the past we want to know what we're going to do in the future but it's important to learn from the past so we don't do it again so we're not in this situation again so as I said the thought of an unencumbered if that would be the case a bill that would come to the floor I looked favorably upon that till I saw what is in here which isn't right and and I'm glad that what hopefully it will have a big strong vote against I want to commend my colleague congressman Welsh he was in his letter he's not demanding anything he is saying let's get together and talk about how we can have passed a bill that is a clean debt limit bill that's what he's talking about why don't we follow his lead on that and get together and talk about how we can do this in a way that is clean and or at the same time has a plan a bipartisan plan to reduce the deficit so that we can do just that as we increase jobs and strengthen the middle class that thank you mr. Welsh for your leadership in that regard and I know that has been mischaracterized here but I salute you for your leadership on that score so my colleagues you'll vote the way you vote but the fact is that what is happening on this floor is not serious it's not serious but the subject that addresses is serious it's time for this Congress of the United States to get serious about debt reduction job creation and stop this assault on Medicare which is the basis for this legislation today without I yield back the balance of my time gentlemen California the Minority Leader yields back her time the gentleman from Michigan mr. Levin's time has expired

D THE AMERICAN DREAM. >> ALL RIGHT. WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. WE'LL KEEP A CLOSE AND OF COURSE LET'S TALK ABOUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE BILL NOW. DOES IT HELP OR HURT INDIANA? >> WELL, I THINK THAT OUR DELEGATION VOTED NO AND THE REASON WE VOTED NO IS BECAUSE THIS WASN'T JUST A CLEAN INFRASTRUCTURE BILL. THIS WAS NOT ABOUT SITTING AROUND SAYING WHAT ROADS, BRIDGES AND THOSE KIND OF THINGS DO WE NEED TO REPAIR IN THE STATE IN INDIANA?

INDIANA KNOWS HOW TO TAKE CARE OF OUR STATE, REBUILD OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND BE GOOD STEWARDS OF THAT MONEY AND I'M SURE THEY WILL BE WHEN SOME OF THAT MONEY MAKES ITS WAY TO THE STATE OF INDIANA.

BUT THIS IS A DISASTER OF A BILL IS A DISGRACE AS AS WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IN THIS COUNTRY TRYING TO OVERCOME COVID GET OUR ECONOMY BACK TOGETHER, GET PEOPLE WORKING A

and thanks to the ranking member um ranked member rolarski distinguished members of this committee i'm sorry that we're here today i think it's fitting to start there because it is the refusal to apologize the refusal to show basic human decency and the refusal to uphold the reputation of this house that brings us together this afternoon we're also here today because republican leadership rewarded that behavior with seats on two house committees house resolution 72 seeks to remove representative greene of georgia from her positions on the committee on the budget and the committee on education and labor i thank representative washington schultz for her leadership on this important resolution the resolution was referred to the committee on ethics but i am appearing before you today not only as a chair of that committee but also as the representative of parkland florida prior to her election representative green engaged in a long pattern of threatening and dangerous conduct against the survivors of the shooting at marjory stoneman douglas high school almost three years ago today february 14 2018. she called mass shootings in parkland in las vegas and in newtown staged false flag events she called survivors crisis actors it is important for this committee to remember why ms green's conduct is so harmful and so very very dangerous miss green petals conspiracy theories that radicalize people online these theories aren't just diluted they also advocate violence they promote harassment they dehumanize and devalue large swaths of our population based on race and on faith last year fbi director ray testified that conspiracy theories like the ones mrs green promotes are among the most serious threats to american security ms green is now a member of congress one who has publicly spouted publicly spouted racist anti-semitic islamophobic garbage as harassed survivors of mass shootings denied their very occurrence now i have i have cried with the families of parkland and i've grieved with them and and in my wallet i still to this day carry a sheet of paper with the names of their loved ones so that they're never forgotten in congress so mr chairman as we have this conversation you're right you've met you've met families we've all met the families i just want to be clear i'm here today in part because alyssa olidev and scott beagle and martin duque and nick doret and aaron feis and jamie guttenberg and chris hixson and luke hoyer and carlocrine and gina montalto and joaquin oliver and elena petty and meadow pollock and helena ramsey and alex shachter and carmen chentrap and peter wang can not be the families are still grieving as are the community of sandy hook and las vegas and too many more to name there are not words in the english language to properly describe how the remarks of miss green makes these communities feel they are still suffering they will suffer forever and this makes it so much worse because green has not accepted responsibility for her actions spreading these dangerous lies if anything she seems to be emboldened as promised that she'll never apologize she's not apologized for amplifying a call for that summary execution of the speaker of the house when promoting a rally in washington dc she called for a takeover of the capital with violence if necessary she said that congress is nothing and they should fear us they should be cowering in fear she told her followers to flood the capital flood all of the government buildings go inside these are public buildings we own them now look at where we are one month removed from a deadly insurrection if republican leaders said in response to these comments as ms green joined their ranks not enough finally this week the senate leader leader mcconnell decried ms green's uh what he referred to as loony lies and conspiracy theories and he described her as a cancer for the republican party and the country but in the house mr speaker mr ranking member ms green was rewarded with seats on both the education and labor committee and the budget committee republican leadership isn't holding her accountable for her abhorrent statements and and incitement they're sending a signal that they will tolerate this conduct that's why we're here today because minority leader mccarthy refuses to do the right thing and remove ms green from these committee assignments that give her a platform house resolution 72 is an unfortunate unfortunate but utterly necessary measure one of our basic our most basic individual obligations is to uphold the public's trust in democratic institutions including this very body where we work it would be impossible to maintain civic confidence in the integrity of the house if we were to normalize ms green's behavior we must affirm that this type of behavior is not now will not be tomorrow and will never be tolerated in the united states congress that is why i support house registration 72. i yield back

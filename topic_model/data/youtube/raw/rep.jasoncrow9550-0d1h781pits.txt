the public affairs manager at connect for health colorado i am going to talk to you about some of your health insurance options and then i will turn it over to my colleague allison summerton who will talk about the different types of assistance that are available to obtain health insurance so just to give a quick overview of what connect for health colorado is we are the official health insurance marketplace in colorado so what that means is that for anyone who doesn't have access to employer-sponsored coverage medicaid medicare or other types of coverage can come and shop on our marketplace and compare the different options side by side so there are different health insurance companies to choose from and we are the only place where you can also receive financial help to lower your monthly premiums as well as get some out-of-pocket help with your out-of-pocket costs we also have expert virtual in-person assistance available throughout the state so we have a statewide network of assisters as well as brokers that are trained and certified through us and they can help you fill out an application from start to finish and a lot of them are offering virtual assistants right now allison summertin will get into a little bit more of those details later on as i mentioned before it's we're a health insurance marketplace so you can compare your options side by side i often like to compare us to expedia or orbits when you're purchasing a plane ticket or a hotel you can see all of your options in one place this is very similar for health insurance options so as i mentioned there are different health insurance companies that you can choose from those are listed here so for these are for the 2020 plan year and in 2021 they will remain the same so as you can see we've got friday rocky mountain cigna kaiser um and then i also wanted to point out that there is a dental option to choose from so delta dental offers several dental products and then there is a link to vision services that you can find on our website as well we also have tools on our website that can help you see what your options are but also show you how much you can save so if you visit our website at connect4healthco.com and click on see how much financial help i can get we have a an anonymous tool where you answer just a few questions about your household and your income and the tool will show you what how much financial assistance you might be eligible for as well as what your different health insurance options would be we also have tools that allow you to filter the different plans based on preferred doctors that you might have or medications you can also filter by the different plan benefits so that we the if there's a specific health insurance company that you would like to shop through or if there's a specific level of coverage that you are looking for you are able to filter your options based on that so typically our customers tend to be individuals who are self-employed between jobs and that's one of the ones that we wanted to stress here today so i know a lot of folks are being laid off from their jobs or hours are being cut and are you are potentially losing your health insurance through your job and so now is definitely the time for you to look at your options through connect health colorado and you know get that in between coverage until you are able to get a job that offers health insurance we also tend to have a lot of our customers are working as contractors or small business owners or working for businesses that don't offer health insurance so a lot of we have a lot of service industry uh individuals who are able to purchase coverage through us and also just anyone working part-time this is not an exclusive list of people who qualify for coverage uh through connect for health colorado basically anyone who is a colorado resident and has a lawful present status and is not incarcerated can purchase health insurance through connect for health colorado allison will talk about the financial assistance that's available later on in the presentation and there are specific eligibility criteria for that as well if you are looking for financial help so with that i just wanted to leave our contact information here as i mentioned before there are several different ways that you can get help you can visit our website at connectforhealthco.com

service center that are available to answer any of your questions they can also help you with the enrollment process and the phone number is listed here so with that i will turn it over to you allison oh you're on mute catches me all the time my name is allison summerton i am a program manager at connect aurora we're at the aurora coverage assistance network next slide please and we are have been funded since 2013 we are a certified connect for health colorado assistance site we provide health insurance education and enrollment assistance for residents throughout aurora and east denver we work with many partners including tri county health department and the county arapahoe county and stride trying to make sure that people not only get coverage but they know how to receive good care as well using their coverage next slide please so i'm going to talk about the different programs that we assist people with in application enrollments and learning to use and retain their insurance there are different insurance programs based upon your income and family size and so for individuals with the lower income spectrum there is health first colorado medicaid it is a program for low-income families again the eligibility is based on income so it would be your tax household the number of people in the household and your monthly gross income your benefits are available without any premiums and in so some services there are very low co-pays like your connect for health insurance plans medicaid covers all 10 essential health benefits in addition it covers medicaid medicaid covers dental services for children and adults one important thing to consider for medicaid is medicaid is meant for people who are lower income in normally in transition so if you've lost your job and have no income there is no open enrollment period you are eligible to apply for medicaid anytime and as long as your monthly income qualifies within the eligibility guidelines we can help you enroll in medicaid next slide please so here are just um the guidelines that will reflective in april so basically if you're a single individual and your income is less than 1 415 you would be eligible for health first colorado medicaid and you can see there are slightly different levels of monthly income for children and pregnant women again we're happy to help you with this our contact information is at the end of the presentation so if you need some help figuring out what you're eligible for we can help you with that next slide please so the child health plan plus program is a program for children and pregnant women it is really meant for children whose parents employ provided coverage might be more expensive and not as affordable for families so there's the child health plan plus program again it is based on your household size and income and there are an annual enrollment fee not a monthly premium but an annual enrollment fee depending upon the number of children in your family again for chip there is no open enrollment period if you are in need of health insurance for your children come to us and we'll help you apply thanks like and again here is a chart and i believe these slides will be posted this chart provides information about the income guidelines for children being eligible for chip so for a person at a household of one let's say you have a 17 year old whose income would be one thousand five hundred and eleven dollars um they would be eligible for chip all the way for family income up to two thousand seven hundred sixty five dollars next slide please so sophia talked about connect for health colorado that would be for individuals whose income would not qualify them for medicaid their angles would be lightly higher financial help is available for these connect for health colorado plans as you can see depending upon your family size for a family size of one an individual would be eligible for financial assistance if their income was up to fifty one thousand dollars for a family of four that would be a hundred and four thousand dollars many people don't think they are eligible for financial assistance it's important to connect with a assistant site like connect aurora or go onto the connect for health colorado website to explore your options because financial assistance really does help you reduce the cost of your premiums one important thing i'd like to emphasize is that the only place you can get financial assistance for marketplace health insurance is on the connect for health caller website and our team at connectorwork can help you with that as well as the folks at connect for health colorado next slide please when you are in transition if you have lost a job and you've lost your employer health insurance you can enroll in a connect for health marketplace plan within 60 days of losing that coverage so if you lost your coverage on september 1st you will have till the end of october to enroll in a plan that would become effective november 1st in addition to having a job loss there are other conditions that would qualify you for a special enrollment period that would provide you 60 days to enroll in a health insurance plan and those are listed here but for example if you have a young adult who is aging off of your employer plan that would also qualify that individual turning 26 to enroll in a connect for health colorado plan the other time that you can enroll in health insurance is during open enrollment if you have all missed a window and you are not and you missed that 60-day period when you lost your insurance you can sign up for coverage beginning november 1st through january 15th and that coverage would be effective if you enrolled by december 15th that coverage would be effective january 1 so again open enrollment begins november 1st of this year just want to explain there are two different types of financial assistance there are premium tax credits which help reduce your monthly payments that you pay in premiums and we will provide that chart on the next page and the second type of financial assistance are cost-sharing reductions they help reduce your co-payments and deductibles and were are available to people between 133 and 250 in the federal poverty level the chart on this next slide displays the income that you would that qualifies you for the financial assistance so that first column your household of two and your income is under forty three thousand dollars you would be eligible for extra help reducing your co-payments and deductibles if your household of two you would be eligible for financial assistance to reduce your premiums as well as long as your income is under sixty eight thousand nine hundred and sixty dollars i'd like to emphasize that you don't have to memorize these numbers they're posted on connect for health colorado and they're on our website and if you have any questions about whether your income qualifies we are here to help you in aurora next page please we have a scheduling tool on our website at connect aurora.org and you can actually schedule an appointment for either in person or virtual assistants we assist people on zoom like this webinar we can help you apply and explain what your coverage options are over zoom as well when you schedule an appointment using the scheduling tool in connector where you can select an appointment for either in person or virtual assistants these are different locations that we offer assistance to folks and the languages that we offer assistance as well we are happy to help you just give us a call or go online and schedule an appointment and if it is a situation that we cannot help you um we often refer and work closely with brokers and can refer you for help with brokers or we'll refer you to the connect for health colorado assistance site again my name is allison somerton and we're happy to help you at connectorwear and my contact information is on the next slide thank you very much oh one more thing we are a program within the environmental health center and of course we are more than happy to help people connect to mental health services as well all right um i think that we can turn it over to ashley now to um talk about the services that she offers great uh this my name is ashley wieland and i am the director of public policy for hungerfree colorado uh i um work with an amazing team here at hungerfree who actually do the services i do the more of the policy side and wanted to fill you in on what's going on federally on hunger programs as well as give you some information uh on um on the how you can get connected with us and we can help connect you with these federal programs so why don't i um go ahead and share my screen and pull up the right thing you never know what you're pulling up right all right so um federal programs uh our hotline which i have down at the bottom of the slide the phone number as well as our website that has a lot of answers around um what's going on with food and nutrition programs in colorado and across the country and there's quite a bit um and a quite a bit we'd like to see continue to happen and happy to work with the congressman on those things uh the food program that most of you have probably heard about and know about is called that you might have used to have been known as food stamps is called snap the supplemental nutrition assistance program and this program helps and provides folks with ebt cards to buy food and so you if you're under a certain income level under 133 of federal poverty you can apply for these for that program um you do go through an interview process and have forms to fill out which that is exactly the kind of help our hotline provides and there's things that they consider like how much your bills are what your medical costs are those different pieces to qualify for snap right now with the covet pandemic and the issues happening um you used to have to go in person to apply for snap now you don't you can do it telephonically uh through the telephone and work with uh our folks and then also people everyone is getting the maximum benefit for snap so whatever um the allotment is based on um based on your family size and your income uh family size actually you get that amount so for example one person right now because of covid19 qualifies for around 200 of food assistance and that's going to be in place as long as the pandemic is a health emergency at the state and federal level so um it's really a good amount of food assistance and some people in the past may have applied and gotten you know a lot less and so don't think it's worthwhile right now it is definitely worthwhile for for folks who are facing um some hard times during um the pandemic as as the economy we're working on the economy and pieces the other another program that some of you may have heard of that um uh usually a lot of you hear about it for pregnant women especially is called wic the um special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children and this program is for low-income uh pregnant women and mothers and children under three so you want to apply and keep it right now a lot of folks don't stay in the wic program so after the after they have um the child and child's about a year old because that's when um children move off a formula but a lot of people do not know that wic can continue to provide some some food assistance in other pieces so definitely participating in the wic program and right now there's there's also waivers in place because of covid19 so um they used to require you to go in person to apply for wic right now you can do it over the phone so if you or your family qualify definitely taking advantage of that program um there's the cacfp program which is the child and adult care feeding program and those are those programs that the federal government helps cover for after school programs and senior centers um and of course during cobit 19 we can't do those in person so there's a waiver that has allowed a lot of those sites to create box meals and to deliver meals and so if you um are needing access to food and you might be able to participate in one of those cscfp programs and our hotline can help with that as well another program that's actually right now really busy is the national school lunch program right now is the time for parents to apply for free and reduced lunch and a lot of parents aren't applying because their kids are doing homeschooling they're doing school through the computer and so but actually those those applications are vital for the funding for schools that's actually how the number of children who are part of the free and reduced lunch program or how schools receive uh what's title one funding funding for their schools and so it's really important that parents apply for the program um and so if you haven't and you know and you because your children are learning at home please do apply it will help your school with it with the funding for the next year there's another program that was created because of the pandemic that was just extended by congress um congressman crow supported and voted for it and we thank him for for that it's called the pandemic ebt program and that program is for uh students who qualify for a free and reduced lunch but are not in school right now this program provides a certain amount of dollars for their families to be able to buy food and it doesn't have to be food for free and reduced lunch times but also food for dinners and other pieces so it's a really great program it was in place an application just ended for it um that basically provided 279 dollars per child in the free and reduced lunch program between march and may um and with the congress extending it there'll be similar dollars for families to apply for so colorado has received around 50 million dollars worth of funds for families to buy food through that pandemic ebt program so we're really excited to see it continue and also help some families that didn't get to enroll in it over the summer so please pay attention and i know the congressman has shared a lot of resources about it as as the application opens and when it opens again i'm sure he will and then there's also summer meal programs where parents can pick up meals and those were in place during the pandemic and through the summer and we had some waivers that allowed parents to pick up the meals it used to be the children had to pick up the meals now um parents can pick up the meals and actually on the national school lounge program and the summer meal program work pretty closely together but right now there's universal meals so um if a family needs food they can go to the school and get it and there's not a process of applying you can go the waivers allow you to go pick up food so it's um the congress has done a lot to help children get food through this and um definitely important to utilize it our hotline can help your family determine what you can qualify for you can call that number below um or you can check out our website um that colorado.cofoodfinder.org is updated to really respond and explain what's going on with food resources during the pandemic so we are here to help uh and get you connected with what what would make the most sense for your family as we all cope with this this difficult time and move forward and that's what i have for you just one side thank you ashley so i just wanted to for all participants if you have any questions you can use the q a function at the bottom of your screen and ask your questions through there and we'll take a look at those while we're waiting to see if any of our life participants have questions we have a couple that came in before about medicaid so um i'm gonna go ahead and ask those the first one is if if you lost your job and you were qualified for medicaid and you got on but then you've got a job what happens oh you're muted allison i'll be happy to take a nap take a try at that one and let anybody else add to that um if an individual if you're already on medicaid and you've gotten employer insurance the most important thing is to report go into peak and report that income change but right now because we're in a public health emergency you are not being disenrolled from medicaid for having a higher income and you will retain that medicaid until the end of the public health emergency which right now is as i'm scheduled to be at the end of january so you can retain your medicaid until the end of that phd but it really is important to keep your medicaid information up to date great thank you so one other question about medicaid is if you enroll in it you say they contact your office and get enrolled how long does it take before it's effective good question so in many cases an individual applying for medicaid can if can get a real time determination and so if you apply in the middle of the month your enrollment or your eligibility for medicaid and your enrollment usually begins at the beginning of that month and even if it takes several weeks for example if they needed verification of your citizenship or needed you to upload your social security card your eligibility when you're approved would become effective in the beginning of the month in which you applied great thank you so this is a question for sophia i think or maybe you could answer um similarly if you applied for or got health insurance through the connect for health website and you were receiving some assistance financially but then your income changes your job or you get a job and now you have employer offered insurance what do you do to either report that change or change your insurance or what should people do yeah that's a great question and it's very similar to the process that you would go through to report changes to medicaid so you would log into your connect for health colorado account update your income information let us know what your new income will be and one thing that i want to emphasize is that the income that we look at at connect for health colorado for financial health is based on your projected annual income for the coverage year that you are in so for example if you apply today we will be asking you what your income will be for all of 2020 so you'll want to report all of your income from january up and up until now and then also any predicted income for the rest of the year um and so when you do get a new job and get new income you'll report that information to us and we will re-run your eligibility usually if you have access to affordable employer-sponsored coverage then you are not eligible for the financial help through connect for health colorado anymore so we will rerun your eligibility and let you know that uh you were no longer eligible and then you would determine you would terminate your coverage prospectively so if you came in today and reported that you got a new job and that you need your health insurance to end it would end october 31st um so everything is prospective and the best thing to do is just make sure to stay on top of reporting any types of changes that happen with your household and we will rerun your eligibility and also that's why assistant sites like allison's are here they can help you report any type of information through the website and answer any of those questions for you as well great thank you so those are all the questions that i have now if anyone in the webinar has a question they want to ask you can you can use the q a function otherwise if you have any other information you wanted to share any of our presenters we'd appreciate that this is allison i uh would like justice sophia said to encourage people whether they're on peak or connect south colorado to update their income status if hours change from even a month or two in your employment or if you're self-employed and you have a bad month or you have a really good month it's really too important to keep that information up to date in your account especially for the tax credits so that you will not have to pay a lot more back at the end of the year if your income did go up for example if you're self-employed and things were really slow in june and july but things started to really pick up in september and october and november and your income was much higher it would be better to report that income change to reflect what that would be so we don't end up paying tax credits back at the end of the year and we'll be glad to help you with that thank you allison that's helpful that is a question we get around tax time when people get that information that oh now they have to pay something back so thank you for bringing that up okay well i don't see any other questions and so um i guess that's it unless anybody wants to add anything else we really appreciate you being here and taking the time to explain all of this i know it's complicated and um and so it's great that you're a resource people can contact you and we'll have that information available on our facebook page and this video is recorded so we can post it and people can watch it again so thank you so much for being with us today we really appreciate it thank you very much thank you for having us i wish everybody good health

to have the conversation that and then I
think the cool thing to talk about is that mental health is part of overall
health that it's common it can happen to Hi everybody it's Zach Nunn. I'm down here at the Science Center with Emily Richardson who is
leading the charge and helping end the stigma on mental health [discussion]. as you know
Iowa has been a leader in addressing mental health -- but we have a long ways to go. A lot of that comes through being able to help with our service providers and
specifically children's mental health. Which are all the things we're looking at tackling this year at the Statehouse but it's important to help bring this to the public So they can engage and understand. Now, tell us what's going on the Science Center what have
you guys scored here?   we are really excited to be opening this exhibit and
bringing this conversation to the community the exhibits called mental
health mind matters and it really showcases the historical impact of
mental health and mental illness and also tries to really build some empathy
experiences with Interactive's to help you show what met people with mental
illness are experiencing as well as resources to help you maybe better your
own mental health or support those friends and family that you might have
that ever need that help. yeah absolutely and it's a challenge because with a
physical affliction it's so easy to identify. With mental health it can its
prolific, yet so many people have a hard time being able to both verbalize it and
then know how best to respond so this is a very it looks like a very interactive
exhibit you've got how did the Iowa Science Center score this to come to
come here first yeah it's um it's a you know a long story with traveling
exhibits how those things come about but really we were excited to be able to
bring those conversations here we're all about being a convener for conversation
and really providing a launching point for conversation
you know we're not experts in mental health but there are lots of people
within the community that know a lot and have a lot of resources to share so we
are providing this exhibit as a launching point and then have
a bunch of community partners and organizations who are going to be
supporting us as we continue to bring this conversation even just raising that
dialogue amongst everyone to be able to come together and have it as a okay
topic to talk about because that's important so you you highlighted here a
mental illness how do we address it compliments to the Science Center we're
very excited it's a lot of work by Emily's part but hey thank you very much
and we'll put the details in the comments section

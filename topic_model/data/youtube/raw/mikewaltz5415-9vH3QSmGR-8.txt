joining me now florida congressman michael waltz he's a member of the house armed services committee and a former green beret commander congressman always a pleasure to talk to you what do you expect to see during this trip to saudi arabia and what will the u.s get out of it potentially well yeah you know that op-ed was a bit rich full of revisionist history where biden claims to have stabilized the middle east in the past year and completely ignores his appeasement strategy uh towards iran with you know yet more promises of pallets of cash uh and it it's at the end of the day if you have to pin an op-ed defending your trip uh you've got issues in terms of your narrative what do we expect to get out what i expect to be on the agenda uh is the cease-fire with the houthis in yemen greater cooperation with israel which is a good thing finally i think the abraham accords may get some some due attention and and building on that and of course he'll be hat in hand uh begging the saudis to produce more oil because he refuses to here in the united states what i hope he'd also be discussing is this is saudi arabia's growing relationship with china uh and china's growing footprint in selling them drones and all types of other weapons and reminding them who their strategic partner is uh and we're also reminding uh the saudis of the chinese very close relationship with iran uh where they pledged 400 billion dollars in security and other types of assistance uh so that's what i hope he'll be there talking about but i think the hat in hand for begging for pumping more oil is going to be first on his agenda right we've already seen um kind of a preview of this this started last summer a little a little less than a year ago when biden right out of the gate implemented the moratorium the ban on leasing oil and natural gas leasing on federal land and water of course a judge intervened to block that but by i think it was august of last year that there was a letter that was sent begging saudi arabia to pump more oil or begging opec plush which included russia this was before the attack the invasion on ukraine so again over and over they keep doing the same thing but expecting a different result yeah well you know to add to that he also sent his emissaries down to venezuela and and that really blew back on them uh in florida in particular with our south florida hispanics who who have truly lived and fled socialism uh uh really making it well known that that was unacceptable and then of course they hope to ink the iran deal so to replace american oil and gas that biden has launched his war on he wants to do it with venezuelan saudi and iranian oil and gas supplies it's just an asinine policy kagan and and frankly i don't think it's gonna work because i don't think they have the capacity uh nearly to match uh what what we could have done if we would just unleash it joe koncha jump in here with the congressman well i just find it amazing that here we have congressman jamal khashoggi who was so brutally murdered a couple years ago and president biden having the audacity uh to say that he would shun saudi arabia as a result of that murder uh when he was a candidate now that he's president and he needs oil he's going there and he's he's he's going to beg quite frankly uh for oil because he won't drill here can can congress do anything when the gop takes back the house i'm not saying if it's a win proposition at this point when you look at the numbers uh to to really expand our energy here at home our energy independence here at home uh or or can the president just veto any effort around that well i would put the president and uh i think to answer your question most directly it depends on if we if we get the senate um and or whether we have a divided congress but uh you know i think the president would be hard-pressed uh if gas prices continue as they are if inflation continues if they are to start vetoing uh common sense legislation coming out of of the congress when inflation and the economy are ranking number one two three four and five in every poll that uh that that we're running and we'll be heading into the 24 political season so look i think we could put a lot of pressure uh on this administration to get back to american uh energy independence and we're just counting the days six more months congresswoman before we go biden is reportedly thinking about recent and this kind of goes to what you were talking about earlier resuming arms sales to saudi arabia your take on that well the united states has been saudi arabia's traditional arms partner and since uh since biden put the brakes on it as soon as he came into office guess who spilled that void china has china is now selling saudi arabia armed drones china is now saudi arabia's largest oil consumer there's been discussions of actually paying for it in the yuan rather than the dollar so china is all too happy to fill that void and that is not in u.s interests that's not who we want uh as the main outside actor in the middle east uh but we've we've got to realize that you know the the cold war that i believe we're in with china we just haven't fully recognized it uh isn't just about taiwan it is being it is being fought for influence all over the world uh and then the united states needs to keep that first and foremost we quickly have seen an eastern access develop between china russia and now pulling other nations that used to be close allies the united states toward china and this was all by design clearly thank you congressman great to see you this morning always michael walton thank you

get Georgia politics real quick a poll has come out it shows bear Loudermilk and bob barr tied for first place in the 11th congressional district now here's the thing let's see it was done by well okay so this is this this this is a candidate based poll you should know full disclosure their candidate based poll 600 people Wow delve more into the bowls plus or minus four percent but dead so twelve percent for Barry Loudermilk twelve percent for Bob Barr three-point-seven percent for Trisha pridemore 2.7% by at Lindsay what oh oh so there are two poles yes and Martha zoller is Martha's also she selling me there are two poles out of the eleventh today well my oh my I had need to find the link to the other one but but here's the deal I'm backing Barry Loudermilk and the 11th congressional district if you didn't know all of the people in that race are fine people and by the way I'm a little bit upset on pressure on Tricia primers behalf I understand she didn't get a right-to-life endorsement and I don't understand why I've known her forever and she is pro-life which is just that that confuses me I that that's that's on whoever is an endorsement her true surprise more is is pro-life wonderful person by the way as is at Lindsay as his Bob Barr I don't want to disparage any of the candidates in that race they're all good but Barry Loudermilk is the guy Barry Loudermilk is the guy who will go to Washington DC and he will shake things up with his own side he's willing to tell his own side no he's not going to collaborate with the establishment he's going to fight for Georgia he's gonna fight for conservative values he's going to actually fight for smaller government as opposed to campaign you know then go ahead and raising the cost in Washington DC but here's the thing I look I like Bob Barr he's a good guy just don't understand why we need to go backwards Bob Barr was a congressman when I was a kid Bob Barr was there back in the 90s the led the Clinton impeachment why why do we need to go back where this is the thing I just I like Bob Barr but I just there's there's a bit of sadness i have in the situation because i see these members of Congress they lose and then they spend all their time trying to get back into it it's like that what was that that terrible Star Trek movie the generations with it was the one with Captain Picard and Captain Kirk and you had the bad guy and he was always trying to get back into the Nexus this magical fantasy world inside some sort of energy ribbon and you couldn't go into it because you would die but if it came towards you then you could get into it if it sailed over you so he decided a supernova Sun and blow up a planet and shift the gravity field to shift the ribbon to get himself back into a Captain Kirk died it was just it was an awful movie but this is life you like Bob bars trying to get back into the Nexus all these former congressman they just want to go back to Washington it's kind of sad

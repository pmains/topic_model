Thank You mr. chairman over here Russian officials have said they agree arms control treaties should include other nuclear-armed nations although the statements seemed to have been aimed at the inclusion of US allies like the UK and France miss Scott Muller given Russia and China's fraught recent history and physical proximity does Russia have a national security interest in drawing China into new start and other arms control treaties and can we expect Russia to take an active role in bringing China to the table it's a good question ma'am they have taken China's part in recent periods while China has been holding everyone at arm's length in this administration and saying we do not want to participate right and the Russians have essentially said well you hear what China says they don't want to participate so up to this point they have not in any way tried to press China to come to the negotiating table I do think just as you say that there are certain incentives on the Russian side for them to help get the Chinese into a process the Chinese have never had to negotiate on limits or reductions of any kind and in this in this sphere so I can see the rationale there but at the moment they have not been pressing them has the United States nuclear force posture then based on the treaties extension and certainty that it provides and if so how would a failure to extend New START impact the military's strategic stability planning how much you've affected existing nuclear modernization plans and such I would first of all I literally don't have the details because I'm not on the inside anymore but my expectation would be that we've been very much in compliance first of all secondly and it's come up a couple times I think it's really important to make sure that we have the resources dedicated to the upgrading of our in modernizing of our industry of our nuclear arsenal if you will I really don't know where that stands that was actually negotiated as a part of the the ratification process so it's not cemented into the treaty itself and it was a commitment on both sides to provide the resources and and so committing to that would put us in a position and I think as as Miss Gottemoeller has has stated put us in a position any other witnesses to actually move ahead if this thing just if this stopped I don't advocate for that because I think there are a lot lots of downsides associated with that so I think we're fully in compliance we are as ready as we are required to be and I wouldn't be overly concerned about that if I were concerned about one thing it'd be where we stand in the in the modernization oh yes that I'm just wondering how it does affect our existing nuclear modernization plans you mean if if we walk from this yes I think I mean it's it's quite frankly gonna depend on the priority for the administration it's a lot of money I think my recollection was back in 2010 the number was about five billion dollars that we needed to to put into it to commit to in the in the fit-up at that particular point in time so it's billions how much of its anat and I know we have invested a lot it would be based on the status and the priorities for the administration to upgrade and commit continue to commit resources to to the entirety of the nuclear capability Thank You Admiral Mullen mr. Myers do you believe there are any gaps in the verification regime and and if so what can we do to improve them as part of the talks floor and extension well thank you for the question um it's a hard question to answer because you don't know what you don't know but the level of confidence here in the United States on our ability to detect non-compliance on the Russian side is very very high that's number one number two over the life of the New START treaty we have no evidence of cheating on their part three and to me this is the most important the individuals charged with carrying out the verification missions were also involved in the drafting of the verification procedures and the language I commend Under Secretary Gottemoeller at the time and share him all the time for having the ditra inspectors at the table with them because it wasn't an issue of something's negotiated it's delivered to the to the inspectors and said now go do it they were fires were there at the table during absolutely so at the end of the day treaties are compromises you never get everything you want but I will tell you having talked and walked and watched these individuals do their job and exercise they were very confident great thank you my time is expired mr. Chairman I yield back

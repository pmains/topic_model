thank you for joining our patella town hall we're going to focus this one on agriculture for a host of good reasons and really excited we have a special guest tonight we have congressman glenn thompson from pennsylvania um he was in kansas of last week really excited to have congressman thompson here with us um if you'd like to ask me a question press star 3 now and to walk to watch the live video of tonight's meeting visit my facebook page or go to our website which is man.house.gov live and uh and you can tune in that away but we're really glad um we realized tonight you know we have folks joining us that are sitting on the tractor uh they're feeding cattle um they're out producing the food and fuel that really drives uh drives this country so delighted to have congressman thompson wanted him to join us tonight because he is the ranking member for the top republican on the house act committee so i get to serve on the house ag committee and he's the top republican uh which means that you know he has a really important role to play now and then thinking about next year so you know we have an election in november there's no guarantees but it looks likely republicans will win the majority of the house we're working hard to see that that happens but if that happens then congressman thompson will be the top republican which will make him the chairman of the house ag committee next year which is going to do the farm bill so our current farm bill we're in expires september 30th of 2023 so excited for you to have the gavel next year when we do our next farm bill lord willing so i invited um congressman thompson to kansas and he joined us last week and i thought we'd do a recap of your time in kansas and then turn to our viewfinder remarks you want to make but um he had some flight issues so he ended up flying actually to denver and rented a car and drove to oakley on i-70 and then drove south to garden city so got in about 3 a.m on um sunday night monday morning and was ready to go at 7 30 on monday morning and uh by the way if you'd like us we're leaving if you'd like to ask me a question press star 3 now to watch the live video of tonight's meeting visit my facebook page or my website at man.house.gov live and you can join that way so i thought i'd give a recap of what we did last monday get your thoughts about that we need to recap we did on tuesday and then go from there but monday we started off the morning by touring a feed yard we toured brook over feed yard which is the first feed yard in the state and i wanted to show gt where cattle feeding really started in our state had a great time there we then went and toured the tyson packing plant there at holcomb an important part of the ag really you know industry in our state mary went toward an active oil well that's being drilled south of garden city which is a lot of fun to see what they're doing that morning tour to farm south of garden city some new acres that were just purchased as part of that farm which was a lot of fun had lunch there i'm standing um in the in the farm shop there then with an ag bank and really heard from the loan officers and some of the members of that bank what they're seeing in the ag economy and then we met with other ag producers that night so when you think gt about last monday and your time in kansas what kind of struck you or whatever struck this whether it was his first trip to kansas and uh delighted to get to host him well tracy thank you so much and thanks for being a great friend and quite frankly an outstanding member of the house agriculture committee i mean the passion you bring uh it's as big as the big first and uh and that was a that was an important part of the trip to really see you know what i've heard about for some time actually for years and to see it in action um you know starting with uh the feedlot and uh you know just uh cattle as far as the eye could see it was it was really pretty impressive and what an operation and to hear about the issues that they were facing too and and these were some of the common themes that we heard but we started right in the morning at uh at brook over feed yards with um you know it's workforce you know and for them it was kind of it was a little different it was cowboys is what they needed and but you also needed uh people with skills because they had that feed mill the fact that they make their own feed right on um just right on the uh on the site they've been doing that for decades for the third generation now um but they need people with skills to help maintain that equipment and we heard that loud and clear um and then you know we we've all been talking for a long time about uh protein processing right and so it was great to be able to spend time with the folks in tyson uh from the with the mainstream staff and quite frankly the front some of the front line workers you know to be able to talk with him and look at what they're doing and you know and how they're you know some of the innovative things they're doing uh they're going into holcomb with where they're going into garden city with uh with a human resources office to help with recruitment and make sure they have the personnel that they need and um as we work on issues surrounding me processing it was really good to get a kind of a hands-on look at that operation of course this is an operation that uh not too long ago recovered from a pretty devastating fire yeah and to see what they were able to accomplish and how fast they were back online uh was was pretty impressive and then i think the the uh when we're at uh uh kansas state university um and i now have my purple yeah i've got my cat so everybody knows so we finished up at garden city and then we drove late last monday night everyone in the district knows this and we had a big rainstorm not everywhere in kansas but a lot of you know we had 40 50 mile an hour winds um cold temperatures a lot of rain for a lot much a lot of much needed rain and i apologize for that yeah this will be happening in my national travels everywhere i go when gt was driving in on sunday i called him and your district is in pennsylvania yes you know different terrain and he commented hey the roads here are straight and flat yeah that's just kind of how we roll yep and uh and he was uh i mean this guy he should have went to bed but he was calling to check on me because it was late at night and i assured him i was entertaining myself by driving and listening to my my book on tape which just coincidentally was called dodge city that's right yeah that's being in our category i sure was yeah so so we spent the night's line and then last tuesday i took gt to kansas to k-state uh met with new president lyndon uh met the dean of college of ag school there we also toured the wheat innovation center in manhattan met with farm bureau other different commodity group leaders in manhattan and then additionally we toured in bath which is something that you heard a lot about so what were your thoughts reflections on what we did on tuesday well uh first of all k-state is uh very impressive you know that the grain program that's been there for i don't know i can make sure that probably 16 years 70 years 70 years or more i mean it's the only one like in the country um i love the fact that they still have the old mill equipment uh which uh ocean probably doesn't look abuse anymore because of the open bullies but it's there as part of the heritage you know to uh to really interest the students and these these students all have jobs when they graduate and then of course we you know we're able to drive by the new modern mill that they have on campus um and so that was impressive i will say i'm a little uh as a product of the language university i'm a little jealous of your new president uh you have a president lyndon is i met him in my barnstorming tour of america of united states agriculture in north carolina where he was the dean of the college of agriculture and so congratulations to the trustees who who did that hiring you you've got a new university president who is uh he was flying the colors already we're in line and a half him and it comes from working on a state and was dean of their culture for ten years yeah great experience and so the the whole visit was uh was just outstanding appreciate you taking the time to uh to come out and really see our state first hand again this is tracy mancars for the big first if you want to ask me or i said question about what's going on in dc press star 3 now gt i thought i'd ask you a quick question as we gear up for the next farm bill uh lord willing you'll have the gavel going into that what are your priorities and how do you see things kind of playing out here well i think part of the priorities is being able to spend quality time uh with members just like yourself and to be able to hear from your constituents you know to be able to hear from the farmers the ranchers uh the foresters uh the the key stakeholders on what um you know what what are they seeing how is the farm bill working or not working for them you know we we're we're really behind you and it's not our fault it's we're not in the majority and uh we're in the minority and the majority party controls the agenda we did the 2018 farm bill you don't ever get exactly perfect it was pretty good but it was because we did over 130 different hearings and listening sessions we brought people to the table and i don't know we're up to about five now maybe uh tomorrow will be you know i'm not sure tomorrow really counts but uh we'll have a full committee here right tomorrow on that um on the commodity future trading corporation which is really important is not necessarily within the scope of the farm bill and and so uh you know bringing those voices from kansas and you facilitate that you made that happen and all that all the things that we learned as a part of that that's that's what we're doing right now we're preparing to govern um and uh but i do look forward to whatever point we can pick up the intensity with official hearings and official listening sessions where we we take bipartisan groups to places like you know kansas state university um and we we invite people in we have a great um hearing field hearing to hear from folks more members at the end of the day the farm bill has to work for the producers and if we're not out listening to them i share your frustration with the leadership of that not doing in-field in-person hearings you got to go out and listen to folks to really understand what's working what's not working to produce the results needed so that we can continue that our great producers can feed fuel and clothe the world that's right literally which is that's what's at stake yeah and and think about it now that's always been important but now we have a situation with this terrible uh genocide in ukraine that uh and you were the one who pointed out to me that originally they had 43 million citizens three millions have left they have 40 million citizens but they grow food for 400. and they're not growing it now because the they don't have the diesel fuel russia shut them off you know most of the farmers are taking up arms enjoying the front lines and they're winning but they're at the same time they're not growing the grains the corn and everything else that they grow to feed a good part of the world so this is you know this and we've been working on this obviously we have a mutual friend in terms of david beasley a great brother in the lord uh who was uh thankfully with with the world food program with the united nations and and uh we brought him in we've brought others in we've had great uh hearings and discuss our discussions i guess not hearings um to look at what are the consequences and the consequences are grim for this fall in various parts of the world we're going to see an increase in hunger starvation and death and that's going to be followed by a destabilization in places like in the middle east um that and so the question is what can we do to help the american farmer find opportunity within this terrible situation to step to be able to provide more nutrition we're in a situation where literally the world's a better place when our africans are using as much as they just like the world's a safer place when the american military is strong and robust the american the world is a better place when american farmer uh farmer rancher and forrester success yeah yeah amen to that so again uh congressman tracy mann and congressman thompson if you want to ask me a question or what what's going on in dc press star three now maybe we'll answer a question or two we have to leave it yeah i'd be ready um so first question is up um uh on the phone we have billy from emporia called in topic of veterans in ag um go ahead billy are you on the line yeah tracy i'm here hey uh how you doing brother good how are you doing billy thanks for calling in i i'm doing all right and i'm calling again i've i spoke with you before about this but my big thing is veterans in agriculture and why the va has yet to uh help veterans acquire land i mean the prices of land even in kansas are skyrocketing i went to an auction in osage county and in lyon county land was bringing six grand an acre it's hard to afford that when you need a 20 down payment on that land or 30 down payment on the land to get veterans into this field where they want to be into but we're being bought out by the corporate guy and it's just uh i don't think that's good for the american economy i think it's good for american security to have all your eggs in one basket if one thing covered taught us was to be the more diverse we are where we get our resources from the better off we are as a nation so i'm again going to ask why why why haven't we discussed it when can we discuss it and let's get on it yeah yeah no i agree you know we're seeing it as you know you talk about the auction at no state you know we're seeing that there was an auction last week in uh near our family's farm in gold county um record land prices makes even harder for producers to uh to enter agriculture for young producers to grow for producers that are not young to grow and acquire land specific to veterans um yeah that's definitely something that um that i spent a lot of time working on thing about i serve on the ag committee and also on the veterans affairs committee so the merger of those two issues is important uh there are some things going on around manhattan with the safe farm and other things that are really working to engage veterans and many of who's never thought about agriculture as a career and uh engage with that now specifically what programs could exist for veterans who acquire farmland i think something we're going to take a look at and uh and really dive into it so appreciate the question no i think so and and whether it's long term for our veterans and and billy uh i'm thinking you're probably a veteran based on your your passion for veterans and really thank you for your service uh my son's active duty military is at north fort hood now quite a few years he's senior nco purple heart wounded warrior and i know uh working with him and his call his comrades and being around them um actually agriculture is a great way to transition to civilian life you know when you come out of the military and so i think there are programs out there we could probably connect you with there are probably some things with usda we'll have to go back and look um and and do a deeper dive on it but certainly with the the the va um you know i've i am familiar with some programs that people put together that really are designed to help veterans get those uh you know learn those skills and get that mentorship now billy's point about the cost of acreage i was uh saturday morning i uh last thing i did that morning i went to an auction a dairy farm uh 193 acres and i know that's puny uh for the the kansas pig first uh but it's it's a decent sized farm in pennsylvania and it's sold for 2.7 million dollars and um and it's it's challenge i was really impressed a young couple a purchase said but uh we do have programs uh veteran or non-veteran you know that we're trying to and i think we need to take a look and see how we do better with that how do we get access to capital now for these these uh if people are breaking into farming i mean the down payments is a killer and and then we'll prevent it so there's there's barriers out there that we need to continue to work i think there's some great programs out there for anybody who wants to get into farming but it's not to say that we can't do better that's right and conversations we need to have thinking about this next exactly and what should those programs be and what should they look like so appreciate that again um if you want to ask a question about what's going on in dc press start three now uh another question here um on the phone is brenda conan from riley how are you doing brendan fine how are you doing thank you for taking my call um i i we have a small farm mid to small we run about 100 head of cattle on probably 150 head of goats right now because of kidding season we're starting to see as i know many farmers and ranchers are the increase in fuel prices which is then increasing everything else we need to take care of our livestock to provide feed sources for the americans what we're not seeing is a commensurate increase in the end product price that we get at the market so i was wondering what could be done or what is considered to be done starting first of all with the fuel prices and then some of the other issues surrounding that in prices that farmers ranchers are getting for their products um i'm yeah to thank you uh thanks for what you and your family do with that livestock um uh inflation's inflation's killing us i mean it's we're what a 40 41 year high in terms of inflation and and i will say a lot of commodity prices but not all have escalated to record levels the farming's agriculture is a business it's not so important what money you're getting it's the margin that you're left with at the end of the day and and fuel costs fertilizer if you can buy it workforce i mean most commodities are breaking even and i'm afraid that not too distant future that inflationary cost drives past the commodity what you get for the commodity whether it's livestock whether it's crops you know whatever and so i would start with uh to me the solution and one of the drivers of this inflation well predated the ukraine right and the terrible evil things that vladimir putin has done now it has been the abandoning of domestic produced energy you know where it was a warrior american warrior american warrior city i represent the district that uh discovered commercial oil i still have uh drake well in 1859 1851 by colonel edwin drake so uh and i have pennsylvania's only ethanol plan and i'm working real hard to get those two family members married they got to be working together uh but uh you know the the energy prices and bad energy policy that we've seen with this administration for what what are we ending to now for almost 16 months um you know the solutions right underneath our feet uh we you bring down the number two cost in any operation is and this is i think it's true with agriculture is energy personnel workforce is number one energy's number two and so the solutions beneath our feet um and then we've uh you know then we've learned some lessons we cannot be dependent on and if we're drilling oil for drilling natural gas and then we need to increase domestically produce fertilizer yep uh we cannot be dependent on other countries uh you know this this feels like cobalt right when we needed things and the other place we could get them was overseas and so we need to be intentional and i know the aid committee this is something that that we are looking at or at least the ag republicans are and something we will look at as a as a full committee hopefully at some point that's right judy thank you for stopping by i know you're busy i really appreciate you coming to kansas last week and joining us tonight tracy thanks father i appreciate it okay have a great rest i hope you all know what a great guy you have representing you in the us house of representatives thank so thank you um gt for joining us uh you know if you want to ask me a question about what's going on i'm here in washington d.c anything agriculture related or otherwise press star 3 now we're going to do a poll real quick and uh and the poll is this what concerns you the most about the current state of american agriculture choices so you can enter one of these four um from your phone so what concerns you the most about the current state of american agriculture one input prices two labor shortages three regulatory overreach or four elimination of protections like the stepped up basis so again what concerns you the most input prices one two hit two to say two select labor shortages three regulatory overreach for the elimination of protections like the stepped up basis so um let us know your what you think about that and here we'll be able to tab relate the results and let everybody know uh man thanks for all your feedback you know i send out periodic updates um from the work that we're doing here in congress and if you'd like to begin receiving updates from my office press star six now we can get you added to the list to get those updates and then you regen the call so again to get an update i'm regular on what's going on in washington and what we're working on uh press star six now and press start three now to get in the cue to ask question um next up you have a question off our website um this is kale from great bend his question is what is the update on the stepped up basis so kale um thank you for for your question i don't know if y'all follow this this you know the stepped up basis is a very very important tax tool for agriculture in our district and enter the country for that matter basically the concept is farmland can pass from generation to generation with a step up or an increase in the tax basis which many times eliminates or at the very least dramatically reduces the capital gains tax exposure on inherited property vital for family-owned businesses vital for multi-generational family farms we saw last year and the buildback better uh the bbb which i think stands for bad bad bad and that's a horrible bill um on on lots of you know starts 150 new programs but one of the ways to fund it that the administration insert into that legislation is doing away with the stepped-up basis which would be disastrous for agriculture i would say it would not be a game changer be a game ender for many of our farmers and ranchers in the district i offered an amendment uh the house ad committee to uh get a sense to preserve the stepped-up basis unfortunately that amendment failed by the democrat-controlled house ag committee very concerning to me we weren't able to work to get this disastrous change prevented so what eventually passed in the budget was a preservation of the stepped-up basis however the biden administration's budget that they just released on monday which is record spending and rescue deficits record debt included again this language that would strip away the stepped-up basis so i actually introduced today legislation um had 71 co-sponsors which is good at a 435 out of the gates saying that we want to make sure that we keep the stepped up basis for american agriculture big big big deal something that uh we are fighting hard to make sure that we that we keep so here we have the results everybody from our poll so what concerns uh you most about the currency of american agriculture 41 said input prices 41 31 said regulatory overreach 21 said labor shortages and 4 percent said elimination of protections like this stepped up basis so again 41 almost half at setting input prices that definitely reflects uh what we hear repeatedly from our from our producers and those in agriculture all over the district um thanks for um your feedback hit start three now to uh get in the queue to ask a question next time we have a call we have mike calling in from barton county how are you this evening mike oh mike are you on the line yes i am good what what part are you mike i was in barton county a couple times last week what part of barton county are you in i'm in the far northeast county great well i know you guys had some wins last week there's some fires in pawnee county this week a lot going on how how can we be of assistance or happy to answer any questions on december 15th we had that 100 mile an hour plus winds and did a lot of major damage not only the homes but also to our operations and and still no recovery and when it first happened they said that they were gonna give us help and so far we've not heard of any kind of help not even low interest rates or anything we'll let we'll take down i think we have your name and number here mike we'll you'll get a call from us tomorrow we will make sure that you're aware of the programs that are out there uh to be friends i've been disappointed with the response times for some of these disasters that we've had from the federal government and i've told this secretary vilsack and others that um you know from the windstorm last december 15th you know that also resulted in fires that we saw up in the uh you know up north of you of course there through paradigm the paradise fire they're uh north north of hayes and uh and russell in that area so we'll we'll call you tomorrow and make sure that everything's been filled out and we can do everything we can to try to help you and that's true if anyone else that has these type of needs i can't promise that we can always move mountains but many times our offices can help prod the process along and help speed things up and we do case work on this and other a host of issues as you interface with the federal government and our dodge city in manhattan office so you had a call from us tomorrow mike and uh anyone else on this call please let us know we can be helpful appreciate the question again press start three now if you'd like to ask a question coming in on our website for brian from manhattan uh the question is is the 30 by 30 order threatening my private lands it's a great question you know we've not talked as much um there's not as much chatter about the 30 by 30 right now something we are very very much watching very closely um still very concerned about so the 30 by 30 was an initiated initiated by the bite administration an executive order shortly after he came into office and basically said pretty simply that by the year 2030 30 of american lands would not be in production and it's pretty short and sweet that's all it said uh when i saw that when i heard that news uh the hair on the back of my neck goes up because in kansas 98 of our landscape production only two percent is not and so a whole host of questions arise on how is that going to be calculated will it be state by state or uh on the aggregate our existing conservation programs grows like crp part of 30 so scant on details last summer of report came out called america the beautiful still is doesn't have enough details but it has some tenants that were pretty important in it said that individual person proper rights would be respected other various things i'm still concerned about it though y'all i introduced legislation um later that week that would mix the executive order all together i think this is a bad idea um for a host of reasons and i see no benefit of it for uh for kansas and for our agriculture so that uh bill's currently the national resources committee right now the bite administration is doing what they call the atlas where they're going to try to catalog and determine where we're at towards that 30 percent goal and we'll see it happen is it's absolutely something that we're watching very very closely and have and we'll fight tooth and nail again uh hit start three now to ask a question or to receive our newsletter update uh from my office press star six and we'll get the information from you and then you can rejoin the call we have a phone call we have uh carolyn calling from republic county uh how are you doing carolyn i'm doing good um mr congressman thank you for taking my call i appreciate it thanks carolyn for joining us tonight um my concern is we heard that we heard a news report this morning saying how 7 000 illegals per day are crossing our southern border my husband heard something to the effect that if 42 a number 42 program uh gets dropped or stopped that there will be more than that even my concern not only for the draw the pull and the draw away from agriculture programs to support this many illegals at this time and ongoing not to mention other program government programs i mean how can we take care of all these illegals and support our own government the way we need to including egg um you know unless we're just gonna keep great spending so i'm throwing money at it i don't know money that isn't worth anything really and so uh and and the other thing is why i had do you have an answer for this why is is uh this president so concerned about the ukrainian border being breached when he doesn't hasn't even been to our southern border i believe this is just to me unbelievable that he he seems to care nothing about our southern border and the many countries we heard today hundreds of different countries are sending in illegals across our southern border i mean really uh give me some give me some answers here mr congressman yeah it's absolutely infuriating so i went down there i wanna know what's really going on so i went down there i went to mcallen texas you know vice president harris is who are supposed supposed borders are she flies over the border um you know to do other things is made one stop in el paso well el paso is not really where um things are happening kind of the epicenter is in calan texas i went there with some other members and i'll see i was both outraged and heartbroken um outraged for these disastrous policies and heartbroken for what we're doing to these kids so here's what's going on and just understand you know last year we set a record as a nation for the annual number of um legal apprehensions that occurred at our southern border 2 million we're on pace this year to shatter that record and and what happened was when biden came into office very first day he made a few changes that had dramatic impacts number one uh he had an executive order that reversed trump's remaining mexico policy so basically what trump the administration did and it really um got illegal immigration under control didn't solve it but but got it more control and i said look if you come to our country illegally and are apprehended then you're going to go back to mexico while your paperwork is just being processed before you let into the country buy and reverse that um number two um this the other policy change he made is he said look um a miner who is five years old and younger can come across um and can bring a family member with them or a minor then who is unaccompanied that's younger than 17 which effectively means a minor that's age 6 to 17 can come across and not be turned back um sounds compassionate right what that's done is that has caused literally hundreds of thousands um to the tune of almost two million kids that are coming to reporters so it's not just uh really the majority's people are children and what we're the life we're setting up for in our country um and how our president is not going to address the situation and is turning a blind eye is absolutely um is infuriating to me i have railed on this on the house floor we've been on national tv talking about this we've written op-eds i've introduced legislation we've written letters to biden um and harris and it's very frustrating what your husband is talking about on title 42 is uh basically the bite administration the court forced them to say look in the age of covid we cannot have people coming across the southern border without being tested for copen so they were all turned away well title 42 is going to expire as the pandemic list and it's going to only further increase what we're seeing happening so pretty simple we need to reinstate the remaining mexico policy and we need to stop signaling that our country is open and we need to secure our southern border with a wall system and the money's there has been appropriated the walls partially constructed in areas the construction stopped and uh and biden can change all this with the stroke of a pen and it's very frustrating he's been unwilling to do that so that's that's the answer there carolyn that's what's going on and uh and that's yeah that's that's the way so again ask me a question to hit star three now um question from marty from clay center from our website i'm talking about asking about energy independence and how do we get there a great question marty i appreciate the question you know it's frustrating to me that we're not there already and we were there just a year and a half ago so realize you know in 2020 we were energy independent which means that we did not have to depend on other few other countries by the way the vast majority of which don't have our interests at heart like saudi arabia like iran like russia but we've decided the bite administration has decided to stop and put our roadblocks to our domestic oil exploration which basically turns off the spigot which also means that you know for our producers aren't willing to take that risk because they don't know what's going to happen to them regulatory meanwhile they're working to dry up the financing for new oil exploration by these esgs and these other horrible policies so that's what's happening what we need to do about is pretty simple number one we need to give our oil and gas producers certainty that they um that we are open for business that the answers to many of these problems are right underneath our feet we just need to drill and we need to expedite the property process to do that two we need to open up other areas of federal lands for drilling the bottom administration said that they're doing that they're really not um three we need to complete the keystone pipeline it's partially constructed it would bring us inexpensive fuel from canada it was our ally to the north um because biden shut that off and sent money over and allowed to finish the nordstrom pipeline you know he stops our pipeline but he restarts and helps finish the nordstrom pipeline um and then we're buying russian oil you know this makes no sense the amount of oil that nor that keystone would supply our country is almost exactly the amount that we buy from putin every day and that needs to change so these are solvable problems uh infuriating that the administration is not willing not willing to solve them so that's it uh you know if you ask me a question again hit star 3 now or press star 6 to sign up for a newsletter we have a phone call i'm dwayne from manhattan's calling how are you this evening dwayne i'm good to see you how about yourself i'm doing well last week [Music] the concerns call back in if you can and we're not we're not picking it up pretty well sorry about that um next up uh we got a question from caleb um from our website dwayne i hope you call back in look forward to talking with you caleb on the website says i'm excited you launched the ffa caucus any updates yeah so uh caleb follows this stuff closely so we launched last december the ffa caucus so in congress you have committees um you also have caucuses which are informal groups bipartisan that form around certain issues and there was not an ffa caucus and i just think it's important that we are promoting and shedding a light on our future ag producers here in washington dc and make sure have policies in place that support ag education that support programs like the ffa 4-h and others and so we launched this caucus um had really pleased actually we had dozens of members joined right away and excited about the work that we will do with ffba cox we also in the process are identifying who some of our advocates are sometimes you know there are members in congress who maybe grew up on a farm or have real roots they now represent a urban district but um you know those are people that that could potentially be supportive of the things that that were supported by the need of the big first so appreciate the question caleb and uh hey next up we have a second poll question and the question is this which farm bill title are you the most interested in so the farm bill that we're currently under has various titles so which farm bill title are you most interested in press one if it's conservation two if it's trade three for nutrition or for rural development five for crop insurance so again which farm bill tyler are you most interested in press one for concert two for trade three for nutrition for for rural development and five for crop insurance and we will uh we'll get back with everybody on the results of the other poll here uh pretty quick so next up this evening i'm on our website again we have reed from alma um we heard about um carson thompson's farm bill priorities what are yours great question and and i appreciate it so you know my biggest priority in this next farm bill is going to be crop insurance i think we have to realize and i know that the district varies the amount of moisture it sees but our high plains agriculture is low moisture high risk agriculture and when your business partner is mother nature we've got to have tools in place to help us manage this risk and crop insurance is absolutely essential to that now when you look at crop insurance we make sure the program's working i mean you look at arc and plc we look at the uh the loan rates we need to really get into that but it's been a successful public-private partnership where the producer is taking risk and is paying appropriate premiums for that risk so uh certainly crop insurance is big there's a whole host of other things that we could be doing i'm better i'd like to see us i think we got a great return on investment for our the efforts that we make to in the in the ag community to expand markets in other countries you know we've got to be conscious of how do we open up markets how do we increase demand for our ag products so spending more money there is something else that i'll be looking at i'm looking at the overall safety net and what our producers need um you know various things so those are the things they're talking about looking at our crp program other conservation programs make sure they're appropriate and are what our producers are wanting so appreciate the question um as we look at this next farm bill so if you want to ask me a question about what's going on press star 3 now or press star 6 to sign up for our newsletter another question came on our website this is stephanie from gove county question about telehealth postcode do you support it the answer is absolutely you know part of agriculture i know this is an egg focused call you know it's it's how do we have the things in place that really buttress or help our rural communities to survive and not just right but to thrive good health care access to health care incredibly important and telehealth in this day and age is a big part of that doesn't solve everything but there's no reason that telehealth can't be a big part of the health care solution for many many areas of the big first or something absolutely support covet came along i think and expedite it or increase the pace at which we're seeing telehealth practices be adopted there's some kinks to still work out there but absolutely something that i i support want to see more of having good telehealth you know big part of that we gotta have good world broadband and access to the internet so that uh zoom calls facetime calls those kind of things when necessary um can be done over the internet and as far as further help support our telehealth effort so we have our poor results y'all which farm bill tyler are you most interested in um number one at 37 percent was trade number two at 26 crop insurance uh next uh 21 rural development 11 nutrition and 5 conservation so again the the winner there was trade at 37 i think an acknowledgement from folks and how important trade is to our agriculture markets in the big first and then close up behind that is crop insurance you know those two things combined we're pushing uh 60 of those priorities again press star three now to get in queue to ask a question um again this is tracy here for the big first uh star three now uh coming on facebook we have samantha uh she says i saw your china letter can you explain um 16 billion dollars is enough yeah basically you know we had the phase one china trade deal that trump negotiated and we saw you know obviously markets were tumultuous there were payments from the government to help make up for uh for the tariffs that china was slapping on you know these trade wars we got the phase one trade deal signed uh two years ago a little over two years ago and china agreed to buy a certain amount of ag products into the day um you know they fell short by about 16 billion dollars and it is very very frustrating disappointing uh infuriating to me that you know china agreed to a deal and they did not stand by their side of it now um understand that china is buying record amounts of our act products more than they ever have at the end of the day it deals a deal and my letter was through the bite administration i'm challenging them and asking questions on why aren't we enforcing this deal that would dramatically could put further price um you know pressure on our markets and big picture we i feel like we got to be opening up other markets we're too dependent on china uh we need to be looking at other countries that will buy our ag products we have records this month from japan buying our beef as an example i think there's a lot of other areas that we can we can grow as well so again i press star 3 to get in the queue to ask a question and um and we'll start to wrap up here actually you know one thing i want to touch on real quick is our input costs i know carson thompson talked about that it's the number one issue i hear in the district and you know you can talk about inflation being seven or eight percent the the reality is for ag producers the fertilizer inflation we see fertilizer processes prices 300 400 they're skyrockey um and for a host of reasons uh what do we need to do a very simple thing we could do today and i wrote a letter about this in my administration is to lift our inbound tariffs on fertilized phosphorus and nitrogen that's coming in from countries like morocco and countries like trinidad and tobago you know we are putting tariffs on these inbound fertilizer components that only further dries up costs and i introduced legislation say look in times of emergency like this we should lift those tariffs and we should let the market sort itself out so that's a a solution there i'm not going to fix everything but but it certainly would help and we need to be increasing our domestic fuel uh and you know fossil fuel production certainly so we have another call here um darren calling it from bird city you know extreme uh you know northwest kansas up in uh shyland bursted area how are you this evening darren yeah can you hear me again i'm kind of outside of town here at great band by the exile grounds and i i don't know how good my service is yeah yeah no i i can hear you darren thanks for calling in i remember many times over the years so uh what's on your mind tonight darren well well our challenge is several things bird city right now we have to play sports with saint francis and we have to drive all the way to palco to play six and eight-man football six-man football uh there's nobody in the west the dairies are taking it all over it's a real challenge what i'm calling to is invite you to come to the farm show in great pen april seventh eighth or 9th whatever day it fits into your schedule we've got a tank forum and i'd like for you to see the farm show and see how in the last 10 years we've gone down by 95 vendors because there's no more ag vendors in the state of kansas yeah i would love to come please invitation let me look at my scale and see if i can do it i have been um you know to the gribbing furniture before uh bears but i would be happy to come back and uh and do that you talked about um football i remember i actually played football palco always had stickers right in the middle of their football field so i don't know if that's been resolved or if that's still a problem i certainly was back then you know the bigger thing you're really striking on or you're hitting on is the continued out migration in our rural communities and that that's really the heart of the issue and so what do we do about i think we do a host of things number one um that's why it's important we get ag policy right because end of the day ad policy is is the is buttressing or is what really lifts up our rural communities if we get that policy wrong it's going to make the problem worse beyond that we got to make sure that we've got good health care we got to make sure we have good schools going to make sure we have good access to internet um housing is a big problem in rural communities something we're working on all the time also daycare uh continues to be an issue um for a lot of well really all communities throughout the district but that's really risen as as an issue because to get you know families to return to our more rural communities not always but many times but husband and wife both work and for them to have a family we got to solve this daycare problem which is that which is a big big problem so darren i appreciate the question um uh we'll look into the farm show in great bend august six seven our april um sunday night so we'll grab the dates and uh and go from there hey a quick update so one thing our office does of course you know we talked a lot about policy we also do what's called casework which means if you or anyone you know is having issues interfacing with the federal government that might be with a passport might be with a farm program payment or or some kind of an issue there could be with immigration issues um if you're at irs whatever if you're imprisoned interface with the federal government uh we spend a lot of time we have people in our office that specialize in helping folks with what's called casework so just reach out to any of our offices go to our website we have an office in manhattan uh one in dodge city and then of course um one here in dc i can't promise we can always move mountains but many times you know we have phone numbers uh folks we can call we get up human on the line and uh and prod the process along so reach out to us if we can be helpful in any way we literally help thousands of kansans all over the big first with them case work and other related needs so as we can be of assistant let us serve you let us help spread that spread that word so well thanks everybody for joining you know it's an interesting time in uh in agriculture as uh seeds you know for spring planting we're gonna start going to the ground we know we have a lot of issues at the end of the day um we can't forget that we're the greatest country in the history of this world and that america i would contend is free and a great country for many reasons but our ag producers who ensure every day that we don't rely on another country for our food supply is a reason that we are the free country we are and imagine we're in a situation if we could add policy wrong and we have to start importing food we will be a less free nation and it's bad enough we got to import fossil fuels we should be doing we've got to make sure we're never in a situation where you're not producing our own food i'm grateful for our ag producers you know this is ag appreciation month um i feel like every day every month appreciation month of the big first and uh you know grateful for ag producers uh all the things that they do to uh literally feed fuel and clothe the world and very grateful so as we can be helpful let us know thanks for joining tonight and i hope you all have a great evening thanks a lot

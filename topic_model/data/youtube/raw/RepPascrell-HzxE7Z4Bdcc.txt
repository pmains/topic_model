of it as to why the bill had to be pulled yesterday Republican Congressman Peter King of New York said bluntly because of ted cruz i'm joined by democratic congressman bill Pascrell of New Jersey a member of the House Ways and Means and budget committees congressman always good to see you Sarah let's start with this how you doing crying I'm doing well sir let's start with what we're hearing about this new bill 35 million for National Guard troops more money as I understand it to be used at the discretion of border governors what are you hearing right now about what else might be in the bill and when that thing might get to the floor Claude four inches to ask that question up to two minutes ago before I ran up the stairs here we had no bill in front of us we had you do not have the language for that bill but that's a technical question they've blown it they know they've blown it yeah I mean if you just saw what your own two eyes regardless of which party you belong to or no party you saw what happened yesterday when they backed off what they were going to do because they didn't have the votes and that's fine but what do we what are we here for the sentence got home if we vote on something today they're not going to be around the boat at all this is all decoration that's what it is these these folks are the group that couldn't shoot straight regardless of what you feel of your politics this is the reason why the Congress has held the low regard we can't get it straight we can't even vote on what we say we're going to vote for and that the top it all off i couldn't believe yesterday when some republicans are saying well if we don't get it done let the president do with is executive powers we just went through two days ago a kabuki dance about how we're going to sue the president of the united states because it uses executive powers you tell me what I'm missing here I you know what I won't even attempt to try to tell you but you do is an interesting point there i mean even if you guys manage to get something done Senate's already gone home my understanding is that the emergency funding is going to run out sometime early august maybe at the latest if you guys are on a five-week vacation what then does that mean for the crisis at the border well it certainly means that kids are not going to be attended to we know that this is a human in question we know it's part of our inability to come to grips with the main issue and that is comprehensive immigration reform over a month over a year ago the Senate voted a bipartisan piece of legislation Democrats and Republicans voted to change our immigration laws of course if people talk about that without knowing what the immigration laws are now it doesn't help us at all know what the law is so we want to do is change it so that people can come out of the shadows so families can be United so we can say look these folks can stay in these folks have to go home we can't do that right now with the chaos that exists and I don't think what's happening in the house today is going to reduce that chaos I think it will increase that chaos and I want to know who's running the show in my house for the Republican Party who do you think's around the show sounds like you've got some pretty good ideas i think peter king is dead on when he says what he says yesterday i'm not going to mess up get involved with Republican politics we have enough problems within our own party and a democratic side well I think he's dead on and what jon runyan the congressman from New Jersey said yesterday who's a moderate Republican who tries always to seek a resolution in the middle Jon Runyan said this is the reason why I'm resigning and leaving the Congress of the United States just listen to that now he may be only one person but he's an important person I think he's added to the integrity of the Congress the short time that he was here and it's the integrity of the Congress the integrity of the house that has been be righted and pouring down by these Republicans who and part of their party does not even want government to exist they think they're cool these 40 to 50 people think they're cool I don't think they're cool I think they deride the Constitution I think they bring down economy bring down the Constitution and I think they minimize how great this country is they should be a themselves and crews should stay over on the other side of the building on the Senate side congressman bill Pascrell from New Jersey congressman I think we are going to leave it there sir thank you for your time have a great weekend I will have a great way you hope you guys get it get a vote done soon so new details so now what

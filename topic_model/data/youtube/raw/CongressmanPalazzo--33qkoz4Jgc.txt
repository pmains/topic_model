FROM MISSISSIPPI SEEK  RECOGNITION? >> I ASK UNANIMOUS CONSENT TO  ADDRESS THE HOUSE FOR ONE  MINUTE AND TO REVISE AND EXTEND  MY REMARKS.  THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE:   WITHOUT OBJECTION, THE   GENTLEMAN FROM MISSISSIPPI IS  RECOGNIZED FOR ONE MINUTE. >> MR. SPEAKER, I RISE TODAY TO  RECOGNIZE AMERICA'S VETERANS.  SATURDAY IS VETERANS DAY, A  TIME TO RECOGNIZE OUR BRAVEST  MEN AND WOMEN WHO ANSWERED THE   CALL TO DEFEND OUR GREAT NATION  AGAINST OUR ENEMIES. WORDS ARE NOT ENOUGH TO SAY  THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING YOU   HAVE ENDURED AND SACRIFICED ON   AMERICA'S BEHALF.  AS A FELLOW VETERAN AND ON   BEHALF OF THE GOOD FAMILIES OF   MISSISSIPPI'S FOURTH   CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, I WANT   TO CONVEY MY APPRECIATION TO   YOU AND YOUR FAMILIES. MANY OF US HAVE SEEN THE PERILS  OF WAR AND CONFLICT. MR. PALAZZO: MANY HAVE PAID THE  ULTIMATE SACRIFICE BEFORE THE  ALTER OF FREEDOM.  BECAUSE OF THIS DISPLAY OF   SACRIFICE, FUTURE GENERATIONS  MAY ENJOY THE BLESSINGS WHAT   OUR COUNTRY STANDS FOR, THE  RIGHT TO LIFE, LIBERTY AND THE   PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS.  I AM PROUD TO HAVE THE   OPPORTUNITY TO SERVICE   ALONGSIDE SUCH BRAVE MEN AND   WOMEN. SO VETERANS, WE ARE A FREE   NATION BECAUSE OF THE BRAVERY  OF YOU AND YOUR FAMILIES.  HAPPY VETERANS DAY AND GOD   BLESS YOU. I YIE

all right i think we're good to go thank you everyone so much for joining us this afternoon i'm lisa mandelbat i'm going to be moderating this afternoon's gun violence prevention round table we have some a really special panel of guests and i'm going to introduce all of them in a little bit and i'm going to start off by introducing shannon watts who is the founder of mom's demand action for gun sense in america and i want to give a special shout out to all the moms who are in the audience today so we're in our colors proud and of course our very own congressman matt malinowski so welcome shannon yeah thank you hello new jersey um i am so excited to join all of you for this important conversation and i want to say hi to all the gun violence prevention advocates and new jersey moms to man actors action members joining us today and a big thank you to representative malinowski for joining for hosting us and for being a gunson's champion uh fortunately we elected a gun sense majority to congress in 2018 but we have to continue that support of elected officials those who will stand up to special interests like the gun lobby and we have to fight to protect representative malinowski seat and hold that majority and also flip the senate and send vice president biden and kamala harris to the white house thanks to the nra life-saving bills are dying on mitch mcconnell's desk and americans are dying in the streets and this administration has failed to protect us from two public health crises covid 19 and gun violence they've actually undermined gun safety despite the fact that about 145 000 people are killed by gun violence uh during their time in office during their administration so this is the most crucial election of our lifetime and it's over in just 24 days we're at crisis levels now and frankly if our lawmakers don't act more guns in more places will translate into more gun deaths and more gun injuries all that said i really do believe we are at the precipice of major positive change and we cannot lose sight of the power that we have right now to elect gunsen's champions i know we can do it uh we've made gun safety go from a political third rail to an issue now that candidates run on and win on and no other issue has such broad support or has so many people energized and talking about gun safety in a smart informed way like we're doing today is how we win we also know that women voters are poised to be a major force in this election uh i think donald trump has spent a lot of time underestimating us with his sexist attacks and his antiquated ideas about who housewives are in the suburbs but if he thinks suburban moms are going to turn out for a candidate who would rather stuff their pocket with gun lobby donations and keep our kids safe he is in for a rude awakening gun safety is now an issue that candidates run on they win on the political calculus has changed completely thanks to elected officials like representative malinowski who are standing up to the nra and it's really also because of all the fierce gun violence prevention advocates who joined us today who are holding our lawmakers accountable it's making all the difference our movement has never been stronger the nra has never been weaker and i know that we can do this so thank you for inviting me to kick off this this conversation and i know um it will be a great one thank you so so much shannon uh and thanks lisa for bringing us together and to everybody who's uh who joined uh the call shannon i know we're gonna we're gonna lose you in a few minutes but i um i i did want to ask you you know you you started mom's demand action basically from your your kitchen table um and it's grown into this extraordinary organization i remember you know when i got into the race in 2018 there was no more organized group of of local grassroots volunteers than the mom command action crowd and and one of my maybe top three best moments in the house was when we passed that universal background check bill and i'm just on the floor you know as i usually am casting my ballot chatting with fellow members of congress i hadn't really looked up and when we when when the the final vote was cast i hear this applause and cheering from the galleries which is against the rules but never mind and i look up sea of and and of course it was all of the you know volunteers who'd come up from all around the country including my district to be there for that moment it was such a wonderful feeling but my question for you is in in this weird year right what what what are you guys doing what are the volunteers doing um to help races in the country where gun violence prevention is on the ballot as it is in in our district yeah you know first of all thank you and so grateful for t to you for voting for that legislation which uh hopefully we can actually sign into law uh next year but we were really in made for this moment in many ways you know i started monster in action as a facebook page we've invested invested in very uh sophisticated technologies all along most organizations only give those technologies to leaders we give them to every single volunteer um applications like hustle um the ability to join calling banks and and um texting banks already this election cycle we have sent over 1.1 million texts we made over 700 000 calls our volunteers have not missed a beat and even though many of them are are suddenly full-time teachers and stay-at-home parents and um employees and all of the things that they're dealing with during kobed they know that this is the most important election of our lifetime and that every single second that we spend getting out the vote matters and will help us win in november yeah and and do you sense it really has become a voting issue more than when you started the organization has that evolution continued absolutely i mean you know you you know that we narrowly lost the vote on the mansion to me bill uh which would have closed background check loopholes in 2013 by a handful of votes in the senate um and and the calculus has totally changed and i always say you have to show lawmakers that if they do the right thing you'll have their back and if you do they do the wrong thing you'll have their job and that takes several election cycles and so when lawmakers see other lawmakers lose their jobs over this uh for example senator ayat in new hampshire it sends a really strong signal that that you should be more afraid of moms than than of gun lobbyists uh well that's a good way to put it as as as i always say when i speak at mom's rallies a very simple political rule is just do what moms tell you to do exactly for everybody and we'd win that vote in the senate now right if mcconnell allowed a vote for universal background checks we'd win the vote we believe so i mean and again this isn't polarizing in the american public 90 of americans 80 percent of gun owners 75 percent of nra members support common sense laws like a background check on every gun sale right so what we're what we're facing on this and so many other issues it's not uh that we lack the you know we have the public um we have the organization we've got the passion it's just there are there are flaws in our democracy right now and we'll talk a little bit more about that later in the call that are preventing overwhelming majorities of americans overwhelming bipartisan majorities of americans from getting the policies that they vote for um that's exactly right and and that that is not the way democracy is supposed to work our our the lawmakers we elect are supposed to do what their constituents ask them to do and in too many cases they're not doing that not just in congress but also in state legislatures across the country and so we really do have to elect guns as champions up and down the ballot yep great um lisa do you have any uh any questions um i i don't have any other questions um but thank you so much shannon for being with us i really do appreciate you helping us with this event and um yeah it's just i know that as you can see i'm wearing my f that um it's something that just two cycles ago i think folks were afraid to run on and i think the work that the moms have done in my own personally i ran for a state assembly last cycle and the moms were out for us knocking doors every single weekend and it was just really powerful we didn't win but i was proud to run on this message and i so glad to have a congressman that's will you know that runs on this message and i feel like you kind of got the ball rolling at that kitchen table which is you know what women do right that's right and we look forward to you running again because it usually takes more than once so we're good right um so thank you and i'm gonna introduce some regina and jim now that is good with everybody yup thank you so much china thanks shannon so um thank you all so much that was so great to hear from shannon directly it's um first we have two other wonderful panelists with us regina thompson jenkins who lost her 19 year old son when he was shot and killed by a senseless act of gun violence she honors his memory as a member of the everytown survivor network and through the devon lane i'm sorry the trey devon lane foundation thank you regina for being with us and we have shiv goal who is a youth activist and public speaker currently attending wachong hills regional high school and he works with many activists and social justice organizations including march for our lives so thank you both for being with us and i just want to remind folks that are on this call if you've got questions for the congressman or for panelists please put them into the chat box and we will try to get to them towards the end of this conversation so but right now um regina i'm going to turn it over to you good afternoon everyone my name is regina thompson jenkins and i'm a gun violence survivor and a volunteer with the new jersey chapter mom's demand action in the mercer county area thank you for having me today i am honored to be a part of this gun violence prevention round table but on september 22nd 2012 my life changed forever my son was sitting on a porch with his friends on a friday night as teenagers do which makes this ironic i even sat on the same porch when i was a child around the corner about 50 feet this is my grandparents home a home where i grew up in while being raised by my grandparents filled with love laughter and great memories will forever be tarnished i will never return to that house again you say why because that's where my baby collapsed on the floor while laying in a pool of his own blood while he waited for the ambulance to transport him to the trauma center at capitol house medical center family we still all have keys to this home because it's known as the family's home someone shot into a crowd of people and destroyed my life a neighborhood that i always felt safe in is no longer hours went by as we waited on word for in the er for tray to come out of surgery and then the police officer escorted my husband and myself to the back room in the waiting room the doctors came out to talk to us i immediately said to him how's my son doing he said i'm so sorry but your son didn't make it everything else the doctor said was like mom like the teacher off of charlie brown i let out this piercing loud scream that echoed through the walls of the hospital then i feign it when i came to i asked my husband what's this was that true what the doctor said my husband said yes babe it's true he said i'm so sorry i told him i don't believe him i needed to see my baby so we were taken to the morgue where my baby i laid on a stainless steel table in a black body bag i leaned over to him and the tears rolled down my face and landed on his i bent over to kiss him which seemed like the last time my heart skipped a beat when my only child tried was killed by a senseless act become violence even though i was supposed to be the teacher he taught me a great deal he taught me how to be selfless he sacrificed his life to save two young ladies to avoid a bigger tragedy john 15 13 says greater love have no man than this than a man that lays down his life for his friends he did that he saved his life he saved those girls lives he was my heartbeat he was my pride and joy trey died a hero but my pain will last a lifetime he was only 19 years old and in college at the time of his death i i would never know what is it for him to achieve his goals and walk across that stage to get his diploma from college but more importantly pursue his career as a social worker and be a productive citizen of society instead of his diploma i received his death certificate he had a heart of gold his character spoke volumes especially on that night my six four tall linky baby loved basketball and when he flashed those dimples with that big smile your heart melted well especially with the girls he yes he was a chick magnet for sure he loved the girls so i would never know that feeling of that mother and son dance at his wedding i would never know the feeling of being a grandmother i was robbed of the opportunity to see him pursue happiness in this lifetime my son he was the 15th homicide in the city of trenton new jersey on that fatal fall night in september when an innocent he was an innocent bystander when someone's chose to shoot into a crowd of people however because of the color of his skin i'm often asked by insensitive people when they hear he was killed by a gun was he in the gang what was he doing well i'm here to tell you not all brack and brown children are in the gang my son was not affiliated with the gang yet i stand before you as a grieving mother young black men are especially vulnerable to gun violence in their urban community society has stereotyped our young black men who are killed by gun violence and often associate them with gangs the chances of a black american family losing a son to a bullet are 62 percent greater than losing him to a car accident the gun epidemic has hit underserved communities of color particularly hard in recent years gun homicide rates in these neighborhoods has reached all-time high crisis point which makes it even worse to date my son's case is still unsolved there are 200 cases unsolved in the mercer county area sadly mass shootings continue to dominate the headlines we know sandy hook we we heard about the las vegas shooting south carolina line of shooting church shooting like many other americans i felt immediate miserable grief on that day when parkland happened my emotions were so overrun with tears i couldn't control myself i thought of my own son when i thought of those students i remember saying to my husband just senseless it's just don't make any sense gun gun violence touches every corner of this country and making our community safer should be a number one priority americans can no longer pretend that shooting deaths are related to the inner city inner city because if you think you're exempt from this you have not turned on the news because they're in the malls the shootings are in the churches they're not walmarts they're in our schools so no one is exempt from this senseless gun violence and the effects of the gun violence is post traumatic stress disorder i live with it every day i am my community i'm speaking out on behalf of those mothers who are voiceless because her black or brown son or daughter didn't make the national headlines of the news but we know every life matters each year more than a hundred thousand americans have their lives cut short by gun violence from suicide domestic violence mass shootings accidental shootings and being in this line of work from volunteering with every town and moms and man action i have met survivors from all over the country with stories like brenda from chicago she said one son overseas to flight for a record freedom and a week later her son other son died on free soil in chicago for susan in north carolina her daughter sarah was killed by her abusive husband in a domestic violence situation or lashay from san diego who was shot five times by her boyfriend while holding her infant daughter she was one of the lucky ones she survived she's telling her story to everyone who would listen or or my my friend dawn her son anthony a unsecured firearm was in their home anthony accidentally shot himself in ewing township his mother found him imagine her lifetime of pain each of these stories have a common denominator a gun was involved i choose to speak out against gun violence because my son has been silenced i am his voice i honor trace courage his legacy through its foundation with a purpose through the trade demand lane foundation to make a change so as today i stand before you as a grieving mother we must continue to hold our elective officials accountable for stricter gun laws common sense laws to avoid having another mother endure the pain of losing a child due to senseless gun violence like i have change spares life thank you thank you thank you regina thank you so much for sharing your powerful story are we um going to hear from shiv first or um yeah we can hear from chad first shiv do you wanna tell us how you got involved in um march for our lives and other organizations yeah sure thank you so much for having me uh congressman malinowski and lisa so my story getting involved with gun violence actually spends back to a year ago now on july 6 in 2019 when a motorcycle backfired in times square in a place that's patrolled by dozens of cops with tourists from all around the world that's kind of last place you would expect something like that to happen but today's world where lethal weapons were so easily accessible it's a very real and a very unfortunate possibility that something tragic could happen there and that same week just five days before from july 1st to july 5th there were 13 shootings across the nation and two of them reached national headlines now i was in the city with my sister we had gone for a broadway show and we heard like towards the end of the show we had heard some chaos going on outside and it was distracting we couldn't understand what's going on and out of nowhere someone screamed gun so when that motor cycle had gone off in times square people ran all over people were into shops people ran to theaters they ran for shelter and for cover from what they thought had been a gun and in most theaters actually what happened was people wanted to theaters they screamed gun and people hid in dressing rooms they hid in closed rooms within theaters within the theater that i was in there was one individual who had run into the lobby and was screened as a security guard and i guess someone in the theater itself had heard that word that were gone and they ran out then more people heard it ran out of theater and at that point the whole everyone theater was running out i reached down grabbed my water bottle grabbed my sister and we ran out the front door i remember specifically there was one moment that i remember so vividly in my mind was i can still see right now i see as we're running out as right when we reach the entrance a man fell before me and he fell flat on his face the first thought that when my mind was oh my god like he something had happened but thankfully he was okay you just tripped and fell and as my sister were my sister and i we were leaving the exit we actually got separated we were in different ways the adrenaline rushing and thankfully everything worked out okay you know we we met back up at venn station and actually had no idea what had happened until we were on the train ride home and we were looking at our phones seeing you know looking up shooting new york city times square and we found out like that is just a motorcycle i laughed it it was such a have it was an experience that i'll never forget and i can never call myself a victim of gun violence because i'm not but because of gun violence even indirectly i know that it's impacting my life and the lives of so so many and that's where my advocacy work and work as youth activists really started from there i actually met with a former congressional candidate from a district a different district are the krybik who had heard about my experience and she told me about march for lives which is this amazing used activist organization that works for gun violence for vacation by lobbying congress by by protesting by doing things like banner drops all across the country and running all kinds of incredible events and from there i was hooked i started a chapter i got involved with organizing and i haven't looked back since wonderful thank you chef um well we're we're depending on this kind of activism it's already made a difference i can tell you it's made a difference in washington dc that march was just unbelievable um and regina thank you for sharing that story i imagine that you do it often and that it's never easy um because your loss is it's it's hard to fathom to anybody who has not experienced what you have been through and look one of our goals here is to make it so that you don't have to tell the story all the time right because you're doing it for a reason obviously we need to change our laws and our attitudes in this country [Music] and um so i'm i'm grateful to you for trying to turn this tragedy into something good for other people um but we all want to make it so you don't have to keep on doing this forever and ever we're all tired of having to talk about this forever and ever and ever um and i think you know one of the things that you brought out in in your presentation is that this affects everybody in every kind of community right i mean there are people who only notice gun violence when it's you know suburban kids in a school right and then there are people who only notice it or think it exists in in huge cities um but it's really everywhere it's rural communities small towns it's medium-sized towns that trenton uh it affects people of every race every ethnicity it's do you do you still find it hard to kind of persuade people that that this is an equal opportunity killer equal opportunity tragedy you're still you're muted actually yes there you go okay i'm immediate um yeah um i try to um you still find yourself convincing people that um that is not a problem and it is a problem um and and i say it you really don't get involved until it knocks on your door you really people don't really get involved until it's a mass shooting or an urban shooting and it knocks on their door that's when they tend to want to get involved well then it's too late i'd rather for you to be proactive than reactive yep i was also thinking about your story and you know one of the arguments that the nra national rifle association makes is that the answer to gun violence is everyone should be armed in their home and you know i'm thinking about what happened to to your son and imagining like if you'd had a gun in your house somewhere what difference would it have made right right um obviously not and the story that you told chev a gun backfiring in times square uh and suddenly people think it's a shooter and and they're panicking like if somebody did have a gun in that situation it might have actually led to a real tragedy right um somebody might have started shooting at where they thought the fake the non-gun was was coming from and and we've had situations uh you know where there's a real shooter and the police don't know who the bad guy is is it the shooter is it a good samaritan who pulls out a gun to defend it so when you look at these situations case by case what really happens you realize that what we need is sensible gun laws so we have fewer guns on the streets no guns in the wrong hands so that's what we're working for right um so let me say a few words about where i think we are um look the last few months we've been preoccupied with the pandemic and that's like most of the conversation in this country about politics about what's going on in congress i i do think there's there are connections here like one of the things that's really really affected me is knowing that as our schools reopen or some of them for in-person instruction really from a public health point of view they should open their windows right and yet they can't open their windows because they got to worry about a potential shooter and the safety of their kids from gun violence so to protect our kids against gun violence we've got to make them and the teachers less safe against a pandemic what a horrible failure that is of our society so we're trying to change that and it has become a voting issue that's a very big difference from a few years ago i'm running on this and there's a real contrast between me and the guy i'm running against because he got he has a he has a scarlet letter a not an f from uh from the nra because he's voted against all these gun laws that we have in new jersey um and one of the things i point out in talking about this is we actually do have pretty good decent gun laws in new jersey we still have horrible acts of gun violence as regina reminded us but it's actually less in new jersey than in most other states i think we're about four gun fatalities per 100 000 people in new jersey in pennsylvania it's like 11 or 12 just across the border and why is that we have all the other problems in new jersey that every other state has right we've got poverty we've got other forms of crime we've got mental illness we've got all the things that people say are the cause of violence but we have one of the lowest i think one of the two lowest in the country rates of of gun fatalities and when they happen very often it's a gun that was purchased outside of new jersey and we don't know in your case regina right because you said it was unsolved but i would not be surprised just based on what we know about these things in our state i would not be surprised if that gun came from somewhere else we had a case in westfield uh last year where a guy came to an elementary school and had like an arsenal of guns in his car and thankfully nothing happened it was averted and he came from delaware he got all his guns there right so even if we do the right thing in new jersey we're not safe unless the united states all moves in the same direction every state moves in the same direction and that's why this national legislation is so so important why we need the universal background checks that's that should be the easiest thing um why we need that ban on those military style weapons that can fire a hundred rounds a minute the big magazines um why we need national laws that allow uh law enforcement to take away guns from people who have shown signs of behaving dangerously even if they haven't committed crimes we just passed that in new jersey but a lot of states don't have it we need a national law um and you know back to the beginning why don't we have that stuff when as shannon told us 90 of the american people support it well um a big reason is money it's that the nra uh and pro-gun groups in past elections are responsible for a huge huge share of the money that politicians raise to get elected and um you know this year it's a little bit less of that because the nras is i'm so happy to say this they're like collapsing because of their own internal corruption but you know they've um they've really gained the system and bought a lot of people and that's why we haven't been able to get this stuff through um and so the final thing i'll say is that in addition to all the gun legislation that i'm for you know bills that actually talk about guns specifically there's one other bill one other piece of legislation or category of legislation that i think is in a way the most important here and it doesn't mention the word gun anywhere in that legislation but it's campaign finance reform it's legislation to get this dark money unaccountable non-transparent money out of our politics where you've got corporations and billionaires um being able to spend unlimited amounts of money on negative attack ads influencing our elections and district after district scaring people and that's what the nra has been able to do and their supporters and we need we need to get rid of that so that we are more likely to have a congress and state legislatures that actually do what the majority of their constituents want rather than a majority of the people who give them money and if we get if we win this election and keep the house and take the senate and joe biden wins the white house uh my prediction is that the first bill we pass will be to fix our democracy so that we can then fix all these other issues like gun violence and health care and prescription drugs and protecting the environment and all these other things we talk about so that's what i'm going to work for and we got 24 days to give us all the opportunity to be in a place where next january next february next march we can actually do something about this instead of just talking about it so thank you all so much thank you uh thank you regina uh and shiv especially and uh look forward to any thoughts or questions that the folks may have for us um actually that's a perfect segue robin ins has a quest has actually a couple questions go ahead robin okay the first one i'm so happy to see that you've already got a bill passed for um universal background checks and i think that's in the house in the house i think it's a great start but we know that the people that get guns are not going to get background checks because they get them in the dark market so i think it's a good place to begin i'd love to see if we could maybe add some psychiatric questionnaires to go along with the background checks and fingerprinting so there is a national registry for any gun owner that's correct and that's why it has to be universal it's not have different background check systems in different states we've got a good one in new jersey right but there has to be a national database here right so if you're from idaho and you try to buy a gun in virginia and you've had issues that that cause you to be on that list it's instantly known um and uh you know mental health issues this is sensitive right because we don't want you know just because you've seen a counselor at some point that shouldn't mean that you're put on some you know put on a list but with the most serious mental health issues yes absolutely um and it's important that universal also means that it applies to all gun purchases not just at a gun store but at a gun show for example online purchases all these other ways that people can can purchase weapons and i think if we do that if we did that we really would capture um a huge share of what we're worried about most of the mass shootings that we've seen uh in our country the the really har you know every incident is horrible but the mass incidents uh the shooter purchased their weapon perfectly legally not on the black market um and a background check wouldn't have caught all of them but it would have caught some of them um so there's not you know also not one answer right do you need the background checks you need the the bands on certain kinds of weapons that are particularly uh damaging um harder for police to deal with right if you're if you're a cop you'd rather deal with someone with a handgun than somebody with an ak-47 with a 50 round magazine right exactly and then these red flag laws i think are also very important by the way this was you know i'm a democrat the red flag laws were originally a republican idea and a very good one um that basically says if if you know somebody could be someone in your family it could be a neighbor co-worker and you see that they're stocking up on guns and ammo and they're behaving strangely maybe they've been threatening people but they haven't committed a crime yet you can go to uh local law enforcement and with a judge's order they can take that person's guns away at least temporarily and in new jersey we've been doing that now uh that law passed i think just last year and we've we've stopped some really nasty things from happening just with that one great great thank you thank you thanks robin um we have another question from nagash so first of all my heart goes out to regina um you know i i can't begin to express uh so but congressman you know how do you get a buy-in of those folks who you know love these guns for sports hunting etc to make it possible that sensible gun laws can be passed you know the whole society seems to be just so polarized because of the whole politics of this so yeah this is a that's a really good question because on the one hand i think that our arguments are very reasonable and that they should be appealing to responsible gun owners to people who own guns to protect their homes or maybe they like to hunt or go to the target range but they're law-abiding people and they they they keep their guns safely and folks like that have nothing to worry about rationally from the sensible gun laws that we're promoting um unfortunately politics isn't very rational right now in america and the other side has convinced some of those sensible gun owners that we just want to take away all their guns and that if we do these five reasonable things well that's just a first step to something much more radical of the government coming to their house and forcibly confiscating legal firearms that they that they own um so that's a big challenge to overcome and yet and yet despite that despite all the polarization and you know people are on facebook and youtube and and they're only seeing stuff from their own side despite that about 90 percent of americans say that they're for universal background checks um we heard from shannon overwhelming majority of gun owners say that they are for universal background checks because after all that's just a check right to make sure that you're you know you're a law-abiding person that you're you know you're not going to do something crazy and and so that's where i get to the next question like even if you can convince a huge majority of americans that that you're right why is it that we don't get the laws passed we're supposed to be a democracy where politicians do what the majority wants most of the time why is that not happening here and i think it's partly the money it's partly because in the past we haven't made a devoting issue like we'll raise our hands and say we're for that but then when we go to vote we don't make it the issue where if you don't agree with me i'm not going to vote for you whereas the nra did succeed in getting people to say if you're for gun control we're not going to vote for you that's changing thank you thanks congressman ship i have a question for you um are you do you vote are you old enough to vote do you believe me voting this november but obviously this is something that's important to you what do you feel is at stake this november why are you yeah well this november uh obviously like you said i'm not old enough to vote but this november specifically is one of the most consequential elections in our history as americans because there really is so much state so much at stake depending on who's elected both in the white house and to congress and even locally in the state of assembly it's so so important with so many social justice issues like gun violence prevention like climate like climate change um like protesting like so so many basic human rights just aren't available for so many americans and it's really unfortunate that that's the way it is and it's unfortunate that things like the right to live have become a political issue and that all these social justice issues do end up impacting like communities like marginalized communities even more so than anywhere else and right now if we don't vote and use our ballots to propel our voices and to propel our thoughts forward there's no there's no uh there you can even begin to guess like what could come next over the next decade in the next century good do you think um are your parents listening to you i mean do you think like high school age kids who are active on this issue are you able to influence your parents and grandparents and your crazy uncle uh who uh likes to hunt and all that stuff you're still muted there you go yeah sorry uh it wasn't letting me unmute myself oh yeah i do think that my parents haven't listening to what i'm saying they're both here watching right now i think they agree with me that over time i think i'm slowly starting to convince them as to why i'm right i think i usually am well that's the story of uh that's the story of uh of life right there they are sometimes right though you know that right sometimes okay sometimes we know what we're talking about thank you we have another question from julia hi i didn't realize i get to say it um i had a couple of questions but one the congressman you mentioned it earlier when you were talking about police what i keep on wondering is how do we encourage police unions and other police entities to support gun legislation i don't see how police can do their jobs well if the you know citizens are out on the street as you mentioned with guns it seems like there's an opportunity there to work with um you know the police force and law enforcement yeah another really good question and locally i think we're we're okay on this i talked to a lot of police chiefs in my district and they're just sensible and pragmatic and no they absolutely don't want people armed with assault rifles they absolutely want background checks they absolutely like the red flag laws because it gives them right this they it gives them a tool to to try to get uh get somebody disarmed if they could pose a threat to uh the community uh at the same time a lot of them are personally gun owners right so they they they come from a culture of gun ownership and so they would be skeptical of um of us if they felt like we were attacking that culture um the idea that somebody can have a gun in their home responsibly to protect their families but if it's about sensible regulation to protect the community to prevent violence to protect police officers then they can and absolutely should be allies in in this in this fight um again like i i i always say that um you know the the cops are the good guys with a gun um in these situations where there's a mass shooting right i want in that situation i don't want the cop to be outgunned by a mass shooter i want a cop with a handgun having to face off with someone with an ar-15 rifle um and getting their voices on side is uh is really important and then you know we have a whole other controversy in this country right about police officers using excess force um and police officers uh treating people particularly people of color badly at traffic stops and and on the streets and there's no excuse for that and i believe you know rule of law means that police officers should be held accountable just as all of us are held accountable when we cross a line but i also do put myself in the shoes of a police officer being out there knowing that anyone can have a gun right some of this some of this violence that we have seen is a product of police officers having to assume like every time you do a traffic stop right you you assume that the person might have a gun and pull it on you and if that's what you assume you are naturally going to be more suspicious more trigger-happy yourself more prone to escalate the situation because you're afraid that the other person may escalate it first if you don't so totally this is this this agenda protects police officers it protects all of us from gun violence from excessive use of force by police all these things come together thanks julia for that question um next we have a question from marcie bandelli who i know has been fighting for on this issue for a long long time go ahead marseille hi how is everybody regina um my condolences um i can't imagine what you're going through and i'm just so sorry that you and your family had to go through this um so after sandy hook i got very involved in gun violence and put a lot of pressure on leonard he's no longer here thank goodness um so i mean and the big obstacle back then and still is is the nra and i know that they've run into financial problems and have criminal charges against the leadership there but i was wondering congressman if you have any information about whether or not um they're closing their doors or if their influence has become less as a lobbying group their influence has become less absolutely um they are spending i i don't have the numbers off the top of my head but they're spending significantly less money in this election cycle than they have in past election cycles like by a factor of three four five to one i think and i think that is i think that's going to be very impactful um again i think there are two reasons why politicians don't listen to the majority of the people on this number one it's the money and number two it's the fact that the the the pro-nra crowd um there are voters on that side who just so obsess about this that they make it a voting issue every time uh and we haven't um we haven't approached it with the same degree of passion and toughness like you know if you're my representative you you vote the wrong way we're gonna throw you out um but you know i think that this is a little uh you know bring it back to my race i i would point out to to you marcy that that your state senator for the last whatever 15 years has been voting with the nra in trenton against all the gun laws that keep our kids safe in our communities and how many people in westfield and summit and cranford uh in springfield and all these towns even know that we're trying to let everybody know that i think i think for congress right it's a little easier but but it just it wasn't like most most folks were for sensible gun laws but they weren't mobilized to make it a decisive issue in an election because after all they kept on reelecting somebody who disagreed with them and so it's partly the money but it's also partly on us right like we we have to be educated voters and community leaders and we got to point that if somebody is not fighting for us on this issue then they're not earning our vote to be re-elected so those are the two things thanks marcie that's actually a perfect segue phyllis peterson has a question about and citizens united or citizens united not in citizens united go ahead fellas hi tom um i'm asking the question about the point you made that the nra has so much money they are able to influence or they did at least in the past but there are others so many corporations with dark money influencing what happens in our state houses and in dc ginsburg uh the gear related uh ginsburg said that citizens united was the worst decision that the supreme court ever made with trump's nomination of coney barnett barrett it seems like it will be a done deal by inauguration day at least what recourse do the democrats have for having the court already packed with conservatives sure so citizens united for those of you who uh if anybody um doesn't know this it's it's a supreme court decision that says that um that that the corporations are people and money is speech right so if i spend money to influence an election that's like speech and freedom of speech means you cannot limit the amount of money that i spent and corporations are people so a corporation can also spend an unlimited amount of money trying to influence an election and that's a big part of the problem we've been talking about so you know some of the the big funding for the nra has come from as you would expect gun manufacturers right big corporations that have a huge stake in uh preventing these laws from being passed enough that they'll spend tens of millions of dollars a year fighting it through their donations the nra and individual candidates so what can we do about it you're absolutely right the supreme court is not going to reverse itself so on this one we're going to need a constitutional amendment there really is no way around that and uh that's tough to do but the good news is most people are for it it's one of the most popular things if i'm out there on the stump if i say i'm for a constitutional amendment to repeal this citizens united decision so that corporations can't spend unlimited amount of money trying to buy elections that's not just democrats who love that republicans love every norm like ordinary people are all for that so it's actually i think a viable thing uh if you know we got to win the senate in the house to to get the ball uh rolling in the meantime there are some things we can do that don't require a constitutional amendment like uh making sure that there's transparency that every donation to any group that's trying to influence an election is publicly reported um that's something we passed in the house uh in 2019. mcconnell won't let it go but we can get that done if we uh if we take back the senate so um so that's the deal we can do this uh we we don't have to rely on the courts as long as we have the congress in the white house there's a lot we can do thank you congressman and that brings us to the end of our round table again regina i want to thank you so much for being here for sharing your son's beautiful life with us um and we are so sorry for your loss and shiv thank you so much for giving us all hope that um young people will save us and again congressman malinowski thank you for bringing us all together thank you everyone have a wonderful afternoon and safely and be well thank you regina thank you chef be well thank you congressman

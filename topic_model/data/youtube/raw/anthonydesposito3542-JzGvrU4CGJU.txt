I always say that I guess during some of the darkest times in our nation in our state in our town in our village whether it was you know after 9/11 after Hurricane sandy or now during the corona virus pandemic it really brings out the very best in humanity and I think we all pray that the very best in humanity lasts for months and months down the road and people don't forget about it but this is a time where our front line workforce are cops our firemen our EMS our hospital workers our grocers our sanitation our municipal employees are really on the front lines and and like mayor Beach said it is a pretty awesome thing to come into work and see that someone put their heart into something to keep you safe I think you know as someone who sort of grown up in the in the public safety world I was a chief in the fire department and NYPD detective and I think you're always tasked with protecting others and it's nice when the people that you serve choose to protect you and that's what you have all bought in this is a time where I said before it's just us ordinary citizens ordinary residents doing extraordinary things and each one of you has done something extraordinary you may not think it is really it has by putting these masks together by taking the time by putting your hard work and and love into them you really are protecting someone who's out on the front line so so all of you thank you keep up the great work god bless and I think better days are definitely god bless

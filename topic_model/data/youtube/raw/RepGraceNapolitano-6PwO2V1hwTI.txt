Thank You mr. chairman there's a lot of questions that I would have them in time will not permit you ask all of them but we know that drilling is not going to solve the issue I think we need to look for more alternative ways to produce the energy that is necessary whether it's performing or for running the diesel fuel trucks or the equipment that is needed in farms I've been to some of the research institutions where they're using LJ trying to produce some fuel for John Deere I'm not sure if you're aware of that but that's something futuristic and who knows maybe that'll become come to fruition someday but Mr Shaw Croft if the entire outer continental shelf were opened the drilling it only increased the old production by one point six percent by the year twenty thirty in peak at point seven eight sent barrel-per-day reduced world prices by seventy cents per barrel the BLM stays that out of 41 million acres already under lease on shore only 12 million acres less than one-third or thirty percent is actually in production in the last two years us is increased oil production by more than a third in 2010 the bureau of ocean management offered 37 million acres in the Gulf however all companies are only producing on 6.5 million acres which is seventy percent so wouldn't it be possible that we can't continue to rely on all production and should be focusing time and funding to our renewable energies to supplant our needs and I do agree with your statement energy independence should be our nation's focused and I think that's this administration has been doing that very well and again on the research those are issues that are critical for me and then to the farmers is additional improvements in manufacturing producing the largest crowds especially when it deals to water and the ranking member and water and power and waters of commodity we no longer have too much of so I'll lay in on you and if you will address those thank you ma'am mr. palitana as well as the committee several issues you have raised certainly we do believe in developing renewable energies and we believe that even futuristic energies that are being developed now we need to be working on those things so that when they become economically viable and they really provide a solution or a supplement to our need today that needs to be pursued you raise the issue of leases and production there's another important component that I believe has been mentioned very clearly today and that is the permitting process just because an oil company has a perm a lease in an area does not mean that they have a permit to extract what we need out of those lands they may not have applied for those permits or they may not have that's true and if they do not know as I think miss harbor mentioned they may not know exactly what the rules of the game so to speak are going to be and that is very an uncertainty of which oil company is not willing to take we face the same thing as far as uncertainty is what our fuel costs are going to be for the coming growing season I'm very troubled by the fact that diesel fuel very likely will be over four dollars a gallon probably maybe over five dollars a gallon for the summer when we move our cattle to and from the range last year it costs us four dollars per loaded mile this year I don't know what it'll be five six it's a very scary situation die answer your questions adequately ma'am Oh sort of kind of anybody else I have limited time so I wanted to certainly sure that I get an opportunity for somebody else to answer I think we agree on a number of the points that you just raised we are going to need multiple options going forward to secure energy future but that doesn't mean shutting off the options we have today I think I would comment on your estimate about the amount of oil that might be on the outer continental shelf that is based on 35 year old data and has not been updated yet and we need access to the shelf for the industry who is best positioned really to know is you know that was mentioned earlier about where are the highest probability potential reservoirs and so we are going to need lots of options let's use today's and invest in tomorrow's as well thank you mr. Fox the administration's 2012 budget request for per acre-foot pardalis breaker foot for an unproduced producing federal oil and gas leases which would provide incentive for the oil and gas companies to duce more resources the HR 927 the United States exploration and idle tracks introduced by a ranking member and representative hold also institutes this fee and repeals deep gas industry royal relief is this your organization supportive of the budget request and of this provision in the legislation and if not what improvements can should be made I don't know enough about that particular provision to answer that question accurately thank you very much thank you mr. chair

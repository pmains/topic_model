Thank You mr. chairman my questions relate to the zero-sum decisions we seem to be making relative to our fits generation and fourth gen fighting aircraft my first question is whether or not the manufacturing base has been a consideration in the decision to upgrade at the f-15 so I think when we looked at the factors that we talked about there is you want to maintain a competitive industrial base you also want to make sure you have weapon systems with the right mix of capacity and capability and there's a mix between them and here we're gonna go through the capability but specifically as to the manufacturing base is that your view that this decision to make the f-15 upgrades is essential in that the manufacturing base justifies that decision I don't know if it justifies it by itself I just think it's um it's a factor that needs to be considered how many f-35 days can we build in FY 2020 I need to get you that number what's the their production rate for the show yeah what's our what's our manufacturing capacity for the aircraft that we've spent the better part of several decades getting ready to launch into the skies we've got 78 in the budget I don't know what their capacity is per year procurement cost has been another justification for the decision to purchase fewer f-35s and and to have the f-15 X options that have been laid out when you finish the f-15 upgrades with the full complement of targeting pods and sensors and jammers what's the Flyway cost I I don't have the specifics on five it costs the life the maintenance and operating cost of them will still be lower I'm get to that I my first procurement cost is it it was an assumption we made that the procurement cost of the f-15 upgrades would be less than buying more f-35 days I believe the main driver was in the the maintenance and the sustainment cost the procurement costs were different but they were not as dramatically different as the others which the procurement cost of which is lower how about that of the fourth generation so what you're telling me is it's cheaper to buy an upgrade a fourth or a fourth gen f15 ex than it is with the fly would cost with f-35 a I believe so can you do that for that guy No put those numbers together for the for the committee's I'm looking at an 80 million dollar flyaway cost on the 35 a and then once you lash the necessary you know electronic weapons pod and another tech to the f-15 X you're looking at a nine to 100 million dollar fly weight cost is that sound I'm not sure what other additional things you're attaching to it depends on the mission you're asking it to perform I would only the the mission set that we would assume when we make these budgetary to see if you could provide for the record for me the detailed breakdown on / not maintenance cost procurement cost on these two weapon systems I would be most helpful sure operational cost you were making a point about that as well what's the basis for the view that the f-15 X level lower operational cost so there's an analysis that was done by our Cape for ghen ization that went through and compared the the set of them because you talked about there's the purchase cost the sustained maintenance cost and basically the lifecycle cost when you think of how long the aircraft lasts and it also compares it for the different missions we need them perform if you're operating in a permissive environment where you're looking at the capacity of the ability of the plane to do strike versus welded rate what's our on the f-15 X what does it cost per hour to fly it I don't have those for me I know that they're they're available but I don't even bring them with me - so as you guys provide for the record for me the the procurement cost breakdown x first the 35 a would be really helpful to have the melded rate on hourly cost to fly the 35 a and the f-15 x because i'm looking at some data that says that by 2025 we're gonna drive down that cost on the 35 a to $25,000 per flying hour with a melded understanding they're different missions but as a melded rate and that's a year after the budget says we would have the first operational 15 x's so presumably that would be a number consistent with the data that showed that to be 27 to 30 thousand dollars per flying hours so if you can break that down for me we'd be happy to nice one of things we'd ask people to assemble because following the the briefings on the mix these were some of the common questions that we wanted to do is give every one of the committees the exact same set of data so that they understood the I mean I you know because there seems to be a pretty deliberate decision to lean into that f15 X and so I would have thought that that would be really relevant information for a budget discussion I want to take my final moments to just ask secretary Shanahan you know can you explain the ways in which these budget priorities recognize the changing environment in the Western Hemisphere Venezuela and how am I going to make sure we support SOUTHCOM effectively yeah so the one of the fundamental assumptions that we've been building into the force mix and the force design you can do that in 30 seconds that'll work okay yeah no I'll do it even even more quickly we've designed this and the Chairman has been extraordinarily helpful here dynamic force employment so we can move forces quickly and reconstitute them in areas where there's demand and to increase interoperability that flexibility allows us then to surge in the case of SOCOM when they have a different mission or they need to search for a short period of time but not to fundamentally change their footprint Thank You mr. chairman I yield back

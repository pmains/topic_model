questions that are a continuation frankly of conversations we've had earlier this week in rules committee uh broadly related to attempts to reform the electoral account act uh judiciary committee just uh yesterday on the rise of threats to elections officials election administrators and it stems from a briefing held earlier this week by assistant attorney general polite took place on monday when he indicated that the department of justice elections threats task force has reviewed over a thousand contacts reported as hostile or harassing by the election community of these thousand contacts about 11 were found to warrant a federal criminal investigation and about four cases have been charged so far so from 1 000 to 11 of those do the math you know four cases have been charged but first question is besides the thousand contacts that the task force has reportedly reviewed are there additional contacts that are waiting to be reviewed how familiarity this with uh this activity uh i'm not sure i'm uh intimately familiar with the flow of the numbers i know that we are there's been a significant significant over the last year last 12 months uptake in engagement with state and local election officials i think it's been table top exercises lots of outreach both the attorney general the deputy attorney general and i have done calls with you know a thousand plus election uh workers uh and officials um and so i i'm not sure i think it probably would get lost in the numbers a little bit that's fine i guess the more important question is as a matter of policy so forget the numbers for a second to your knowledge does the task force review every contact that's been reported as hostile uh to my knowledge but i we i'd have to circle back to you in case there's some clarification clarification on the policy of what to further investigate post report versus what not um and in the same spirit uh safety of elections administrators obviously we're living in an era where elections workers whether it's at the state level the local level or even volunteers feel that they're under increased threat from election deniers and others who may wish them harm i believe it's critical that the federal government demonstrate that it stands ready to respond to the election community's concerns and doing that requires an adequate allocation of resources to the problem so the first follow-up question uh to what i asked assistant attorney general police yesterday is in each of the fbi field offices is there a special agent assigned specifically to the task of responding to concerns raised about election threats coordinating a response or is it yet an additional responsibility on top of other work well let me answer your question this way we have at the fbi in every field office somebody who's specifically designated as an election crimes coordinator um and that is their responsibility and that's a program that we've had in place for a while i will say that with the uptick in the trend that you're talking about the the burden or the the workload of those people has has significantly grown right i think before those those coordinators would see a huge uptick in in work around the time of an election right but now with election-related violence or political violence becoming an almost 365 days a year phenomenon those folks are i think even more taxed and of course as i mentioned earlier in response to your other question with the significant uptick in engagement between the fbi all the field offices and their state local election counterparts the job has has grown significantly yeah and let me just emphasize the point that that you just made uh because i think it bears highlighting uh it's no longer just around election time when this starts up when i when i served as california secretary of state we started making routes to fusion to getting everybody sort of focused on this post to 2016 election right because the world changed in that cycle um it wasn't just election day it's the lead up to election day what are the registration deadlines the vote by mail deadlines etc but to underscore how year round this is now i mean it's been almost two years since the november 2020 election and yes or no are there people still challenging the results of the november 2020 election and not just social media posts and tweets but activity including threatening activity that stems from that yes or no well certainly all of the various election-related threats that we contend with uh have become more of a uh ubiquitous uh all year long phenomena not just the ones that you mentioned but also uh you know we haven't talked about the malign foreign influence piece the foreign governments and their efforts um you know a lot of people don't realize this because they tend to you know focus just on the on the election time but those efforts the malign foreign influence piece cyber targeting and other efforts those are happening same way pretty much all year long all right so one more statement and one final question the statement is this because they appreciate how quickly the fbi other departments and agencies have had to come up to speed on misinformation the space this information the space the dangers physical and otherwise that it creates undermining confidence in our democracy the electoral process uh specifically and the general policy of the fbi and others not taking public actions or making statements close to an election or as it pertains to candidates for office when you now have more and more of election deniers and conspiracy theorists running for office and specifically for offices related to election administration at the state and local level i truly hope that we are thinking ahead on that and strategizing how to maintain the policies of uh neutrality not being political but at the same time doing what's necessary to defend our democracy final question what else do you need from congress or this committee specifically but chronicles more broadly in order to receive adequate resourcing and attention to these issues uh well we our budget request i think calls for a significant upgrades to our i.t systems we talked earlier in response to one of the earlier questions about the importance of ai and things like that uh we've also asked for on the cyber side because that's kind of cutting across everything some significant increases there so those are some of the things i would call out there's a number of them in the uh the budget request uh but that are particularly important as we try to get ahead of the threats you know i think that's one of the things that we all need to be getting better at is trying to focus on where's the threat going to be a year and a half from now two years from now five years from now not just tomorrow okay thank you very much senator padilla senator kennedy

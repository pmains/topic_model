now we're here on set with me Democratic congressman from connecticut jim Himes Jim happy new year Thanks fine all right listen so the general consensus this is the president's chance to hit the reset button I mean you know you came in after the second inauguration with a lot of ambition and it's just didn't quite work out for whatever reason and so now we're going into 2014 our NBC news politics team really looking at six things to expect in the address the growing issue of income inequality may be number one in terms of themes what do you want to hear tomorrow well um yeah there's a lot the president needs to do tomorrow night and as your report has said you know he sees fighting some some cross-currency had a lousy 2013 people are rightly concerned about the functionality of their government but look I think the term reset is a little strong no single speech of course is going to you know dramatically improve his popularity ratings or a course change the nature of the majority party in the in the house which has you know single-mindedly dedicated itself to stopping his agenda so what what I hope to hear and you know we hear all this buzz about is he gonna you know talk about the executive actions he can undertake more than anything I hope to hear is that is that he needs to continue to pound the vision that he has for this country and that's a vision of course that has bipartisan support infrastructure investment right I mean I come from a state in a region where trains are you know getting derailed and whatnot education by the way as a as an absolutely essential way of dealing with the inequality that will be part of his theme so that big vision even though it's not gonna be fully achievable is important well you have supported the infrastructure Bank which is something he's been positive on as well in the past which hasn't been done but quickly before I move on to something I want to show you from Ted Cruz people who don't know your district and from you talk about income inequality you mean fairfield county one of your dishes were the richest in the country but you have Bridgeport Connecticut which is a city that's had its struggles and has a lot of lower-income and middle-income constituents for you what do you need to better balance your serving those two crowds you know what what those two crowds understand and of course the the president's opponents are going to say that he's turning Americans against each other with those two crowds and by the way with the American middle-class understands is that there needs to be a system which is fair and that doesn't mean at the end of the day this is why the term income inequality can be problematic uh what we're not what nobody in America i think is seeking to achieve is everybody having the exact same income the languages i think people understand whether they're in bridgeport middle-class are wealthy in a place like Greenwich is that we should all start with equal opportunity that your life shouldn't be determined whether you were born in backcountry Greenwich or an inner-city Bridgeport that's where we need to focus it's not not so much the isms of redistribution of wealth it's about equal opportunity and I think it's a key thing to talk about senator Ted Cruz he went on TV yesterday reprising the rhetoric on Obamacare basically I want to play a clip of it and what he thinks the president should do tomorrow I then I want to get your reaction I have a listen Obamacare is a disaster and you know for the state of the union one of the things President Obama really ought to do is look in the TV camera and say to the over five million Americans all across this country who had their health insurance canceled because of Obamacare to look in the camera and say I'm sorry The Washington Post points out that quote Republicans hope to make Obama's health care law a centerpiece of their midterm election message but the new poll shows that it is a less important issue for voters than in 2010 you obviously you're going to have a race in 2014 how much do you expect that to be the central issue that is run against you well you know the more Ted Cruz and Mike please speak and I understand they're both giving responses the president even the more they speak the better off i personally am in the sense that you know swing voters in my district and this is Connecticut more you know just listen to Ted Cruz and Mike Lee and say oh by the way Republicans say what what in the world has become of my party look Ted Cruz gave a remarkably fact-free statement there you know he didn't talk about 10 million Americans who now have insurance for the first time as a result of Obamacare he didn't talk about 40 do you think that'll be the number one thing stuck in your face not no look I've been you know I've been in the the Affordable Care Act has been a big part of the political environment for the last four years what's different now versus four years ago when of course the mic root the Ted Cruz's at the time we're talking about death panels is that now American see the reality and of course the reality is is not unblemished I've been since the law was passed that there's things that we should fix but now Americans are coming to understand that a lot of people are getting health insurance the costs are coming down that there are benefits so I think it's going to be a at worst an ambiguous uh political effect on November I just very quickly worked out in time obviously congressional approval ratings what they are president says executive orders might be something he'll use a lot does that bother you you okay with that well you know obviously as a member of Congress I hope that the president doesn't stand in front of Congress and say I'm doing this all without you I hope that he paints a vision and then he says join me on these things so that we can get something done I think you know the pendulums beginning to swing we got a budget done for the first time in four or five years you know with a lot of votes so I think the environment is not healthy yet but getting better all right congressman jim Himes of connecticut safe travels down DC we appreciate it thanks all right

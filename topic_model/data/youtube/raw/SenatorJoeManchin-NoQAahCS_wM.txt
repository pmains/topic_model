West Virginia is one of
the most patriotic states in the nation. And that's
why I was proud to help Mrs. Vernon Young of
Charleston obtain replacement medals earned
by her late husband during World War Two. Mr. Kester
Young served in the United States Army as a
communications chief from 1942 to 1944 and suffered
a shrapnel injury while he was stationed in France.
When Mrs. Young reached out to my office, she
didn't know what medals he had earned because he
never spoke to her about his service. My caseworker
Kim Berry was able to secure Mr. Young's
replacement medals from the Army. I'm proud to
report that my staff recently delivered these
medals to Mrs. Young at her home in Charleston. I do appreciate everything
he's done to get these medals for me. I really
want to thank him from the bottom of my heart, for
getting these for me, and something I can give to my
daughter, and my grandson. That's all I have. It was an honor to assist
this wonderful family and honoring a true West
Virginia hero and thanking him and the family for his
service. If you or someone you know is in need of
assistance with a state or federal agency, please
contact my office at 304-342-5855. My staff and
I are always ready to help fellow West Virginians
wherever you may be.

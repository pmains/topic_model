look my last memories of afghanistan were in uh june 2012 and um i was blind at the time i'd just been blown up and uh but i could hear and uh what i could hear was the the cries from rachman rockman was our interpreter who stepped on the ied right in front of me and he was still alive he later died he was the kind of guy who were leaving behind he was the kind of allies that we had these people who would sacrifice for our country as i was moved to the to the uh evac helicopter they were laying down cover fire for me one of those guys laying down cover fire his name was dave orson two months later he was dead in a helicopter crash with one of my other best friends pat feeks you know the question is do these guys die in vain it's a question a lot of our veterans are asking after this bungled exit from afghanistan and the answer is no because there was a realization that for 20 years we were keeping america safe from another 911. unfortunately our politicians never really clearly articulated that to the american people and that lack of communication resulted in this mess that we're in now there's going to be a reckoning for the decisions that led up to this but you know we we talk about accountability in the seal teams quite a bit hyper accountability really everything is your fault even if it's not because it must be that's leadership accountability for your actions accountability for what wrong what went wrong admission that something went wrong how about that and then doing things taking actions to fix it that's what we've been asking for for weeks when we still had a chance i asked this administration go back on offense reset the chess board you've screwed things up admit it now reset the chest forward and regain our leverage they said no they wanted to stick to their arbitrary surrender deadline and they left so what is today about it's about fixing this it's about taking action but first the administration has to admit it's wrong stop running victory laps it's like the arsonist claiming they did a really great job putting the fire out when in fact there's actually still people inside that's the kind of analogy that we have here no admission that anything's wrong running victory laps and refusal to do anything about it then when we come today the speaker of the house can't even show up she sent a different representative in her stead she couldn't even show up to face us and say that she will not allow this bill to go forward this is a common sense bill again behind closed doors democrats have asked for the same things accountability of what's there accountability of who's there and then a plan for how we're going to get them out pretty simple just a plan just a recognition that there's even a problem and that we need to address it and of course not recognizing the taliban stop giving in to the taliban i can't believe we even have to ask for that i can't believe secretary blinken is even toying with the idea that these illegitimate terrorists could ever be recognized as a government they're on our terrorist watch list they they were they were driving around our blackhawk helicopters with our allies hanging from below them they're going around and killing sprees killing american citizens and allies that's who these people are that's who they always were that's why we had to fight them we ended no wars yesterday we're still at war and it's time that our administration actually recognizes that and recognizes that there's american citizens on the ground still at war and we need to get them out

to kansas senator uh physician by training roger marshall with us right now senator you have never been a big fan of the the spending involved in the latest so-called inflation reduction act including beefing up funding for the irs and those thousands of agents development like this and a security review has probably got to add to that concern yeah neil if we're going to hire 87 000 more federal employees they need to go to the border we need border patrol officers not more irs agents i'm very concerned with this labor shortage that we have taking eighty seven thousand people out of the private workforce and putting them into non-productive government situation as well i look i ran a small business i signed a paycheck every other week for some 25 years for up to 300 people those small businesses are going to get hammered by these audits it's going to cost a small business 10 to 25 000 to defend the audit and really it's just money down the drain it doesn't really go to grow the economy at all it's they're going to come after small business owners as well as those moderate income folks we're going to bear the brunt of this once again you've probably heard senator that the democrats the white house and generals say republicans are scaring people here it's not like a gestapo uh hunt of tax cheats and all the rest that with 50 000 retirees planned at the agency the net gain is not going to be nearly so oppressive in agents what do you say to that well i'm concerned about why are they arming these agents why is the irs buying all these weapons um and i'm concerned about just the audience they're going to be creative they say they're not doing that senator i mean i but but go ahead well yeah i i we will see where they end up right i think regardless at the end of the day we're going to be audited and it's very expensive to defend these audits that's why we're introducing legislation that would make the irs pay your legal and accounting fees if they take you to an audit and they're wrong so i think that that'll that'll get rid of some of the uh the frivolous suits that we're going to see out of this now they've also said senator you've probably heard this as well that this isn't meant to target anyone who's making 400 000 or less that this is really looking at the business and wealthy tax cheats and the rest but when i brought this up with administration officials and pointed out that that crowd the 400 000 under crowd say what you will of what constitutes rich represents about 60 of our tax revenues that come into washington so if you're deliberately saying they're not part of this then does that mean uh they can do whatever they want or that they're getting some false assurances here again i go back to my concern about small businesses but we asked the democrat senators to put that in writing that they wouldn't do any special audits of people in that under 400 200 000 income level and they refused to put it in writing uh and so they had the chance just what else you do with 87 000 agents there's there can't be what a thousand billionaires out there eventually it's going to work themselves down to hard-working americans having defend audits all right senator thank you very very much roger marshall joining us right now position by training now

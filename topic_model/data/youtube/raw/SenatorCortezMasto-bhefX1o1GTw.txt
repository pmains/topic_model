mr. Zuckerberg thank you been a long afternoon and I appreciate you being here and taking the time with every single one of us I'm gonna echo a lot of what I've heard my colleagues say today as well appreciate you being here appreciate the apology but stop apologizing and let's make the change I think it's time to really change the conduct I appreciate the fact that we talked about their principles for Facebook notice users on the use of the data and that users have complete control of their data but the skepticism that I have and I'm hoping you can help me with this is over the last what seven years seven 14 years seven years I haven't seen really much change in ensuring that the privacy is there and that individual users have control over their data so let me let me ask you this back in 2009 you made two changes to your privacy policy and in fact prior to that most users could either identify only friends or friends of friends as part of their their privacy correct if they wanted to protect their data they could I identify only friends or friends of friends who could see their data isn't that correct senator I believe that we've had the option for people to share with friends friends of friends a custom audience or publicly for a long time I don't remember exactly when we put that in place but I believe it was before 2000 so either you can choose only friends or friends of friends to decide how you're going to share that protect that data correct those are two of the options okay and in 2011 when the FTC started taking a look at this they were concerned that if somebody chose only friends that the individual user was under the impression they can continue to restrict sharing of data to limited audience but that wasn't the case and in fact selecting friends only did not prevent users information from being shared with their third-party applications their friend used isn't that the case and that's why the FTC was looking at at you and making that change because there was concern that if you had friends on your page a third party could access that information isn't that correct senator I don't remember the exact context that the so let me let me help you here because David Vladek who was spent nearly four years as director of the Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection where he worked including on the FTC's enforcement case against Facebook basically identifies in this article that that was the case that not only did facebook misrepresent and that's why there were eight counts of deceptive acts and practices the actual FTC in November's twenty eleven decree basically stated required Facebook to give users clear and conspicuous notice and to obtain affirmative might jump back here to do three things the decree barred Facebook from making any further deceptive privacy claims and it required Facebook get consumers approval before changing the way it shares their data and most importantly the third thing it required Facebook to give users clear and conspicuous notice and to obtain affirmative express consent before sharing their data with third parties that was part of the FTC consent decree correct senator that sounds right to me okay so at that time you're on notice that there were concerns about the sharing of data and information users data including those friends with third parties correct senator my understanding well let me ask you this let me do it this way in response to the FTC consent to make those changes did you make those changes and what did you do to ensure individuals user data was protected and they had notice of that information and that potentially third parties would be accessing that and they had to give express consent what did you specifically do in response to that senator a number of things one of the most important parts of the FTC consent decree that we signed was establishing a robust privacy program at the company headed by our chief privacy officer Aaron Egan was specifics on it and I know I and I've heard this over and over again I'm running out of time but here's the concern that I have it can't be a privacy policy because that's what the consent said it couldn't be it had to be something very specific something very simple like you've heard from my colleagues and that did not occur had that occurred we wouldn't be here today talking about Cambridge analytic oh isn't that really true had you addressed those issues then had you done an audit had you looked at not only the third-party applications but their audit of their associated data storage as well you would have known that this type of data information was being shared and that's our concern and that's what I'm saying now the time just to make the change it's time to really address the privacy issue it's time to really come and lead the country on this issue and how we can protect individual users data and information I know my time is running out but I appreciate you being here and I'm just hoping that you're committed to working with us in the future and addressing these concerns

my next guest is this distinguished diplomat he's a former businessman he was the ambassador to japan did a heck of a great job and now he is being punished for his sins by becoming the new senator from tennessee i've got a pop question for him right off the bat welcome senator bill haggerty old friend here's my question are you ready what is the single best thing the u.s congress can do to launch an economic boom well the first thing we can do is retain the jobs tax cut act that you worked so hard to put in place and president trump back back in 2017 we got our economy off to a huge boom you brought about a blue collar boom larry when you think about the policies that you and president trump work so hard to put in place under your leadership we saw our economy expand faster than any other major economy in the world blue collar workers got a disproportionate benefit from that their wages grew faster than white-collar workers it importantly delivered the best jobs growth ever recorded from minorities that's the type of thing we need to continue deregulation lower taxes a more business friendly climate and standing up to our opponents like china well senator haggerty uh you're right and of course flattery will get you everywhere with me we'll put that right on the table but well and by the way larry congratulations on the new show i love it i'm so honored to be one of your early guests that's the key point and you did such a great job for us we worked together but look bill i i got to tell you this i'm going to ask the pop q quiz question again right now you've got stimulus and reconciliation and minimum wages and all this rigmarole going through the house and the senate and democratic pork bills and whatever i want to just take it all off the table and say to you what is the single most important thing you could do to launch and maintain an economic boom which is gestating right now what is it getting vaccines into people's arms getting kids back to school and getting parents back to work that's what we need to be focused on larry i'm with you on that yes yes i mean really here's the bizarre to me this is the single biggest story we have in this country today the odd thing is the biden crowd is trying to hide the good news there's a lot of economic good news but the biggest good news right senator is the vaccine which came from operation warp speed which is now proliferating you know they got to think 70 million today the pharma companies came out and they're going to provide 300 million more uh respected scientists senator are suggesting if the pandemic doesn't end this spring or summer it's going to be rolling down it will not be a big factor to me let folks alone let the economy flourish let us have the freedom to work and invest before we do any fine-tuning that would be the key i'm with you on that larry if you think about what's happened already four trillion dollars worth of stimulus has been passed there's still a trillion dollars worth or close to a trillion dollars that hasn't even been spent yet and they're talking about putting another two trillion dollar package in place most of which i think 95 of which i read today won't even begin to get spent until 2022. last one real quick we you and i will come back and talk much more about china asia and japan but do you believe you were on the china trade team even though you were ambassador japan senator do you believe the biden crowd will stay tough with china will they no it's most disappointing i mean they need to wake up and understand that china is not just a competitor china is a key strategic adversary they come at us militarily they come at us diplomatically they come at us economically whether it's stealing our intellectual property and subsidizing their industries which takes away american jobs blue collar jobs militarily look at what they're doing right now in the south china sea in the east china sea they use their quote coast guard to run chinese chinese battleships essentially through japanese waters and chase off their trawlers their aggressiveness in that part of the world is amazing and we need to be standing up right now not standing back all right folks you can see why senator haggerty is going to be a big force in economic and foreign policy senator thank you very much good luck on your new tenure up next on cuddle lawmakers questions your own power about the need for more government spending

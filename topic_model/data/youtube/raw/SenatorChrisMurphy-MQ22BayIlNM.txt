very much let me let me reflect on senator Blumenthal thanks to all of you for being here with us today I wish you didn't have to be here we stand just in awe of your ability to grieve and to speak truth to power at the same time I don't know how you muster the strength to do this over and over and over again but you do and I know that you must wonder to yourselves why you keep on coming back here your after year when you don't see the progress that seems so obvious I know you must wonder whether it continues to make sense to march or to go to your state capital when the truth seems so clear and yet you feel like you're beating your head up against a wall I think part of what we want you to know is that what you are doing is absolutely working I wish this place worked faster but I have seen no issue move further than the issue of gun violence in the short time that I have been in the Senate right we couldn't win a single vote here in the months and year following Sandy Hook in the 2000s the NRA put a bill in front of Congress and it was passed within months they got everything they wanted well there has been a sea change here right the House of Representatives led by mike thompson and rosa DeLauro and others has passed in a bipartisan way legislation that's going to save lives we got very close over the course of this summer to convincing our colleagues in the Senate to pass a similar bill and it's not because our powers of persuasion all of a sudden got better it's because they're scared of losing their seats right they finally realize that our movement the anti gun violence movement is stronger than the gun lobby and so we are here to honor and remember those who have fallen but we are also here to remember that those great social change movements don't succeed overnight and that all we are seeing on a daily and weekly and monthly basis is progress we now pass more laws at the state level then the gun lobby does right we're winning more seats and more races than they are we have more advocates we have more voices we have more resources we have more money and if we continue to double down on that success then it is not a question of if Congress wakes up it is just a question of when now the question of wins is a really important one because every single day that you wait that's another 100 Americans most of them young Americans many of them victims of their own personal demons turning guns on themselves who perish and so we have to continue to act with urgency but we also have to act with confidence not just in the righteousness of our cause but in the efficacy of what we are doing I hope there's a day in which we don't have to gather here in this manner I hope there's a day in which we have one and we can gather in celebration of those wins but until then we recognize the righteousness of our cause we celebrate the fact that we can make sure that other families don't have to go through with the family standing here have gone through and I'm just so proud to be part of a delegation that cares and leads on this issue and to be part of a movement that is one that is going to be the most impactful of all that I have ever been a part of in my time in public service thank you all for being here today [Applause]

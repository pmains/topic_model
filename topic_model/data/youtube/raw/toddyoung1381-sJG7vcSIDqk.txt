tobacco use is the single most preventable cause of death in disease Indiana Republican senator Todd young helped introduce a bipartisan effort to raise the smoking age nationwide the state of Indiana ranks 45th in the country in terms of tobacco usage I know we can improve on that this is another step in the growing movement to extinguish youth nicotine addiction especially with the alarming rate at which children are now vaping during a one-year period from 2017 to 2018 saw an increase in utilization of these products by 78% among high school students nationally 95% of Americans begin using tobacco before age 21 if we can raise the age of purchase we can significantly reduce the number of people who begin using this product and we can avoid the deaths and adverse health outcomes associated with this I'm proud to be here to help introduce the tobacco to 21 act and to see this legislation move forward you

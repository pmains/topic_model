all right and welcome back this morning a stopgap bill to keep the government funded is on its way to the U.S house and that bill includes more than 12 billion dollars to help Ukraine joining us live now this morning to talk about the bill some of the challenges facing our country right now is Valley Congress member Jim Costa Congressman thank you so much for joining us this morning much Megan these are challenging times that we are living in for sure and first I mean of course we have our hurricane and coverage uh we're just thinking and praying for those in Florida right now hurricane Ian is wiping out roads infrastructure and this bill includes more than 18 billion for FEMA which is great support for them are there any sticking points in this that could come up between the two parties and somehow prevent this from being passed well I certainly hope not we all our hearts are with the folks in Florida for the devastating impacts of the hurricane and of course it's not over uh rebuilding uh so much of the the state that has been devastated and the hurricane sadly is now continuing to move on and it's going to be hitting South Carolina it just reminds us that with the impacts of China climate change that in fact we've got to ensure that we do everything we possibly can to protect the American public this funding for FEMA will go a long ways toward helping us rebuild but obviously a lot more that will have to be done and Congress and of course we want to talk about the war in Ukraine this is now more than half a year we've provided tens of billions of dollars in AIDS Ukraine we're providing now more weapons some helmar long-range missile systems but um you know President Putin made a direct threat of nuclear weapons do you think as someone who's been in Congress and seen and different conflicts before are we doing enough to deter Russia and have we been clear with Putin I think we've been very clear with uh Putin and I think that the the president and the Congress on a bipartisan basis has come together on this issue uh beginning earlier this year uh three weeks ago today I was in Ukraine I was in Kiev I think first member of Congress to spend the night on Friday and Saturday at a Yalta European uh strategy conference and met with the solinsky government the ukrainians are brave people I was in bushka where the the furthest advance that Russia had got which is a suburb kind of like from the distance of old Fig Garden to downtown Fresno uh that's how close the Russians got to and and saw a a mass grave site where 166 people mainly women and children had been married it's horrific what what Russia is doing and this is the test of our time not just for Ukraine but for democracies around the world and I think that uh Putin badly overestimated his military underestimated the ukrainian's will to stand and fight for their country and whether or not the West uh NATO and the United States and others would in fact rally and simply not slap Putin's hand as previously had been done in George and Crimea yes and you know helping Ukraine helping the U.S in turn really truly it is important for our national security as well Congressman here at home um you know it you hear it from your constituents we have our gas prices back up inflation we know some of these things are impacted by global happenings as well how are federal policies right now Curbing and fighting inflation well the Federal Reserve board obviously continues to be focused on maintaining uh the interest rates as a tool to combat inflation we didn't like the numbers last month the European numbers are are higher this is a worldwide impact because of Supply chains because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and other multiple factors and we're going to have to work through this but there are other parts of the economy we've created over 18 million uh not 10 million jobs we reduced unemployment by 18 million Americans who now have work and and so there are other positive signs in the economy but gas prices and inflation costs for food concern every American they concern me and we're trying to deal with supply chain issues to bring down those costs um and and gas prices have gone down although they've gone up here recently we're going to have to continue to focus on all the above all right Congressman Jim concert Congressman thank you and that vote happening later this afternoon and so best of luck to you there in D.C today I am sure so be safe if you get any of those maybe a little trickle of wind something up the coaster from Hurricane Ian so stay safe yes thank you very much

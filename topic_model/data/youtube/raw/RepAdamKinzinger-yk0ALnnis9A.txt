this week the panel will hold a prime time hearing on thursday focused on the 187 minutes from the time when president trump left the stage at that rally in the ellipse we're going to walk down to the capitol until he issued that infamous video message so go home we love you you're very special republican congressman adam kinzinger will be co-leading that hearing on thursday good morning to you morning so let's start with these secret service texts the agency said this was just a matter of timing and a tech upgrade do you believe that or was this malicious i think we're going to know more tuesday we made the decision as the committee that we need to subpoena these records the the ig came in front of us and said look we have been working hard to get this they claim it was this technological change we moved everything we lost these texts and then they also put out a statement though that said we've only lost some of the text and everything relevant to this investigation has been turned over so those are very conflicting statements so we decided as a committee let's request these by tuesday and we can make a decision i will say this in the very least it is quite crazy that the secret service would actually end up deleting anything related to one of the more uh infamous days in american history particularly when it comes to the role of the secret service so the subpoena set tuesday as the deadline so has the secret service said we will meet that deadline and these texts still do exist somewhere that's what we've from what we understand they've said we'll we'll we'll meet this deadline and we'll see what we get here so either we get that information still on record we don't know so either we get that stuff if we end up getting the text then obviously for whatever reason the ig didn't now you have what you have if we don't then it'll call out the secret services having said that they have these texts and they don't so you know is this anything big we're not sure um but we need to chase every lead down on this and there's a question of why are they not cooperating with the ig uh the the dhs ig and uh and they need to so the committee has though spoken in the past with some secret service officers so do you have a date yet to question the two in particular um tony ornato about what happened january 6th um of course he's relevant because of cassidy hutchinson's testimony about what's happening in the vehicle look we're still working on that uh we'd love to have him come in uh we're working out those details we know that through i guess anonymous sources they've said they're going to be happy to come in and testify we would encourage anybody to anybody that knows anything but it's got to be under oath right now it's just been discussion from secret service through anonymous sources and that to me compared to somebody like cassidy hodgeson who swore under oath what she had heard that's important to come in and do that so it's still ongoing but hopefully we get that will you get that by thursday in this hearing i highly doubt we'll get them coming in and talking by thursday but again i would love that but we keep getting new people coming in every day with information willing to go on the record so it's been amazing how sensing these hearings have started the amount of information we're getting has just rapidly accelerated cnn was reporting that a d.c police officer who had been somehow involved in the motorcade arrangements was corroborating the testimony given by cassidy hutchinson that there was an almost violent confrontation with the former president in the vehicle that day is that what the committee has been told i can't confirm or deny those because we haven't come out with who we have or haven't spoken to i'll just say i'm not going to aggressively push back on that characterization and we have every reason to believe that what cassidy hutchison said at least from what she said she heard because she wasn't in the limo and never said she was she was told this but she was told this we fully believe that she is a credible witness and her allegations are quite explosive so 187 minutes um you're leading this hearing you you know what you can present at this point can you at least tell us if you filled in the blanks of you know who the president was actually speaking with why there weren't phone records for example of phone calls he may have placed during that time period we have filled in the blanks uh i can't necessarily say that the motives behind every piece of information we know will be able to explain but this is going to open people's eyes in a big way the reality is i'll give you this preview the president didn't do very much but gleefully watch television during this time frame we're going to present a lot more than that but i could only imagine as i mean i knew what i felt like as a us congressman if i was a president sworn to defend the constitution that includes the legislative branch watching this on television i know i would have been going ballistic to try to save the capital he did quite the opposite the president didn't do anything president didn't do anything and we're going to fill those blanks in and if the american people watch this particularly i say this to my fellow republicans watch this with an open mind and is this the kind of strong leader you really think you deserve uh you all are still discussing whether to go ahead and try to force a conversation with the former vice president mike pence his former chief of staff mark short said on this program this is very low likelihood of ever happening do you personally want to subpoena mike pence look i personally want to talk to mike pence i think there's a difference between do we subpoena him do we ask him for a transcribed interview i think it would be important to hear everything he has to say that said i'm not sure we get a ton more out of him than what his staff has already told us um the big question we're still dealing with as a committee is is their benefit in talking to somebody like donald trump and request and he come in uh that's something we're we're negotiating back and forth on whether we want to do that and uh and what that looks like what is the value in speaking directly to the former president and the vice president when the former vice president chief of staff and his you know legal adviser have testified to you why do you need him physically there and what would the president's testimony yeah and i'm not sure we do need them physically there because again we're getting a lot of information and i think you'll see after thursday's hearing we know a lot um look donald trump has made it clear that he doesn't mind not telling the truth let's just put that mildly he lies all the time i i wouldn't put it past him to even lie under oath so i'm not sure what the value is there that's again something where i think the thing to keep in mind is this this investigation is not winding down we may be towards the end of this tranche of hearings we may have more hearings in the future and the investigation is still ongoing so we're we're we're getting to the bottom of what we need to know tranche of hearings what does that mean i mean how many are you thinking this is this will be our eighth hearing this is the end in this kind of grouping uh i fully expect when the report comes out we may have a hearing or two around that but of course as you saw with cassidy hutchinson if we get information that the american people need to know we may end up bringing up more hearings at that time too so i want to ask you about the former overstock ceo patrick byrne who spoke i guess for eight hours behind closed doors with the committee the other day he said to reporters um there is so much interest in the december 18th oval office meaning because it all comes down to it the crux of history comes down to it and then his lawyer said stop talking what's the rest of the sentence exactly what is the crux of history here i don't know you know it's hard to get into the mind of somebody like patrick byrne it's hard to get into the mind of somebody like rudy giuliani is this a grift do they really believe some of these conspiracies but he has been i mean it seems like patrick has come to believe that there is some deep state conspiracy to overthrow the government and or at least have the deep state way of the government and so i don't know what would have come next in his mind but i can tell you his uh he seems a little unmoored from reality when it comes to politics and when it comes to democracy so mother jones published audio this week of steve bannon who was speaking to a group of associates in in october i understand this was recorded about the former president's plan to declare victory let's listen to what he said and what trump's going to do is just declare victory right he's going to declare victory but that doesn't mean he's the winner he's just going to save someone that's our strategy he's going to show us a winner so when you wake up wednesday morning it's going to be a firestorm what does that indicate to you i mean steve bannon speaks sometimes in hyperbolic terms does that indicate to you that there was a level planning going back that far oh yeah i mean i think look if you look at the president's statements even months prior to the election he started saying if we lose it's because it's going to be stolen there was i think it was uh chris steyer came in on our second hearing and talked about that idea of that the red mirage how early in the night it'll look like republicans are winning and then later it will be the obvious results i mean i think democrats were ahead in ohio significantly even at the beginning of the night steve bannon is an agent of chaos steve bannon in his own words believes you have to basically burn the system down to rebuild it and fix it what he's saying right there is very clearly him saying no matter what we're declaring victory and that is a violation of everything we have to hold dear in a constitution listen the only thing we need for democracy to survive is the knowledge that you can vote that that vote counts and we live with the winner or loser if half the country believes that that wasn't accurate you can't expect democracy to survive i want to ask you about what's going on in georgia your fellow republican senator lindsey graham is challenging a subpoena by a grand jury there they want to ask him questions about this call that he placed to the secretary of state there around the election graham said he's done nothing wrong um is there a reason the january 6 committee has not spoken to him are there questions you have for him well look the question of is there reasons well i mean first off we have a lot of information in terms of what happened in georgia that's a piece of our investigation we have the whole broader thing of what led to january 6 what's been done since in terms of him no i haven't talked talked to lindsey graham personally um that's his decision with the with the grand jury in the challenge i'm not sure if his issues of speech and debate which is what he claims the protection are he was acting in his position as a senator i'm not sure if that actually would apply to if you're attempting to change an election outcome i'm not the lawyer i don't know but to me it seems a little odd that he would try to pull that in front in terms of uh going in front of a grand jury and saying what you know all right congressman kenzinger thank you for coming in we'll be watching on thursday and cbs news will cover that hearing at 8 pm eastern time thursday night on our broadcast and streaming networks face the nation we'll be back in one minute so stay with us

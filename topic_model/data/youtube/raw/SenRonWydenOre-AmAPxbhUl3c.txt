Thank You mr. president this amendment is for the millions of Americans more than 800,000 of them who serve in the military and vote by mail in our system of government the most open and free system of government in the world mr. president those millions of Americans may vote absentee they may vote in what's called no excuse absentee or they may vote in an all-male election but they deserve this fall to have the assurance from the United States Senate that as we reform the Postal Service the election will not be disrupted I hope my colleagues will support this I think it's been discussed at length with both sides of the aisle it's always been bipartisan to try to expand the franchise and with that mr. president I would yield the floor and would hope that we could pass this on a voice vote and I want to thank both a chairman Lieberman and Senator Collins who've had a a real challenge handling all these amendments and they've been very gracious both of them as always mr. president the senator from Connecticut mr. president I rise to support the amendment and I thank Senator Wyden and those who worked with him on this amendment frankly for calling our attention to this important matter and working to ensure that our efforts to salvage the United States Postal Service to change it to keep it alive do not come at the expense of our critical efforts to ensure access to the to the voting booth by mail and also no excuse absentee voting programs that rely heavily on dependable mail service so that I support the amendment and if there's no further debate I move that we adopt the amendment by voice vote all those in favor signify by saying aye aye all those opposed the eyes appear to have it the eyes amendment number 2020 as modified is agreed to

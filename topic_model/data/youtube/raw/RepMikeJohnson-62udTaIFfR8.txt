I think my friend the gentleman from Florida listened regarding what you gentlemen were just talking about here I just pulled this up examples of actions that could lead to an other than honorable discharge include security violations use of violence conviction by civilian court with a sentence including prison time are being found guilty of adultery in a divorce hearing that's not a definitive list those are only examples but but here's the irony I think that sticks out in all this today we are hearing articulated this new Zeal allow extra measures of respect and deference to Veterans which everybody on this side of the aisle obviously agrees with but it's really ironic because it was just last week just a number of days ago my amendment to do that in the context of the sicilini gun control bill was flatly even vehemently denied by every Democrat on this committee they insisted that veterans who honorably served the country and know how to handle a firearm who are specifically trained in that could not be trusted to be Exempted as a category like law enforcement officials in their big gun control bill but the section of the bill that we're talking about here is section seven um is is really this is really something because what we're saying here and for people back home who are watching this look the Secretary of Homeland Security has total discretion under the bill to give lawful permanent residency to a veteran even if that non-citizen veteran committed multiple crimes trafficked and drugs smuggled humans across the border engaged in international child abduction illegally voted in U.S elections you name it so here's the question and I mean this is a good faith question I'm asked the the chair if she would entertain it you said if effectively in your comments what I took from that is you said well yeah yeah okay don't worry the secretary has total discretion but the Secretary of dhh is going to watch that don't don't worry you know why would we allow even the discretion for these categories I do not understand it it is madness to me why would we not just put it in your bill and say these categories are not allowed why would you allow the DHS secretary to even determine that it doesn't make any sense do you have an answer that question Madam chair if the gentleman would yield uh if if you would read the bill there are um several sections that remove discretion I've mentioned them before from the secretary in terms of applicants who are risk to National Security applicants who have committed or conspired to commit significant human trafficking offenses an applicant who's been convicted of any of the following aggravated felonies murder rape sexual abuse of a minor crimes related to the operation of a prostitution ring and related human trafficking crimes related to the production sale or possession of child pornography and I would just note further that the general discharge I would presume that the young man that Mr Bishop knows who declined the vaccine that he would not have a dishonorable discharge that he would have a general discharge just as someone who has committed adultery would get a general discharge not a dishonorable discharge I hope that clarifies this for you Mr Johnson I yield back I thank you for your response I would say it doesn't clarify it and but because I I just don't know why we would even allow for the this to be a gray area at all I yield back the gentleman from Florida

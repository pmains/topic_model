here's the deal come on man senator haggerty of tennessee is here to talk about what is a real crisis at the border they're looking now at the highest number of illegal immigrants surging the border in over 20 years and there are a lot of large surges in the interim those last 20 years so this is gonna this is a crisis it is one of joe biden's own making and yet he's denying the very words that he said just this past september your reaction senator well sean thank you for having me today and my reaction is just the same as yours this is a crisis of biden's own doing he invited them just as just as you've underscored and playing back his own words from the campaign he's even created incentives now if you look at what's inside this quote coveted relief package uh illegal immigrants are going to get a check so all the wrong incentives are in place he's stopped all border enforcement and it's amazing they want to see schools shut but they want to keep our borders open i find it just incredible and they're even putting people to test positive in hotels but there's no checks to see if they stay in that hotel or if they go out and with the possibility of infecting innocent people and then of course americans are going to have to pay the bill for as many people as ultimately come across that means education that'll mean health care uh that'll mean probably ultimately impacting the criminal justice system uh assuming some people break laws right oh absolutely and my fellow tennesseans see this all the way in tennessee it's not just at the border shown i was talking with a couple of sheriffs yesterday in tennessee they've already seen a surge in crime particularly illegal drug usage and these drugs are coming right across that open border in mexico this is something that's got to be dealt with you mentioned biden's removal of the migrant protection protocol to stay in mexico plan that was working president trump's plan was working keeping people there in mexico and dealing with the problem in that regard letting them come across the border as they're doing right now and failing to adjudicate this they're just letting them cross the border you know at every point they've stopped building the wall as you mentioned today along with 39 of my colleagues we send a letter to the government accounting organization about this because we believe that this is an infringement of congress's power of the purse if the monies were appropriated the biden administration doesn't have the authority to freeze border wall construction stop stop funding it uh we appropriated the funds they've got to come back to congress before they can stop it we're going to push back on this as hard as we can all right this this to me is all madness and insanity now a couple of other things because in 2018 if you recall president trump was accused of putting kids in cages remember oh yeah and we found out something that was very interesting we learned that the video that most of the medium i call them the mob because they have a mob mindset and mentality all the media mob were playing well that actually was video from 2014. those cages were built by joe and barack they weren't built by donald trump now we have kids in cargo shipping containers i'm not sure if you've had an opportunity to see the outside of them i'd love to show you the inside of them but we can't get any of our reporters inside because they won't let us inside imagine the reaction of if donald trump was the president and he was putting kids unaccompanied minors in cargo shipping containers with a tiny window with bars on it uh and we're told butterflies on the walls i don't think that would go over that well do you not at all sean i i agree with you completely as you say if president trump had allowed this to happen uh it would have been the biggest humanitarian crisis ever now the biden administration refuses to even use the word crisis as you acknowledged before uh mayorkas again refused to use that term today this is a crisis just as you describe it it's going to be the greatest humanitarian crisis that many have seen in our lifetimes you know we've have other issues now that are out there we've got finally joe to answer a question and this is the problem if you run a presidential campaign hidden in a basement bunker rarely if ever taking any questions and just showing up for the bare minimum two debates uh and a virtual speech at the democratic national convention we never got to the issue of court packing we never got to the issue of d.c puerto rico statehood we never got to the issue of ending the legislative filibuster i'm sure you heard by now the the biden's answer on ending the filibuster i'm sure you know mitch mcconnell's reaction to it um joe manchin says it should be harder that seems in keeping with what joe was telegraphing last night all things that were not told to us before the campaign things that i warned a lot about now becoming a reality can they can they literally get any of that done in your opinion well i i i say this sean you know we're in the middle of a pandemic a global pandemic we're in the middle of a recession we're trying to recover from and as you so clearly articulated we've got a border crisis going on yet their number one priority is to shove through this hr one and they're willing to destroy the senate filibuster to do it and that would turn the senate into a body just like the house of representatives it would take away the long-standing history of open debate here and i am you know extremely concerned that that's the direction they're going to go because it's all about power to the democrats that's what this strategy is outlined by mitch mcconnell would it be effective enough to push back on ending the legislative filibuster in other words apparently they could tie things up in such knots that literally mitch mcconnell was saying okay well if that's what you want it's going to be a quote mess weapon of mass obstruction and he said if that happened they would use every arcane senate rule that is now available one of which would even be which would require unanimous consent to even turn the lights on before noon and he says they're going to use every other rule to make tens of millions of americans voices heard uh would that work would that be enough to stop this radicalism well that's what is going to happen as as leader mcconnell described it no one knows the rules better than he does and no one is better equipped at unleashing this if if it happens if the democrats move in this direction they're going to find massive resistance from the republicans and i think we're going to be locked arms standing up to this uh we'll do everything we can because we cannot allow the democrats to achieve what they want which is one party rule here in america they want to use this hr hr1 to basically put them in power till the end of time so we believe as i do that it's unconstitutional that it asserts the constitutional authority of state legislatures certainly uh article two section one clearly says that the domain of setting election rules falls strictly with state legislators no mention of congress no mention of federalizing the elections but that's exactly what they're going to try to do i do believe there's a huge constitutional problem just as you said you know and well i would argue even on the issue of court packing which they're having i guess some you know stacked account council or investigative uh unit look into the possibility of implementing that uh how do you think the issue of dc statehood is going to play out how do you think the issue of puerto ricans puerto rico statehood is going to work out i think they're going to if they can get hr one through they're going to continue to move in that direction with statehood for d.c with statehood for puerto rico these are going to be the things that you've warned about you warned about this during the election and what's going to happen is they're going to come to fruition if we don't stand our ground and do everything we can to stop them from from destroying the filibuster and as you mentioned this is just the beginning if it went all the way to attacking the court we would literally destroy the supreme court in our constitution you know we often talk about this mass migration or people leaving high tax highly regulated democratic blue deep blue states like new york and new jersey and and michigan and california and they're they're headed towards texas and florida but many are also headed towards tennessee and the carolinas and and i love tennessee i have a heart for tennessee i lived 90 miles uh south of nashville when i was broadcasting on a radio station in huntsville alabama early in my career and i used to go up to nashville all the time and i love music grow and i love i love the city i think it's amazing and i love the state also what i worry about for all of these red states where you see this you know a lot of people from these deep blue states moving is that some people are going to bring their liberal democratic socialist policies with them does that concern you because it would concern me well uh thank you for acknowledging the what i believe is the best state on earth to tennessee uh and and i encourage everybody to visit early and often uh because we're open for business in tennessee i i think most of your listeners know that but we're open for business and we're open for tourism there with respect to the demographic trends though this has been going on for some time tennessee is one of the best managed states in the nation we've had a conservative legislature that has kept our tax rates among the lowest in america we've got a great business environment and we've seen this movement underway it's accelerating though sean and i think the concern that you raise is something that i hear very often from tennesseans but if we continue to stick to our principles i think these people that are moving from california from new york from michigan from illinois will begin to see the power of our ideas and the power of our ideology i'm not so convinced i mean it's pretty radicalized in new york and california i you live there every day sean i don't know listen i'm i'm tortured i mean i am literally a prisoner here and and i'm stuck but uh but i don't you know one of the things that's sad to me is you elect conservatives that are fiscally responsible that are don't believe in high taxes and a lot of regulation and you balance your budgets you fund your pensions and now you got the big uh emergency covert relief monies tens and tens and tens of billions of dollars now that are going to be redirected to states that have always over taxed and mismanaged and misappropriated uh so many billions of dollars in other words red states will be bailing out blue states right now i'm the beneficiary of it i don't want to be it's not fair to tennesseans oh it's not at all and i can tell you tennesseans are furious about this uh you know i talk to folks from my home state every day and i don't want their money i don't they deserve they deserve to keep it they they do not want to be bailing out mismanaged blue states and blue cities and that's exactly what happened with this so-called coveted relief bill you know less than 10 percent of which was actually aimed at covet this was primarily about what you just described sean and that's mending the the past the the failed policies of these blue states and blue cities have been repaired on the backs of tennesseans and other states that have been conservatively managed like ours i supported president trump's tax plan because even though i did i no longer had the ability to deduct my state income taxes which are significant in new york ten percent and because that is not a benefit for you don't get the same benefit in tennessee the carolinas florida texas any red state you don't get the same benefits at all so basically what they're doing is they're rewarding blue state governors big spending governors tax and spend states for their irresponsible fiscal policies by taking money or offering tax cuts and and abatements in a sense you have to deduct your state income tax um i bet you biden brings that back too you watch uh it's it's so it's such such underscores their hypocrisy sean when they do something like this but what what that did was it had states like tennessee just as you say subsidizing the tax rates for folks in new york and other other high tax jurisdictions but that tax act that you talk about back in 2017 that was the beginning of president trump's blue-collar boom that and deregulation put our nation on the fast track in terms of economic growth you remember barack obama saying no how are you ever going to get these jobs back you know you must have to have a magic wand well abracadabra president trump there you go brought it back well you need to do more radio and tv um because that message needs to be get getting out more often uh senator haggerty thanks for being with us appreciate it thank you sean great to be with you thanks my best to my friends in tennessee

thank you mr chair and uh thank you secretary vilsack for being here today and just wanted to you you talked a little bit about the drought with representative or hellerin but in your written testimony you mentioned that producers have faced the possibility of having to liquidate herd herds due to the lack of availability or affordability of feed and forage from the summer's drought in my district that was not just a possibility it was reality nearly all of my state has had some kind of abnormally dry conditions and over three quarters in severe drought most notably the northwest and north central portion of my district spent significant time in the highest level of drought conditions which is where i heard from producers that unfortunately this possibility did become a reality to this day portions of that northern point are still in d3 extreme drought the producers in my district saw this coming and requested emergency authorization to hay and grey's crp acres prior to the nesting season in july i led a delegation letter with senator klobuchar formally requesting action from you prior to the primary nesting season other members and delegations including congressman johnson requested the same from you to this day we have yet to receive word from you or your staff on what drove that decision seeing as this is your first time appearing since uh appearing before the committee since the drought started i'm now asking you on the record to explain this decision well the law didn't allow uh me to take the action that you all requested then secretary what specifically in that 2018 bill i because i think you're referring to the 2018 farm bill what specifically their uh prevented you from doing that well i i can get you the chapter and verse congresswoman i i don't have it on the top of my head but i will tell you the staff indicated to me that i didn't have the authority to do what you were asking me to do that it would require a law change i'm more than happy to work with all of you to do the technical work uh to get to to deal with this but you know our interpretation was that we weren't able to do what you were asking us to do as soon as we were able to do it legally we did it and and secretary we have entered a bipartisan i believe with representative angie craig from minnesota we've entered we've put together a bill already to to clarify that if that's the reason that we are unable to do that um but in addition to that i heard frustrations from producers that emergency haying post-primary nesting season was disallowed upon the graduation of a county from a d2 to a d3 drought and i i can't figure out why a county's haying situation is suddenly in better shape enough to to lift this emergency authorization as the drought conditions actually worsen can you explain for the producers in my district why that decision was made and where in law that we need to make those changes i'm happy to look into that circumstance that doesn't sound right to me either congresswoman i'm happy to look into that okay well i would certainly appreciate some kind of a written uh written response to that because uh that is that is a huge concern we just could not figure out um why exactly that was the case um but you know this um this does tie all tie back uh to the to one of the biggest concerns uh from producers in my district and you know i heard from producers over and over about the confusing and at times conflicting information from the usda as to what resources were available to them what practices they can do when and it goes on and on my staff and i pulled together a resource page to help adjudicate some of these concerns but i'm concerned that information decisions and authorities are not clearly and accurately filtering down from washington to the states and to those farmers i look forward to working with you to address these concerns and better clarify the authorities you need so that we're not just throwing money at a problem and not really really addressing the concerns and issues that farmers are facing but we're better preparing for and responding to the situations like this in the future and mr chair with that i yield back

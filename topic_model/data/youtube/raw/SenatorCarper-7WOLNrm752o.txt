madam president senator from delaware madam president good morning senator is now considering s 914 the drinking water and wastewater infrastructure act of 2021. this legislation was reported unanimously last month by the committee on the environment and public works on a vote of 20 to zero i rise today to join senator capito and on or towards our colleagues to join us in voting for the adoption of this legislation legislation will help upgrade our nation's drinking water and water infrastructure wastewater infrastructure investments that are sorely needed my president so that our colleagues understand the real need for drinking water and wastewater investments let me just begin today by by sharing a bit of my own personal history on these issues and invite our colleagues to maybe recall a bit of their own history my sister sheila and i were born in beckley west virginia a coal mining town in the southern part of the state for two of the six years that our family resided in the mountain state we lived outside of beckley coal mining town and we lived alongside a stream known as beaver creek we lived outside of beckley and by a couple of miles sometimes my sister and i and along with other kids in our tiny community would play on the banks of beaver creek chasing frogs trying to catch the small fish that swam there were never allowed to eat fish caught in beaver creek though and our neighbors didn't eat them either why because we were told in no uncertain terms by our present parents that it wasn't safe to eat those fish in time we learned some of the reasons why it was unsafe some of the septic tanks the nearby residents relied upon were not well maintained and as a result raw sewage and other pollution would sometimes end up seeping into beaver creek my sister sheila and i would go on to grow up in danville virginia located right on the border with north carolina danville virginia had once been the last capital of the confederacy and by the time we got there it had become the home of dan river cotton mills and as well as the world's biggest tobacco market even our radio station was the wbtm world's biggest tobacco market we lived in a what i suppose was a middle-class neighborhood just outside of town and we drank water from a well in our own backyard that was located less than 100 feet from our septic tank my senior year in high school i was fortunate enough to win a navy rotc scholarship attended ohio state university and there uh in columbus ohio we drank water provided by the city of columbus which also treated the sewage of the cities close to a half million inhabitants several years after graduating from ohio state in 1968 and while deployed to southeast asia as a naval flight officer during the vietnam war i would learn that the cuyahoga river which flowed through cleveland ohio had actually caught on fire i dubbed it the fire heard around the world and it served as a wake-up call to our nation to get serious and began addressing the air and water pollution they were all too prevalent in much of our country spurred by this wake-up call our president at the time richard nixon by executive order and a firm by the congress created the environmental protection agency in 1970 and inspired in part by the burning cuyahoga river outrage at the indiscriminate dumping of pollution into rivers streams and wetlands around this country congress enacted the clean water act in 1972 over the veto of then president richard nixon the goals of the clean water act are at the same time simple and profound and i'm going to these are the words to restore and maintain the chemical physical and biological integrity of the nation's waters let me just repeat that to restore and maintain the chemical physical and biological integrity of the nation's waters the clean water act congress ambitiously declared that the waters of the united states would be fishable and swimmable by 1983 and that there would be no more pollution discharged into our waters by nineteen two years later in 1974 then president gerald ford signed the safe drinking water act into law in the years that followed cities and communities across our country applied to epa for grant funding to help build new drinking water systems and improve existing ones similarly with the help of epa grants communities across america built or upgraded waste water treatment systems to clean up the wastewater being discharged into rivers and streams over time grant requests greatly exceeded the funding available through epa grants and during the regular administration the controversial new approach was proposed the creation of revolving loan funds administered and managed by each state and after considerable debate and compromise this proposal was enacted into law i was serving in the house of representatives at the time ended up supporting that proposal and thus the concept of state revolving funds was born in 1987. the clean water program was an alternative financing mechanism for the construction of wastewater facilities congress extended the same revolving loan fund concept to federal drinking water programs in 1996. federal funds ceded revolving funds in all 50 states and in puerto rico and provided support for projects in the other territories and in the district of columbia right here this federal support leveraged state and local funding along with revenues generated by utilities in the years immediately following the creation of these funds congress periodically modified them to meet the changing needs in cities and communities across our country and inspired the news the use of new technologies in more recent years however the the programs languished and the authorizations for the state revolving funds were in dire need of updating in 2018 for the first time in 22 years 22 years congress reauthorized the drinking water state revolving fund did so for three years the clean water state revolving loan fund used for wastewater and other vital needs has not been reauthorized in nearly get this 35 years and now the drinking water state revolving fund is set to expire at the end of this year at the end of this year somebody should do something and that somebody is us needless to say we've fallen woefully short of congress's lofty ambitions to create fishable and swimmable waters by 1983 and to eliminate the discharge of pollution in the navigable waters by 1985. it's also clear that the system we have now despite our best efforts isn't enough to meet the needs of our communities particularly those who cannot afford to participate in loan programs to upgrade in increasingly inadequate drinking water and wastewater facilities for far too many families in this nation access to safe clean drinking water and a healthy environment is do you find whether it's just a dream just a dream and a lot of folks too many folks face a real crisis all too often we see headlines telling of the poor state of water infrastructure in our country and this lack of resilience in the face of severe weather not that long ago in texas earlier this year nearly 15 million people 15 million people lost access to clean water when plummeting temperatures broke water mains brought power down to drinking water facilities across that state in jackson mississippi that same harsh weather caused over 80 water main breaks and left tens of thousands of people without water particularly in predominantly african-american neighborhoods but as we all know this goes well beyond a few isolated cases the problem of water in our nation runs much deeper millions of americans still lack consistent access to clean drinking water today the american society of civil engineers 2021 report this year called for uh or reported that america's infrastructure behavior they give by grades a b c d e f they gave our water system a grade of c minus uh i don't know about my colleagues i never got much of a pat on the back when i bring a home or c minus on my report card neither to my sister and uh c minus is not satisfactory in my family and i think for our country that same report earlier this year also revealed that there's a water main break every two minutes every two minutes in the united states and that six billion gallons of treated drinkable water are lost each day to leaks in crumbling water supply systems 6 billion gallons and that begs the question how much is 6 billion gallons anyway well it's enough lost water to fill 9 000 swimming pools let me repeat that it's enough water to fill 9 000 swimming pools not each year not each month not each week every day some communities report losing a quarter or even half of their drinking water to leaking pipes in my own state of delaware where cinder coons and i come from communities like ellendale delaware and the southern part of our state have struggled for years to find and afford safe alternatives to increasingly polluted drinking water wells and ellendale is not alone thousands in communities of color tribal communities rural communities and others struggle not only with access to clean water and wastewater treatment but also with the capacity to afford the infrastructure necessary to provide and meet those services let me emphasize clean water is an essential part of our healthy lives healthy economics and a healthy environment but for those communities who simply cannot afford to pay back loans or for needed water infrastructure we got to find a better way and i think uh by working across the aisle and working hard our committee the environment and public works committee is suggesting that better way in the legislation before us today i'm pleased to report the madam president that these are challenges that we have sought to address head-on with this legislation this bipartisan legislation that we consider today authorizes more than 35 billion dollars for drinking water and wastewater infrastructure programs at the environment environmental protection agency over the next five years these programs will create jobs make our communities healthier by building by repairing by upgrading by modernizing our nation's aging drinking water and wastewater infrastructure systems here's how first the measures takes the historic step of reauthorizing the clean water state revolving loan fund for the first time in 35 years 35 years and it does so by increasing funding levels for the first time since 1987. this legislation also reauthorizes the drinking water state revolving loan fund a program whose authorization expires as i mentioned earlier at the end of this year this fund helps to ensure that clean water flows whenever we turn on our faucet the clean water comes out of it next this bill makes sure that we're helping our fellow americans most in need the least of these most in need by boosting funding for programs that fund projects in low-income areas in rural communities and tribal lands and communities of color that have historically have been left behind by investments in our water infrastructure according to a recent analysis water systems with multi-year safe drinking water violations are far 40 40 percent more likely to be in places with higher proportion of people of color drinking water quality violations are by far the most frequent in low-income rural communities where local governments struggle to finance the most basic water infrastructure needs to help resolve this historic injustice more than 40 percent of this bill's investments are targeted to help disadvantaged communities the bill authorizes our bill authorizes more than a billion in new funding to reduce lead and drinking water and particularly for our country's rural areas tribal populations and low-income neighborhoods our bill invests another billion dollars into programs to connect households to drinking water and waste water systems and services why disparities in opportunity and investment are also present in tribal communities our legislation grows the tribal drinking water program by 20 percent and reforms programs to help tribal education agencies remove lead from their drinking water systems too this legislation does far more than just fix what's broken madam president tomorrow phrase from our president joe biden this legislation actually does build back better by fortifying water infrastructure for our new and worsening climate reality i'll be honest with you my president colleagues ours in this country ours is a future that promises more severe weather events like hurricanes like floods droughts and bitterly cold weather it is a future like it or not with more and more people living on the front lines of sea level rise like my state of the home state of delaware the lowest lying state in our nation to that end the bill provides a combined 500 million dollars to make our water infrastructure systems more resilient and adaptable in face of extreme weather events within that historic investment is a new 125 million program which will for the first time for the first time provide grants to communities seeking to fortify the wastewater systems against climate change's impact finally with our eyes focused on the future our bill expands government's role by in researching and developing the water technologies for tomorrow by investing in technologies to improve for example storm water control and waste management by doing so we can help american companies export innovation while not exporting jobs rather by creating them right here this is not just the bill to spread and suspend and bill though but legislation that will direct agencies to build and spend more wisely we know that investment innovation as envisioned in the bill before us can have a profound positive impact on our economy creating jobs and fostering growth for our entire nation we can in short seize opportunity in the face of so much adversity as we say in delaware carpe diem seas of the day actually we say carpentier c is the day there's an old african proverb that comes to mind madam president goes something like this you want to go fast travel alone if you want to go far travel together and on this bill mountain president i can proudly say that center capital and our colleagues on the environment and public works committee have chosen to travel together the drinking water and wastewater infrastructure act of 2021 passed out of our environment and public works committee with a resounding vote of 20 20-0 zero and from outside the halls of congress this bill has earned praise from across the political spectrum from big cities to small communities a group of government officials that include the us conference of mayors wrote that this measure will and i quote help address the many water infrastructure challenges that communities face i go on to quote local leaders support the drinking water and wastewater infrastructure act as a reliable long-term and increased in that federal investment in the water infrastructure close quote we're representing our less populated areas of the country places like raleigh county west virginia i was born my sister i were born senator capital knows it well's joe manchin knows it well his wife's from there places like raleigh county west virginia sussex county and southern delaware the rural community assistance partnership says and and i quote proud this is what those they say of our legislation proud to support this bill because americans deserve clean safe reliable and affordable drinking water regardless of the community size or zip code close quote i could not agree more we know that access to safe reliable and healthful water isn't a blue state or a red state issue it's an issue that goes to the core of the promise afforded to every american in thomas jefferson's uh declaration of independence our country's declaration of independence but largely pinned by thomas jefferson these words the promise of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness if we'll be honest with ourselves none of us can expect to pursue much less enjoy this american ideal if we don't have access to clean water to drink because without water we have no life so the need for action on this issue is clear to that end i've been grateful for the partnership for ranking member senator capito i'm proud this measure is the very first piece of infrastructure legislation i believe to report it out of a senate committee in this the 117th congress the environment of public works committee has a long tradition as some know of working across the aisle to get significant legislation over the finish line and this bill is the latest example of the kind of work that we do i like to say we're workhorses not show horses and but uh this is the first one that's a senator capito and i've been able to work on together and i'm grateful for all that she and her staff have done to help get us to this day i often times say that bipartisan solutions are lasting solutions think about that bipartisan solutions are lasting solutions that's how i think we should approach almost all of our work here in the senate by reaching out to our colleagues across the aisle where we can create lasting solutions to problems challenges facing our nation and this bill before us today is a product of that kind of partnership the legislation is a result of tireless dedicated work by ranking member senator capito by her staff and by my own i want to thank them and every member every member of our committee for all their outstanding bipartisan for all their contributions to helping us craft this legislation over the last several months i especially want to note on my staff john john king is sitting here right there right behind me annie damato margaret mcintosh also known as macky tyler hoffman reardon and our fearless staff director mary frances repco and another member of our team who used to be part of our epw team who's now leaving our staff it's our last day ashley morgan and uh we want to thank uh her for all of her help in the last couple of years i also want to thank adam adam tomlinson for his leadership with ranking member capito and her epw team including jess kramer and travis we uh we thank them all very very much and finally a big shout out to our water sub committee chair senator duckworth for taking the lead to introduce this excellent measure along with senator cardin and epw committee ranking members lummis senator lummus have wyoming and senator kramer and it's been a pleasure to work with each of you and your staffs i would go so far as to say a labor of love a labor of love and with this uh bill's level of support is my hope that we can seize this momentum and pass this measure quickly this week i urge all my colleagues to join center capital and me in supporting this excellent bill

well good morning everybody it's a beautiful fall morning in Washington DC I don't know about you Christi but I had a great walk up here today and of course I'm here with congresswoman Kristi Noem from the state of South Dakota and Kristi represents the whole state is that right I do South Dakota doesn't have a whole lot of people in it so we our delegation consists of just me well before we talk about internet sales tax can you just tell us a little bit about you your family and your journey to Washington DC sure so I live in the state of South Dakota I'm a farmer and a rancher and I've done that my entire life ran for Congress in 2010 so I'm in my fourth term I'm married to my husband Brian he has an insurance agency that he runs and then we have three kids so Cassidy is our oldest she's 23 Kennedy is going to graduate from college this year she's graduating a year early she's 20 so we always say that she's our favorite because she's finishing school so early and then we have Booker who's 15 he's a sophomore in high school well Kristy my wife would want me to make sure that you knew that I have three boys and they're kind of surrounding girls here some of your age so they're they're eligible bachelors right so tell us a little bit more about the economy and your district I just assume it's very rural and very agriculture related it is South Dakota's number one industry is agriculture and before I came to Congress I served four years in our state legislature and was the Assistant Majority Leader there when we were there you know we realized that the economy is changing not just in our state but across the country and a lot of businesses and a lot of people are online now people shop online when you go to a rural state like South Dakota we have you know a couple of really large cities but the rest of the population is pretty spread out they don't get to town every day much less not maybe not even every week and so they shop online and it was really hitting our state budget quite a bit we don't have an income tax in South Dakota so our main revenue comes from property taxes and sales taxes and we noticed as sales revenue sales tax revenue dropped that it was because a lot of people were shopping online so when I was in the state legislature I worked on streamlined sales tax making sure that our Main Street businesses weren't being discriminated against you know one of the things we talked about in rotary is this principle is it fair to all concerned and as I think about when I go back home I purchase something on Main Street I have to pay a cells the 7% sales tax but I purchase it online and I paid nothing now the law is actually there I should be paying it but for some reason it doesn't get it get added and I just feel like it's not a fair situation well I think that's what a lot of customers don't realize is that they still have the liability to pay those sales taxes even though it wasn't collected from that online sale the responsibility lies with them so not only do we have the Main Street small town retailers that choose to have a presence in our towns they employ local people and create jobs then they collect and remit our sales tax to the states not only do they have the challenges of balancing all of that they also don't have a level playing field those online retailers can often sell goods at a cheaper cost because they don't have to collect the sales tax and remit it to the state and so they're undercutting them and then it leaves the customer exposed to that liability so our goal is to have legislation at the federal level that just makes it fair Krista you're one the strongest most fiscal conservative people up here I'll have people that will say to me my goodness you're wanting to add a new tax and I don't feel like we're adding a new tax we're just trying to make this fair and actually enforce a current tax could you kind of just speak about about that because we're both very much one a balanced budget we don't want to leave debt to our grandchildren I tell people that all the time what this country does today is that we live off of programs and reap the benefits of them and then we leave the bill for our kids and grandkids so for me that's a moral issue it's not how I was raised and it's not how this country should run this is not another tax this is a fairness issue customers already owe this tax and it's not being collected and paid and that liability lies with them and our Main Street retailers that are suffering to keep their doors open we already in the state of South Dakota 70% of our businesses tough time making it to the second generation so there's already a lot of challenges on small businesses if somebody has a restaurant if they have a small clothing shop if they have a little hunting shop or a gas station and they're collecting sales tax and remitting it to the state and then they're competing with someone who is not even in that state isn't employing people there they could be across the country and then they don't have to collect and remit that sales tax that's a fairness issue and that's why this bill is so important and it's it is becoming a revenue issue obviously for States but if we don't take action we will be in a situation where we literally force States to look at new revenue and new taxes and that's what I'm trying to prevent well Christy I think you've summed it up very very well thank you for your leadership on this issue thank you for being a leader up here in Congress I always look up up to you when some of these are the issues and in your committee of jurisdiction so thanks for your leadership for rural America especially I want to thank you we need reinforcements here that understand and get these issues that are willing to dig into the policy and that's what I found with you is that you've always been a a true leader on digging into the policy and wanting to do what's right and that you don't always find that here in Washington DC so I appreciate you digging your heels on in this issue - you're welcome Christy that thanks everybody

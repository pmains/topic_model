I got into IT due to different type of partnerships that were prizes from the corporate goal to help me get training and also you know learn how to kind of function in the corporate role and I would like to know if you're going if you are governor where you try to bring about something like that statewide for a lot of all workers for losing their jobs yes we need to provide incentives to go back to school and learn some trade skills and learn some vocational skills and we want to make our community college affordable there are some states that have made are looking to make Community College free and I'm very seriously looking into that and we need to really train and we want to make this very affordable so that people can learn those skills and that's good for the businesses too if we don't have skilled people no matter how much tax incentives you give to the businesses if you don't have good workers are Iran businesses and if you can get good people you can't run a good business and we need to really instill that so that a kid in high school doesn't want to go to college that's perfectly fine if he or she would rather learn some trade skills and we have a lot of very skilled tradesmen that are retiring and when they retire all of that knowledge base is gone and if we can get these mentor them have them come in into high schools and middle schools and if they can mentor our young people that would be wonderful and we need to create an environment where that happens

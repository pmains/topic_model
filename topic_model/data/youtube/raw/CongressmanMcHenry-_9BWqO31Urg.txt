hello friends uh this is congressman patrick mchenry i'm coming to you live from a with a telephone town hall meeting today uh we're going to get to your question so if you have questions please press star 3 and we'll get you in the queue um i want to give you a rundown of what's going on in washington uh and um and to you know but before we get into all that uh about uh the state of state of affairs i i think we should start by you know just a reminder all of us we should be praying for our neighbors down east who are impacted by the recent storm and those that are being hit by it now you know these things are always uh always dicey and um uh with the risk of human life and so uh just uh be aware of that um but um you know i'm gonna start this evening by giving you the lay of the land where things are in washington including what's being done to address the coronavirus um and how it's affecting our communities and want to make sure that we get to as many questions as possible so please press star 3 if you'd like to ask a question again star 3 to ask a question so i want to begin tonight by recognizing what a difficult and trying year this has been for our communities and for our country we began this year with one of the strongest economies we've ever had in american history a record low unemployment we saw we saw with the president's trade agenda taking china very seriously that we saw uh with that uh good tax policy regulatory policy we saw the emergence of strong growth in our economy and wage growth to go along with it so the average family is better off at the end of 2019 than they'd been really in generations and so um you know that changed a lot and so uh we you know obviously want to think of those front line workers battling the coronavirus and the folks that keep us safe and healthy in our communities like our law enforcement we also want to thank our health care workers that are doing everything that they can to protect us and to keep us safe and we saw that across western north carolina we continue to see those extraordinary acts so now as you start tonight allow me to give you just a quick update on what washington has done to address the corona uh virus up and um and so we've continued the fight and i believe it's the duty of congress working with the president to offer bipartisan solutions to it to advance the safety and health of of of america to keep us stronger and to give us strong to give us safe to keep us healthy at the beginning of the the crisis congress came together and passed the bipartisan cares act and while the bill was far from perfect it was necessary the cares act was not a stimulus package it wasn't about a grab bag of a bunch of washington programs but as an emergency relief bill designed to ensure our hospitals our local and state officials and our local economies have the resources they need to keep our economy to keep our people afloat during this crisis that they didn't make this isn't like the financial crisis this isn't about uh wall street uh malfeasance uh that is that brought our economy low this was the voluntary shutdown of our economy because of the virus and the cares act uh we had the paycheck protection program which is in essence the way that we used uh small businesses to help those on their payroll that was what was about what it was about it's about successfully saving millions of jobs and i think we succeeded in saving millions of jobs not all but in two months the program moved more than 500 billion dollars worth of loans to 4.9 million small businesses supporting 51 million jobs across the country here in north carolina the program supported 1.7 million jobs with over 12 billion dollars in loans issued small businesses in our great state so while the cares act was the right response at the right time we have a lot more to get done uh and uh what comes next with the coronavirus relief package we need to be measured about this and what i believe with our approach we have to take is we have to measure twice and cut once right think of it that way measure twice and cut once now that's not really what washington's good at what they want to do and what the debate is now is how much money can you shovel out the door regardless of need and so what we're focused on is making sure that schools and health care facilities get the support that they need and those workers that aren't permitted to go back to work because of actions of of governors and mayors and the shutting down of businesses that they get the support they need so they can survive um and so those are the things that i'm focused on and that means we need to build better technology drive more innovation so we get a cure we get a treatment regime we get people safe and secure and healthy and that way we can actually return to uh supporting new ideas and cutting-edge research and entrepreneurship and all those things that make our economy good and strong and so i've supported programs and uh and and changes to federal law so that we can get um our supply chain uh you think of that ppe equipment that that that is so vital for the health care for our health care providers the masks the gowns the the gloves to make sure they can give tests or treat patients right we need to make sure that we're not relying on chinese-made gear we need to bring that home we need to bring that supply chain home so that we are safer here in the united states and more secure from really chinese-made uh goods uh that may not be as is as good as the ones that we can make here in the united states uh we need to make sure we have a plentiful supply and so i have a bipartisan bill that does just that it's the american ppe supply chain integrity act so we're trying to work through those things that make sense for the short term and for the long term here so that's the top line right now want to take your questions though and we've got folks that are queued up um tonight for our telephone town hall if you'd like to ask a question please press star one and um we um we will uh we will take your questions and uh as they come in uh so we have let's see we've got um here we go we've got uh mr yoder uh mr yoder uh i don't have the town you're from but uh uh mr uh james yoder you're on the line live for telephone town hall hey how you doing mr mchenry doing great miss yoder uh where are you from uh lincoln north carolina and uh i'd like to thank for all you've done for me and my wife in the past and uh we all thank you well thank you i appreciate it i appreciate it what's your question tonight well it's kind of about that coronal virus stuff they say you know if everybody wore a mask you know they probably take care of it maybe but uh why not everybody uh stay at home for you know like 30 days except the people you know that absolutely you know essential people that need to get out there you know everybody else stay home and uh there's not much use to have a mass mandate if they're not gonna enforce it you know if it drive them out like a 500 ticket i don't believe i could get but one of them you know and i it cured me from going out but that is my input on it you know i mean it seems like uh i'm not going to say a simple problem to correct but you know maybe that would work what do you think well i think that's part of it but uh let me put you on hold and i'll give you the answer here but thank you for your question mr yoder and um me and my wife and you have a nice day sir thanks look forward to seeing you in person sometime soon mr yoder's question is i think a good one um which is uh why not just shut things down and try to control the virus we're seeing this in australia where they've shut down uh a whole part of australia um well quite frankly i think we're at the stage where people wouldn't abide by it and it the areas that are hard hit the hardest hit areas maybe that'll work maybe that'll work in some urban area but you've got to have law enforcement to do it we're seeing the urban areas where they won't even enforce basic laws with people gathering big gatherings of of people protesting or doing other things so what i'd say is we have to do the things that we can control in our personal lives and what i believe is individuals can make good decisions for themselves and they should make decisions for themselves and that means that we've got to be wise and thoughtful in how we go out that means washing your hands wearing a mask when you're around other people that are not a part of your family or people you don't interact with regularly keeping distance from other people basically the stuff that we do when when um we're just trying to stay healthy and away from people right and those that have um you know a pre-existing condition or concerns that they have to take a heightened awareness but i think that's part of it yes that is part of it we also have to get on with finding a cure right or a vaccine is a way to think of it right um and so um that is the work that we're about and that's operation warp speed is uh has gone about trying to get that vaccine but but that is a bigger issue that we've got to resolve and we're resolving it through funding right and at this stage we eat different companies eight uh six deals with uh eight companies on on getting a vaccine and so uh six different vaccines that are through going through the testing process to make sure they work and we when we get a vaccine that is through the whole process it will be safe and and we should take him um and so we're moving forward to make sure that that's out there available but back to our personal responsibility and our duty and our personal responsibility our duty is is to make sure that we stay healthy and and that we limit our interaction with other people so we limit the spread we can do that i don't think you need a government mandate and i don't think you need the uh the police force to enforce that i think we can do that reasonably uh by taking precautions uh at the individual level that's why i believe personal responsibility is a key here so that that's my top line view here so uh we've got other folks that are coming in the line here for questions please press star 3 to ask a question and we'll get you in the queue but you're for those of you who joined us we've got a telephone town hall meeting tonight and this is congressman patrick mchenry um and so let's get to the next question um let's see here um who's next here um let's see we've got uh miss matthews i don't have a town for you but uh miss matthews uh you're live on the on the call tonight i'm from conover north carolina well thank you thanks for being on and my concern is uh i'm a cancer survivor and my concern is with tax increases and all as that you that are implemented on single people and uh decrease that medicare wants to pay for cancer treatment after even though you're not cancerous they are cutting the treatments that they're now providing and uh eliminating some of the treatments for the complications that you have from being in cancer treatment in the past and i'm seeing this more and more and medicine medication is increasing so much and i i just think that you need to address this we need to address this for everyone because more and more cancer uh diagnosis are being given day in and day out okay uh so on this uh in particular if you have an issue with uh medicare uh please if you would call my office tomorrow uh in hickory and um and the number is eight two eight eight 828-327-327 6100 6100 and we will uh for a constituent casework issue like this medicare issue please let us help there and and so this is a this is a big issue so thank you for uh raising it but let us see if we can help this specific case and see if there's some larger change that we need to we need to make happen for you thank you very much sir thank you and again if you've just joined us this is congressman patrick mchenry and you can look at my website which is mchenry.house.gov and uh and that would give you all the information to contact my office but if you have a casework issue for you or a loved one or a neighbor or friend some issue where we can help fix a problem that they're having with government please give us a call my talented staff uh we're always happy to assist where we can and try to get um get the best uh response that we can so um let me go on next you've got uh uh miss uh schweichgood from faithful yes hello thank you for yes it's uh patrick mchenry thanks for being on the line what's your question tonight on tonight's telephone town hall okay i have a concern about the voting process if it's going to be a mass mail voting or for able or be a combination of absentee voting and poll voting i think there is a very good case for mail fraud voting fraud if you do mass mailing yes uh thank you for raising this this is a serious issue of concern so thank you miss weisguard i'll put you on back on hold here uh it's about mass voting by mail so in north carolina right i there's all there are all these other states that do that do uh that have different ways of voting but north carolina we have a good long-standing method of how we do this in personal election day or traditional voting everyone's aware of we also have early voting for roughly the two and a half weeks leading up to election day and that's technically called no excuse early voting well no excuse because it's effectively an absentee ballot you get to do it in person a number of different polling places and that works really well my wife and i have used that a number of times and it's been you know no lines or little lines and you know the folks in lincoln county where we live uh the the the board of elections they do a great job and all those volunteers do a fantastic job to make the election happen in those early voting sites especially and then there's also in north carolina mail-in absentee ballots now i've used that before as well if you're traveling on election day or you know if i'm running around election day i've used i i've used the mail-in vote we have a strict set of rules so it's not everybody that does it so what i would what i would do is broadly i'd tell you our in-person early voting and our absentee ballot ballots that we mail in are very safe in north carolina now there is a concern that if you go to all mail-in votes like some states want to do that you don't have as safe as system as what we have in north carolina and i agree that's a problem that's a concern that i have because we want the integrity of our election system to be the highest possible right we can fight like cats and dogs over who should be elected but we shouldn't have to fight over the fairness of the count we shouldn't do that that's that should be left up to third world countries uh where that happens not the our not our great united states of america and so um i'm glad that our system in north carolina is safe and sound and if we have absentee ballots by mail we got a very strict process there if you have early voting we've got a very strict process there and if you have election day strict as well in north carolina so i'm not worried about the integrity of our system in north carolina i'm worried about some other states where that's a problem but thank goodness we don't have that problem in north carolina thank you for raising it um and so um let me let me get to uh mr uh mcgibbon and uh cheryl's ford over in arnold county or are you on tonight yes sir oh excellent well it's on both sides of the lake so anyway thank you thanks for being on the line it's uh patrick mchenry um and uh for those of you who just joined us it's a telephone town hall so uh thank you for taking my question before i retired here at the sheriff's ward i worked for a pharmaceutical medical device company up in north chicago actually ran one of their businesses inside the manufacturing group and so i'm very attuned to this issue about you know the manufacturing going overseas i actually addressed it with the then senator kirk from illinois at the time expressed to him my major concern is exactly what we're seeing now is that we are losing so much of our ability for antibiotics and equipment that's critical to you know critical care units and hospitals that was moving over to india and china and actually you know those were the most scary but it also was going to ireland and singapore because of huge tax advantages that those countries offered that america wasn't willing to do so it was just practical for the companies to move it over there as you look at trying to know you said something about having a bill on ppe are you also looking at these you know medications for heart and diabetes and things like this and getting those back into us at least manufacture enough to take care of our own demand is there anything in that bill that you spoke of or anything you're working on that would address those issues yes thank you for raising it that is a critical issue so thank you mr given um so it's my focus on with my bill that um uh that that we're working through the legislative process is focused on that physical equipment that that is basically oriented textiles right um and uh and the basic manufacturing that goes into those components are really related to textiles that's the focus with that bill but we are broadly working through the complete supply chain for pharmaceutical drugs and technology and if you think of some of the elements that go into even your iphone or your computers those things the chinese have sought to control additionally some of the basic elements that go into pharmaceutical drugs the chinese control many of those inputs things that go into vaccines the chinese control well we've allowed it to be offshored so we are addressing that in a holistic way there's bipartisan support for this and there's history on our side uh after world war ii uh i'm sorry after war one is in the united states we decided to address our whole supply chain issues because we had a number of critical things were made in germany or in europe that went into really the strength of an american economy that really tested the strength of the american economy and we fixed that problem between war one and war ii and then after world war ii we've gradually allowed these supply chain issues to erode over time and uh in through trading relationships or various other things we haven't thought of our national security and the risk to our national security that that that offshoring of of some critical elements have uh have weakened us and so we're addressing that and i think over the next few years you're going to see a broader set of issues that we address but critically uh mr mcgivin that the pharmaceutical supply chain is is a is high high in in my mind and in our minds and for republicans and democrats in in washington so anyway thank you for for raising that um and so we've got other questions that are coming uh down down the line uh and want to thank everyone for um well for being on this telephone town hall so uh but tonight uh if you have questions please press start three and we'll get you in the queue um and so uh what's next up um what do we have here let's see we've got mr i'm sorry um we had kelly carpenter from vail um yes sir um i have actually two questions um one i would like to know why we're in court litigating cutting social security benefit to seniors and also medicare me and my husband are 62 years old we both have pre-existing conditions and um [Music] i i don't understand that we've both been working since we were 15 years old i've been paying into this for my entire life and we had very good jobs um and it makes no sense to me why the government would be trying to take away what i've done paid in second right i'm having surgery at the end of the month it's um a surgery i have to have i go for a covered test five days prior to my surgery to make sure i'm not infected and i'm not i haven't left my house since i had my back surgery last september and they cannot tell me if the nurses and doctors that are going to be in the operating room with me because the surgery i'm having this month is going to be very bloody very messy they cannot tell me if the surgical staff has had their coded test and that i'm going to be safe from the doctors and nurses and whoever else is in the room um i don't understand when you retire at 62 you should get medicare automatically our health insurance costs so much money it's over high it's more than my social security benefits okay let me try to answer these two things and so thank you for raising this uh miss carpenter and and i think you're right when you pay into the system you shouldn't see your benefits cut and i don't support reducing anyone's social security benefits uh or your medicare benefits and there is there's no litigation going on right now nor any legislation that would cut your social security benefits and so that is not gonna happen uh nor does uh president uh the president wanna cut social security benefits or support cutting social security benefits so just to be clear that is not on the table and the only discussions that are that are happening on social security is the hope that i have is that is that we keep social security solvent and strong for the next generation so that if you're 35 years old today or 30 years old today that you still can access social security which is which is going broke over the over the coming years so we have to fix this and save the program but nobody's advocating for for cutting uh social security that is not on the legislative agenda uh to be clear second the the question for uh health care of you getting a test before surgery yes that's quite common and and each hospital system has their own testing regime for for the coronavirus some people are uh some uh test quite frequently and they could tell you when uh but you have to access that for each each one of the hospital systems that you or in hospital that you are uh using uh so thank you for raising this uh and thanks for being on the call tonight we've got miss bowman from uh hickory on the line um thank you for being here it's a congressman patrick mchenry for a telephone town hall um and so what's your question okay thank you uh uh mr mckendree uh my question is as i'm uh looking at uh uh cotton balls for first aid i'm seeing them coming from india so will this trend continue because i'd rather have mine made in america but will i have to be i mean will i have to see them coming from india well thank you for raising that uh actually we've got um in in in our great 10th district we've got the largest consumer largest producer of american cotton uh in our in our district and so no you shouldn't see you shouldn't have to get foreign manufactured cotton products you shouldn't have you shouldn't have to see that and so if you go to walmart or cvs there there's there should be an alternative for you that is made in the united states um uh with uh and so uh i would um i think u.s cotton is uh is one of the names of of the brands that's out there so i'd recommend american cotton so thank you thanks for the question no we should we shouldn't allow our manufacturing base to be eroded we have to have competitive products on the shelf and we need to have trade agreements that support american jobs so um anyway thank you thanks for raising uh the question um and so um let's see what else do we have um what else do we have we've got uh uh miss uh dinardo uh in in uh in hickory you got another question for us tonight yes i do how are you patrick mchenry congressman uh yes i have two questions my first question is with these vaccines first and upmost uh are they gonna do are they gonna make this mandatory for all people to take this which i hope not uh also what would be the product what would be the liability for the federal government and the pharmaceutical companies if any person does get ill that's my that's my first question my second question is looking at the republican party and i thank god for trump every single day i feel we the republican party do not shout loud enough because the democrats are out there and they are causing just upheaval where are the republicans to stand behind our president to fight with him those are my two questions uh thank you great question let me start with the the question of republicans sticking with um speaking with the president i will tell you that if if if you say if you're a republican you say a supportive word about the president you're not likely to get invited to the sunday shows but if you are a republican and you say bad things about the president you will be on as many sunday shows as you want to be on you'll be on uh tv you'll you'll get invited by the media and and you'll be featured front and center now uh so they highlight the people that disagree um and that is that is what the media likes they want to have conflict they want to have conflict between republicans and so any republican they'll say something bad about the president they they highlight and this president they highlight it more than i think any other president but they even did this with barack obama if you're a democrat and you said something negative about obama you'd get you'd get featured and if you're a republican you said something negative about george w bush you'd get featured right it just so happens that the media has done this uh on hyperdrive right now and that's uh you know because that's their the obsession with the president that the media has um that's my view of it now other people have different views and if you're a democrat on the line you may have a different view than what i what i would have about this but that is really what happens you get featured if you're if you're negative uh the other question about vaccines uh no well though there will not be a mandate for you to take the vaccine uh on uh the chronovirus uh but what i will tell you is there we are going through all the heavy regulatory burden to prove out how effective these things are first of all you there are two key things with uh getting a drug approved one you have to ensure that it does what it says it does right that it's effective one and two you have to ensure that it does not hurt people so one it produces some it produces good and two it doesn't hurt you right and so those two things are both critically important if you take a a drug that says that it's going to lower your cholesterol and it doesn't lower your cholesterol that is a bad thing now if you take a a vaccine like this about this this this virus right of the coronavirus um and it says that it it uh it protects you it needs to protect you so the the the six deals that have been a part of uh operation warp speed the six deals involve eight companies and they're all very they're quite outstanding companies almost all are american companies and the deals there for those six vaccine candidates are to ensure that their clinical trials are not held up by government regulations now it the government regulations they still have to make sure that these are safe and effective absolutely so be assured that if it gets through the fta process if it gets through the regulatory process that it will be effective and and then to the second point i i think i think most people will want to take the vaccine when it's offered to protect themselves and there are others that can make the free choice to not take it but i think it's really important to let people make decisions for themselves um and so what i would say is i for one uh will will once a vaccine comes through i will seek the vaccine not a not in front of every other people but i will i will actually take the vaccine so that's my choice my personal choice and my family and i we can make decisions for ourselves and our children but other people can make their decisions for themselves so that's my long answer for for a very short question sorry about that so anyway thank you all for being on the line it's patrick mchenry a couple a couple more questions in queue uh and thank you all for for taking time to be on this call um and um and and i'm really just grateful to have the opportunity to represent you so we've got uh mr butler uh from lake norman uh uh so are are you on the denver side uh yeah well i'm down here uh close to counts forward i'm actually oh yeah second uh last code before you get to the down oh absolutely i know where you are i know where you are you know um i i don't live too far away from you so anyway uh how you doing mr father i'm doing good you not bad not bad and just good to be on with y'all and uh what's your question tonight well it's really about the leadership you know in the house and in the minority leader in the uh senate uh and all the unrest is going on in the country the writing and it's just a i mean it's scary uh i'm 77 years old man my wife you know we don't get out that much as far as you know especially this coven 19 going on but it just seems to me that that nobody whatever you know the president wants uh they it's 180 degrees off from what he wants on everything and and uh it hurts the american people the most but oh and you know it just seems like these leaves are pushing us towards a socialist country and it's just real scary and uh i you know you work with the members of the the house how is the members you know are they more bipartisan than the leadership uh yes but uh but i'll tell you it's a dumpster fire up there right now right i mean it is you know it i look at you know i keep up with the news but you know it's i get so mad and scared sometimes i just go somewhere else but uh but it's just i mean it's tearing our country apart yes well thank you for the question let me try to answer that thank you mr butler thanks for being on the call thank you i appreciate it um well thank you mr butler i i appreciate it and um and so we're gonna we're gonna keep going here so i i think uh national leadership on getting us through this you know you see uh you don't see that coming from congress and it's quite frustrating because we know there's serious work that has to be done and it's very frustrating because we're not seeing it get done and we got to prioritize getting people through this and get the economy going again think of the question of safely opening schools is a real it's a really incredibly difficult question on how to do it safely both for the students and for the teachers and for the and for the families related to it but we need to see leadership on this we need to see leadership on testing we see leadership on how businesses can safely get back to work without risk of being sued and these things require hard work from our community leaders and we're not seeing that unfortunately and it's quite frustrating to me uh because we need a consistent message on how we can safely do this uh and so thank you for raising that question it is sorely needed um and i think people are quite frustrated even more so because this is an election year and everything everything else is much more frustrating and especially laying on top of the fact that uh we've got this virus that we're trying to beat so we've got mr uh we got um uh mr mrs smith from lincolnton that's all i've got here if you're on the line um yes i am i'm ms smith uh thanks for being on the line here thank you for taking my town hall hi thank you i have a question what about these retailers when you go like walmart and some of these other retail stores and you go in to make a purchase and they ask they want their exact amount of money and if you don't have the exact change then they're like well we need to round it off to the nearest dollar or either do you just don't get your purchase because we're short on coins so why is it that our money is so short on coins all of a sudden in our country and then a second question i have is if when school starts back and you have these parents that need to go back to work how are they to find child care when school is only going to be open like two days a week well uh that is a major issue and uh for us in north carolina but every state in the in the countries is struggling with that question of opening schools um but we need to have some consistent policy right and and we don't we've got three different options and um it seems like they end up being four five six different options by the time school boards get done making a decision and as a parent i am frustrated by that too the question about change is a very good one if y'all i think many people have gone out you've experienced this and quite frankly because of the shutdown we shut down the supply chain to move money around uh and what i mean by money is actual dollars in the actual paper money and coins um and it slowed down the manufacturing process for for that currency and it also slowed down the movement of that to get it where it's uh needed and necessary um and that money is uh that currency's flowed through our society without much of a debate uh but this is something that we are working to remedy uh right now as we speak and it is a major concern for us the federal reserve is in charge of of our currency and this is something that they haven't had a problem with in decades but they're currently experiencing a severe problem with change for instance coins more so than bills and so that is also a question of manufacturing and us getting the manufacturing going again and getting our economy up and running and people working again that's a big struggle uh for for currency so we're trying to fix that i'm quite aware of the the currency issue and uh trying to make a difference and get it get that get that fixed um we've got uh mr pearson from lincolnton is next up on the line uh mr pearson you're yes you're on the line um i'd like to thank you for your service from the alpha battery first 113th my question is what are we going to do to hold china accountable for this pandemic it's affected republicans democrats what are we going to do it's a great question and i think that is a fundamental big question for us to resolve not as democrats not as republicans but as americans how do we resolve that well first i think we need to have trade policy that makes us stronger and doesn't make china stronger that's number one uh number two um i've uh i uh with uh uh michael mccall and greg walden two other republican leaders in the house uh have sent a letter to president trump requesting sanctions on china based off of their hacking their attempted hacking of of our research data on trying to find a vaccine or a cure and so that is uh a key issue uh to hold china accountable so stronger trade policy sanctioning uh those agencies and those people and the chinese government for their attempt at hacking uh our cure for the the for the virus that they unleashed on the world uh the other thing is this you know people wanna people focus on punishing china well why don't we do this why don't we focus on policies that make us stronger make our marketplace uh uh cheaper and easier to do business in uh make our tax policy more uh much better for small businesses and for mom and pop shops to to go out and start start businesses make our regulation easier so that people can comply with it and start a new business or or take a little risk we should try to strengthen ourselves that is i think a key thing make us more independent in terms of energy make us more independent in every sense of the word for our supply chain our manufacturing capacity and who we are make our health care better more accessible our people healthier let's look holistically about how we make america stronger and that that is the best that is the best uh best retribution for chinese bad action that the kind of

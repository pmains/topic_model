senator lahey thank you senator durbin thank you for holding this hearing i think it's extraordinarily important and i'm delighted this is the first hearing you and senator graham are going to have with your your subcommittee we know that the fbi director has testified before this committee and others in the past few years there's been a dramatic increase in the activities of domestic hate groups now some of these activities result in tax targeting the american muslim community to make matters worse some leaders as senator durbin point out have sought to show fear and divisiveness against american muslims now paying the flames of hate against those with different faith traditions runs contrary to our american values remember our nation was found in large part on the importance of religious freedom i welcome the renewed focus by some on our fundamental charter the constitution of the united states but i remind everybody the constitution is not a menu with options to choose based on the political whims of the moment instead it's a constitution that sets forth freedoms and protections for all of us the first amendment our bill of rights one of the most defining principles of our national character preserves all our other rights by guaranteeing a free press and the free exercise of religion ensures an informed lecture the freedom to worship god as we choose or not to worship as we choose our choice it guarantees diversity you guarantee diversity and protect the eye of the diversity you guarantee democracy now throughout the history of the world our religious minorities have been persecuted malign the long list of religions who members have been systematically denied freedom and categorically stigmatized even exterminated we must never forget this when we consider religious freedom religious minorities in this country all americans deserve civil rights protections and the freedoms providing the constitution that does not end with the vital freedom in the first amendment it continues to ensure due process and equal protection it's bolstered by important civil rights laws that we've passed to guarantee there not be discrimination against religion members of the committee worked with the late senator ted kennedy myself for the past several decades to ensure this fundamental religion our fundamental freedom we work together to pass the religious freedom restoration act religious land use act the institutionalized persons act it's been long been a bipartisan issue in the senate but more importantly being a bipartisan issue religious freedom it's been a consistent american value and that's what really counts the most american muslims like all americans must be protected by the rule of law that holds these constitutional and statutory protections we passed the matthew shepard hate crimes act to strengthen the civil rights of all americans we responded to law enforcement concerns about the difficulty of bringing criminal prosecutions against those who target their victims because of their religion their ethnicity their race their gender and so on last year in the run-up to the national elections the rhetoric became even more heated and threatening there are threats of korean burnings and some have even asserted that muslim americans are not entitled to the protection of the first amendment that comment should shock and offend anyone who claims to love and respect the constitution others on the radical writers suggested islam one of the oldest and widely practiced religions on earth is somehow not a religion at all and so his followers shouldn't have the protections of the first amendment that is nonsense and i would hope that americans remember why our founding fathers established this great nation when they hear this kind of divisive rhetoric i'm glad to see the assistant attorney general for civil rights tom perez here former assistant attorney general for civil rights alex acosta former judiciary committee council varanakara here for the hearing i'm also pleased that one of the leading voices of the catholic church in america is here to testify cardinal mccarrick's testimony reminds us that we catholics also had our loyalty to america question not just in the earliest days of our public but during the lifetimes of many of us my friend dick durbin referred to the irish and the italians and the lithuanians i knew exactly what he was saying by irish ancestors faced this when they first came even to vermont now in the most tolerant states in the country my father is a teenager face science has said no irish need apply or usually more directly no catholics need to apply my italian grandparents in a small town an italian community were seen as different like my mother and my uncles and aunts they spoke a strange language where some have heard some of the vermont accents might think that's a strange language but when they had mass the priest would have to come into the back door and the curtains had to be drawn shades had to be drawn now that would be inconceivable today members of the senate of other faiths also know from their own experience that religious and ethnic bigotry can be easy to ignite very difficult to extinguish i agree with colonel mccarrick that religious freedom is destroyed by attacks on people because of their religion and by the terrible misuse of religion to incite hatred even justify violence a divisive religious rhetoric is used for partisan advantage in the means of principles upon which this great nation was founded so mr chairman i thank you

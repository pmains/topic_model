heard a letter from stan with parkland the national association of families for states schools founded by the families of the victims in the parkland high school massacre who wrote respectfully requesting that wrote to leader mccarthy respectfully requesting that representative green be removed from the educational labor committee uh i wanted mr chairman just to quickly um make clear once again it's been a long hearing but the constitution clearly provides the with the house best with the house the independent authority independent independent of the ethics committee to discipline any of its members where the appropriate sanction may include the limitation of any right power privilege or immunity of that member we are well within our rights to do this i would like to talk just i would like to again uh address the issue of precedent i mr chairman you said this eloquently and i i just couldn't agree more um the precedent that we should be concerned with as a president of the president of not allowing members who traffic in anti-semitism and racism and islamophobia and violent threats against public officials to have the benefit of sitting on a committee in the house of representatives the precedent that members of congress cannot trade in conspiracy theories without consequences and the precedent that members should not and cannot attack and harass private citizens let alone survivors of gun violence without consequences mr chairman we've not had a chance to to talk about uh but i would just refer back to uh just last congress when the house passed almost unanimously a resolution uh that condemned q anon and the conspiracy theories that it promotes that resolution conveyed the sense of the house of representatives of which we are all apart that conspiracy theories like those promoted by qnon encourage the rejection of objective reality deepen our nation's political polarization and undermine trust in america's democratic institutions we cannot afford to allow that trust to be undermined anymore i i am i say this we talk about our colleagues um i do view ranking member wallarsky as a friend i am sorry that this is the first opportunity that we have to work together in this capacity and i and i mean this not as an attack against her but merely as a defense of the people that i represent and so many around the country when i tell you that i know for a fact with absolute certitude that when we use a word like tragedy to talk about the decision to simply make sure that there is accountability here that for the families in parkland and the families in sandy hook and the families in las vegas who know that this is a person who has questioned whether these mass shootings even existed they know what tragedy is they've experienced tragedy they live it every single day we have to act today mr chairman i hope we do in the bipartisan way today and again on thursday my colleagues all seem in agreement that what's been said is unacceptable is unacceptable so then we need to take this action because it is the only opportunity that we have to do so i really appreciate the opportunity to be with you and i thank the committee for being so thoughtful and deliberative throughout this entire process

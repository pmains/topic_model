now i'm without question here to fight for those who truly need the help we want to make sure that those that are still hurting get the help that they need but i'm also called to protect the future of this country to protect the future of my children and my grandchildren and what i don't want to see happen is to punish hard-working kansans who we feel like we're trying that we are being forced to bail out blue states who overreacted and totally shut down their economies and shut down their schools look overall this package is so full of pork it smells like bacon and now it's dripping grease it's dripping grease and that grease are democrat projects like speaker pelosi's underground railroad project in the silicon valley and senator schumer's bridge to nowhere from his backyard into canada which have been bailed out by the parliamentarian now but there's still lots of bad news radical democrats still want to bail out mismanaged states at the expense of hard-working taxpayers with dollars that are being distributed in an unfair manner for instance my home state of kansas is getting shorted 400 million dollars so we're doing taking 400 million dollars from kansas and giving it to some other state but you know who the biggest loser is the state with the shortest stick is the state of georgia they're going to there have been taken from them a billion that's b as in boy billion dollars over a billion dollars from the state of georgia to move those dollars into some other state i don't know how any congressman or senator from the state of georgia could possibly vote for this bill how in the world could could anybody vote for a bill that's taking money when it's not being done fairly this is not fair it's not american thank you

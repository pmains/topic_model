joining us now is democratic congressman adam schiff of california he's chairman of the house intelligence committee and he's a member of the january 6th select committee and served as the lead impeachment manager for the first impeachment trial of donald trump in the senate thank you very much for joining us tonight mr chairman uh there was a uh an amazing amount of detail today from william barr about all sorts of investigating that fbi agents were doing around the country including in georgia because the president of the united states was upset with the election result and so we see the attorney general calling the u.s attorney uh in georgia to talk about certain things and then he talks about this election and then suddenly fbi agents are going to investigate election workers in georgia and ask them questions because the president is perturbed now the attorney general reports back to the president that there's nothing there but we saw all of the machinery of the justice department going to work for this president in the aftermath of the election well lord that's right and i remember at the time that the attorney general said that he was going to look into these allegations uh having serious questions about whether the part was doing this only because the president wanted uh the department to do it and to give some kind of uh you know substance to these bogus claims of fraud and i was particularly struck i have to say by the attorneys general's comments in that clip you just aired where he was relating how he told the president that the justice department wasn't an extension of his legal team uh well when he intervened in roger stone's sentencing and when he intervened to make the case against michael flynn go away he certainly seemed to be an extension of the president's legal team but like so many people lawrence in the trump administration they reached the point uh and bill barr got there very late but he got there where he could go no further to you know to support uh the immoral acts of this president so he drew mine now it was very late coming but i'm glad it came what it did um but uh but yes it was very controversial even what he did do uh in uh investigating these claims without really more than the president's badgering as a primary motivation earlier tonight in our coverage uh rachel maddow was making the point to me about the references to the georgia investigation into specifically this with former u.s attorney pac who then there was this sudden and dramatic resignation that we didn't understand at the time uh in the in the aftermath of this election he was suddenly out of there and rachel specifically asked me to ask you if that is actually going to be a subject of future hearings that are we going to hear more about u.s attorney pac and how he left and more generally about the georgia investigation uh you know it's a great question lawrence uh and i i'm not in a position where i can tell the answer yet we certainly have more information about the circumstances in which uh he was forced out of office or forced out prematurely uh but i can't comment into whether at what point uh we'll be sharing that uh you know i do think that this whole issue of the president's claims about georgia and of course other states the degree to which when he didn't get the answers he wanted his impulse was always to try to get rid of people to get rid of this u.s attorney to get rid of the attorney general of course there was a whole entertaining of the scheme to put jeffrey clark in the position of attorney general when he couldn't get the other leadership to do it so this is a president who would basically fire people when they wouldn't follow his corrupt instructions uh chairman thompson uh indicated earlier tonight that it seemed like he had decided not to make any criminal referrals to the justice department after that became public liz cheney tweeted the january 6 select committee has not issued a conclusion regarding potential criminal referrals we will announce a decision on that at an appropriate time what is your understanding about that well i i think liz is right we you know we have from time to time i think uh in ones and twos talk with each other about this issue but we haven't really had a full committee discussion let alone reached resolution on it and this is the kind of decision we need to make as a committee uh so i'm confident we will make that decision at the appropriate point uh and weigh all the equities you know we obviously have a different responsibility in the justice department but there are appropriate times where we do make criminal referrals we make them when people are in contempt of congress but even more broadly than that we have on occasion made referrals where we have discovered evidence that we think a crime has been committed and that should be related to the justice department so i think it's still very much a matter for the committee to deliberate and decide an appropriate point i want to take a look at uh trump campaign lawyer alex cannon and his testimony about a conversation he had with vice president pence that he described let's listen to this conversation he had with vice president pence he asked what i was doing on the campaign and i told him that you know we were looking into some of the issues related to voter fraud and he asked me i don't remember his exact words but he asked me if we were finding anything and i said that i didn't believe we were finding it or i was not personally finding anything um sufficient to alter the results of the election and he he thanked me that was our interaction uh that is quite a contrast uh between the vice president and the president to the same information uh it absolutely is uh you know you're the vice president is asking you know what have you learned he gets an answer he thanks the person for their answer of course you got a very different reaction uh from donald trump uh as uh attorney general barr indicated when uh attorney general barr said that he found no there there effectively uh and uh donald trump uh obviously wouldn't take that for an answer uh and we you know we see this play down time and time again i think barry burke um who you just spoke with had it exactly right uh donald trump is guided by two things his personal interests his financial interests anything that comes into conflict with he won't accept now that doesn't mean he doesn't know fact from fiction i think it means that he is just going to uh you know state it as he would like it to be disregard any contrary information lie if he needs to why if it helps him and frankly i think in trump world in his mind anyone who doesn't lie like he is is just a sucker and a loser congressman adam schiff thank you very much for joining us after your very busy day we really appreciate it thank you and

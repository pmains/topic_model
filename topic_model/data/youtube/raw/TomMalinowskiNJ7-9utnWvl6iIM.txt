tom malinowski joining me live from washington dc and he's just been appointed vice chair of the house committee on foreign affairs uh so congratulations on that appointment it will be an a a very important one and one that will be closely watched of course from this part of the world you clearly feel very strongly about freezing these arms sales to saudi arabia who you know you can explain to me why they shouldn't be a a crucial u.s ally uh in a moment just explain why you feel so um that this is such an important issue thank you so much that the war in yemen as i'm sure your viewers are are very much aware is is led to the worst humanitarian crisis in the world thousands of deaths uh hundreds of thousands of uh civilians vulnerable to disease and starvation and saudi arabia has recklessly fueled this conflict ignoring the concerns of of the united states the united states congress most of the trump administration i guess with the exception of the president and his family for the last uh the last five or six years so we feel and this isn't just democrats in congress overwhelming majorities uh in congress for several years have felt that the united states should not be facilitating uh the uh saudi arabia's uh offensive airstrikes that have caused so much of this harm over the last few years and uh that the biden administration agrees and has taken this this early action riyadh's position of course uh is and and one assumes will be uh that yemen and the houthi insurgency there and the attacks from the houthis on the kingdom um is a is an issue of of national sovereignty and as a key us ally in the region they will rely on the us for support what is your message then to the kingdom my my message our message is that saudi arabia is completely dependent on the united states or its defense um and yet has completely ignored american concerns about the war in yemen about human rights about mistreatment of american citizens um you know saudi arabia wants to talk about sovereignty it needs to account for the fact that its government kidnapped an american resident off of u.s soil and dismembered him several years ago and and only got away with it because of the close personal relationship between the saudi royal family and president trump's family well that's that's no longer there it has to now take some responsibility uh for making this relationship better rather than relying on americans to always ignore saudi misbehave in the letter that you co-wrote you outline four actions that you wish to see the biden administration take and i just want our viewers to to um uh understand these they were implement immediate accountability measures for the hishochi assassination two was freeze delivery of offensive weapons to saudi arabia three reversed the fto uh designation of the houthis as a terror organization and four demand release of american citizens arbitrarily detained by the saudi government have you received a response to this letter well i guess the first response was in the form of the decision that the biden administration just made to uh to do one of the things that a bipartisan majority of members of congress have been asking for to to freeze these arms sales uh i i would we expect based on statements from the administration that they they will declassify uh information that the intelligence community has uh regarding the ultimate responsibility for the murder of jamal khashoggi uh secretary of state lincoln has also uh said that he is reviewing the the terrorism designation against the houthis um because of the humanitarian impact on the the yemeni civilian population and i have no doubt that the biden administration unlike the trump administration is going to have a zero tolerance policy or mistreatment and uh an unlawful detention of american citizens uh i mean we have one american citizen of saudi origin who who is in prison as a doctor from boston who's in prison in saudi arabia uh for the crime of of becoming an american citizen without the permission of the saudi royal family this is not a government that is acting like a u.s ally if it wants to be treated like a u.s ally it needs to act like a usl on one of the points that you were just discussing there the reversal of the designation of the houthis um with respect anthony blinken as you rightly point out has said that he will review that designation he said review rather than reverse um i wonder whether you believe that was sort of uh taking a sort of middle ground approach or how you would describe what you heard from anthony blinken and if you can just explain to us um just how easy it is uh to actually reverse that decision made by the trump administration and it's dying hours as it were so he didn't say review rather than the diverse it would make no sense to review such a decision unless you were considering uh reversing it that's that's the point remember president biden has been in office for just a few days uh there's there's a lot on his plate and the responsible thing when you're when you're dealing with a complicated problem like this is to begin with a review both uh tony blinken the secretary of state and jake sullivan the new national security adviser have have said that they were very troubled by the decision to designate the houthis not because the houthis are nice people they are equally responsible i would say saudi arabia for the suffering of the yemeni people and deserve to be held accountable but the practical difficulty here is that it just is not possible to provide the humanitarian assistance to the 80 percent of the yemeni innocent civilian population that is under houthi control if the entire houthi movement in government is is designated it just creates enormous practical difficulties for for saving lives and so what i imagine they will do is look for a way to hold the houthis accountable as they deserve to be but without making it impossible for the un and humanitarian agencies to provide life-saving help for completely innocent people in that country no and you make a very good point because uh you know just the reversing reversing this designation doesn't necessarily mean that the war you know the war is going to be you know the war will end any time soon um and nor indeed would the freeze on arms sales um were that to become permanent that is the issue isn't it but you know that at this point you know this is a war that continues uh correct i mean neither of these neither of these moves uh are necessarily gonna end this war this conflict in yemen which has been so destructive to so many by themselves no but but do keep in mind as i said at the outset saudi arabia is entirely dependent on the united states to maintain its defenses and its military uh efforts uh it's not just it's not just arms that the united states sells uh one of the we sell the service of helping to maintain um the the saudi air force in in ways that you know if that were removed it would be very very difficult for saudi arabia to sustain a a massive campaign of air strikes over yemen for for a long period of time somebody's got to service those american provided aircraft um and they can't do it without our help so it does it does give the biden administration a lot of leverage to um to go back to diplomacy and to and to persuade the saudis to to to to be open to a political settlement to this conflict i'd like to talk to you at length um this region is our region and and i'm fascinated to get your uh position on on various different issues not least uh the appointment of of uh rob malley of course and and the biden position on iran um i can't do that now because i gotta have to take a a break we are a packed show this evening but i'd love to have you back sir so please uh let's talk again in the uh weeks to come and it'll be fascinating to get your insight given your new position uh on that foreign affairs committee thank you

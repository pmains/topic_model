the balance of his time for purpose does the gentleman from the Northern Mariana Islands seek recognition mr. Chairman I have an amendment at the desk the clerk will report the amendments as in the clerk will designate the amendment without objection I met offered by mr. Sablan of Northern Mariana Islands pursuant to House Resolution 303 the gentleman from the northern marianas islands and a member opposed each will control five minutes the chair will recognize the gentleman from the Northern Marianas Islands thank you very much mr. chairman mr. chairman we all agreed that the Department of Defense has the responsibility to defend our nation but the department also has a responsibility to clean up after itself when he could dominate our environment or threatens Public Health and we in Congress have a responsibility to give the military the money needs for that clean up the amendment I offer adds 20 1.3 million to the formerly used defense sites program i plan to withdraw the amendment out of respect for chairman trailing hyacinth and his subcommittee who actually added 25 we look to the Fox program above the President's budget I request but I want to make the point that we ought to keep funding at the same level we appropriated in fiscal 2015 250 million dollars and that is what my amendment would do because now it's not the time for the military to backslide on its clean up there are 5,000 sites in every state and territory that we know are contaminated and these sites are not in someone else's backyard 87 are formally used if insights are in German failing Hassan state of New Jersey 42 photo sites are in ranking member of this class c state of indiana and in my district I represent a northern mariana islands there are 24 contaminated areas dating back to World War two still waiting to be cleaned up for example 17 rusted few tanks in the little village of the knock-back leaking oil to the ground since Harry Truman was president and every day kids walking by to school fisherman until a good just a few feet away families living with the smell of oil in their homes this is not just an environmental issue these are finished screen of damages our military's ability to defend our nation and let me explain in the Northern Marianas today the Defense Department wants to expand training activities using live fire running pipelines building more fuel tanks doing the very things we know contaminate the environment and threaten Public Health and the people I represent are saying no to this expanded military activity now restoring fats funding will not change anyone's mind about the military's proposed buildup in my district but at least the military would have a little more credibility when it promises that it will clean up after itself because if the people I represent see Congress cutting funds for fats does the military promise has no credibility at all and this is not just about the northerners this is a national issue we are 5,000 sites currently identified for cleanup nationwide and another 10,000 on the list of potentially contaminated sites and even if we appropriate 150 million dollars for 2016 it is not enough the Army Corps of Engineers estimate total cleanup costs of 14 billion dollars so at porn fifty dollars a year we will still be having this same discussion fifty years from now again I commend the chairman and his subcommittee for adding 225 million to the formerly used defense sites program but ultimately we all have to do better and I thank you mr. chairman and I ask unanimous consent to withdraw this amendment oh yeah I yield to mr. chairman ranking member biscaia preciate the gentleman's statement before the floor and to bring the issue to the members attention as you rightfully point out and not only for the constituency you represent but the chair myself and whether it was in any of our districts as you also rightfully point out this is a national problem it tends to be forgotten because it's not seen visually by the average constituent but very serious a health and environmental problem and do appreciate you raising it to join this particular debate thank the gentleman for yielding yes sir and again I am I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment at this without objection the amendment by the gentleman from the northern mariana islands is withdrawn Thank You mr. Sherman

you know as we all know the delta variant is making its way across america and the way i look at it is if you haven't had the vaccine yet this is a great opportunity for you to talk to your doctor about the pros and cons and the risk and benefits of taking the vaccine on the other hand i think we can all take a deep breath a sigh of relief that the science shows us there's no reason to panic over the delta variant here's the good news within two weeks two-thirds of all american adults will have had both vaccinations ninety percent of seniors will have had both vaccinations and the people that are left that haven't had the vaccination we probably think half of those have natural immunity and i would also add by the way that for our children probably 40 percent or more have had the vaccination as well i want to reassure america that either natural immunity having had the virus or vaccination provide exceptional defense against the delta variant and all variants as far as we know in fact they probably prevent over 95 percent of hospitalizations due to the delta variant and i think that's what's important to be falling right now is the number of hospitalizations and death from the delta variant not necessarily just the number of people that are carrying colonizing the virus right now look the science has not changed and the clinical picture of america looks better every day this is not the time to close down schools it's not the time to close down our economy or insist on mass mandates this is the time to believe in the science to work with the science that our vaccines and natural immunity that they actually work that you should have confidence in them that we don't need mass if you've had the vaccine or if you have natural immunity we don't need to shut things down that is not the thing that we should do look as far as i know not one child under the age of 18 has died from covid unless they had some type of a of a serious health condition as well on the other hand we know that mask and closing schools without doubt is a cause of psychological and academic harm to our children i believe it entrusts our local school boards to make the right decision not ordered by decree of politicians and bureaucrats here in washington d.c listen this is not the time to panic it's not the time for fear mongering either that doesn't do anybody any good science is not on the side of the fear mongers here's the bottom line if you haven't had the vaccine or if you haven't tested positive for the virus go to your doctor ask him for the antibody test and then you and your doctor should decide the pros and cons the risk and benefits and if you want the vaccine so thank you so much i'm glad you had you all came out today and we will try to answer some of your questions

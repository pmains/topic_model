Out of Milk republican from Georgia joins us now this morning Congressman you know what doesn't matter what the Republicans say the president is going to continue this attack on Medicare and Social Security and that the GOP wants to do away with them exactly right I mean I thought from listening to his speech the other night in Congress that he claimed he converted the Republicans even though from the very beginning Kevin McCarthy was clear that as we negotiate on the the uh raising the debt ceiling that those two items are off the table there's plenty of other things we can go to to cut spending without touching those Investments that the American people have made themselves but yeah look when your your approval ratings are that low you're very desperate and as you just said he has made the the same proposal that he's accusing the Republicans of making he's made it himself in the past all right I want to get on to this uh um issue as well which I just don't understand despite the Biden Administration denying plans to ban gas stoves the energy department has quietly put forth a proposal to limit energy consumption for gas stoves which could effectively end the use of them I mean what do you think of that congresswoman I'm surprised he hasn't accused the Republicans of wanting to ban gas those at this point look this is exactly what he does in his administration he makes a claim he says he backs off of it but he quietly allows the administration the bureaucracies to go ahead with it that's what he did with petroleum with uh with oil early on he said he started backing off but he didn't what he did is had the EPA as he said look we're going to open more leases he tells the EPA to not approve those leases based on environmentals and this is this is the way this Administration Works they they tell you one thing and behind the scenes they're going to do another he'll float a trial balloon no pun intended with that but he'll float a trial balloon on something and when there's bad response he'll say okay we're not going to do it but yet he's empowering the bureaucracies to carry out that that policy but this is insane he's got a strangle hold on the oil industry and the gas industry at the same time wanting to take away uh gas stoves I mean is this what the American people want it is not what the American people want but this Administration has proved time and time again the American people are just a distraction to him they're an obstruction to getting done what he and the far left radicals that are pulling the levers behind the scenes this is what they want he could care less what the American people wants except for he he does want to get reelected so he'll he'll play the game a little bit hoping that we don't see the reality of it but this is this is the America they want an America that they Define that they strip away every freedom that every American has to fit a mold that they decide through the bureaucracy of what America should be regardless of what you think regardless of what you want and and a perfect illustration of that was during the State of the Union Address with all the rampant crime that's going on people being their their property being stolen they're being murdered the only thing he wanted to crack down on were those who fraudulently took coveted relief funds he's going to aggressively hunt those down and prosecute them so if if someone steals from the individual citizen that's no big deal but don't you steal from the federal government

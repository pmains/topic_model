this morning the Washington Post wrote a piece titled black Republicans are no longer hiding as they run for Congress now one of the most prominently featured was Houston area Republican candidate Wesley hunt a West Point Grant an army vet is leading his Democrat opponent in the polls hunt adding you're seeing black conservatives no longer hiding from what we do traditionally Houston area Republican Congressional candidate Wesley hunt joins us now Wesley What's Happening Here I know this was a fairly conservative District but just around the country you see you see a change like people have kind of had enough well I think when President Biden says you know if you don't vote for me then you ain't black oh I love that and I've been black for a long time uh I think it's very insulting to Black voters and I'm running here in the district Congressional District 38 it's the newest one right here in Texas it's a predominantly white District a district that President Trump would have won by over 20 points and a black man is going to be a congressman that seat and the reason why is because we don't care about race religion color or Creed we just want good governance if for whatever reason the Democrat Party has pitched to black people that you have to vote for us no matter what and that's just not true and they've also convinced black people that white Republicans won't vote for black Republicans well that's not true either well Democrat pollster Cornell Belcher has a theory Wesley about why blacks are moving toward the GOP check it out uh going into 2016. I think we didn't know exactly the the extent to which sort of misinformation and some of the the Russian meddling uh had on the election immediately we've seen this sort of trick this sort of trickery before especially aimed at minority minority voters again this is you know once again another hurdle for minorities voting Wesley um he's already laying the groundwork to try to dismiss a republican victory yeah I think what people have to realize that this is the worst inflation I've seen in my lifetime just the worst border crisis that we've seen in my lifetime enough fentanyl has poured into our country to kill every American five times this is the worst crime that we have seen in our cities and by the way this influences everyone particularly black and brown people and we are not stupid 2.2 million people have been apprehended that doesn't include the uh God always just in the last year yes yes 2.2 million so if you do the the math on it it's really like 10 million maybe over the last couple of years and all the godaways and all the absolutely you know other problems I mean this is this is not just a Texas problem this is an American problem it most certainly is and so when you couple that with the idea of defunding the police and then you want to take away our Second Amendment rights and I wonder why we are all upset and this is why black people are saying enough's enough the Democrat Party has not done good by us it is time for us to look at other options and that's why why I'm here Wesley congratulations I shouldn't say it it's premature about two weeks from tonight I'll call you and say congratulations great to see you thank you for having me all right thanks for coming in the studio

statement Thank You chair to get for holding this important hearing the Energy and Commerce Committee has been steadfast in its efforts to help combat the opioid crisis with both investigations and legislation where there was the committee's investigations into opioid distributors patient brokering or major auto manufacturers we've continued to ask questions and demand answers for the American people when it comes to legislation this committee led the way on passage of the 21st century cures Act the comprehensive addiction and Recovery Act and in the support act for patients and communities I was proud to work with these three landmark bills which are advancing treatment and recovery initiatives improving prevention for taking communities and bolstering our efforts to fight deadly illicit synthetic drugs like fentanyl that no is this is synthetic opioid that is 80 to 100 times stronger than morphine in 50 times more potent than heroin for many years pharmaceutical fentanyl has been utilized as a powerful pain medicine to treat severe pain such as advanced cancer pain commonly used in the form of a patch on the skin or a lollipop but pharmaceutical fentanyl is not what why we're here today we're here today because of concerns over illicit or illegally manufactured fentanyl the fentanyl crisis is particularly dangerous because of its high potency and the small amount required to potentially cause an overdose and it has become a powerful additive to drugs such as heroin cocaine or counterfeit pills with or without the users knowledge according to the CDC in 2017 there were more than 28,000 deaths involving synthetic opioids in United States which is more deaths than from any other type of opioid further overdose death rates from synthetic opioids increased all across all demographics County urbanization levels in numerous states a little bit of fentanyl goes a long way which makes it harder for the law enforcement to track where and how fentanyl is being purchased Findo can be purchased on the internet both an open-source and on the dark web and can be purchased pseudo anonymously using Bitcoin or cryptocurrency in addition to being smuggled across our borders Findo can be mailed in small quantities through the Postal Service or Express consignment carriers and therefore has a higher likelihood of coming in the United States undetected these circumstances require a much different approach to intelligence interdiction and law enforcement compared to methods that may be better suited for what might be considered a more common drug smuggling operation the threat is real and has been growing over the past few years according the Customs and Border Protection data in fiscal year 2015 seventy pounds of fentanyl were seized in United States in comparison for fiscal year 2018 more than 2,000 pounds of fentanyl was seized further for fiscal year 2019 to date there have been seventeen thousand and three pounds of fentanyl seized which is enough fentanyl for more than 600 million lethal doses of fentanyl and we still have four more months of data to account for before we know the total for this year I want to acknowledge some of the efforts and accomplishments of this administration including but not limited to HHS establishing an inner part mental substance use disorder Coordinating Committee China pledging to add phenol to its list of controlled substances increasing shipment tracking responsibilities and coordination among multiple entities and disruption efforts which has taken down an entire online black market where we are already seeing new tools and resources provided and utilized as a result of this committee and administration's work the threat still exists and our work is not done I want to thank all the witnesses for being here today I look forward to hearing from all of you about successes we have had in combating our nation's vendo threat but also how the threat has changed what challenges remain and what more we in Congress can do to be partners in this fight I yield back

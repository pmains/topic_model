this is a difficult time right now for a lot of our nation's farmers particularly those who hail from my home state of Indiana adverse weather conditions have have complicated the planting season in fact so many Hoosier farmers can't get their crops into the ground as of last week only 31% of our corn crop was able to find its way into the ground as compared to 67% nationally and so this is really this is putting so many of our farmers in a difficult spot the June 5th deadline by which one can plan and still be eligible for full crop insurances passed so now our farmers are faced with a deduction on all that they're eligible for our farmers face some really confusing options and I'm glad that the United States Senate working with the house and this president have been able to get a disaster bill passed and signed into law but now it comes time for implementation and I just am really hopeful that USDA will be issuing guidance soon so that our farmers know how to apply for the crop and livestock loss monies that are available to them from last year and for this year we will be pressing the AG department to move hard there a lot of good people over there that are not-- I know trying to make this happen quickly

dollars are headed right here to our area to help try and process DNA evidence quicker that money coming from the feds Congressman Garrett Graves hopes this leads to criminals being held accountable for their actions sooner Lester Dewey is in the alert center with how this will all work Lester yeah guys the money is coming from the Department of Justice and will provide the East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff's Office with rapid DNA testing technology to hopefully get rid of the backlog of DNA tests at the state police crime lab quicker with the help of Congressman Garrett Graves the East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff's Office will be getting millions of dollars for New Rapid DNA technology it means the people that are guilty they are going to be held accountable much sooner not leaving him out on the street to commit other crimes for longer periods of time typical DNA testing can take up to 30 days but rapid DNA can come back to investigators within 90 minutes if a suspect's DNA is linked to other crimes we want to prevent crimes before they ever happen we want to solve crimes when they do happen we want to give closure to the families and we want to make sure we take a dangerous criminal off the street right now State police's crime lab serves nine parishes including Orleans and East Baton Rouge Parish which leads to a backlog you can imagine how that DNA lab is uh overwhelmed right now just with violent crime and not even speaking about property crime so this can really help us tremendously district attorney Hiller Moore hopes this will help solve both violent and property crime in Baton Rouge and get the suspects faster every day that goes by after a crime occurs you know it's not good for us it ages and it sometimes unfortunately ages out and other things happen so the quicker for us the better the swabs will create a DNA profile from a high quality single Source sample I use blood as an example where if one single Source has a drop of blood that you kind of know that came from this person it's not a mixture of spatters or blood or like a door handle while the rapid test is one more tool for law enforcement we're told it can only be used in certain cases and the funding will only cover a limited number of kits to start and all other DNA will still head to the state police crime lab but Congressman Graves says there's still work to do but but Lester also want to be clear this is this is a good step in the right direction it is not all that needs to be done we've got to hire up more police officers we've got to make sure we're working with the judges the judicial system to hold these people accountable to keep them in jail so this technology could also be used to clear anyone suspected of a crime we're told officials are hopeful this can all get started in the upcoming months guys back to you

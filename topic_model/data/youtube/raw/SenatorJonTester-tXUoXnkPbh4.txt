senator from Montana I want to thank the president for recognition thank you very much tonight once again Congress is proving to the American people that Washington is broken this bill is not a product of deliberation of the world's most deliberative body it is a product is not a product of meaningful public hearings it is not a product of compromise or months of hard work between multiple committees and it is certainly not a product of a grand legislative idea that was desperately needed to meet the demands of the public the bill in front of us is the product of dysfunction partisanship and political desperation 30 years ago the Senate passed President Reagan's tax reform 97 to 3 after the conference committee had worked it over it passed overwhelmingly by with 74 votes that could have been the case today but there was never an attempt to have an honest debate about this bill and there was no attempt to get bipartisan buying I reached out to lean lend my perspective in Montana's perspective the perspective of rural America but my offer fell on deaf ears and I never heard back I asked the President to work with me I raised my concerns early but and they never made an attempt to address those concerns there was no effort to reach across the aisle to build consensus for this bill once again the leadership of this body chose to draw a line in the sand they chose to empower the fringes and leave those in the middle out in the cold as a result the first major tax bill in Congress in a generation will likely pass with only support of one party that is not what the founding fathers had in mind as for me I wanted a tax bill that would assure hard-working Montana families and businesses had a say in this process I wanted to construct a bipartisan bill that provided folks with tax relief without adding to the debt and I wanted to simplify the tax code without gutting provisions that would help build our middle class but today we're stuck with this final bill that does none of those and our options are yes or no now there are some things in this bill that are good three to be exact this bill keeps in place important medical deductions that benefits seniors and helps them pay for care as they age that expands the child tax credit abroad a boost to families across the country it lowers income tax brackets to keep a few extra bucks in your pocket each year but when we look at the bill we have to weigh the good and the bad so speaking of those individual tax cuts the ones I just talked about a few seconds ago well they're only temporary they're short-term problems that will disappear with the wind an estimates show that more than 80% of this bill benefits will go to the top 1% 60% go to the top 1/10 of 1% of our population in fact hardworking families will actually see a tank tax hike within 10 years but this country's biggest corporations this bill makes their tax cuts permanent so at the same time that taxes start rising for teachers and farmers and electricians and nurses and working folks large corporations and big businesses will still be reaping the benefits from the giveaways in this piece of legislation on top of huge benefits this bill makes no attempt to ensure that these corporations will use the savings to create more good-paying jobs this bill also destroys the foundation of our health care system 13 million Americans because of this bill will become uninsured and everyone else's premiums will go up by about 10 percent they will be more expensive to see your doctor it will be harder for rural hospitals and clinics to keep their doors open and more folks will end up in emergency room the most expensive medical treatment they will be sicker and their treatment will be more expensive and the rest of us will be forced to pay for it but the bad list doesn't stop there it forces a 25 billion dollar cut to Medicare this bill pushes millions of people out of itemizing their deductions reducing incentives to buy a home or donate to a charity if caps state and local income tax deductions which targets middle-class families it changes the way we adjust tax brackets for inflation which will force future generations to play catch-up it will force state budgets into the red and put critical healthcare education and law enforcement initiatives on the chopping ball and it opens up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil drilling but that's not the worst thing about this bill the worst thing about this bill is it saddles our kids and grandkids with more crushing definitely you know it was in 2008 in 2009 this country was going through one of the worst economic crisis since the 1930s the debt was increased in that period of time people often say the government needs to be run like a business well if you have a business and incomes not coming in you have to borrow some money that's what happened with the economic downturn the money wasn't coming in so our debt went up on the other side if you're in business and you're making a few bucks and times are better and they're good you pay that debt down well this country is in a lot better shape now than it was in 2008 9 we should be paying that debt down at this moment I'm not adding a trillion and a half to it now I'm going to tell you as sure as I'm standing here today within the first quarter of 2018 there will be folks standing up on the other side of the aisle saying we need to cut Medicare we need to cut Social Security we need to take away subsidies for everybody whether it be farmers mothers young families disabled veterans money that's used to keep our public lands in public hands dollars that are used to make education more affordable dollars for health care overall they will tell us that we simply cannot afford them because our debt is so high but today today we're going to tack a trillion and a half on for the sake of giving of the rich a tax benefit in middle-class families a temporary benefit there will go away over the next 10 years how they've so quickly forgot the so restraint that we've talked about when Democrats controlled this body our national debt is already about 20 million 20 trillion dollars this is more than 64 thousand for every man woman and child in this country the path we're on is truly unsustainable it's not the first time we've been down this road Bush tax cuts were sold to the American people and we were told that they would pay for themselves well guess what today those Bush tax cuts are directly responsible for one third of that twenty trillion dollar debt we know this to be true yet here we are about to swipe the credit card one more time for over a trillion and a half to put our kids and our grandkids on the hook to pay it back well we get temporary relief and the large corporations get permanent relief for those of us who were ignored during this process this is what we're stuck with some good things but a whole bunch of bad things more than I can count on my hands we can't celebrate the good things that ignore the bad just because we ignore it doesn't mean that it's not going to come true this bill will not strengthen the middle class it won't improve our schools it won't lower the cost for health care let's call it what it is it is a tax giveaway to the wealthy mass is tax reform and those that vote YES on this bill will do so at the expense of our kids and our grandkids they will be paying this tab long after we are gone and what is ironic about this is most of people that serve in this body say we I'm here to make sure the next generation has opportunity we are taking away their opportunity with this bill it will limit their opportunity it will cap their potential all for what well I'm not really sure because when I go back to Montana every weekend folks aren't stopping me on the streets and telling me that corporations and the wealthy need a tax giveaway what they do tell me is we need to make sure that programs like chip were around that we need to make sure that Medicare and Social Security are there for future generations we need to protect our public we need to pass a farm bill that works that we need to invest in infrastructure well folks this tax bill takes away all of that potential we've been at war for 16 or 17 years the military needs rebuilding it makes it much more tougher everybody knows what's going on in North Korea the potential to have to spend a bunch of money there it's real in infrastructure whether it's highways and bridges or broadband or water systems in dire need of help but the fact is is the the tracks are greased this bill is going to pass and rather than working on the pressing issues around here the next excuse is going to be entitlement reform which means we're going to do our level best and the name of the debt to get Medicare and Social Security and who knows what else will be put on the chopping block to be ripped away from working families this bill tires our hands prevents us from making the kind of investments we need to build a strong middle class which has been the envy of the world and it puts our most vulnerable at risk I'm going to vote no on this bill because it is a step backwards it raises the debt it does nothing to solve the income inequalities in this country and it pushes the American dream further out of reach president I yield the floor

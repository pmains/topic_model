Thank You chairwoman I want to thank the chairman commissioners for being here the FCC is responsible for a vast array of issues and I welcome the opportunity to discuss a couple of them today diving right in I want to talk about broadband deployment one of the most important tools the FCC uses to encourage broadband deployment is through the connect America fund which helps make deploying and maintaining broadband internet possible in remote and rural and underserved areas across our nation these are areas like Mecca thermal Coachella in my district where I grew up where it's rural area farm worker area where we also have some tribes or a tribe that also exists in that area and we know that there are some classrooms in the Coachella Valley Unified School District that doesn't have access to good internet where teachers have to print out a YouTube video and show them as slides so that the kids can can can get the the information but also the CV Unified School District and the community work together to provide every student K through 12 an iPad or a tablet to boost achievement and narrow that digital divide where oftentimes when I grew up there we had dilapidated books and we didn't have the most recent copyrighted book as well unfortunately however broadband deployment across the region remains spotty at best limiting the ability for students to take full advantage of this technology in December of 2015 I wrote to the FCC in favor of frontier communications proposal to acquire Verizon's wireless networks and supporting their commitment and working together with my office to utilize the connect America fund to deploy high-speed Internet in those underserved areas in my district and I urge the FCC to support frontiers efforts to deploy broadband in my communities and to hold frontier accountable to their commitments to closing the digital divide through their acceptance of connect America funding and so my first question to chairman hi are you committed to ensuring all connect American Funds recipients are fulfilling their responsibilities under the program absolutely congressman yes and and how are you going to monitor that progress two different ways up front we have required the recipients of that funding to build out to 40 percent of the territory but in end of this year twenty percent by the end of 2018 20 percent by 2019 and the final twenty percent by the end of 2020 we require reporting obligations throughout and on the back end there's accountability if they do not say if they do not build what they said they would build out then we will require the accelerate Thank You Mac thank you this is obviously a critical program not only for the people and the families I represent but millions of Americans who still lack access to broadband now switching gears my next question is about addressing the challenge of and in some cases the other lack of diversity in media programming ownership and viewpoints for me this isn't about some statistic it's about the children in our communities who deserve to see their stories their communities their experiences their role models their culture portrayed on the screen and a positive light it's about giving our young people more inspiration and more role models to look up to on the screen and behind the screens and when they believe that they can dream big and fight to make those dreams come true our nation as a whole reaps the benefits I firmly believe that we need to see real progress real change if we're going to need and we're going to need to improve the diversity of those decision-makers at the top as we've seen several mergers over the years and the evolution of how people consume media content we must ensure that diversity in programming and content is not diminishing as the agency who has overseen numerous mergers over the years the FCC has a responsibility to take public interest into account in determining whether to approve a particular proposal chairman pie very briefly if you don't mind because I do have another question the FCC considered diversity when reviewing proposed mergers under the public interest lens that is one of the factors that goes into our analysis and Commissioner Clyburn you have been a champion for this issue in the past how do you think the FCC and Congress can work to improve diversity on and off the camera I think one reason a one way is through ownership just stamping every merger that comes our way it's not going to help in terms of diversifying the ecosystem a tax certificate program that works extremely well an incubator program that I think will work extremely well that we could possibly relax some of our ownership obligations those are two proven ways I believe that we could further infuse and diversify the marketplace good I look forward to working with you both on this particular issue in the future thank you I yield back

action to the president's decision today John Hoeven is Republican senator from North Dakota senator thanks for being here good to be with your reaction to this today well look it's no surprise but he made the political decision the American people overwhelmingly support this project rather than deciding for energy for the American people you know he made the political decision and really the winners OPEC this is the kind of decision that you know prevents us from building the energy infrastructure we need producing more energy here at home so we go back to relying on energy from places like the Middle East the company was going to pull back the project and then this decision happened officially yeah well how do you think that broke down the whole thing was very odd you know we talked to the company we talked to obviously the Canadian government and the State Department had contacted TransCanada and said you know will you withdraw the project this was like withdraw the application this was like last Friday company said no so the State Department said well how about if you pause it and put out a press release you're willing to do that which the company agreed to do they do that on Monday Tuesday Josh earnest says nope we're not going to pause the project and then they get a letter rejecting the request for the pause or suspension and today the president comes out and declines the project again all political not following the law or the regulation as they're supposed to do for the people who say listen this isn't good for the environment this wasn't the right plan this you know they argue all kinds of points about this despite what the State Department report had said over several years what do you say that they need to read the environmental impact statement look this was a seven-year process and the comments the president made today actually are contradicted by the State Department report and the environmental impact statement which says no significant environmental impact and so again you know ironically now this oil is going to move it's still going to be produced in Canada and up in our part of the country Montana North Dakota but it's moving by rail rather than by pipe and you actually have higher greenhouse gas emissions that it verse is building the pipeline here is another element the president talked about today specifically addressing Congress tickle is okay the pipeline would not make a meaningful long-term contribution to our economy so if Congress is serious about wanting to create jobs this was not the way to do it if they want to do it what we should be doing is passing a bipartisan infrastructure plan that in the short term could create more than 30 times as many jobs per year as the pipeline would your response center yes so that's what I'm saying his comments are directly contradicted by the State Department report and the environmental impact statement look this pipeline is part of building the energy infrastructure we need so that we can produce energy in this country and become energy secure or energy independent but you need the pipelines the transmission lines the road and the rail to move that energy from where it's produced to where it's consumed so right he turns this project down now when prices are low like I say great news for OPEC because after a while when prices start going back up there back in the driver's seat and we haven't made the investments that we need to make to become energy self-sufficient think about if you're a company or a CEO and you're contemplating investing the hundreds of millions or billions in the building infrastructure and you have this kind of arbitrary process we've talked about covered Keystone for a long time there are a lot of other pipelines in our country right do you think that this if a Republican president gets elected that this is one of the first things that happens sure no question if we get a Republican president novice this will be approved we have the support in Congress to do it the challenge is going to be whether we can get enough votes to override his veto where it's 63 so we need four more in the Senate their clothes in the house or whether we can attach it to other legislation to get something done sooner or in the event that we have a Democrat president are you going to try that oh sure absolutely but again this is about and this will be certainly an issue in the presidential campaign are we going to the energy in this country and build the energy infrastructure we need to move it safely and efficiently or are we going to continue to rely on energy from the Middle East that's the question and you know what the American people want they want to produce that energy here at home and work with our closest ally Canada senator thanks for being here thanks appreciate

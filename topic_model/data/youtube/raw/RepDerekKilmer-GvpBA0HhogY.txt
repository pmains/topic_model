the gentleman is recognized for one minute thanks mr. speaker I want to thank my friend and co-founder of the Puget Sound recovery caucus representative heck for his partnership on the Puget SOS act as you heard from him the Puget Sound is truly a gift that we need to restore and protect generations have enjoyed the ability to swim and fish and dig for clams in this iconic body of water they've built lives and made livelihoods on the Puget Sound but for the millions of residents that call Puget Sound home and for future generations we absolutely have to take action to fight for the sound and that's why I invite my colleagues to sponsor the Puget SOS Act this bill raises the profile of Puget Sound by naming it a nationally significant body of water enhances the federal government's coordination in addressing these issues it respects tribal treaty rights this bill is an important step I look forward to continue to work for Puget Sound our kids including my two little girls are counting on us and I yield back the balance of my time the gentleman yields back

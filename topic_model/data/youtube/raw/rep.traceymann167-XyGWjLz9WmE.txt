madam speaker i rise today to voice my strong opposition to president biden's budget proposal for exclusion of the hyde amendment which for 45 years has protected americans from forced financial complicity in abortion and abortion services when congress passed the hyde amendment in 1976 our country's lawmakers had the sense and decency to agree that if abortions were going to take place in the country at least dissenting americans wouldn't get stuck with the bill forcing people to pay for the killing of babies with their tax dollars is unconscionable that's why the hyde amendment was passed now the president wants to revoke this protection if his as if his six trillion dollar budget which would blatantly require us to raise taxes or print money under bankruptcy wasn't already disastrous enough i believe that life begins at conception and that unborn children in our country have a right to live every member of congress should but one does not need to in order to support the hyde amendment which prohibits the federal government from forcing americans the from forcing the american public to do something that we should never ask them to do pay for abortion

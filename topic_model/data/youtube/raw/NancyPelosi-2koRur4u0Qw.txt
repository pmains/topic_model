hello my name is congressman Bennie Thompson from the second District of Mississippi I serve as the chairman of the committee on Homeland Security the corona virus pandemic is one of the most challenging adversaries our country has faced many Americans have faced unimaginable grief millions of families up unsure about their future all Americans have changed their daily lives and I worry about the health of our loved ones we must thank the thousands of health care workers first responders and other essential workers who are helping us get through this they are our heroes I also thank all of you for following social distancing guidelines and for following the orders of your home states while there are many challenges our here we are hoping that the darkest days may be behind us but before we move forward we must get to the truth the truth is that the response to this pandemic has not been as stellar as the president keeps repeating the truth is that there is much more we need to fix now to get it right first is testing Congress worked together over six weeks ago to pass legislation for better testing despite promises from an administration on testing since the beginning of March we'll steal behind on testing this has hurt our ability to get ahead of the virus so far only 1% of the country has been tested we are stories every day about people waiting in line overnight to get tested we're processing backlogs mean many don't get results for weeks and this week fewer were tested than last week this is not right unfortunately we've seen no leadership from the president he's quick to put all blame and responsibility for testing on the states this is not true and is not the American Way the truth in we need a whole-of-government response for a nationwide crisis all our states are in crisis and need federal assistance the truth is without widespread testing we cannot resume our lives next with proper testing we must also compile the necessary data on how kovat 19 is affecting different communities it has become clear that this disease disproportionately impacts communities of color if we want to address disparities and outcomes and move forward we need administration to work with States to document the relevant data and share it we also must make sure that our health care workers and first responders have the necessary PPE and medical supplies and equipment they still need we had an emergency response system at the ready to properly quickly and equitably distribute supplies however the administration has upended this system putting political actors we're experienced professionals once were there efforts have been wrought with chaos delays and accusations of political bias states were told they were on their own only to see the administration out beating them and rerouting their shipments no state should have to compete with other states or the federal government to get what they need if we are to succeed in this crisis and work together we must use the truth as our guide while we have hard days ahead we must rely on science and data and follow the directions of the health experts and doctors what we do in the coming weeks will be key to our recovery you can be sure that House Democrats will continue to use the truth as we put workers and families first thank you for listening and be safe

I thank the chairwoman for yielding and I think all of our witnesses for appearing today to discuss the reauthorization of the National Flood Insurance Program which as we all know and has been said multiple times is set to expire yet again in May you know I spoke on the house floor in November expressing my profound dismay with the eighth eighth short-term extension vote since fiscal year 17 with the NFIP being twenty point five billion dollars in debt we must reform the program to keep it solvent to provide coverage for those who truly need it and to protect the taxpayers from additional and future bailouts it is estimated that only 3.5 to 4.5% of current flood insurance policies are covered by the private sector mr. O'Mara do you believe that there should be greater private market participation in those policies that cover threats from floods absolutely and we see we see the opportunity of the federal program focused more on vulnerable communities in the private market take care of more folks that can afford it the flood insurance market is is dominated by NFIP mr. O'Mara do you consumers benefit from this journal monopoly I think more data and more competition is good you know and I think the concerns that have been raised in the past been discounted by the real life experience that states like Florida that have shown that you can actually have competitive marketplaces and how does it work in a Florida how is it working in an Arkansas in places like this but in a private market so the places that it's working best in places where the policies are at it got a good level I mean there's kind of good standards around them and then making sure that banks and others are kind of accepting those as fully fully viable alternatives to the the federal program did you layman when the NFIP was created in 1968 1968 I think I was six the belief was that the private insurance market lacked the data and ability to assess flood losses without a little conversation about Daddy here which has been very important especially that related to mapping tell me what has changed in terms of data technology and the markets ability to assess risk since 1968 there's a few things that have changed among other things the the insurance industry used to be much more local it is a global industry now reinsurers in particular operate internationally take large risks from different parts of the world balance them against each other and that's how they're able to cover very large events the the depth of the global reinsurance market the ability of catastrophe modeling the emergence of the catastrophe modeling industry and and just you know general changes in in how insurance is underwritten has made it possible for a private market to emerge it is not prepared to take over for the NFIP the NFIP remains the primary source what it is emerging and it will continue to grow what we need is both we we have 85% of the country without any flood insurance and there is a significant need for the marketing juggernaut of the insurance industry to start having an incentive to sell this coverage to people who don't currently happen and and in that same keeping which barriers within NFIP prevent private insurers from entering the market and how does some of these legislative drafts today help solve some of those problems it seems like a good number of the issues with with the banking requirements may be resolved by the rule that is currently open from the FDIC and the other banking regulators I understand that the FHA remains an open question and I know some of the other panelists have discussed that the biggest you know disincentive right now to the program is if you are going to move from the flood insurance program to a private policy and then wants to move back into the flood insurance program later you're not currently considered to have continuous coverage and so if you had a subsidized or grandfathered policy you would be stuck with the full risk rate I want policies that generally move towards full risk rates but that is that could be punitive in a in the short term in the short term in the long term though we could see real movement I think into the private sector and and some of the tools that we talked about like reinsurance and and additional data dealing with mapping and other things those fact checkers ought to be able to allow underwriters to move this into the private sector more would you agree I agree mr. Maira yes absolutely and may I add that on that lapse of 40,000 people that were purchasing a lot of those were FHA loans mm-hmm and they were not given an option to go and seek private mortgage insurance so that they could close that transaction I appreciate thinking I think the chair

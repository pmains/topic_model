thank you we've had an election the clear message is the American people are on the side of trade skeptics who don't think that the trade deals we've entered into in the past have been good and what we're going to see is a bait-and-switch because now we're being told the only problem is multilateral trade deals well t tip is a bilateral trade deal of course we're a union of 50 states they're a semi union of dozens of states NAFTA which is held out to be the worst deal you could call it a bilateral deal but all the controversial provisions of the us-mexico provisions if it was just the US Canada deal I don't think it would be discussed much so NAFTA's controversial positions are in effect a bilateral deal the South Korea d a South Korea deal which cost us as much jobs as any on a pound for pound bass basis is a bilateral deal so what we're going to be told is that the Wall Street elite should control American trade policy to the destruction of the American middle class but we should insist that they do it on a case-by-case country-by-country basis I would submit that American workers should not compete with 40-cent and our Vietnamese labor that cannot organize and has no freedom whether it's part of a TPP or whether it's an individual deal now I've been told that our Witnesses are generally trade Oh files rather than trade skeptics is that a mischaracterization of any of you know and so notwithstanding the wave and the message the only sing loud message he came from the American people the those who support these trade deals continue to dominate the discussion in here in Washington in looking at a trade deal and there are some worthy of support the issues that come up are investors bay state low wages labor rights environmental protection currency manipulation and balance of trade well with Britain um I low wages I think is one of the big problems because in theory a trade deal should equalize wages and both contracting parties well British wages are relatively high labor rights they've got stronger labor rights than we do or any of our witnesses familiar with the American right-to-work laws I don't see any but i'll point out that the State Department has testified before judge Bowen eyes subcommittee back in the day that our right to work laws or a violation of the UN declaration of human rights and international labor standards because they in effect make it impossible to organize unions environmental protections are strong in Britain's viewed on the world standard and I haven't seen serious currency manipulation so let's go back to investor state we're told in other trade agreements that we have to surrender our sovereignty and big give giant corporations a second way to attack our environmental and protections and consumer protections in order to give our corporations a fair shot when they're doing business abroad do our witnesses generally agree that American business can get a fair shake in British courts and therefore it's not necessary to have investor-state protections for American corporations dr. Hamilton if you can just give me a yes or no I guess yes what is it mr. Lester yes dr. garden balance of trade it would a deal with Britain that simply eliminated all tariffs ah be good or bad for reducing the Americas trade deficit dr. garner or for going it's possible that it can't be estimated but if you have an estimate lemme know well it would be good foldy the trade deficit would be good for the US economy I didn't ask the economy yeah we did we have the largest trade deficit in the history of a million life would a trade deal with Britain make that worse or better or you don't I would not make it worth it I i think that the united states would benefit from such a deal okay let's go look I can't estimate it but I also don't think trade deficits are bad for the economy we lose 10,000 jobs for every billion dollars of trade deficit and if you're not one of those 10,000 people and your statement go on dr. Hamilton us has a trade deficit in goods with European Union and UK but it has a trade surplus and sir yeah and I'm looking for the for the unified I some trade skeptics only focus on goods and imply the point where the batteries man open up the services economy across the Atlantic the United States Senate stands to benefit considerably okay and finally I'll point out that Britain has a health system that makes Obamacare look like it came from the Cato Institute and I yield back

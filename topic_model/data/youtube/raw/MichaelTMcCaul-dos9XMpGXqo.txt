i think from uh you know from a entergy perspective and this is a very you know as i said earlier an undefined battlefield it's very it's very murky it's very foggy and it's it's a 24x7 um in engagement and it's not going away so from my perspective we have to own our piece of i guess the battlefield and our our pieces is our system can we prosecute our our defensive strategies um our capital that we have to put against this in our human human resources we have to be very very deliberate in the strategies and the technologies we deploy across our system to protect our critical assets so um i think you know winning is taking ownership of your your piece of uh of this battle and doing it very very well and uh and holding up the other end of uh and the spectrums and maybe the secretary referred to this you know electricity is a very important sector to become so or a number of other critical infrastructures and everybody has to own their piece and do their job with the support we can gain from the federal government and i think i have um howard schwitz back by saying that this is not a cyber war i think we have to be really careful about using the terminology war um with regard to cyberspace cyber conflict whatever we may characterize that i think john did a great job of characterizing it as criminal activity and fraud and those kinds of things that we know how to react to we have tools for response for mitigation for collaboration and right now i think you know we don't have that for something called cyber war part of the effort of administration and its release of its international cyberspace policy last year was the development of norms for behavior in cyberspace and i think that's the first step to even thinking about what might be a doctrine of war or a military type doctrine for cyberspace so i guess um you know when what global action and what um compels us as a country to uh possibly respond so i think it's a it's a it's dangerous in that sense and if we think of it only about more than we miss the marcus johnson i'll use the moderator's priority and say there are elements of what has been uh put forth that comprise how do you win um but there's also a couple other pieces which is you have there's the urgency component it has to be this recognition of a vital threat to national economic security what people don't appreciate on the advanced persistent threat uh spectrum is that it is a unprecedented period of state-sponsored espionage against our nation and our allies but it's not just state sponsored espionage by potential adversaries the department of defense has said there are over 100 foreign intelligence agencies seeking to penetrate the dod network on a regular basis so i wasn't that good at math but i'm probably going to use one hand to count all potential adversaries in the united states what that means is we have a family and friends problem as well and so we need to understand that as we're coming up with an approach to deal with the second part of it is what is our objective our objective is not to stop attack you can't stop attack is always going to happen all you can do is two things one you can create resiliency inside your networks so that the objective of the attacker is defeated the networks continue to operate they continue to provide services and capabilities to owners operators and citizens and they are resilient in the face of this advanced persistent and targeted threat and then then the third thing is it is about the people yet again if you do not have properly trained people who are always going to be vulnerable so the totality of all these pieces together can cut the constitutes a strategy for how to win but like the old phrase it's not the destination that's the journey this is a non-stop and never-ending journey that we're on right now

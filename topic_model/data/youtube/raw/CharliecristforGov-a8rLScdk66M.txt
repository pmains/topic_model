we're famous for our sunshine here but for many work starts before it comes up and continues long after it goes down that's who I fought for every day as your governor we save the jobs of 20,000 teachers we cut property taxes for seniors in our middle class and if you send me back I'll raise the minimum wage demand equal pay for women and restore funding for our schools I'll fight for you from sunrise to sunset I always have and I always will

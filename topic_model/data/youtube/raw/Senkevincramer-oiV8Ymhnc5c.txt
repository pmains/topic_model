kevin kramer north dakota center first of all mr kramer how are you feeling sir i feel pretty good larry thank you my my hand is healing well i'm i'm short a half inch or so on one finger but i think i'll be fine thank you all right i feel blessed no no we're all praying for you honestly we're everybody who's praying for you so you are well aware i know of the west virginia versus epa and it was a big victory presumably um i don't know for the people but in your assessment and when you talk to folks what are they saying because you couldn't you know this could be the beginning of the end of the war against fossil fuels i know that we don't have the white house and you they still have regulatory but regulatory overreach is kind of out of fashion now i would think what do you think larry i think that's exactly right i think uh west virginia versus epa which north dakota was a party to um while it isn't precedent setting it in sort of a broad way it certainly gives a clear signal from this court that the overreach of the federal government will not be tolerated that in fact there are limits on the rules and regulations that environmental and other agencies can can you know push on force on industry and uh unless of course it's something that the the people's representatives in congress have passed into law and that what we have seen are these these agencies doing extra legal extra statutory extra even constitutional rules and getting by with it until now so uh this is a major victory i think west virginia versus epa is just the beginning frankly larry of of uh the pushback against the uh the state really tell me more about that um yeah center because i i i'm gonna i'm gonna presume you're thinking about how the lower courts will uh work to implement the supreme court decision is is that basically where you're going well that's right larry but let's let's first go to the source of the problem that is the agencies the agencies if they're paying any attention should recognize that they do not have this extra statutory extra constitutional authority and so hopefully the rules that come out from them that they promulgate and the regulations that come from the white house will be more in line with this thinking with what you know what is foundational frankly to our constitution that that is federalism states rights individual rights um but then if they don't the district courts and certainly the the appellate courts will you know have to look at west virginia versus epa this ruling and say maybe not so much you know federal agencies a debt we don't defer to you we defer to the constitution we defer to states we defer to what congress did and when congress doesn't speak to something that doesn't imply that their absence of saying something means you could do whatever whatever you want so that to me this is why donald trump was president for four years this is why mitch mcconnell was majority leader is so that we could restore the state's rights to um you know to the federal government and this and the federal state and frankly larry what i think ultimately that the best outcome would be is if we just had a lot less need for federal government because now states can take that control of what states are supposed to have control of would you be sure and tell your friend joe manchin just what you just said that we need a lot we have a lot less need for the federal government yeah isn't that the truth isn't that i think i think in his heart joe knows that's the truth yeah i know i think he's breaking my heart but we'll see i don't want to go down too far down that road one thing though um so with respect to this decision and the likelihood that it curbs regulatory power yet senator kramer uh within a week or two of the supremes decision here you got the epa putting out this ozone restriction and we'd shut down the permian could shut down the back end it could shut down the marcellus right i mean he just goes ahead and does that based on thin air there's no congressional law no and that's i think a great point not only that but then you have um pete butterjudge over at the department of transportation doing his thing um with greenhouse gas emission standards for for state dots which is a direct assault on states rights and which by the way in the infrastructure bill we specifically excluded the ability of the federal government to do these things so maybe i was expecting too much to think the agencies were going to behave better but i do think they have to look at at the courts and the entire value chain all the way up to the supreme court of the united states and know that these are not these are not going the direction that the supreme court says they should all right my guess is sir the bidens are going to try to fight this but they're going to lose you know and nothing will happen i agree i agree right and if and if nothing happened you know you know say that your attorney general in north dakota or in texas or someplace brings a lawsuit that'll at least stop the bad stuff is that fair enough one really isn't that what the court's for and that's what litigation should be litigation is the the attempt really it's the firewall if you will to stop bad things from happening um and con it's congress's job not to make bad things happen and where bad things have happened to correct the course if they can but what is so i think important and what's so impressive about this supreme court is again they stick to the constitution they stick to statute they they want they expect agencies to stick to what has been passed in law what authorities have been given by the elected representatives not to add these extra statutory extra constitutional authorities and by the way this is i've had the opportunity now larry to vote on two supreme court nominees one amy coney barrett of course most recently judge brown and and i've interviewed both of them this was the my main really my only line of questioning for each of them was what's your position on federalism what's the role of federalism going forward not just historically they both answered the question differently and it's reflected in their in their votes of course on these rulings well you're terrific senator kramer i'm glad you're feeling well and um if you buy mansion dinner i'll i'll finance it okay i'll finance it probably break a million fcc laws but whatever just uh you know tell them kudlow says hello i will tell him i'll pass the message on he's getting a lot of attention yes i know senator kevin kramer the best the best thank you sir

Democrats have long been railing against millionaires and billionaires and how bad they are but one hears crickets from the left when Democrats rely on a billionaire donor like Tom Styer who's launched a multimillion-dollar campaign to impeach the president roll tape he's brought us to the brink of nuclear war obstructed justice at the FBI and in direct violation of the Constitution he's taken money from foreign governments and threatened to shut down news organizations that report the truth if that isn't the case for impeaching and removing a dangerous president and what is our government become let's bring in Republican Mississippi senator Roger wicker good to see you senator good to be with you what do you think of this impeach the president campaign well you know I turned into this morning to the morning news and there it was Tom Steyer with his commercial I would make two observations I think mr. Starr probably has more money than he knows what to do with but the second more serious observation is that he probably speaks for the majority the vast majority of Democrats in the House of Representatives but currently today if the Democrats somehow persuade the American people to give them the gavel again in November of 2018 I wouldn't be surprised at all to see a successful impeachment resolution moving through the house I don't think it would get anywhere in the Senate but it would bog down the Trump agenda for two full years and totally dominate the Washington decision-making scene so I take it seriously I don't think it has a ghost of a chance of actually removing the president but it's something not to be sniffed at it's something that that I take seriously and and and we need to combat and we need to alert the American people that this is a real threat yeah the impeachable offense the one that's in that list of what Tom Steyer said would be obstruction that's the FBI probe that's firing Jim Comey that remains to be seen we're going to stay on that story we we want to move on to this plus a fight that happened within hours of Republican lunch with President Trump now the president and Senator Robert corker reigniting and nasty feud they've been going at it for months now here's senator corker just before the president met with the Senate GOP roll tape the President of the United States a liar the president has great difficulty with the truth on many issues do you regret supporting him in the election uh let's just put it this way I would not do that again you wouldn't support him no I think that he's proven himself unable to rise to the occasion it was a stunning chain of events a Senator flake also announcing he would not run for another term Trump Trump voters are saying they're cheering this they're saying the swamp is draining itself now senator wicker I think this you were at you were at the meeting today at the White House for lunch what did you see were they able to bury the hatchet well I saw absolutely none of that at the lunch today it was a very fun constructive discussion by the president about the accomplishments his administration has had over the first nine months and and the the achievements that he's had working with Congress and then we had a nice exchange with with some question-and-answer now clearly senator corker didn't ask a question and senator flake didn't ask a question but it seemed clear to me that that 99% of the people in the room were on the same page and we want to move the president's agenda forward it and the thing to do right now is to concentrate real hard to get this tax cut so it looks like the boats think we have the votes to do yeah it looks like the votes are coming in but you're saying you know final 10 seconds they didn't speak to each other senators corker and flake did not speak to the president the president didn't speak to them right there was there was no conversation among those three no senator wicker thank you so much for coming on we really appreciate it sir glad to know

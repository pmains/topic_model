the gentleman from Nevada Mr Horsford is recognized for five minutes thank you I want to thank the chairman and the ranking member for holding this necessary hearing today and I want to thank our expert Witnesses for appearing before the committee I'm glad that you're here to elaborate on the various ways that the Chinese Communist party is challenging the United States interest on a global scale whether it be through unfair Trade Practices and ignoring of international sanctions undermining of the Swift banking system expansion of influence through the belt and Road initiative or simply military aggression we are seeing a multi-faceted campaign from Beijing to catapult China to the Forefront of global markets and the world stage we have a responsibility to our children and to the Next Generation to own the 21st century as the United States no longer do we have the luxury of waiting for tomorrow as we are locked in a competition for America's Global standing today so the work that we do here and have done over the last two years will be key to positioning our country for the economic fight to come I'm proud to say that house Democrats have delivered and laid the groundwork for American Success Through Strategic investment in our people our production and our infrastructure the chips and science act ensures that the technology of the future will be made right here in America by union members with good quality jobs and as the high-tech manufacturing sector evolves our production capabilities will grow right along with it however other Investments were necessary to rebuild our crumbling roads and bridges through the bipartisan infrastructure law which will allow American businesses to bring their goods to the market faster and at a lower rate meanwhile the inflation reduction act delivered support to the nearly 60 000 manufactured employees back in my home state of Nevada while ensuring that the United States Will Lead the Way Forward on clean energy now these are just some of the examples and I know my colleagues on the other side will propose additional ones and I hope to work with many of you on those efforts but I believe that we should be focused on also supporting and investing in American companies and the American Workforce for decades Investments manufacturing and our supply chains had to be offshore to China by multinational corporate corporations that saw opportunities for ever greater returns I am particularly worried by the large investments from the Thrift Savings Plan and other retirement accounts into companies controlled by the Chinese Communist Party nebadans don't need to have their retirement accounts investing their hard-earned money into companies and funds that are actively competing against us while I applaud President Biden for his recent executive order barring investments in certain military or surveillance companies it remains that U.S investors hold over 1.2 trillion dollars in equity and debt issued by Chinese entities these Investments should be made here at home to the benefit of American companies communities and workers to make matters worse while the company's American firms have invested in may appear privately held oftentimes they are still working at the behest of the Chinese Communist Party Mr Harrell given all that we know about the difficulty to disentangle Chinese state-owned Enterprise from private firms do you think it is appropriate for the administration in Congress to consider further restrictions on American Investment in Chinese firms are we essentially shifting money away from our domestic sectors to the benefit of our competitors so I do think it is appropriate for Congress and for the Biden Administration to look at ways to expand limits on certain U.S investments in China I'd recommend in particular that the administration and Congress work to build out the list of Chinese military and surveillance companies where um investment is currently prohibited to potentially include other kinds of companies where we see specific National Security risks from the ACT investment in those companies and I also joined several of my colleagues here in endorsing a narrowly targeted review mechanism for certain outbound private investments in China I do think it's important to look at both these issues thank you very much Madam Mr chairman Madam ranking member I will yield back gentleman yields back

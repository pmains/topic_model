I want to thank the distinguished chairman Mr Neal for yielding time and for leading this important legislation and also thank him for the opportunity to serve on this important committee also want to thank the ranking member for always showing respect in our deliberations and all the best to you and your future deliberations Madam speaker I rise today in support of H.R 9640 the presidential tax filings and audit transfer transparency Act of 2022. as the chair has said since 1977 the IRS adopted a policy of conducting mandatory audits on the president while they are in office as a check on their power disturbingly our committee found that the IRS had all but given up and ceased this program under the previous administration as our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have chipped away at the funding for the IRS their talent pool has shrunk and that has been unable to retain the kind of tax and financial experts that are actually needed to review the complex tax returns of some of the wealthiest meanwhile those on the lower income Spectrum especially those with children who claim the Earned Income Tax Credit are more likely to be audited in fact with reports from our committee five times more likely to be audited those individuals on the low income Spectrum than the most wealthy so the evidence is clear Congress must step in now is why this legislation must be passed I urge my colleagues to vote I on this measure and to put confidence of the American people in this tax system once again I yield back

I was representative barbara Lee a Democrat from California EJ Dionne an MSNBC contributor washington post columnist and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution Julie pace chief White House correspondent for The Associated Press and Michelle Bernard president of the bernhard center for women politics and public policy lovely to have you all here nice to be back in DC Julie do you think I got this right do you think that drafting strategy is what's going on with a couple of those candidates yeah I think you I think you nailed it perfectly for Rubio and Kasich it actually is a great strategy right now they're looking at this large field they have a solid base of support at this point they have enough money to compete for months if this race goes on for quite a long time and they don't really have an incentive to go after Trump directly if they know that Bush and Walker and others are going to do that they need someone to do it it just doesn't need to be them right now so it's interesting to me this idea that that that Bush is playing this role of going after you even here mr. Trump there in that moment say Oh better energy tonight good job jab right I'm wondering is should-should Jeb be drafting a little bit or is it right for him does he need to have to attack trump I don't think he has a choice especially i want to say hope every NASCAR fan in america now becomes a fan of the militia although it's funny conservative friend of mine Henry Olson a great political analyst partly because he's not from North Carolina also talked about drafting it's up that i was at on friday he was talking about horse race oh yeah and he agrees with you and I think this is a classic thing in campaigns you saw it for example like in a governor's race in California where there were two frontrunners and this was when gray davis was running they just went at each other the voters get sick of the attack and they say who else is up there so i think there's a classic political thing here but those guys don't have a lot to gain by going after Trump the other guy was doing a peculiar form of drafting is Ted Cruz right where his idea is someday Trump will collapse or might collapse I'm going to pick up and supporters so he doesn't say across about Trump it says nice things about him saying you know guys Trump supporters I'm here if something happening man even then the drafting is so commonly it also gives me the part of why we love NASCAR North Carolina is the inherent danger that always exists right this sense it that you're watching something that could go badly and it also it just strikes me that part of whatever strategy seems to be going on the GOP primary there is a stoking of fear a stoking of this sense of danger and especially around around for example the Iranian deal around the idea that somehow the president is not keeping us safe as a nation and I'm wondering if you can respond to that you know preying on fear which is the terrible emotion to me is just fundamentally wrong the American people won't be fooled by that I don't believe I think that people will know at some point that that the Republicans are really just trying to play to their emotions rather than talking about the real issues like the issue around affordability of college education access to affordable housing access to the ballot box I mean the real issues that these candidates should actually be addressing they're not addressing them and so the plan on the fears of people many of these candidates the Republican candidates are doing it's not going to work people are going to wake up and see the fear mongering should not be part of the political discourse when you're going to support a candidate or determine who you're going to support on this fear mongering there was also a little bit of a revisionist history moment that happened Michelle I want to play Jeb Bush talking about sort of his brothers track record as president your brother and your brother's administration gave us Barack Obama because it was such a disaster those last three months that Abraham Lincoln couldn't have been elected you know what as it relates to my brother there's one thing I know for sure he kept us safe I don't know if you remember so that was meant to be like his comeback and instead we were like sir I'm not sure if you remember that 911 actually did happen yes and Katrina happened on your brother's watch yeah I don't think that's what he was thinking I think this was Jeb Bush actually drafting you know he's going to sort of hang out there and allow Donald Trump to implode which eventually i think is going to happen from what we've seen from Jeb Bush so far I think that's the best we've seen him if we if we if we don't if we don't want to say ignore but if we don't want to take away in any sense that 911 happened I think his point was that after 911 on his brothers watch the United States was not attacked at home again and it gave him an opportunity to look like a leader to be strong to be emphatic to be as Donald Trump would say high energy that moment and the moment when he protected his wife were his greatest moments in the second debate and he needed to do that anthrax did happen after which the he is talking to Republicans only two worlds in America the ocean Post story this morning where you know it's as if you have completely different groups of people talking about completely different things that line went over really well with Republican at and for now what he desperately needs disagree circlet like it's actually a little more simple he has struggled with this question of what to do with his brother throughout this campaign what his supporters and his campaign really likes about that moment is that it was decisive it was clear he seemed confident in his answer he handled the brother question and that's a style even more up winning oh man did not fair we come back we've got more on this debate and the way that it's making all of us heal and up next the candidate who may have had the best comeback

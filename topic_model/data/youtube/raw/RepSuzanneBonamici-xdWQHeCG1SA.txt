Thank You mr. chairman Thank You secretary Burwell your work covers so many areas that affect the daily lives of Oregonians Americans I appreciate that I want to thank my colleague and friend representatives Stefanik for bringing up the older Americans Act I want to ask you about the home and community-based supportive services program that fund services like legal assistance elder abuse prevention transportation Emil sites medical appointments a referral assistance for seniors and their caregivers now I'm supporting the additional 10 million dollars in the President's request as well as as many of my colleagues why is it important to increase funding for the older Americans Act programs especially the home and community-based supportive services given the rapidly rising population of older Americans and i do want to save time for another I'll just quickly say then I think there are two elements it's about what it means for the individuals in terms of these programs we know are making a difference in terms of supporting people to be able to have care at home if that's what's appropriate for them and so it's about the individual but it's also about the economics as well in terms of the success of these programs contributes economically keeping seniors in there at home less expensive thank you that Oregon Health Science University has been working in collaboration with intel on genome mapping that's especially useful in cancer research the goal is to make personalized genomic analysis faster or less costly more routine what are some of the challenges at research institutions face regarding the collection and sharing the information and what opportunities might the cancer moonshot provide to overcome some of these obstacles and advanced precision medicine some of the limitations or the fact that the areas of science don't work together and you actually need an engineer to help deliver through the system a biologist figures out what it needs but an engineer actually delivers the delivery mechanism and we have not broken down those silos as we think about the science I think it can help with that the other thing I think I'd help with this data and information because one of the things and this is part of what precision medicine is about is making sure that data and information can be widely accessed in safe secure ways that's both about privacy and cyber security but that information can be used widely and broadly to discover and understand more quickly it also and then we'll save costs because how one accesses information / trials will become easier and less costly which is a very important cost element to do I look forward to working for a drug collation those important issues and and finally I think my colleagues who brought up the the issues with opioid overdose and abuse and all the resulting deaths we've had an explosion in in my state as well as in the country I applaud your three-pronged evidence-based approach and can you talk a little bit about the the prong of improving prescribing practices particularly important an extremely important part and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention will be issuing new prescribe or guidelines in terms of the issue of how we can talk about these issues and think about these issues because one of the problems many physicians say I don't know I wasn't trained in this way so we want to get those out and make sure people are using those because when you think that over 250 million prescriptions a year for opioids we know we don't need that many as a country so prescribing as an issue so we're going to target that as an issue get out new guidelines and then we need to probably work with the Congress to make sure those guidelines are used thank you and I know my state just received about 2.7 million dollars to expand substance abuse services particularly focused on treating opioid abuse I know that's not enough we still have more work to do I had a fourth question but the Chairman asked already about preschool development grants and look forward to watching how that seamless hope the transition is seamless as the HHS continues to manage those grams so I yield back Thank You mr. lady yields back

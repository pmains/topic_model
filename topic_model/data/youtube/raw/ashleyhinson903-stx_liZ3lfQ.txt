welcome back Republican lawmakers including our next guests are calling out the administration's woke policies on the military warning about the life and death consequences not only for the heroes who serve in the U.S military but the Americans they protect Iowa Congress congresswoman Ashley Henson joins us now to explain good morning congresswoman I saw this op-ed yourself Tom Cotton uh put out explain to me why this is life or death yeah well it's pretty simple this is about Safety and Security in our communities both here in Iowa and across the country and wokeness has no place in our U.S military period so it's unfortunate that we've seen under the Biden Administration with him as our commander-in-chief we've seen some in the Department of Defense prioritize pronouns over preparedness and so that's the senator and I's Point here is saying we need to get back to the basics here of what our U.S military needs to be doing it's about preparedness it's about making sure that we can step up and defend our country in a time when our adversaries who do not have our best interests at heart are continuing to advance and and focus on their military so that's what the senator and I are calling for with our military here in the U.S yeah there's really kind of two issues that play here right one of them has to do with how effective our military is as it exists the other one has to do with our ability to get people to join to serve in it to begin with we've got a graphic here just talking about how bad our recruiting is the Army is 15 000 soldiers short the National Guard 75 100 service members short the Navy Met 10 percent of its coal and the Marine Corps met 30 percent of its goal listen when I joined in 2010 there was no way the Marine Corps was going to miss out on its goal just by its nature and then this week we have this headline where the Marine Corps doesn't want sir or man do you think these are directly related oh absolutely you know our military is a proud institution and thank you for your service as well I'd be remiss if I didn't say that and to everyone who served our country who's watching this morning I think it goes without saying though we need to be focused on these priorities we're hearing about our Air Force Cadets being taught to not say the word terrorist and to be gender inclusive I think the last thing we should be worried about right now is offending someone who does not have our best interests at heart and is actually working to do us harm so again let's replace every one of these woke gender ideology classes with a class on Battle preparedness and Military Readiness that's what we should be focused on I think it was a great victory that we were able to eliminate the covid-19 vaccine we had a lot of people who are not signing up for the military right now because they know they don't want to get that vaccine we had people leave the military because of that so again let's focus on these priorities it's preparedness over these pronouns it's preparedness over all these other priorities that this Administration continues to push which weakens our military and hence our ability to keep them American Safe yeah I joined I think joining the Marine Corps back in 2005 I'm older than I think I am I guess and uh but I joined because there was a war in Afghanistan I felt like I needed to be a part of to defend my country you know the body Administration just ended that war very unceremoniously do you think Americans Young Americans still connect military service with defending this country and with patriotism absolutely I do and I think that's what this is a this is about this is at the heart of the people who are standing up to serve our country and keep our country safe it's about patriotism not about all of these other priorities so again let's get back to the basics let's make sure that our military is prepared to take on China Russia all these countries that continue to expand their militaries and invest in their militaries guarantee you when they're hearing that we're doing gender ideology classes in our military they're doing backflips and celebrating that because they they perceive that as weakness so again let's end the military wokeness I've actually launched a website and militarywokness.com join our fight in this let's push back against the administration's policies here let's focus on keeping our military strong so we can keep Americans safe yeah you know the Marine Corps sold me on three words honor courage and commitment uh thank you for speaking up on this congresswoman thanks for joining us

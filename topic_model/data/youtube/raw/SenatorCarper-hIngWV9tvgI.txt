THE PRESIDING OFFICER: THE SENATOR FROM DELAWARE. MR. CARPER: MR. PRESIDENT, I'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF SERVING WITH SENATOR BARRASSO FOR ANY NUMBER OF YEARS. WE WERE THE COLEADS ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE AND ACTUALLY FOUND COMMON GROUND ON A WHOLE LOT OF ISSUES AND DISAGREED ON A NUMBER OF THEM AS WELL. BUT ON A PERSONAL LEVEL, WE HAVE, I THINK, A VERY GOOD FRIENDSHIP AND HAVE HAD IT FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS, GOOD COLLABORATION ON ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC WORKS. I DISAGREED WITH ALMOST EVERYTHING HE SAID, ALMOST EVERYTHING HE SAID. AND I'M NOT A DISAGREEABLE PERSON, BUT I ALWAYS LOOK FOR COMMON GROUND, AND I'M SORRY TO SAY I DIDN'T HEAR A WHOLE LOT FROM HIM TODAY TO DO THAT. THE SUGGESTION THAT SOMEHOW WE SHOULDN'T BE CONCERNED ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE, THE CLIMATE CRISIS HAS VISITED OUR PLANET, A COUPLE OF POINTS I WOULD SHARE WITH ALL OF US. THE UNITED KINGDOM -- THIS WAS IN THE NEWS YESTERDAY, THE DAY BEFORE, MONDAY OR TUESDAY OF THIS WEEK. THE UNITED KINGDOM BROKE ITS RECORD FOR THE HIGHEST RECORDED TEMPERATURE MULTIPLE TIMES ON MONDAY, REACHING 104.4 DEGREES FARENHEIT. IN GREAT BRITAIN, FOR THE MOST PART THEY DON'T HAVE AIR CONDITIONING. RECORD TEMPERATURES -- 104.4 DEGREES JUST ON MONDAY ALONE. THEIR AIRPORT RUNWAYS IN GREAT BRITAIN ARE MELTING. THAT'S RIGHT, MELTING BECAUSE IT'S SO HOT. THE RAILWAYS IN THE UNITED STATES ARE BUCKLING FROM THE HEAT WITH RIDERS WARNED TO STAY HOME, TO STAY HOME. OVER 1,100 PEOPLE DIED IN SPAIN AND PORTUGAL JUST IN THE LAST WEEK FROM HEAT-RELATED ISSUES, CAUSES. WILDFIRES IN FRANCE HAVE FORCED 30,000 PEOPLE -- THAT'S ABOUT AS MANY PEOPLE AS WE HAVE IN DOVER, DELAWARE, OUR STATE CAPITAL -- 30,000 PEOPLE TO EVACUATE. ORGANIZERS PLAN TO POUR TENS OF THOUSANDS OF LITERS OF WATER ON TO THE TOUR DE FRANCE ROUTE, A HUGE BICYCLE COMPETITION, TO PREVENT THE ROAD FROM MELTING IN THE HEAT. MORE THAN 40 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES ARE UNDER EXTREME HEAT WARNINGS ACROSS THE GREAT PLAINS IN CALIFORNIA. AROUND 60 MILLION AMERICANS WILL LIKELY SEE TEMPERATURES AT OR ABOVE 100 DEGREES NOT THIS YEAR, NOT THIS MONTH. THIS WEEK. NEARLY 60% OF CALIFORNIA IS DEALING WITH EXCESSIVE DROUGHT WHILE 20% OF TEXAS IS 5% WORSE THAN LAST WEEK, EXPERIENCES EXCEPTIONAL DROUGHT, THE MOST EXTREME LEVEL ON THE DROUGHT SCALE. AND FIREFIGHTERS THIS WEEK ARE CURRENTLY BATTLING 89 -- THAT'S RIGHT -- 89 LARGE FIRES IN 12 STATES IN THE UNITED STATES. THAT'S JUST OFF THE NEWS PAGES OF TWO DAYS AGO. MR. PRESIDENT, AMID CALLS TO LOWER THE PRICE OF GASOLINE, I RISE TO SPEAK ON THE NEWS THIS WEEK REGARDING CLIMATE CHANGE. THERE IS NO DOUBT WE'RE LIVING IN UNPRECEDENTED TIMES AS A NATION AND AS A PLANET, AFTER AN UNPRECEDENTED PANDEMIC GROUND OUR GLOBAL ECONOMY TO A HALT, AMERICANS HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING TO RETURN TO NORMAL. AS WE SAW IN THE NEWS EARLIER THIS YEAR, UNPRECEDENTED SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES FROM THE PANDEMIC ALONG WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN'S UNPROVOKED INVASION OF THE UKRAINE HAVE CAUSED GAS PRICES TO RISE UNTIL THIS MONTH, UNTIL THIS MONTH. WE KNOW THIS IN TURN HAS FUELED INFLATION AND PUT ECONOMIC STRAIN ON FAMILIES AND SMALL BUSINESSES ACROSS OUR COUNTRY. PRESIDENT BIDEN HAS RESPONDED TO THIS CHALLENGE WITH UNPRECEDENTED ACTION, RALLYING OUR GLOBAL PARTNERS AND RELEASING RECORD AMOUNTS OF OIL FROM OUR STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE. THE RESULT HAS GARNERED LESS ATTENTION FROM THE MEDIA. OVER THE PAST 34 DAYS, GASOLINE PRICES HAVE DECLINED BY MORE THAN A HALF DOLLAR PER GALLON. I'LL SAY THAT AGAIN. OVER THE PAST 34 DAYS GASOLINE PRICES HAVE DECLINED BY MORE THAN 50 CENTS PER GALLON, THE FAST OF THE DECLINE IN OVER A DECADE. MORE THAN 20,000 GAS STATIONS ACROSS OUR COUNTRY ARE NOW OFFERING GAS FOR UNDER $4 PER GALLON, LEADING ECONOMISTS EXPECTING THE DECLINE IN GAS PRICES TO CONTINUE, MAYBE ACCELERATE. OUR NATION IS ON TRACK FOR HISTORIC PREPANDEMIC LEVELS OF PRODUCTION BY 2023. IN ADDITION OUR NATION IS ON TRACK TO SURPASS OUR HISTORIC PREPANDEMIC LEVELS OF OIL PRODUCTION BY 2023 -- NEXT YEAR. STILL THESE ARE SHORT-TERM SOLUTIONS THAT LEAVE AMERICANS SUSCEPTIBLE TO HIGHER GAS PRICES. WHY? IT IS THE GLOBAL MARKET THAT LARGELY DETERMINES GASOLINE PRICES. THAT MEANS AS LONG AS OUR ECONOMY RUNS MOSTLY ON FOSSIL FUELS, ENERGY PRICES WILL CONTINUE TO BE VULNERABLE TO THE FORCES OUTSIDE OUR NATION. WE CANNOT DRILL OUR WAY OUT OF THIS PROBLEM. AND IN THE LONG RUN, THE BEST WAY TO ENSURE THAT AMERICAN FAMILIES HAVE ACCESS TO LOWER PRICES AT THE PUMP IS BY REDUCING OUR DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL AND ON FOSSIL FUELS. I WANT TO SAY THAT AGAIN. IN THE LONG RUN, THE BEST WAY WE CAN ENSURE THAT AMERICAN FAMILIES HAVE ACCESS TO LOWER PRICES AT THE PUMP IS BY REDUCING OUR DEPENDENCE ON FOSSIL FUELS. DOING SO JUST ISN'T CRITICAL FOR PROTECTING AMERICANS FROM HIGH ENERGY COSTS. IT'S NECESSARY FOR ADDRESSING THE EXISTENTIAL THREAT OF CLIMATE CHANGE. MAKE NO MISTAKE, THE CLIMATE CRISIS IS HERE. IT'S HERE, IT'S IN EUROPE, IT'S IN ASIA, IT'S IN SOUTH AMERICA, IT'S IN AFRICA. IT IS ALL OVER THE WORLD. WE SEE IT IN THE FORM OF UNPRECEDENTED HEAT WAVES AFFECTING AND IMPACTING MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ACROSS EUROPE AS I SUGGESTED, AND OUR COUNTRY TOO. WE SEE CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE FORM OF UNPRECEDENTED DROUGHT DRIVING WILDFIRES ACROSS THE WESTERN U.S. THAT ARE BIGGER THAN MY STATE. CURRENTLY FIREFIGHTERS ARE BATTLING 89 LARGE FIRES IN 12 STATES, AND IT'S ONLY EXPECTED TO GET WORSE. ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION, THE DECADE-LONG MEGADROUGHT IN THE AMERICAN WEST IS NOT JUST EXISTING, IT'S INTENSIFYING AND EXPANDING EAST, WORSENING THE THREAT OF ADDITIONAL WILDFIRES. AND WE SEE CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE FORM OF RISING SEA LEVELS THAT PRODUCE WAVES ABLE TO WIPE OUT WEDDINGS IN HAWAII JUST LAST WEEKEND. THIS EVENT IS A REAL-LIFE CONSEQUENCE OF WHAT EXPERTS HAVE ALREADY TOLD US. SEA LEVELS ARE RISING FASTER THAN THEY HAVE IN MORE THAN 3,000 YEARS AND ARE EXPECTED TO RISE BY AN ADDITIONAL FOOT BY 2050. WE KNOW THIS FIRSTHAND IN DELAWARE. DELAWARE IS THE FIRST STATE. DELAWARE IS A STATE, THE LOWEST-LYING STATE IN AMERICA IS DELAWARE. OUR STATE IS SINKING. THE SEAS AROUND US ARE RISING. DOWN IN LOUISIANA, A BIG STATE, IN ANOTHER PART OF THE COUNTRY, IN LOUISIANA THEY ARE EXPECTED SEA LEVEL RISE AS WELL. IN THE STATE OF LOUISIANA, YOU KNOW WHAT? EVERY 100 MINUTES, EVERY 100 MINUTES THEY LOSE A PIECE OF LAND TO THE SEA THE SIZE OF A FOOTBALL FIELD IN LOUISIANA. I'LL SAY THAT AGAIN. EVERY 100 MINUTES IN LOUISIANA, THEY LOSE A PIECE OF LAND THE SIZE OF A FOOTBALL FIELD. EVERY 100 MINUTES. AND WE SEE CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE FORM OF SEA LEVEL RISES IN, ALL UP AND DOWN THE EAST COAST, DOWN TO FLORIDA, THE GULF COAST, EAST COAST, WEST COAST, EVERYWHERE. THE EXTREME WEATHER IS COSTING US. ACCORDING TO AN ANALYSIS OF DATA FROM NOAA, AND THE GLOBAL REINSURANCE PROGRAM, SEVERE WEATHER COST MORE THAN $12 BILLION, BILLION WITH A B, PROPERTY DAMAGE IN THE UNITED STATES. $THAT IS AN AVERAGE -- THAT IS AN AVERAGE OF ABOUT $1 THE -- $199 PER HOUSEHOLD. WE CONTINUE TO SEE THE DESTRUCTION THAT ACCOMPANIES CLIMATE CHANGE HAPPEN ON A GLOBAL SCALE AS WELL, THREATENING THE CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE WE RELY ON FOR INTERNATIONAL TRADE. THIS WEEK THEY MENTIONED THE RECORD-BREAKING TEMPERATURES I'VE JUST SEEN IN ENGLAND AND EUROPE AND GERMANY AND OTHER PLACES. MOST TRAGIC OF ALL, THESE CLIMATE-INDUCED EVENTS ARE PUTTING PEOPLE'S LIVES AT RISK. EXTREME HEAT IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF WEATHER-RELATED DEATHS IN OUR COUNTRY. ACCORDING TO NOAA, THE 12 MOST COSTLY WEATHER RELATED EVENTS ALONE RESULTED IN THE DEATHS OF NEARLY 700 PEOPLE. ADDRESSING THIS CRISIS IS THE CHALLENGE OF OUR TIME. IT IS DIRECTLY TIED TO THE PRICES WE PAY AT THE PUMP AND NEARLY EVERY FACET OF OUR LIVES. INSTEAD OF L DOUBLING DOWN ON POLICIES THAT CONTINUE TO FAIL, AMERICAN CONSUMERS AND THE PLANET, AS SOME OF OUR COLLEAGUES HAVE BEEN ADVOCATING FOR TODAY, WE SHOULD FOCUS OUR ATTENTION ON PASSING LEGISLATION THAT ACCELERATES OUR TRANSITION TO A CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE AND LEAVES NO COMMUNITY BEHIND IN THE PROCESS. IT IS OUR TICKET TO A BRIGHTER FUTURE AND ONE WITHOUT RECORD-BREAKING HEAT WAVES, HIGH GAS PRICES, AND UNPRECEDENTED DEVASTATION. LET ME CLOSE WITH APOLOGIES TO STEVEN SILLS. STEVEN SILLS, GREAT SONGWRITER, SINGER, BUFFALO SPRINGFIELD, ICONIC GROUP. LONG AGO HE WROTE A SONG WHICH HAS THESE WORDS. IT STARTS SOMETHING LIKE THIS -- THERE'S SOMETHING HAPPENING HERE. JUST WHAT IT IS AIN'T EXACTLY CLEAR. THAT'S HIS WORDS, THE OPENING LINE FROM HIS, THE GREAT, ONE OF THE GREAT SONGS OF ALL TIME. WITH APOLOGIES TO STEVEN STILLS, THERE IS SOMETHING HAPPENING HERE, AND IT IS EXACTLY CLEAR WHAT IS CAUSING IT. IT'S A CLIMATE CRISIS. WE HAVE WAY TOO MUCH CARBON IN THE AIR. WE'RE PRODUCING MORE, AND THAT'S THE BAD NEWS. HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS -- WE CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. WE CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. AND PART OF IT IS -- I'LL JUST CLOSE WITH THIS -- 30% OF OUR CARBON EMISSIONS IN THIS NATION COME FROM OUR CARS, TRUCKS AND VANS. 30%. MORE AND MORE WE'RE SEEING AUTO MAKERS BUILD CARS, TRUCKS AND VANS NOT TO RUN ON GAS AND DIESEL BUT ON ELECTRIC. WE'RE BEGINNING TO INSTALL THOUSANDS OF CHARGING STATIONS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY TO HELP PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO CHARGE THEIR BATTERIES AND ALSO TO BUY HYDROGEN, WHEN WE SWITCH TO HYDROGEN FOR FUEL CELL VEHICLES. THOSE EXPANSIONS AND THOSE INVESTMENTS WILL PUT LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS, PROBABLY MORE THAN THAT, TO WORK ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN EVERY CORNER OF THE COUNTRY TO ENABLE US TO REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS FROM OUR MOBILE FLEETS. WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO, INSTEAD OF JUST BURNING COAL AND TO SOME EXTENT NATURAL GAS, WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO THE CREATE ENERGY, CLEAN ENERGY FROM ADVANCED NUCLEAR. I'M A NAVY GUY, 27 YEARS IN THE NAVY. WHEN WE STARTED WE DIDN'T DO NUCLEAR ENERGY IN THE NAVY FOR 50 YEARS. YOU HAVE KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE DIED IN THE NAVY FROM EXPOSURE TO RADIO ACTIVE MATERIALS? ZERO. 50, 50 YEARS, PERFECT RECORD. AND WE'RE NOW, AT THE BEGINNING OF NEW DEVELOPMENT AND NEW EXPLORATION AND IN PURSUIT OF NUCLEAR ENERGY USING SMALL MODULAR NUCLEAR REACTORS. A LOT SAFER THAN THE ONES WE'VEDING F. WE'RE IN A POSITION NOW TO HAVE, LITERALLY FROM MAINE DOWN TO MARYLAND, OFFSHORE WIND THAT CREATES ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF CARBON-FREE ELECTRICITY THAT WE CAN USE TO CHARGE OUR CARS, TRUCKS, AND VANS. ACTUALLY PUT A LOT OF PEOPLE TO WORK BUILDING THOSE WINDMILLS AND DOING GOOD THINGS FOR OUR PLANET. THE CLIMATE CRISIS IS HERE. THE QUESTION IS WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT IT. AND THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO MEET IT HEAD ON. IT'S NOT LIKE YOU GOT TO EAT YOUR BROCCOLI. NO, NO, NO. THIS IS SOMETHING WE CAN DO AND WE COULD ACTUALLY NOT JUST DO GOOD THINGS FOR OUR PLANET, BUT HELP US AVERT GREATER DISASTER IN THE DAYS GOING FORWARD. WE CAN ACTUALLY CREATE A LOT OF ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY, A LOT OF JOBS, AND WE CAN DO THAT. WE CAN DO BOTH. WE NEED TO DO THAT. WE NEED TO DO THAT. WITH THAT, MR. PRESIDENT, I YIELD THE FLOOR TO MY FRIEND FROM TEXAS. I THINK I'LL SIT HERE AND HEAR WHAT HE HAS TO SAY.

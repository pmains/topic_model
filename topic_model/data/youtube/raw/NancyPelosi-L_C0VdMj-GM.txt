the gentleman is recognized well if the Raven whatever the 49ers fans can come together hopefully so can the Democrats and the Republicans on an issue of this grave concern to our country our budget which should be a statement of our national values instead as mr. Van Hollen said we see the Republicans playing games with the budget playing games that's what they have been doing and that's what they continue to do as we go into this spring where we need to find solutions playing games a give new meaning to the term March Madness because that's what will result if we have to face a sequester it's a very bad idea a sequester should be out of the question and we should be talking about how we find a solution instead of a sequester mr. Van Hollen offered a solution here we have the debate on the budget the blueprint for how we go forward and the Rules Committee dominated by the Republican majority has said we won't even let your proposal come to the floor not in the form of an amendment or a substitute in any other way and water I'm what are they afraid of they are afraid of common sense because that is what mr. Van Hollen's mr. Van Hollen's proposal is about it recognizes that we need to have spending cuts in fact we've already agreed to 1.5 1.6 trillion dollars in spending cuts and the Budget Control Act it recognizes that we must address the entitlement issue in fact Democrats have already agreed to more than one trillion dollars in Medicare savings to strengthen Medicare and to protect beneficiaries so with that as a basis we go forward with thee with the Van Hollen proposal which is a very common sense solution it says it is a plan there's a plan to replace sequester it cuts further it makes further spending cuts in a responsible way it ends tax breaks for big oil and it ensures that millionaires pay their fair share who could be opposed to that so let's get serious it's time for us to get serious we have a serious challenge we should be working in a bipartisan way to find a solution instead again the Republicans are playing games leading up to what make March Madness a term that would be inadequate to the consequences to our children millions of whom will be affected in terms of their education and their well-being to our seniors to our veterans to our safety in the streets in terms of cops on the beat the list of cuts across the board and a meat axe approach was no sense common sense given to it is ridiculous it's ridiculous and let's stop this march to falling this March Madness let's get serious that's except the president's challenges he put forth if we can't have a big bold and balanced solution now let's at least do something that is balanced and and bold as we go forward to to the end of the fiscal year as mr. Van Hollen has proposed so that we can do what is right for the American people instead what is wrong for our economy but the Republicans are proposing is a blueprint for a downward spiral in our economy it's irresponsible it does not have value in terms of being solution oriented and I might add in madam Speaker that I'm listening attentively to this debate and I hear my colleagues on the Republican side talking about how important it is to reduce the deficit and we are in total agreement on that subject I think we have a moral obligation to reduce the deficit I think we have a moral obligation to create jobs if a to work because growth in addition to cut spending cuts and revenue increases growth is what's going to help us reduce the deficit but I didn't hear one boo out of any of the people not one little hoot one little peep or any other sound an endangered species of a deficit hawk would have made during the present President Bush's term when this most of this deficit was amassed tax cuts for the wealthiest people which did not create jobs but increase the deficit give away to the pharmaceutical companies with an ill-advised pharmaceutical plant and two unpaid-for Wars two unpaid-for Wars just not fair to investments that we should be making in America's future whether it's biomedical research to create cures and to keep America preeminent in terms of science whether again it's invested in the seed corn and the education of our children the list goes on and on the list goes on and on of all of the initiatives that are important to growth to making our future brighter to keeping America competitive to keeping America number one so I urge a strong rejection of what the Republicans are proposing is frankly silly and as I said before unworthy of the challenge that our country faces and the bipartisan solutions that we should be trying to achieve I urge of a no yield back the balance the gentlelady yields back

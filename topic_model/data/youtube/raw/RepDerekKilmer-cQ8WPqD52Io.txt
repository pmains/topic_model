Thank You mr. chairman I rise in opposition to the amendment while I respect the sponsors intent on reducing spending sugar in our carrier fleet is not the way to do it our fleet of aircraft carriers is the envy of the world because of the power and capability that they bring to bear a fleet of 11 carriers allows the United States to be a powerful force for stability around the globe it keeps sea lanes open and protect our merchant fleet against hostile governments and piracy they allow our troops to respond quickly to natural disasters and humanitarian crises all over the world reducing the number of aircraft carriers would have bad consequences it reduce our ability to protect ourselves and our interests abroad it would have a dramatic impact on the morale of men and women who serve on them as longer deployments place an unfair burden on these sailors and it would result in longer and more expensive maintenance to be conducted reducing the time the vessels are able to react when needed for these reasons and others I must urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment and I yield back the balance of my time

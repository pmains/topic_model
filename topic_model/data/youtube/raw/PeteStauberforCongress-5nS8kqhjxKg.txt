not only are you feeding our district and our state you feed the nation farmers feed our nation in the world and that secure food supply chain that you're providing to us and we can't thank you enough well good morning everyone congressman pete stauber here i am uh just east of the city of hinckley at the roger nelson family farm i'm here with roger and his son john and you know what we talked about how diverse our 8th congressional district is and farming is an extremely important part of it and roger why don't you tell us a little bit about your farm and then i've got some questions afterwards sure well um this is a second generation farm hopefully a third generation uh we're looking at and uh right now it you know it's a farm that's in transition um you know originally with my dad it was milk cows and moved into beef cattle and now we've transitioned to more crops and a feedlot beef cattle feedlot and i'm looking to transition to jonathan here someday in the future so well let me ask you about that so uh you're the second generation what is it what does it mean to you that your son jonathan is going to take this over this it's going to be that next generation what does it mean to you well um this is really where i was born on this farm here and grew up i wasn't here all my life came back to the farm to uh when my dad retired but uh so i've grown up here as this is my life and you know you're really tied to the land as a family you know and so um hopefully that it'll carry on to jonathan you know but there's no guarantees yeah you know so jonathan you graduated you talked about you graduated from the university of minnesota you're about to take over this farm being that third generation of the nelson family that that pride in farming what are you what are you looking forward to what does it mean to you um i guess carrying on the family tradition is a big part of it my you know my grandpa he started and you know put a lot of work into it and then my dad too you know they spent their whole lives improving the land and trying to build building a better future for me and so just carrying that on and um you know hopefully when i have kids that they'll you know the fourth generation exactly yeah you know i we we know that the the farmers are the best stewards of our land and and uh we appreciate what you do when i talked to you earlier not only are you feeding our district and our state you feed the nation farmers feed our nation in the world and that secure food supply chain that you're providing to us and we can't thank you enough let's talk about like right now we're going through covid19 tell us how it has affected the farm well uh certainly from our aspect with raising cattle and having beef cattle that are ready to market the whole covet impact has you know you know people read about in the news i see in the grocery store that that there's there's no beef on the shelves or the price is really high and it really is because of a bottleneck in the in the processing there's plenty of beef out in the countryside but we can't get it to the consumer because of this big bottleneck and it's really as as as high as the prices have gone in the store it's gone that low for um us producers and we just you know you see about how people have to just give away their hogs and and we're not quite in that position as with the cattle but we certainly have sustained some pretty major losses with our so it's it's it's forced us to sort of reinvent how we market our our cattle and and we're that's that's another whole thing of this transition we're now doing direct marketing um to to consumers you're doing what you need to do to survive yes absolutely and i think that it's really been tough on you and i just stuff from our standpoint as members of congress we understand the importance of farming i mean you look at the minnesota congressional district and and uh farming is extremely important uh it's been an important part of it it will continue to be a important part not only the district but the state just any final thoughts on that you can give us if i had if you could give me one sentence jonathan tell me uh as you transition tell me that your your heartfelt comments about taking over the farm soon tell me what it means to you yeah so i guess something i really enjoyed is learning how to do a better job farming whether it's making the cattle producing better cattle or just improving the soil health and so that's that's something i have a passion for you are the best stewards of our land you just said you know so well i think that the the legislation that we want to put forward uh comes from good ideas and suggestions from those farmers across the great state of minnesota and this entire nation i guess so with that being said i just want to i want to thank you both for for being part of our farming community our food security and the hard work that you do and as i said earlier you not only feed our area state of minnesota in this country we feed the world and it's just a pleasure to be here on the roger nelson family farm jonathan i look forward to you taking over becoming a successful farmer because we need successful farming and and so with that i want to thank you both for being here and allowing us to come on this beautiful farm this morning well thanks we're really glad to have you out and to show you you know what's happening in our small corner of the world that's great thanks you

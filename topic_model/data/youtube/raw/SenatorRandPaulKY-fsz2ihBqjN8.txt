Kentucky Senator Rand Paul who is also a doctor is back in action volunteering at his local hospital now that he has fully recovered from coronavirus he joins us right now for his first interview since recovery we're also joined by Fox News medical contributor dr. mark Siegel good morning to both of you dr. dr. Senator Paul let's start with you this is a new look for you I don't think I've ever seen you with a beard before well you know they banished me to the basement they did agree to feed me but nobody would send a razor down so I guess this is what I got from my my quarantine my quarantine beard yeah dr. Siegel is going to have a question for you in a minute but first let me ask you how did it feel to have coronavirus and what did it feel like to the point where you thought to yourself you know what I think I'm over well you know in my case I had an extraordinarily mild case I had no symptoms never had a headache never had a body ache never had a fever never had a call if I didn't really have any symptoms in fact I would have never gone to the hospital had I not or not to the hospital would not even gone to the doctor's office had I not known this was about and that I had been traveling so much so it's a bizarre sort of situation that some people get very very sick you know even die from this and some people get no symptoms they've tested people in Iceland where they've tested you know a large body of the population of Iceland and they found that about 50% of the people were positive have no symptoms and so there's something about this illness that's not just the illness but your immune response to it and it may be some sort of genetic thing that some people are genetically predisposed to a overwhelming immune response that ends up making the patient very sick with their lungs filling up with fluid and then other people like myself get virtually no symptoms all right dr. Siegel Senator Paul I want to ask you something a lot of our viewers don't know about you and I know you're too humble to say this yourself but you go around to underserved areas and you perform eye surgery or an eye surgeon ophthalmologic surgeon that saves vision for a lot of people and it's it's something you do that you don't highlight enough so how does it feel to now volunteer in a covert nineteen ward taking care of patients with kovat 19 after having had it yourself does that put you in a better position to address it to communicate it to know what they're feeling like you know I spent about 20 years in medicine mostly doing eye surgery but I was also an ER physician as well as someone who spent a year doing general surgery so I've been in and out of medicine my whole life I miss it it's great to be back working with local doctors some of whom I knew when I was in private practice here but someone whom are new and younger and I've gotten to know some of the hospitalists when I was in practice that weren't many hospitalist these are doctors who practice primarily in the hospital and that's who I've been working with in the hospital because I now have immunity I can't catch it presumably I have the ability to go into rooms more often I have the ability to talk to some of the patients and maybe spend a little more time that anything I can do to prevent a trip of either a doctor or a nurse into the room is helpful to them it's also I try to be encouraging to the patients just from a moral standpoint some of the patients I've been with the biggest thing that bothers them is they can't see any family their family's not allowed to visit them the hospital that's hard on people young world sure senator let me ask is revealed that that mark let me ask him one quick question after it was revealed that you were tested positively some of your fellow senators said wait a minute we just saw him at the gym what's your message to the senators who thought that you should not have been there I think the facts are important I was told by the Louisville health authorities that I didn't need to quarantine I followed explicitly the doctors advised to a team I was asked not to quarantine or test they didn't follow that to a tee I went ahead and got tested but I was not asked to quarantine in fact I went to a charity event with a thousand people there and they told everyone there unless you had contact with the one woman who's positive you didn't need to be quarantined so I think some of these people overreacted and I think that's true of the country people are scared and frightened and when people are frightened they don't always think about the facts they just get mad mm-hmm sure all right mark a quick question senator there's been a lot of government overreach in all of this I'm sure you agree how about physicians taking the lead on what to prescribe like hydroxychloroquine other treatments how about the issue of public gatherings where there was the governor saying they're going to let as you famously said you know the governor is saying they're gonna track people who went to church yesterday how do you feel about the government involvement versus the role of the physician in all of this you know I think like the governor in Michigan it's her ignorant and her hatred of Donald Trump that caused her to say really ridiculous things doctors for really since the beginning of modern medicine have prescribed drugs that are called off-label it's they're very expensive to get a drug to be applied to a certain purpose so it's already approved for one purpose like the anti-malarial drug a hydroxychloroquine it's also used for lupus and a variety of other things probably half of these other diseases don't have a specific indication because it costs so much money in time to get the FDA to do it so it's not unusual to use something like an anti-malarial drug for rheumatoid arthritis or lupus but it's also not that unusual to find a new use for it like we've found with the virus I can tell you that locally when we've had patients that are sick they are getting the hydroxychloroquine and there's at least anecdotal evidence that seems to be working and helping them and that is a conversation a lot of patients are having with their doctors dr. Siegel thank you very much for joining us live from your studio Dexter and a doctor Senator Rand Paul thank you very much for joining us from wherever you are out there in Kentucky haha thank you all right good luck to you glad you're on the mend

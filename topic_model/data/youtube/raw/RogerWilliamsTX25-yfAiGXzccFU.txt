mr. speaker that someone that we have on our committee is a business person who has a history of of creating jobs in my native state of Texas I'm very happy now at this point to yield to my fellow Texan mr. Williams as much time as he may consume to give us his thoughts on dodd-frank as well Thank You mr. chairman I want to thank you for your leadership and before I begin I would just like to say I am a small business owner I've owned my own business for 44 years I've been through a lot I've been through dollar gasoline I've been through twenty percent interest where I borrowed money I've been through the slowdown in 88 I've been through 911 and I must tell you the economy that we're in now Main Street America is hurting like I've never seen it hurt before and that's why I'm up here to talk about this this situation that we seem to honor tonight dodd-frank i joined the Chairman and my other colleagues here tonight to speak on what I believe is one of the most impulsive deceiving and unamerican pieces of legislation that has ever been passed through this body what I'm talking about is a 2003 each law that is unfairly blanketed our entire financial system with more than 400 costly rules and regulations just as we have found out that the Affordable Care Act is not affordable we are learning that dodd-frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act doesn't do what its name suggests i believe we probably need a government protection act the dodd-frank is hammering small-town America as we've talked about and I mean like I've never seen before in 44 years small-town America Main Street America is hurting with and they're hurting with unnecessary but very expensive compliance measures that are hard to meet as a small business owners I said of over for the year 40 years I can say firsthand the dodd-frank is driving Main Street job creators and community banks and credit unions out of business yesterday in our op ED Congress Randy Neugebauer and I wrote that the American people were fooled into believing dodd-frank was necessary to ensure financial stability and prevent future market meltdowns but instead of responsibly studying the root causes of the financial crisis Democrats in Washington rushed to regulate in my home state of Texas one of the healthiest economies in the nation 115 banks have closed their doors these banks are far from the major financial institutions in New York they are small town community lenders that cannot pull together resources to comply with dodd-frank there are community banks and credit unions that issue 51 percent of all business loans under 1 million dollars the crippling effects of dodd-frank have trickled down from the president's pen to local job creators who had nothing to do with the financial crisis the costs have been passed along to them it isn't right and it's not fair dodd-frank is another example of how this administration discourages growth under President Obama and his administration the risk of running a business is no longer worth the possible reward and that's a big problem this is America that pawsley like dodd-frank are the product of lawmakers who have little to no business experience they haven't worked on payrolls they have met a payroll they haven't counted inventory they haven't met with employees that need personal help they haven't put people to work but they have done something it's issue 153 new regulations a hundred and seventy or eighty seven compliance changes and fifty-nine annual adjustments to thresholds at what price we ask the Congressional Budget Office and Government Accountability Office have both estimated that dodd-frank cost three billion dollars to implement and will result in nearly twenty seven billion dollars in private sector fees assessments and premiums we simply can't afford this for this reason I have introduced legislation that will loosen dodd-frank's chokehold on small businesses and Main Street America the community financial institution exemption Act will require the financial the customer Financial Protection Bureau to explain to Main Street lenders why they are not exempted from certain CFPB rules and regulations as permitted my bill has the support of the independent Bankers Association of Texas and the Texas credit union Association the National Association of federal credit unions and the credit union national association I ask all my colleagues to support my efforts it's time we stop punishing those who put their livelihoods on the line to realize the American dream and not the American scheme I yield back the remainder of my time and God We Trust I think my friend and the gentleman from Texas my fellow Texan for his comments and the perspective that he brings as somebody who's actually successfully created job

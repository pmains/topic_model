we to recognize the ranking member of the subcommittee mr. Guthrie for five minutes for his opening statement Thank You chair to get for holding this important and timely hearing and this is an area of bipartisan interest measles is an extremely contagious virus it can cause significant respiratory symptoms fever and rash in some cases the consequences can be severe one in 20 children with measles develops pneumonia one in a thousand children develop brain swelling that can cause brain damage one or two and a thousand children who contract measles will die fortunately measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000 because the nation had gone more than 12 months without any contagious disease transmission public health experts believe this progress was achieved because of a very safe combination of measles mumps rubella or MMR vaccine very high vaccination rates in a strong public health system to detect and respond to outbreaks however elimination does not mean the disease was completely eradicated the disease remains in many parts of the world there are about 20 million cases worldwide each year measles returns to the US when the infected travelers bring the disease back to parts of the country when some parents have chosen not to vaccinate their children because measles is so contagious it is estimated 93 to 95 percent of people in a locality need to be vaccinated achieve population immunity this level of population immunity provided by very high vaccination rates prevents outbreaks and sustained transmission of measles according to CDC tracking while national vaccination rates remain high estimated MMR vaccination rates among 13 to seven-year-old teenagers can vary widely ranging from seventy-seven point eight percent to ninety seven point nine percent across states and local counties in United States we currently have multiple measles outbreaks in the United States as of February 21st 2019 the CDC reported that there are a hundred and fifty-nine confirmed cases of measles this year in ten states my home state of Kentucky was recently added to the list unfortunately this current Raik is continuing a recent trend an average of 63 Meisel cases were reported to CDC from 2000 to 2007 however from 2011 to 2017 the annual average of reported cases increased to 217 the CDC told the committee staff than in the last five years there have been 26 measles outbreaks involving five or more people seventy-five percent of those cases spread in the local close-knit communities with groups of unvaccinated people these outbreaks are tragic since they are completely avoidable every state except three have enacted religious exemptions for parents who wish not to vaccinate their children there are 17 states allow a personal philosophical exemption which means that most people can opt out for any reason for example in Washington state just 0.3 percent of Washington's families with kindergarteners use a religious exemption while 3.7 percent of families use a personal exemption and 0.8 percent use a medical exemption vaccine exemptions have increased in the past three years to a median 2.2 percent of kindergartners among all states with recent link to pockets of under excitation some state legislators are looking to tighten or eliminate certain types of exemptions that allow parents to not have their children immune eyes after the Disneyland linked outbreak to measles in 2014 the state of California ended a religious and personal exemption for vaccines the Washington legislature is working on legislation that substantially narrows the exemptions for vaccinations that would eliminate the personal or philosophical exemption while tightening the religious exemption in recent weeks state legislators in New Jersey New York Iowa Maine and Vermont have proposed eliminating religious exemptions for vaccines however last week the Arizona House Health and Human Services Committee approved three bills two exemptions for mandatory vaccinations given the concerns raised by the measles outbreak in various parts of the nation and recent state legislative activity it is appropriate to have this hearing to provide greater discussion and examination at a national level I'll welcome our two expert witnesses dr. messin a of the CDC in dr. Anthony Fauci Fauci Falchi of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases I look forward to your testimony and I yield back my time

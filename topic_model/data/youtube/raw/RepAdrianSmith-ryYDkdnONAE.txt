Thank You mr. chairman and thank you mr. Hagen for your presence here today I think we have a great opportunity to work in a bipartisan fashion on these issues that you are addressing and I hope we take advantage of that I certainly appreciate your efforts to modernize the system we know that we have some laws on the books that did not anticipate various technologies and I would hope that we can again work together to address this so that we can help the American people we know we heard a while back from ZocDoc who explained that there are obstacles that stand in the way of adequately helping the American people I know that representing a very rural constituency issues can be a little different than more urban areas and as services are rolled out and the fee structures and so forth that might be required under existing regulations and that may not be the best business model to reach folks in more rural areas and so we need flexibilities and when you when you look into the delays currently in place that stand in the way of patients receiving timely health care I would hope again that we can work together to to address this ultimately I think from certainly addressing regulations that are on the books and I'm glad that already you and the administration are are looking into that but if you could perhaps elaborate what is the administration's plan that to it to account for the technological advances in health care relating to stark law and in federal anti-kickback statute so first of all I want to say that I'm also from a rural community town of about 800 tip of southern Illinois called mounds and I grew up underfoot in a rural hospital where my mother worked so you can rest assured that we will have sensitivity towards the issues faced by rural health care providers at HHS we take it into account obviously there are a lot of challenges facing rural and remote health care providers that are unique to them so we are and again the stark and anti-kickback statutes also if I make it more difficult in many ways it creates a special problem for areas where there are a few providers that aren't actually connected with one another in other words when you only have one person that you can affiliate with in a community it becomes kind of a difficult issue to say I can't affiliate with this person because the law prevents me from doing so in other words you can be driven to either remain completely isolated from anyone in the community because there are relatively few providers or you're violating the law so we in other words a rural community it can be particularly afflicted by the stark and anti-kickback statute as is often implemented so that's a particular issue with regard to I believe you mentioned technological issues in many cases the stark and antikickback statutes create again a problem where people can't get access to technologies as quickly as they otherwise should be able to and that is particularly an issue within rural communities because they often lag urban communities and being able to get access to technology as quickly and being able to implement it for the health of the people in those in those areas so you have both lower quality of health you have fewer providers and you have more restrictions on them being able to coordinate with one another due to the do too in many cases older regulations interpreting these laws

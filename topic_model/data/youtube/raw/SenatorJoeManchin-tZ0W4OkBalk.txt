I come
from a very small town in West Virginia that has pretty narrow perspective on everything, really, because everybody
permits things the same way. I'm coming, coming here. As I said,
I have friends from all over the globe. I have, some of my best friends
is from Texas, Chicago, California. I've got one of my best friends
grew up in China. So it's all over the world. I've got people in my English class that grew up in Japan, Philippines. So it's just a really
humbling experience hearing some of their stories as well
and what they've been through to get here. It's really neat meeting people
from all over the world. I love it. I'd recommend it. Like if you can get out of West
Virginia for a while and meet other people and experience
different things because you don't realize
what you're missing out on sometimes.

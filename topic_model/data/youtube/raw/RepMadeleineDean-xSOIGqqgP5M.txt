teachment manager madeline dean of pennsylvania she's a member of the judiciary committee thank you so much for spending some time with us it's great to talk to you i wonder if you could take us through what happens next week when when the article makes its way to the senate what is your understanding at this hour of the timing for a trial well thank you for having me nicole we do know that it has been said that on monday we will take and present the article of impeachment to the senate in terms of the timing of the trial that is i know the subject of negotiation it's above my pay grade and it is also within the senate uh so what i'm focusing on is being fully prepared for the trial it could come as early as tuesday and i have to tell you our team of managers uh is fully prepared and speaker pelosi made that point she said whatever the timing is it's fair because the the managers have the same amount of time as donald trump's lawyers she also made the point that the evidence is out there for many to see can you just talk about the evidence that you'll be presenting well i can't preview for you the evidence but certainly your reporting reveals what much of the evidence will be we were all witness to this i i'm stunned by it still you think about it just two weeks ago the president incited a mob to riot and create an insurrection in an attempt at a coup in an attempt to overthrow a free and fair election for his own personal political gain and five people died and it wasn't just any day of the week he invited incited this mob on january the 6th he knew exactly what that date meant it was a date where the vice president and a joint session of congress would complete our constitutional duty certifying electors it is shocking to me to this moment yeah that we were hunted that gangs were chanting hang mike pence they looked to assassinate uh speaker pelosi so we we cannot turn a blind eye on this and we will be prepared with the evidence that the world has watched uh both of the president's behavior and the attempted insurrection i mean you and i talked a couple days after and i asked you if you felt safe and very candidly said you did not i mean donald trump made it so that you are not safe at your job by inciting um the insurrection against the capitol and i wonder what your understanding is of the current security situation at the capitol well i've had the chance to be there quite a bit over the course of this week was just there today and i have to tell you number one i am so moved uh by the dedication of the capitol police anyone i've been able to talk to and be in contact with they are committed they are dedicated they are heartbroken for what took place and of course the loss of two of their members i also today had the chance to visit with national guard members from pennsylvania from my home state my area frankly it was an honor to meet with them over in the capitol visitors center so today the capitol stands very very secure i do feel safe but look what it took it took an incited attempted coup by a president and then the presence of tens of thousands of national guard to support our capitol police and metropolitan police it's a sad state where we are but certainly the capitol is very secure now can you explain the reporting overnight that some national guardsmen ended up in a garage i can't i have read the reporting and that's why i uh took the chance today to go find some members of the pennsylvania national guards to just simply say i am sorry i have no idea why that level of disrespect and and just utter mistaken order took place so we'll have to find out i don't know who who made that order or why it would have happened but it was clearly a mistake and you saw capital police rectify that and and hang around until every one of them was brought back inside is it your expectation or belief that the security situation will remain fraught through a trial of donald j trump for impeachment i'm certain it will stay heightened uh i i i don't think it will be fraught i think there is a unity of purpose uh that this capital this temple of our democracy and all those who work there not just the electeds but the staff the janitorial staff the police uh everyone who works there must be kept safe and certainly it will be kept safe throughout the trial and i'm sure well beyond i am surprised that if you look at the reaction after 9 11 it was it was fleeting but it was a laying down of our partisan arms and the decisions again they're still divisive and polarizing in their policy debates but a lot of the decisions that were made and legislation that was passed was done so in a bipartisan way if you think about it now two weeks later it's almost more stunning that more than 100 house republicans voted to overturn the results of the election after the insurrection that led to the deaths of five people including two capital police officers and i think seven senate republicans voted so how do you what is the strategy for sort of breaking the partisan spell around the trial which seems to me to have nothing to do with politics but just a question for the united states senate do you care about the rule of law do you care about a lawless president who incites an insurrection i think it's a very good point and i do wonder you were talking a lot with your previous guests about timing whether sooner is better or delay is better i do think that in the delay whatever it happens to be uh members who voted uh to not to certify the election or not to impeach have had a chance or will continue to have a chance to reflect you know i was really moved by uh president biden the night before he was sworn in the memorial he did uh at the uh reflecting upon the lincoln and what he said there i thought laid a predicate for our own work he said there to heal we must remember it's hard sometimes to remember but that's how we heal it's important we do that as a nation as much as he was talking about healing through mourning and grieving over the dead the four hundred thousand dead including my own mother-in-law he was also speaking i believe that for us to heal as a nation from this attack we must remember and that would is what i believe the child will represent some of the very first steps toward this nation healing i think you're right about that congresswoman madeline dean you always make us think thank you for spending some time talking uh to us about all that we'll continue to turn to you as this proceeds thank you thank you for having me thank you

when my great-great grandfather came to America he worked the land 16 hours a day not my choice he was bound by chains but through the decades my family found opportunities success and security when we achieved the American dream from slavery to West Point in just five generations that's our story but it's also America's story we persevere we advance we do the impossible when I look at my baby daughter I think of the limitless opportunities that she and her generation can have but to secure America's future we need a new generation of leadership and Congress with an unwavering belief in American exceptionalism I know we can secure our way of life cutting taxes and growing our economy securing the border and strengthening our military when America stands together we can do anything I'm Leslie hunt and I approve this message

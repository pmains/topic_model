my next guest is a Democratic member of the House Judiciary Committee congressman Karen bass California chair of the Congressional Black Caucus who is also in attendance last night congresswoman how did you understand the line about war and the investigation with what what was he saying well I think that he was essentially threatening that if we were going to move forward and do our responsibilities as members of Congress that he was not going to cooperate with any legislation it was another juvenile response and a clearly an example of the fact that after two years in the job he still doesn't understand that we are a co-equal branch of government and that one of our primary responsibilities is oversight of his administration the problem chrissa's is that for the last two years he's had no oversight so he thinks we're harassing him when actually we're doing his we're doing our job um Matt Whittaker is set to testify before your committee this week I believe on Friday if I'm not mistaken what are you expecting there this is someone who is the most powerful law enforcement official in the United States of America runs the Department of Justice has not been confirmed in the Senate is the subject of multiple lawsuits and hasn't really said much in his tenure exactly and so one of the things we want to know is is he willing and is he committed to doing his job and so if he's committed to doing his job then he needs to recuse himself because remember he was on the air talking for months and months before he got the position with the DOJ that he did not believe that a president should be investigated a president could be indicted etc and also didn't believe that the Muller investigation made a lot of sense so the question is until we have a permanent attorney general will this attorney general follow the law are you confident that he has not are you confident a the president has not interfered with him there's reporting the president berated him after one of the Michael Kohn filings there and there's questions about whether he has exercised any undue influence down the line whether that's the Muller probe of the Southern District confident he hasn't I don't have an ounce of confidence I really don't I mean I don't know why we would expect that that he would one thing about the president is that if you attempt to do your job as a member of the cabinet he berates you publicly he talks about you he calls you names bring etc and he's been radio silent about this guy and so that's one of the reasons why we would like for him to come before the committee oh you think that's interesting you think the lack of Rage tweeting about Attorney General Whittaker as compared to Jeff Sessions is essentially a tell out in the public that Whittaker is doing his bidding isn't that his pattern I mean I think that has been his pattern with anybody that has criticized him you know again I mean 24 months in the job he still thinks that he's running a company he is supposed to be running a government which means that the people that work around him you know that the head of the Justice Department works for the United States yeah it's not his personal law firm and that's what he struggles with he struggles with the basic understanding of his job and everything that we've been told about him we know he doesn't read we know he believes that he has the best opinion we know he doesn't need facts and so given that he has really struggled to understand what his job is all right congresswoman Karen bast thank you so much for making a little time tonight

congresswoman can't come back republican from the great state of Florida joins me now Carlos one I've put it to you that these new rules give the far right a great deal of Power are you comfortable with that well as a member of the rights I would think that people want to have more say at the table I'm very comfortable with the rules package because it's the pretty much the exact same rules package that we had on January 1st with the small change of emotion to vacate down to a single member as of January 5th so there was only one change to the rules package despite all of the theatrics of last week that was the only thing that changed so I know there's been a lot of talk a lot of conjecture a lot of rhetoric but at the end of the day it was the same rules package that we as members of the Republican conference debated three times over and accepted three times how can you get anything done if all it takes is one GOP House member to stand up and say vacate the chair that did have to be a vote on it but it would hold things up a lot wouldn't it I mean that's um really almost tumultuous I don't see how I get things done well you know I think that by and large people want to come up here and get things done on behalf of their constituents write the ship for the American people and so if someone wants to stand up and and say you know listen I think you're doing a bad job and I'm gonna you know do a motion to vacate they've got to convince 217 additional members to go along with them and that's a really really tough task so I think that you're going to have a lot of family discussions going on but at the end of the day just like we did last night we fired 87 000 IRS agents this week we're going to take back the political piggy bank that the bite Administration has turned our strategic petroleum Reserve into we're going to do the work that the American people actually care about and put the campaign rhetoric to the side and do what's best for America look I'm all with you I mean I'd love to see you fire 87 000 IRS agents but that decision which you made yesterday that's going to be reversed in the Senate it's not going to go anywhere is it well and I think this is where we have to stand strong and play some Hardball with the Senate you know the Senate can't it goes both ways they can't just Ram a bunch of things down our throat just like we can't to them so there's going to have to be some give and take here and that's the beauty of the system that was envisioned by our founding fathers we're riding the ship and it took like I said some theatrics it took some uncomfortable conversations but I think you're going to see a brand new attitude up here in Congress especially coming out of the house really pushing back and playing Hardball with the Democratic Senate that's what it's going to take for us to right the ship because as it stands right now half of America feels silenced they feel like their their viewpoints aren't being heard and now we have the Republican majority in the house the people's house it's time to fight back again I've got to go back to the the idea of what are you comfortable with three of the nine seats on the rules committee go to the freedom caucus that freedom cork is a very small minority within the Republicans in the house are you comfortable with a small minority having that kind of power so when you think about the freedom caucus as a whole there's about 44 45 members of the freedom caucus over half of the freedom caucus was with Kevin McCarthy from the very beginning of last week's vote so this agreement this handshake that has taken place because keep in mind this is separate from the rules package it doesn't dictate who from the freedom caucus is going to be on the rules committee but what it does say is that there will be representation from the freedom caucus so it's really anyone's guess as to who that's going to be and that remains to be seen okay you're thoroughly United behind speaker McCarthy we are Congressman Captain republican from as I said the great state of Florida thank you very much for being with us this morning always good thank you sure have a good one

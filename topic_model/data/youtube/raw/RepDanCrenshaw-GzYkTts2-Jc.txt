[Music] some of these numbers are just startling when you take a look more than 100 000 migrant encounters in february alone that in itself is a 97 percent increase from the same time last year u.s border patrol is now allowing asylum seekers to cross from mexico into the united states to have their requests processed reversing former president trump's remain in mexico policy new reports show that the number of children detained at the u.s mexico border has tripled over the past two weeks this comes as the number of ice arrests fell 60 last month today i heard from biden's secretary of homeland security that the border is totally secure they're lying they're lying and they're lying at the expense of the american people with all due respect there is not a crisis at the border do you believe that right now there is a crisis at the border i think that the uh the answer is no the biden administration has begun the work of reversing literally hundreds of other rules regulations and fees put in place by trump we are not saying don't come we are saying don't come now so one of the places i visited was rio grande city the cbp station down there they're calling this a crisis they're calling this completely unprecedented uh they had six thousand apprehensions last month now that's the most they've ever had in recorded history what makes it worse is they're expecting that to actually double right now there are roughly 4 000 illegal border crossings every day and the numbers are even more concerning when it comes to unaccompanied minors so why is this happening that's what everybody wants to know the answer is actually really simple biden reversed trump era policies on day [Music] one this is a policy that simply said look if you're crossing over and you're claiming asylum remain in mexico and we'll adjudicate your claim there they're allowed to come across uh the river and then they're turned over to the border patrol and the border patrol takes them to a processing center and then they're released out into the community with this written promise to appear the likelihood of them showing up i think everybody agrees it's probably slim to none yeah and why would you yeah cbp reports about 78 000 people were apprehended at the southern border in january these migrants have permission to move on with notices to appear in court is this is this situation sustainable at all i only think it's gonna get worse the second thing was the asylum cooperation agreements with the northern triangle countries guatemala el salvador honduras now this makes a lot of sense because if you want to claim asylum again do it in your home country do it at a local embassy or consulate now only about 10 of asylum claims are adjudicated in favor of the asylum seeker this means that millions of people around the world that are truly persecuted that of a true claim to asylum they can't get here they don't have the geographic advantage they can't just walk across and our system is at full capacity we're in star county and we're at what's called the salinas crossing rio grande river's right here after 6 pm every single day what you're gonna see is a bunch of rafts coming back and forth and these migrants they walk up this path that i'm locking up right now and they turn themselves in most cases when we're patrolling an eight or a 10 hour day we'll see a lot of activity on the river well then during those time frames where there's not where you have that stronger policy and that deterrent we're not seeing near the activity 100 meters that way is the road and that's where border patrol is usually waiting on any given day there could be hundreds lately it's been hundreds and they've got to fill up their vans they've got to fill up all of their resources to get these migrants to the station meanwhile things drug cartels that are getting them across are now flanking the border patrol and getting their drugs across what seldom talked about in all of this is how the drug cartels make out the flow of drugs continues at a steady pace and most of it is coming from the southern border in california you don't get to cross the rio grande river without talking to the drug cartels now they charge everybody what's called a peso about 300 per person man woman and child you don't cross that river without it now this is extremely low risk for the drug cartels see they're used to smuggling drugs and they usually need somebody to actually smuggle that drug if they get arrested well they're going to jail but a person with a child well we all know what happens they just get let loose so the drug cartels just point them in the right direction hundreds of people at a time getting charged 300 per head they put them on a raft and they send them across sometimes in the same spot dozens of times a night they say just walk to border patrol see border patrol is actually part of the process for them so we are here on our ride along tonight um near mcgowan and uh here with the deputy chief of the sector here we're getting ready to pull up on a group of about 50 that we're having a process right now that will tie us up for probably at least an hour i don't want to wait all right uh tie you up meaning you can't go look at what else is going on yeah another thing you told me that you see a lot is that whoever is in charge of this group because it's not like this group just randomly got together right like there's there's somebody organizes this and they're usually associated with drug traffickers and what they'll do is is use this group as to distract all you guys obviously this takes a lot of resources we're all here right now which means there's a lot of uh unknown territory and and places we can't see so as um is border agents federal border agents are their time is taken up with migrants thousands just turning themselves in the actual security role is being taken up by texas correct the cartels have it seems like they have an endless supply of money and they have nothing but time and and they come up with some really innovative ways to smuggle their product into the country cbp instead of while patrolling the border uh they're now babysitters they're bus drivers they're nurses so what do drug cartels do well that's where they actually get to smuggle their drugs not just drugs but human smuggling we've even had some people on the terrorist watch list coming across our borders and it's easier than ever because cbp can't be doing what it's supposed to be doing patrolling the border a wall is an immorality it's not who we are as a nation no matter how you feel about about the wall i think it's a moral abomination i think it's like the berlin wall this is where walls and infrastructure come in look when you have a wall and you have lighting on it you have sensors and you have technology um yes it's true that you can't necessarily put the wall everywhere along the border and a lot on the left say we'll see that's what makes the entire thing useless renders the whole infrastructure useless that's not true from a tactical perspective it creates choke points see border patrol knows that if they have infrastructure here well they don't need as much personnel there and they can focus their personnel needs in places where maybe you can't build a wall we can redeploy our forces where we might not have some of this technology where it might be a little bit more difficult to patrol so security is a three-legged stool it's technology it's infrastructure it's personnel it won't make us safer it won't stop illegal drugs it won't stop illegal immigration there will not be another foot of wall constructed in my administration every move the democrats make is intended to create more illegal immigration and the third thing was biten just said he's going to stop deportations so so we're saying that if you come across we're going to let you go into the interior we're going to buy a bus ticket wherever you go we're saying that hey we don't really want to deport you and on top of that they're promoting legislation that would give everybody amnesty so of course people are going to come across the border illegally senior dhs officials telling abc news there is a significant surge of migrants crossing illegally into the u.s the sad part about all this is that it's totally preventable we could change the tide overnight all you have to do is re-implement the trump administration policies remain in mexico asylum cooperation agreements with the northern triangle countries they want to work with us actually enforce our laws deportation laws when people break the law put them through the court system get more immigration judges out there finish building some of these sections of walls they do work border patrol tells us that this isn't moral this isn't compassionate this isn't right to a lot of legal immigrants that are trying to make it through the system this is about protecting our sovereignty this is about protecting the rights of legal immigrants to go through our system instead of clogging it up with people who just walk across in caravans if we don't address this if we don't take the obvious measures to stop what's happening on our southern border in the next few years we're going to end up with millions of more undocumented migrants here in this country and what kind of country does that

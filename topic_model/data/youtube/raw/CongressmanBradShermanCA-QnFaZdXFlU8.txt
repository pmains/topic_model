there's my bad Sherman Deborah Democrat from California member of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the house good evening what did you hear from the president in the foreign policy area that might have interested you the most or maybe concerns you the most what concerns me is he talks like he's going to prevent North Korea from having a nuclear weapon but he's continuing the same policy we've had for 17 years and if anything they've made more progress in the last year than they made it any other time what he's not willing to do is cause Beijing to even wonder whether they might lose access to the US market and as long as Beijing feels that they have free access to the American market then China is not going to change its policy toward North Korea and North Korea is not going to change its policy toward developing missiles how about the president's comments or how about the whole debate over Russia at this point is what I should ask what's coming from the White House what's coming from the hill so much news out there so much friction what's your take on the whole Russia story well he's defied the law today a huge bipartisan majority several months ago passed a law that said that we have to sanction those companies that are doing business with the intelligence and agencies of Russia and today the State Department simply announced they didn't feel like it that's a whole new attitude toward law enforcement the president spent a good chunk of his speech toward the beginning talking about the economy the benefits of the tax bill as he sees them the rising stock market and on and on what do you see right now in the country economically happening we're in a six year wave 2017 was good not as good as any of the prior five years under Obama but 2017 was good we all hope for a good strong 2018 congressman brad sherman democrat from california thank you for joining us tonight

Thank You mr. chairman I appreciate this opportunity to have this discussion regarding our bill on mergers and acquisitions mr. chairman is more and more baby boomers retire it's been estimated that approximately 10 trillion with a t10 trillion dollars of privately owned small and mostly family-run businesses will either be closed or if possible sold to a new generation of entrepreneurs in the coming years mergers and acquisitions brokers M&A brokers play a critical role in facilitating the transfer of ownership of these smaller privately held companies however today's one-size-fits-all system of broker-dealer regulation unnecessarily burdens business sellers and buyers with the pass-through of heavy regulatory compliance costs that do not provide significant incremental benefits and privately negotiated M&A transactions today federal securities regulations require an M&A broker to be registered and regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and FINRA just like Wall Street investment bankers selling or buying publicly traded companies that's right anyone brokering the sale of a hometown business in your district must be federally registered and regulated as securities dealer broker in addition to state law requirements regardless of the size of the business or the sale transaction federal securities regulation was primarily designed to protect passive investor investors and public securities markets privately negotiated M&A transactions facilitated by these small business brokers are vastly different and are not typically related to the transactions meant to be protected through the SEC and FINRA registration and regulation that is why I've continued to introduce bipartisan legislation known as the small business mergers acquisitions sales and brokerage simplification Act this bipartisan bill would create a simplified system for brokers performing services in connection with the transfer of ownership of these smaller privately held companies the changes proposed in this bill HR 477 would specifically apply to M&A transactions involving the sale of privately owned businesses with annual earnings of less than 25 millions that that is earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization commonly known as Avada or annual gross revenue of less than 250 million now there's been some discussion about why particularly x' numbers while it fits for various industries for example if you are in the grocery industry you're going to have very high sales with a very low margin of profit you own a jewelry store you're gonna have the opposite you may have very low number of sales but high profit margin so that's why we had that we we actually mimic that those numbers HR 477 would only apply where the buyer will directly or indirectly control and actively manage the businesses after the transaction closes let me read that again this is going to apply only to people who are going to be indirectly involved with their businesses this is not passive investing this is active investing transactions where the buyer requires control and then actively manages the businesses are entirely different from capital-raising transactions involving passive investors the regulatory structure regarding these types of M&A transactions should reflect that additionally the investor protection provisions included in my legislation disqualify bad actors and quote public shell companies and and those companies would then be excluded from these from these mergers the implication I'm sorry the impact of this legislation would be meaningful by reducing transaction costs promoting competition among small business brokers and facilitating private business merger acquisitions and sales of small businesses this small business initiative promotes economic growth and development through business sales jobs creation and preservation and provides important immediate and substantial relief of regulatory burdens on small business professionals who serve small businesses smaller business owners business brokerage services are critically important to entrepreneurs that start build and eventually want to sell their private enterprises similarly these services have helped new entrepreneurs acquire businesses while helping existing companies grow thus preserving and creating jobs in the communities that we all serve in today's highly charged political environment it's nice to show the American People that positive affective initiatives can be considered and passed with strong bipartisan support in fact similar legislation has overwhelmingly passed both the Financial Services Committee and the Full House of Representatives during the last two congresses it's legislation like HR 477 that demonstrates Congress can act in a bipartisan manner to positively impact the lives of Americans I urge swift consideration and passage of this important bill with that I yield back

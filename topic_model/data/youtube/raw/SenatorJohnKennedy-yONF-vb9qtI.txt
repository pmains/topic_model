joining us now for reaction senator john kerry john kennedy excuse me of louisiana thank you sir for joining me clearly today was um uh it was an assault on 75 million americans i think it was meant to be and that last swing at donald trump what's your take away from all of this tammy i don't uh i don't hate anybody and i try to look for grace wherever i can find it but as to speaker pelosi's january 6 commission um i guess it comes down to would you buy a used car from speaker pelosi i mean that's what this is all about isn't it speaker pelosi says that her commission is a non-partisan search for the truth i don't believe that just about everybody i've met in washington dc is partisan um speaker pelosi is the most partisan of them all if partisanship were an olympic sport she'd take home the gold she has said repeatedly what she thinks she stacked the deck of this commission i think she put eight democrats or seven democrats and and congresswoman cheney on the commission and i think six or five republicans and she rejected some of mr mccarthy's choices uh i think that what speaker pelosi plans to do is give the republican party not just president trump but the republican party a fair and impartial firing squad i think that she i think she is planning to as she has in the past to um try to equate the atrocities and they were atrocities of january 6 with the entire a population of people who who didn't vote for president biden senator kennedy i'm a republican yeah i think you're absolutely right and everyone on the democrat side uh is missing that irony that they're complaining about an assault on democracy and here they are using taxpayer dollars campaigning propaganda to demonize and smear half of the american population when already there's violence in this country when this is they figure maybe they can get more votes from this i want you to listen to a if you could sir uh some sound from a cbs news conversation a contributor um uh about uh his uh reaction to the olympics and comparing his trouble with it to january 6. let's listen my favorite part of the olympics was always going to stay in for the opening ceremony and then i just realized you know man particularly after these last four years i had a wrong nationalism is not good we've seen the rise of white nationalism nationalism is not good and also this whole idea i keep thinking back on the uh capital riots and i saw a lot of you know u.s flags right so now when i see the flag and the flag raises man where what what what america am i living in doesn't that sound sir this is creating an environment and a mentality that i think what the democrats want which is uh one that rejects america one that looks at your neighbor suspiciously that your neighbors are the problem that people who don't think like you were the problem it worries me does does it worry you well of course america is not perfect but america is good more than that america is the freest country in all of human history america is the wealthiest country in all of human history america is the most powerful country in all of human history and the greatest country in all of human history we are not perfect but we are good and many of my democratic friends not all of them but many of them seem to hate it they think that america was wicked when it was founded and it's more even more wicked in their judgment today they think that the uh america is racist misogynistic and that everybody who doesn't think the way that they think is is uh is ignorant and that is really it seems sir to be the message that seems to be the message of anyone who uh recognizes this charade for what it is and shame on uh representative cheney and kinzinger for participating just shameful on both of them sir thank you very much for joining me tonight i appreciate it

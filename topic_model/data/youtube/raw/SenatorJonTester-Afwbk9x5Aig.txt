thank you madam chair and I want to thank all of you for being here today I appreciate it we talked a little bit about this mr. Simmons when when you were in my office yesterday I guess it was but but I want to kind of get all four of your opinions on it you know and what it's about is concentration in the AG industry and I know you guys don't deal with all of it I think justice deals with the with the commodities portion but you do deal with fertilizer and chemicals the way I understand it and just for your reference so you know 80% of the beef in this country is basically the markets controlled by four companies six percent pork 50 percent chicken that's not what I would call a very capitalistic in my book and makes me want to dig Teddy Roosevelt up and bring him back to life but nonetheless I want to know from each one of you who think it's a problem number one and if you do think it's a problem what can be done about it if anything is the toothpaste out of the tube and we're just hosed or is this something we can actually do something about so I'm gonna start with you I'm John Joe Joseph all right Joe you've only Joe John's a good nephew but Joe's good yeah John's a really good name yeah so just go ahead and shoot if you think it's a problem so yes tell me what we can do about it well so one of the things we talked about that earlier on in the in the hearing today is doing a merger retrospective program to see if we have been to lacks in our enforcement and so one of the areas we might focus on Republic would focus on would be would be the AG area so in terms so good news now if you find out your two lacks does does this in Jenna Kym China situation does it have some impacts on that yes sure like any any mergers that would come would come would come ahead would you know in the future would be would be subject to or not subject to but would be in for our analysis of being formed by the merger retrospect okay but but mergers has happened in the past that's done deal generally that's generally the case okay the other thing too is that not only could the current situation be a result of a consolidation it could also be the result of any competitive unilateral practices and we could look at those two and that if though if there were such cases instances of that then what we would hopefully be able to do is to get an injunction prohibit those anti-competitive practices and maybe that would make the market more competitive going forward briefly do you guys see it the same way yes I do senator okay yes I would just add that the ability for people to sustain a livelihood in agriculture making sure that barriers to entry that are not illegals it's critically well I would just tell you that and we talked about this a little bit Joe that my school forty kids my graduating class was isn't very big been a long time ago now forty years ago now the whole damn school has got 40 kids in it and we've seen that kind of depopulation across rural America now I want to ask you about another issue and by the way I hope you're able to do that because because I think when it comes to competition in the marketplace whether it's selling it or whether it's the inputs you're putting on the crop it is critically important it's just it'll do away with family farm agriculture and I'll tell you what if family farm agriculture goes away this country changes and not for the better that's just my two bits I was sitting in a homeland security meeting the other day it wasn't classified and my phone rang and I thought gosh it's a 202 number I'd better take it and it was a there was a telemarketer okay and and I guess I shouldn't have taken it but it could have been something important and it wasn't it was a nuisance and and I think we have far too many of these and we have failed in this regard so how can we this garbage from going on I got to tell you I mean I don't ask them to call me they call me if I want to buy a hotel room I'll call them okay so how do we stop this yes in our I think the the original do-not-call rule was was good at the initiation but it's been over two can buy technological developments and it doesn't work anymore as you as we all experience and so I think the answer is it's probably a technological solution and I know that the FTC and the FCC are having conversations and working to explore that type of solution okay anybody else have any comments on that about some great ideas so I want to get calls from somebody that well you call me and not just call a number there are software solutions that are effective to a certain degree I haven't tried them myself and I'm 61 yeah well you have children yeah I got kids I got grandkids crabby handling yeah there you go yeah anybody else want to comment on the do-not-call stuff senator all comment I'd associated myself with what mr. Simon said there's no question that this needs to be a priority for good right behind the AG competition right behind there yeah it's a priority but I I'm worried about the resources and tools to solve it and I think if we need more we need to come to you and and ask for it amen brother I mean you guys got a job to do if you don't have the dough to do it we can't hold you accountable so please do thank you all very much thank you madam chair

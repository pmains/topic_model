we are back with the fox news alert the taliban making significant territorial gains in the country of afghanistan seizing control of three more provincial capitals the escalation comes as the united states nears complete withdrawal of combat troops in the region here now to discuss is u.s congressional candidate and army veteran wesley hunt wesley good morning to you good morning happy to be here you know as we look at what is going on with afghanistan it's tough to watch because so many americans have gone over there and risked their lives to try to have a different outcome than what we're getting right now yeah that's absolutely correct and general patton famously said no good decision was ever made in a swivel chair and the idea of us telegraphing to the taliban exactly when we were going to leave and how we were going to do it was made in the chair just like that in my opinion the thing is not necessarily leaving i do think that's a good idea for our brave men and women to come home and to end these decade-long wars in the middle east and we have to send a message to our enemies that if you don't comply with what we would like you to do in terms of how you deal with us and and our friends there's going to be a price to pay and the message that we are sending not just to the taliban but to the iranians and to the russians to the chinese is that we are weak right now and we have got to get strong in order to continue to protect not just our borders but the borders of our friends there's another story wesley that we wanted to talk to you about since you're from down there in uh texas you know the runaway democrats who left austin so they would not be pressed to vote for a bill they knew they were going to lose regarding changes to voting restrictions and there's that famous charter flight where they're not wearing a mass and a whole bunch of them wound up with covet well now 22 of them are suing the governor and other republican officials part of their lawsuit says the plaintiffs the democrats have been deprived of liberty for substantial periods of time suffered much anxiety and distress over the separation from their families and much discomfort and embarrassment and their reputations impaired wesley they left they ran away and now they are suing the governor for saying i'm going to arrest you when you come back because that is what he is obligated according to republicans to do to get him back to vote yes well now we're talking about the good old frederick douglass freedom fighting 51 and their hypocrisy instead of suing the governor they actually should be supporting the governor for for defending our southern border right now we've had over 1 million illegal crosses into our border which is actually greater than the population of president biden's former state delaware but just when i think they can't get more hypocritical hold my beer because now two of them two of them go on vacation while their other members are doing their jobs that the texas people voted in my office to do that's to make laws and to enforce them that's all governor abbott is trying to do is his job i find it to be ironic that these people have left and fled our state not doing their job and then they want to get mad at our governor for doing the job that we elected him to do fascinating to me isn't it well here's the thing wesley they thought they had the upper hand but i think politically this whole you know running away to washington dc has been a disaster a you know it's completely backfired on them it has and i tell you what the eyes of texas are upon them we are watching and every voter here in texas knows who is currently in session doing their job and doing the biddings of the tax paying texan right now and they aren't and so we have about a year and a half to get this right and i can assure you down here in texas we will all right wesley hunt joining us today from the houston area sir thank you very much thank you very much i appreciate it god bless you god bless you

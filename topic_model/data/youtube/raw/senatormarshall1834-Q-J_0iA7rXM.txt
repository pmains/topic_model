Roger Marshall with us now Republican from Kansas so you're on the Agriculture Committee are you okay with this no work requirements for food stamp recipients well first of all stuart thanks for having me this is a huge day a great day for agriculture in DC and let me start just by commending senator pat robertson Turman conway for the great job they've done shepherding this farm bill and to get to your question i think there's some great improvements on the food stamp program in this legislation it's not everything that we wanted but we sent over to about 40 ideas that we had concepts and this final bill has 18 of those that are going to improve the food stamp requirements currently 36 states have a waiver to get out of those requirements and this legislation will close a lot of those loops it's gonna make the food stamp program much more efficient and I think the American people will be happy with this farm bill you're from Kansas that's I'm gonna call that farm country if you don't mind absolutely yeah I know it is the president is taking a very hard line in his fight with China and farmers are getting hurt I'm sure that farmers in your state are getting hurt but do you still support the president and his hard line with China no it's amazing these farmers are the most patriotic people I've ever met they're standing beside the president despite these some of these tariffs that are going on what we need to realize is that it's very very broken trades been broken we cannot keep doing what we've been doing the president's trying to address this China has kept American at beef out of to China for 14 years they turned down total shipments of wheat and sorghum from us they do so many things that that continue to hurt us so they've been sucking blood from American agriculture for decades and this president is trying to address all these there's some short-term pain we think there's a long-term gain opportunity but this 90 days needs we need to take care of this problem that we have going on here in this 90 days one encourage the president to come to some conclusions figure out long-term deals but we need trait that we need China to put to put their money where their mouth is and start taking on some of these things that they said they're going to do to give us long-term access to these markets that your farmers are with the president on his hardline with China yes sir yes sir it's just amazing yeah we did surveys 80% of them are standing right there beside the president that they love the president Roger Marshall Republican in Kansas thanks for joining us sir we appreciate it thank you very much yes Stuart thanks for having me sure thing

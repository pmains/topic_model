as gentleman from Arizona mr. Gosar thank you very much mr. row you made a great comment making sure that skill is cool and I think that's really important I want to go back to something that was actually said by Steve Jobs and reiterated by Ashton Kutcher success looks like a lot like work work looks like it looks a lot like a job and a job looks a lot like success no job is below me I never left a job without having another job so the will to work directly leads to the American exceptionalism and toward the rebuilding of the American Dream would you would you agree with that absolutely yeah we are we're obsessed with with what you do we ought to be obsessed with how you do it I'm gonna take it to another story I got to commemorate a skate park doesn't seem like it has something to do with this but there was this gentleman by the name of Rob Dyrdek that was out there and he was in his hat and his glasses and his shorts and he said I am the American dream it's because I had an opportunity not that it that I succeeded at first I had opportunity all the way around the work around the OP being given to me and I finally found success but we're running out of opportunity I think what you made comment to was is that we have to tag people young people and to know that there is opportunity and your PR is exactly that we're talking about job Corps the problem with Job Corps is that 98% of the countries never heard of it SkillsUSA 400,000 members 98% of the countries never heard of it these kids convene every year to compete in disciplines that Sean's entire business is predicated on steam fitting pipe fitting carpentry welding the Boy Scouts of America we've heard of they introduced the welding merit badge last year it's in the top third of all popular badges already they're building inroads Future Farmers of America by the way don't even want to be called Future Farmers of America anymore because the word farmer has become such a pejorative it's negatively impacting their ability to recruit so now they're the FFA PR matters job corps needs better PR Boy Scouts F they future farmers these that's the connective tissue that came that came out of in many ways they're picking up the slack that occurred when Bo tech left high school that's where the action is right now and we ignore them at our peril well we have the golden opportunity because you see all these shows about you know putting antique cars together and you know rehabilitating houses we just have to connect the dots at the high school level and junior high level with low tech I mean I'm from Western Wyoming I was required to take two years of welding so I've never left that torch um even though I went to dentistry and when I take that torch to a person they don't care for it I mean but I mean the opportunity yeah the opportunity is is that my parents always said that you always have a job it comes back to that that Steve Jobs aspect incorporated we're almost there because we see the fascination with how to do it's you know Mythbusters all these things is what we have to do is we have to choreograph and make that skill cool at high school to get them to go along that pathway would you agree I'd say that all the dots are there screaming to be connected the youth organizations I just mentioned the shows you just mentioned people are hungry for it you know to your point your dad was alignment all right so last year the industry introduced national linemen day I didn't know about it but somebody gave me a heads up and I wrote a nice post on my little Facebook page went to bed I posted a picture of me in Wyoming at the top of a pole with you know a real a real pro it's a great picture you see what looks like half of the country behind us anyhow I posted this I went to bed the next morning 1.3 million people are interacting with this post they love it and now people are anxious to say thanks they just really don't know who to direct it to but they know they know something's wrong something's disconnected the average American will get it they just they just have to see it and we got a show at all well and I think the other thing is is the lower debt ratio to students success is the vote Tech education we have seen it over and over again so what we have to do is queue kids into this because a lot of kids see things mathematically different you know and see how the application goes they're visual they say okay how does counting change matter to me well when you put it into a car and rebuilding a car and the facts of how you rebuild it makes a big difference along those lines on one question I really my kids love your show Isabelle and gassed and always watched it so if there was one memorable moment that's applicable to this committee what would it be in your in your history on the show applicable to it well you know all all things are air but I would say the first time I worked on a on a wildcatting rig I don't even remember if it was Oklahoma or Louisiana somewhere really close to both but watching those guys it was almost a mix of of construction Cirque du Soleil and and just a giant dare they worked as a unit they worked as a team and you could literally you know I had a front-row seat to watching what it takes to get the energy out of the ground and and and following that through the process is something that I got so many letters to when that episode aired because again it goes to that idea that people are people are willing to make the connection but you have to show them in an empirical way that their lights don't come on their car doesn't move civilized life as they know it stops but for those people on that platform that's the trick that's how you pay a tribute and that's how you engage your viewer thank you very much I thank the gentleman and

[Music] as a member of the house financial services committee in 2009 congressman william lacy clay jr helped to bypass an obama administration proposal requiring that the financial services industry have the best interest of their clients in mind now that decision is coming back to haunt him in a race against challenger corey bush who you've seen here on this show fight corporate monopolies a progressive advocacy group released an ad this week blasting clay for the campaign cash he received from wall street donors take a listen when predatory wall street firms needed a favor they turned to congressman william lacy clay clay opposed president obama's effort to protect working families retirement savings from greedy financiers instead joining with wall street what did clay get for opposing obama and siding with trump tens of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions corporate power is corrupting democracy and william lacy clay is part of the problem fight corporate monopolies are responsible for the content of this ad wow all right here to tell us more is dc bureau chief of the intercept and great friend of the show ryan graham great to see you ryan good to see you ryan see you all right give us the substance of what this ad is about and also give us a little bird's eye view of the strategy here right you know it's it's it's brutal in the sense that it it pins lacy clay you know against barack obama barack obama you know this the second most popular democrat in the world after his wife and you know so being on the other side of him and being allied with president donald trump in a democratic primary is is just brutal and what makes it even more brutal is that it's true in this case so the the rule that that they're talking about there is called either the fiduciary rule or the conflict of interest rule and it's utterly bizarre that it even had to be enacted the rule says that if you're a financial advisor you have to have the best interests of your client at heart in other words you can't push your client into some crappy product that your own company made that's just going to bilk them for fees that's what much of the investment industry does for workers who don't have the power to choose between uh you know between different investment plans the employer picks the plan for them uh the the investment advisors give a little kick back to the employer say this is the best one for you to take you know you're going to get a great rate and it's and it's the workers who wind up with the short end of the stick and so the obama administration as part of wall street reform was you know put in into place a rule that said you can't have these conflicts of interest that unleashed a six-year war uh where the investment industry pushed back and one of the people who was a a leading uh spear in that fight was lacie clay who has a key position on the house financial services committee and joined with republicans in pushing back against this rule and and to have somebody like clay on letters and and in efforts pushing back against the rule you know gave it a sheen of of bipartisanship say you know what actually we're just we're just looking out for working people here you know otherwise you know you wouldn't have democrats on the bill now after trump took office he came in and said hey these democrats were right and he obliterated the rule so the rule is now gone lacey clay has has now switched side and said that's terrible what what trump did but but he spent you know six years fighting the obama administration's attempt to enact the rule and it was the fact that it took so long that enabled the trump administration to overturn the rule and ryan i mean outline this here which is and we talked about this previously which is that this is a real shot across the bow at the house democratic caucus these are ads with real money behind them that are calling them out for corporatism over decades what is this reverber how is this reverberating on the national democratic level you know it's going to shock the house democratic caucus because the the ecosystem as people understood it was that you could do things like this in washington and it wasn't going to turn up as news back in springfield massachusetts through st louis missouri you know you know all he did hey he signed a couple of letters that were written to the department of labor which kind of lends credibility to the effort but it wasn't like he was going to public war and going on cable and attacking president obama and so the kind of unwritten rule was that sort of thing stays it stays in washington but now you have this deep pocketed kind of dark money progressive group that's that's uh fighting corporate monopolies they they're dumping six figures into st louis to tell everybody what he did when he was in washington you know breaking that unwritten rule this is the same group that that's doing the same thing in springfield massachusetts to to richie neal the chairman of the ways and means committee richie richie neal took a ton of money from private equity firms that own uh shares in hospital companies uh and in kind of hospital networks and fought against surprise surprise billing reform you know that thing where you show up in a in a hospital and one of the doctors that sees you while you're in the hospital is not in your network and boom you've got a 25 000 bill when you didn't have it's not like you had a choice you couldn't you couldn't ask the doctor as he's as he's coming in with a clipboard you know what network he's in and if if he's out of network uh so you know he raked in tons of money and he's getting hammered back home with with big money you know this changes the game you know somebody like uh corey bush she lost by 20 points in in 2018 she's running a much stronger campaign you know clay is obviously still the favorite any incumbent it is a favorite the clay family has held this seat for 52 years but to have uh you know air power like this coming in has to make clay nervous yeah absolutely well and that's a big part of the dynamic is not just was there an unwritten rule that you could do this stuff in dc and it wouldn't catch win back home the reason that that rule was there is because there were no money behind any anti-corporate forces to tell that story back home so speak to that dynamic of how the fact that there's real money here to push for and you know anti-monopoly anti-corporate or um you know as sort of what most americans would actually want a more balanced economy talk about how that changes the the dynamic as well yeah i think there are two things going on here and and one of them is that the left has actually seen some success so people who have money say oh actually if i invest in candidates like an ocasio-cortez uh they might actually win the second piece of what's going on i think is actually a function of inequality you know we have this lottery-like capitalist system that has been operating 30 or 40 years now since the 1980s and because it's a lottery system you know based on based on luck uh you're going to accidentally enrich a small percentage of decent people you know who have kind of progressive or populist values all of a sudden they turn out to be you know multi-millionaires and you know they don't want anything other than you know up upsetting the apple car they want to they want to destroy the system that kind of turned them into these multi-millionaires that you know that's not 99 of the people that the system works for but if you have one one percent of those and there and there are 2 000 of them let's say across the country you know that starts to add up to real money if all you need is you know three hundred thousand dollars in springfield to to overturn uh to overturn a a ways and means chairman for instance so tell us about the just the state of the race here ryan how are cory bush's chances looking what does the polling look like and is this going to make a difference so there there was polling that i've heard of that was done by demand for progress that had lacie clay under 50 which which means he's vulnerable uh still had bush trailing by double digits the difference between this time and and 2018 is that in 2018 the entirety of bush's paid upper paid campaign operation paid messaging operation was basically two weeks of radio ads this time she's going to be on radio for about eight weeks uh she's up on television with her own ad buy on top of the one that we're seeing here a sunrise movement just endorsed her is going to raise money for her and their outside spending arm might spend on her behalf she's been able to spend 85 000 on on mailers so far and so losing by 20 points in in 2018 show you know shows that she's an underdog but many of the people that came out to vote in 2018 simply didn't know who she is and that it's an underrated fact of american politics that just simple name id plays such a significant role pundits on the national stage say well uh clearly voters you know rejected medicare for all and and therefore that's why uh corey bush lost if you talk to voters that say actually i supported all of the things that bush was uh for i just hadn't heard i just hadn't actually heard of her and under pressure you know lacie clay now is actually a sponsor of medicare for all which is another thing that has muddied the waters of these primaries because if you just kind of check a lot of boxes in these deep blue seats the the incumbents you know have have usually sponsored all of the right bills and and appear outwardly progressive so you kind of need a significant amount of money to start explaining to people okay yes that's true but here's what he did on the conflict of interest rule that's a small point

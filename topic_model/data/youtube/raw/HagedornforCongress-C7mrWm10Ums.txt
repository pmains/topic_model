Paul's Lutheran School in Truman and Jim has always been a hard-working rural guy he grew up on a farm he had knows the aspects of farming and we've been lifelong friends you can tell that he grew up on a farm he knows what he's talking about when he talks about agriculture and he has a passion for it he's walked in hundreds of parades and and met with hundreds of thousands of people and you wouldn't think of somebody walking in a parade and meeting people because a lot of times politicians just walk down the middle of the road and waved their hand if they walk or they ride in a car and just waved Jim is back and forth across the street from one side to the other he walks at least twice as far for every parade route that we walk and I've gotten to know him very well and I've gotten to know him even better now in the campaign and he's a great guy I'm Neal bright Bharath of rural Truman and I'm voting for Jim Hagedorn for Congress

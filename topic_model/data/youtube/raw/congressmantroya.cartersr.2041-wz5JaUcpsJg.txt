. IT IS NOW MY HONOR TO YIELD TO  THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN FROM NEW ORLEANS, MR. TROY CARTER. MR. CARTER: THANK YOU,  CONGRESSMAN BOWMAN, FOR  ORGANIZING THIS HOUR TO DISCUSS  SUCH A CRITICAL, CRITICAL ISSUE. SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR  LEADERSHIP, BROTHER. MADAM SPEAKER, TODAY I RISE IN  SUPPORT OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO  SHINE LIGHT ON THIS CRITICAL  ISSUE OF MENTAL HEALTH. OUR CHILDREN ARE OUR MOST  PRECIOUS TREASURE. FOR MANY OF US, THEY ARE OUR  REASON WHY, WHY WE WORK TWO  JOBS, WHY WE GO TO SCHOOL, WHY  WE TRY TO OVERCOME PERSONAL  CHALLENGES AND BECOME THE BEST  VERSION OF OURSELVES. AND YET, OUR SYSTEM IS FAILING  TO HELP OUR DEAR CHILDREN FIGHT  THEIR OWN DEMONS. FOR KINDERGARTENERS TO YOUNG  ADULTS, YOUNG PEOPLE --  KINDERGARTENERS TO YOUNG ADULTS, YOUNG PEOPLE ARE NOT BEING MET  WITH THE SERVICES NEEDED TO BE  HAPPY, TO BE HEALTHY, AND  TRAGICALLY, TO SAVE THEIR LIVES. IT IS TRULY A CRISIS, AND LIKE  MOST CRISIS WE FACE, THE  SITUATION IS WORSE FOR SOME  COMMUNITIES THAN OTHERS. CERTAINLY, IT'S THE CASE FOR  COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. HERE IS A TERRIFYING STATISTIC. BLACK CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF  13 ARE TWICE AS LIKELY TO DIE BY SUICIDE COMPARED TO THEIR WHITE  PEERS. TWICE AS LIKELY. FURTHER, CHILDREN WHO SURVIVE  NATURAL DISASTERS LIKE MANY OF  MY CONSTITUENTS IN SOUTHEAST  LOUISIANA ARE LEFT WITH  EMOTIONAL SCARS THAT CAN IMPACT  THEM FOR THEIR ENTIRE LIVES. A NEW STUDY PUBLISHED BY THE  JOURNAL OF CHILD SPSYCHOLOGY AN  PSYCHIATRY FOUND THAT THE STRESS OF EXPERIENCING A NATURAL  DISASTER DURING A PREGNANCY CAN  SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE THE RISK  OF CHILDHOOD DEPRESSION AND  ANXIETY. IT'S CLEAR THAT WE'RE IN A  CRISIS AND WE MUST ACT TO MEET  THE MOMENT. I'M SO GRATEFUL THAT THE  INSTITUTE OF WOMEN AND ETHNIC  STUDIES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW ORLEANS -- STUDIES OF NEW  ORLEANS, RATHER, HAS BEEN  GRANTED $400,000 FROM H.H.S. FOR AN INITIATIVE TO HELP IDENTIFY  HEALTH AND WELLNESS POLICIES  THAT ARE STRESSFUL IN IMPROVING  BLACK YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH AND  INCLUDING SUICIDE PREVENTION. THIS YEAR CONGRESS JUST PASSED  THE BIPARTISAN SAFER COMMUNITIES ACT WHICH WILL HELP KEEP GUNS  OUT OF THE HANDS OF INDIVIDUALS  WHO ARE IN DANGER OF POTENTIALLY HURTING THEMSELVES OR OTHERS. BUT THIS HISTORIC BILL ALSO  INCLUDES $500 MILLION FOR  SCHOOL-BASED MENTAL HEALTH  SERVICES AND MILLIONS MORE FOR  CERTIFIED COMMUNITY BEHAVIORAL  HEALTH CLINICS AND MENTAL HEALTH TELEHEALTH. THIS YEAR WE ALSO LAUNCHED THE  988 HOTLINE, MENTAL HEALTH  CRISIS HOTLINE AND TEXT LINE  WHERE PEOPLE CAN REACH TRAINED  COUNSELORS IN THEIR TIME OF  NEED. WE MUST, WE CAN, WE WILL DO  MORE. WE MUST MAKE MENTAL HEALTH  SERVICE EASY, ACCESSIBLE, AND  AFFORDABLE TO EVERYONE,  PARTICULARLY OUR CHILDREN. WE MUST TEAR DOWN THE STIGMA AND EQUALIZE MENTAL HEALTH AND  PHYSICAL HEALTH. IT'S OK TO NOT BE OK. EVERYONE NEEDS SUPPORT AT  DIFFERENT POINT IN THEIR LIVES. EVERYONE NEEDS A LITTLE EXTRA  HELP SOMETIMES. EVERYONE CAN FEEL A LITTLE DOWN  SOMETIMES. EVERYONE HAS ISSUES THAT THEY  THINK ARE INSURMOUNTABLE. BUT GUESS WHAT, WITH HELP, WITH  TREATMENT, HELP IS THERE. AND YOU CAN SURVIVE IT. YOU GOT TO KNOW THAT. DON'T EVER BE AFRAID TO ASK FOR  HELP. DON'T EVER BE AFRAID TO ADMIT  THAT YOU JUST DON'T FEEL RIGHT. DON'T EVER BE AFRAID TO ADMIT  THAT YOU DON'T FIT IN, THAT YOU  FEEL DIFFERENT. HELP IS THERE. AND WE'VE ALL HAD MOMENTS WHERE  WE NEEDED HELP. YOU GOT TO KNOW THAT YOU CAN  SURVIVE AND YOU WILL SURVIVE  THIS. WE MUST ALL BE TRAINED ABOUT THE SIGNS OF MENTAL HEALTH AND  HEALTH CRISES AND LOOK OUT FOR  ONE ANOTHER. IMPLEMENTING MANY OF THESE  PROGRAMS AND SUPPORTING THE  MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WHO  PROVIDE THESE SERVICES AT A  SIGNIFICANT PRICE TAG AND FROM  MY PERSPECTIVE, IT'S ESSENTIAL. ANY DOLLAR THAT WE SPEND, ANY  MONEY THAT WE APPROPRIATE, THAT  SAVES THE LIFE, THAT GIVES  INDIVIDUALS HOPE, THAT WE CARE  AND THAT RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE ARE DOLLARS WELL SPENT. WE NEED TO DO MORE. WE NEED TO INVEST IN PROGRAMS  AND HAVE STAFF THAT CHANGE AND  SAVE LIVES. AND WE NEED TO DO IT NOW. WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO FIGHT. OUR CHILDREN ARE WORTH IT. WHEN SOMEONE HAS HIGH BLOOD  PRESSURE, THEY EXERCISE. THEY DIET. THEY TAKE A PILL. IF SOMEONE HAS DIABETES, THEY  EXERCISE, THEY DIET, THEY TAKE A PILL. THEY MODIFY THEIR LIFESTYLES AND THEY'RE NOT ASHAMED TO ADMIT  THOSE THINGS. MENTAL HEALTH IS NO DIFFERENT. THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH  ADMITTING THAT YOU MAY NEED  HELP, BECAUSE HELP IS THERE FOR  YOU. AND WE KNOW THAT THE RESOURCES  ARE THERE AND THEY MAKE A  DIFFERENCE. SO WE GOT TO GET AWAY FROM  FEELING LIKE IF WE NEED HELP  THAT SOME HOW, SOME WAY THAT  SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH ME. THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH YOU. THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH  YOU -- MORE WRONG WITH YOU THAN  SOMEBODY HAS A HEADACHE AND HAS  TO TAKE AN ASPIRIN OR SOMEBODY  THAT HAS HIGH BLOOD WE CAN FIX IT. YOU'RE NOT ALONE. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU KNOW. TO ANYONE WHO â– IS STRUGGLING, WH HAS CHILDREN OR YOUNG PEOPLE IN THEIR LIVES THAT ARE STRUGGLING, YOU'RE NOT ALONE. YOU WILL NEVER BE ALONE. THINGS WILL GET BETTER. REACH OUT. 988 IS AVAILABLE TO YOU 24/7. EXPERTS ARE WAITING TO HEED YOUR CALL. ORGANIZATIONS ARE FUNDED TO HELP YOU. WE ARE HERE TO HELP YOU. YOU ARE NOT ALONE. AND YOU CAN AND YOU WILL SURVIVE.

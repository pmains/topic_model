and i think they can get them back on track probably pretty quick once they're in that classroom but i think that's really what we were missing was that that accountability piece of what a classroom provides well uh good evening everyone congressman pete stauber here again i'm with cindy and mark at their home just north of malacca and today we're just talking about want to talk to them about school and how it was like last march when uh the schools were shut down because of the coronavirus and what was it like for you as as parents with the kids at home um you know distance learning and and really turning your home into the classroom tell us a little bit about how how it was uh how you experienced that cindy sure um well we had two high school boys at home and i would say at first they were really excited to be home so um initially excited and then it didn't take long for them to realize that they were starting to miss their friends the expectations just started to drop in um in all their classes and it really wasn't on the teachers in this community we just started to realize that other families were experiencing hardship so our kids were just didn't have to do much to keep up and had a lot of time on their hands but through the emails through the teachers we just realized that in our community there was just lots of stress in the home so the parents weren't able to help their kids doesn't learn they really take their growth do you think the distance learning had uh somewhat of a negative effect on pushing their education forward yeah they were just not being pushed or challenged they could have handled a lot more for our kids so mark as a father as you saw this what did you think as the kids were going through this that was it a change to distance learning on the computer and sometimes virtually in the classroom what was your reaction well um i wasn't involved with it a lot because cindy kind of took over that and and our two boys you know handled it well themselves and i think probably the thing i recognized because one at the time was a freshman one was a senior selling our son lincoln um you know missed out a lot of opportunities that he had to experience being a senior the last day of school certain events and things that took place that that he didn't get the experience that most of us look back now and are great memories that we had absolutely and so i think for me that was part of the part that probably stood out the most to me um and uh and then of course socially they both enjoy being around their friends and doing those things but they they adapted well all things considered um with the help of cindy and then also they were just motivating able to get the work done that they need to get done as we as we uh transition into the fall here and opening a school what are your thoughts on uh on getting the kids back in school and do it responsibly and safety just tell me what you as parents are thinking we realize that there are a lot of people a lot of fans affected by kovid but we've just not really seen it here so um it's it's tough it's tough to think about it moving forward with those kind of parameters set on us and it doesn't seem like we're really experiencing that now we know it's the potential is probably there but it just seems for us it feels like we're overreacting but i it maybe it's unfair for us to say that i think initially it seemed with the new governor's um suggestions it seems great with uh handing it back over to the school districts like immediately that sounds great i think that makes a lot of sense um to see how covet is expecting you know is affecting your community and can you safely open and stay healthy and you know wash things down and stay distant so i thought that was initially sounding great and then all of a sudden there was oh but by the way wear your mask i just know that kids already are distracted in school they're already struggling to pay attention and so i just think with that mandate there's going to be new challenges for sure at school i do want to go back to one thing you talked about it was your son lincoln that graduated as a senior that's one of the things i talked to most parents have said the exact same thing you did mark about that those last weeks and as a senior those are memorable i i mean i graduated in 1984 i remember my last day and what we did and was walking across the stage with the diploma and our seniors this past spring didn't have the opportunity and and uh i'm sad for that i'm sad for all yeah or your boy lincoln and others that didn't have that experience that we had you know going through this pandemic so mark lastly tell us about what you expect as the school year starts what's your expectation of the students and the teachers in the classrooms and even our governor as a class as we start out this fall in school uh i guess i don't have high expectations because it's really uncertain at this point so i don't want to be disappointed um one of the things that i i think cindy would concur that the that we have a very good school district and we've got i think we have great leadership um even back to lincoln's graduation they did a phenomenal job of adapting and making the graduation special did a lot of neat things so you know hats off to them for doing that and trying to really you know make up for and i think they did a very all things consider they did a phenomenal job of that so so we really commend them for that and i guess i have really a fair amount of confidence um in our leadership at the school we have relationship with most of them friendship and something we went to school with and so we're just i don't i just i feel extremely blessed and often remind them how fortunate we feel to have our children in this school district and that's key yeah so so so i think with that increases the element of trust so then it doesn't cause me to have anxiety about the expectations of what are they going to do or not do because i do i do trust them that trust between the parents and the teachers the school district that's a that's a big component of this and uh you know making sure that you know uh that that we use the data and the the doctors and our community leaders making this decision for exactly exactly yeah i think that's really into cindy's point i think it's great that the governor is willing to allow that i think that suji's not just throwing a blanket statement everybody has to do this you know based on what he thinks i think that's that's huge but i think it also puts a lot of pressure on the administration make those decisions and make the right call and have that pressure to potentially make the wrong call and what is that and leave it local yeah that's good that's great that's great cindy mark thanks for spending a few minutes of your time i really appreciate it and this is pete's power play with cindy and mark just north of malacca take care now you

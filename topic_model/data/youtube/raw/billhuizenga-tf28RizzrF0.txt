for a minute and a half gentleman is recognized for a minute and a half right Thank You mr. chairman and Mr Speaker I rise today in support of HR 1965 we missed that number by one should be 1964 because 1964 was the last time that they actually updated these registration numbers that is a very long time I can tell you at age 42 it was a number of years before I was even born the last time that this happened and it's a high time that that that it does happen and I also tell you mr. speaker that here with the Republican Americans job creators plan the first thing on that list is empower small businesses and reduced government barriers to job creation and I really hope that this bipartisan bill doesn't become part of that lost 15 over in the Senate this is a very proactive bipartisan step that this body is taking that as it goes over across to that next chamber needs to be addressed we need to do this because we must modernize we must update we must do these things to remain competitive in a world market and Mr Speaker I appreciate the opportunity and in pleased that I could rise in support of that bill and I yield back the balance of my time gentleman from Alabama

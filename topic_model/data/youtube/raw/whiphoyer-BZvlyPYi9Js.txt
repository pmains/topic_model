anywhere of Maryland thank the gentleman for yielding I thank you for taking this time on the special order I think this is aside I need to apologize to him for and wait so long for this special order I also want to tell the American people mr. speaker that the gentleman who has taken this special order who has taken this special order is probably the constitutional expert knowing in this body but one of the constitutional experts in our country he is a great legislator himself although new to this body not new to being a legislative leader at all a legislative leader in our state for many years a wonderful teacher and somebody who has great political courage and is willing to stand and say the emperor has no clothes is willing to call attention to the fact that our democracy is that risk that our due process is at risk he used the phrase trumped-up what an interesting phrase that is that we have used for many years I don't know as had as much relevance in years past as it now may have Mr Speaker I thank my friend mr. Raskin for leading this special order our system of government as he has pointed out is based on the rule of law we are government of laws not of men what that means is it is not personalities not dictators not Kings that rule our land it is the law the law of our Constitution the law of our legislators and the common law that we pursue as interpreted by our court systems its foundation is the constitutional principle that all are equal under the law no one is exempt the appointment of a special earlier this year to look into the possibility of administration of the administration or Trump campaign officials colluding with foreign adversary or obstructing justice falls into a long tradition in our country of using independent counsel to investigate those in the most senior offices of our government our founding fathers would say that is a check and balance that is a protection against the usurpation of democracy the choice of the former FBI director Bob Muller to be that independent investigator was an extraordinarily wise one a decision greeted with support from across the political spectrum precisely because mr. Muller is so widely respected for his independence and his commitment to the law above all else and parenthetically although it is not necessarily relevant he is a Republican he is not however driven by the politics of left or right or Republican or Democrat he is a man of the law a man who seeks the truth a man who has dedicated his career to assuring that we remain a land of liberty under law we have already seen a demonstration of that commitment in the prompt firing of a subordinate investigator for an act that was not illegal as the gentleman from Maryland our constitutional scholar scholar has pointed out but however threatened to impugn the objectivity of the investigation in other words he removed somebody who he thought might undermine the credibility of because he is so committed to this investigation being objective and unquestionably fair mr. Muller has made it abundantly clear that he will not tolerate any hint of bias in this investigation so far it appears that his investigation is bearing fruit having uncovered serious crimes and secured three indictments as well as guilty pleas from two key subjects guilty pleas this was not a question of we had a trial and somebody convinced the 12 people that he was guilty this was a case where the individual said I am guilty I did what was alleged I know that it is illegal and I should bear the consequences that included of course the National Security Advisor who was national security adviser I think for 25 days or close to that number mr. Flynn as the investigation is advanced mr. speaker we've seen troubling statements from the president and his advisors seeking to sow uncertainty about the legitimacy of the special counsels activities and undermine confidence in him but it's not so much the confidence in him that is critical its confidence in the law its confidence in the process its confidence that in fact we are a nation of laws and whether we are president or president peasant we will be held accountable if in fact we break the laws what is being done to undermine this process threatens the Independence of the investigation and those who aren't taking it it dangerous to our democracy and to our freedom now in recent days we've heard calls by the president and his allies to launch a counter investigation of the press special prosecutors investigation those of us who know history know that that is so often the defense of those who seek authoritarian power of those who believe they are above the law of those who believe they can intimidate others so that they will never be held accountable for wrongdoing this preposterous suggestion has but one purpose to cast the shadow of doubt over the findings of mr. mullahs inquiry by attempting to frame it in a partisan way in fact mr. melih was appointed by a Republican appointed Deputy Attorney General it is tactics like this one that we see so often overseas in countries ruled by dictators and those seeking to become dictators this willful effort to erode confidence in any institution that must be seen as impartial is harmful because if nobody and nothing is impartial if everyone and everything is tainted by politics and interest then no one no one can possess the moral authority to hold accountable one who wishes to be entirely unaccountable that mr. speaker is the reason I think that the president has also attacked the Fourth Estate the newspapers the broadcasters the people whose Duty it is to bring facts to the people so that they the people can make a rational judge in a democracy for it is in their hands that the power ultimately resides and if you undermined those who give them the facts then you undermine their ability to make decisions this ultimately is what the special prosecutor's work is all about accountability ensuring that every person is held to the same high standard of behavior under the laws of our nation so Mr Speaker I urge my colleagues in both parties this is not about party this is about country this is about patriotism this is about the rule of law if we lose that respect for law we will lose our country it will be a different lesser country I urge my colleagues from both SAR parties from every ideological corner let us not forget the most fundamental principle that binds us together as American and as public servants that all are created equal that all of us and all Americans are equal under the law that doesn't mean we're the same but it means in the eyes of the law we are equal as we stand to be held accountable or to be held innocent or not involved or not owing somebody else for wrongdoing we need to uphold by our words and by our deeds the special prosecutors work must continue unimpeded and it must continue to be respected yesterday and the Judiciary Committee that was not the case to defend the indefensible undermines respect for law I want to thank my friend again mr. Jamie Raskin from Montgomery County Maryland as I said a great constitutional scholar and teacher a great legislator but more importantly than that an individual who loves his country and throughout his life has fought to make the country all that the founding fathers meant it to be I thank him for coming to this floor and for his efforts to ensure that mr. Muller's investigation can continue to be seen as impartial and with its objective unquestioned and that is accountability accountability and justice equal justice under the law that is our bedrock that is our touchstone that is our guiding star that is what Professor Raskin congressman Raskin citizen Raskin is talking about today and we all ought to thank him for that and I yield back the time to my friend Jamie Raskin a Maryland mr. Hoyer thank you very much for you

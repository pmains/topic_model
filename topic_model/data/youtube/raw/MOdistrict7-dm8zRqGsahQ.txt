Thank You mr. chairman Mr Colley during your question and answer session here today you said that hopefully there will be some changes to 111 d before implementation what type of changes would you like to see in 111 d I'm hopeful only because I've listened in public to statements by senior officials at the EPA so I have no particular information but I think in terms of timing of the targets to make a more progressive transition ideally more progressive more not not in a political sense but in there well I know not the political sense but I'm talking about more rapidly progressing but to slow them down and phase them in more gently so that essentially the way the original proposal was his targets were on average get to be eighty percent of the way there in the first year that was too steep of a hill to to climb I think physically in terms of reliability so our suggestion in terms of timing would be to make the compliance targets more gradual more phased in over a period of time to allow us to make sure that the infrastructure is there gas and transmission and and The Dispatch capability is there to meet those targets okay yeah I'm progressing I didn't mean to imply politically but I thought you were wanting to speed up the process but the opposite downer is front end yeah okay also for you Mr Colley the EPA's proposed rule includes interim targets beginning in 2020 based on this rule eleven states have achieved 11 states must achieve seventy-five percent of the total goal for the first interim date of 2020 and my state of Missouri has to achieve over sixty percent total goal by then what impact do you think the sudden change by states to meet the 2020 interim targets will have on reliability issues well it creates challenges in terms of some units may be forced to retire they're no longer economic us and particularly coal and baseload units and I might add we get eighty-five percent of our electricity from coal and Missouri some of those units might not retire but it might not be available to operate but it very limited times in regions where gas natural gas supply is an issue going from less than thirty percent dependence on gas to seventy percent dependence creates a huge new demand on on gas utilization and whether the gas is going to be there every day and the cold days and a winter is going to be a challenge oh also for you Mr Colley the when Newark puts out an alert what's the general response time I the utility sector the alerts very there's a level one two and three and we can set whatever a response time is appropriate for the situation a level three is the most urgent and it requires a mandated response from the entities level one as a advisory heads up and level two is a recommended set of actions but does not require a response back that there was completed okay thank you and for you mr. Pardee I understand you have concerns regarding the timing for FERC to complete to complete its required analysis within the 90 days of being proposed wouldn't you agree that having such a report would be beneficial to those members of the public submitting comments on the proposed rule I think the the analysis that we've seen for example in the context of the clean power plan are certainly informative and useful and I'm sure the public has benefited from seeing that information okay what role should FERC have in the review of state implementation plans and what about in review of federal plans you know the commissioners wrote a letter to EPA just this past week addressing that point and what they indicated was that they felt they needed to to be careful not to overstep their role and intrude on the authority and responsibility of states but having said that they indicated that the the existing processes would be the starting point for how to address the reliability implications of those plans and and that could be supplemented with any additional guidance or work that the commissioners felt appropriate to save me trying to run that down could you provide my staff with a copy that letter yes sir okay thank you on mr. Chairman I yield back gentleman yields back this

through them we want to welcome back to the program senator Roger wicker Republican from Mississippi senator wicker welcome back to today's issues glad to be back on a big day yes it is listen we've got a there's so many stories I don't know what two three years ago it seemed like it was hard to two maybe four years ago hard to find news stories now we can't cover everything under we have two very important issues we want to try to squeeze in we know your time is limited the first I went to your to your website you have released a statement on North Korean provocation this is very worrying the situation in North Korea very worrying to many Americans who have been following this once you tell us because you're a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee this is kind of in your wheelhouse kind of lay out the problem and the difficulties in solving what is going on in North Korea well the problem is North Korea is dominated now by the third generation of totally irresponsible unreliable unpredictable leadership the the people and in North Korea pretty much view these leaders as as gods and they're just totally brainwashed and who would have thought that they could develop this this technology that was that was demonstrated a few days ago which basically shows that they are capable of putting an atomic bomb on an intercontinental ballistic missile that could reach any city in the United States including Tupelo including Washington DC but but they do have that technology and most of the people live in absolute poverty there but but their elite are they're well educated and they've developed this capability so we obviously had to pay attention to it I do think this I don't think Kim jong-un wants to commit suicide and I do believe he understands that any attack on America or or in the attack on Americans in our interests would result in in a firestorm coming down on him that very day would be the last day of his life and the last day of the lives of all the members of that regime there would be carnage for sure around in the area and we don't want that we want to try to avoid it but I do believe he understands that in the attack on the United States though he's now capable of it would result in his immediate death the senator I'd like to ask you something about China obviously they're the big player in that part of the world in your judgment is China doing enough to do use the problem no and you know China sort of they sort of treat North Korea the way Russia treats Iran you know there they give lip service to being opposed to the development of a nuclear weapon but they're not doing everything they possibly could China could bring the North Korean regime to its knees if they would do an absolute boycott and absolute end of all trade and relationship but they want to keep them as sort of a handy for their things to get too out of hand but in a way this unstable regime at the North part of that peninsula gives them a little leverage with the rest of us and I do view China as as just as significant a an adversary to the United States as as North Korea they very much want to dominate the Pacific and that's why we need that's why we need to implement my ships act to to provide for 355 ship Navy so that the Pacific is a place where that we're American interesting keep the sea lanes open senator Steve drawl here with the American family news we're hearing pretty substantial or substantive rumors that the president may be planning to replace Secretary of State Tillerson in the middle of this whole thing with North Korea it makes me a little nervous to think about changing that important of a position what do you have a thought about that well if the secretary would would like to step down after a tough year I don't want to keep him if he doesn't feel like he's he's got the juice to to continue this is a very tough job and you're you're in the air all the time you're on the road all the time so you know whatever they decide to do I support it I read the news article you know Pompeyo is is the CIA director he's being rumored as someone who wouldn't move into that position he is he is strong as horseradish he's a graduate of the United States Military Academy number one graduate out if I'm not mistaken and would be a very hawkish and no-nonsense Secretary of State if that's the way the president wanted to go I would support that but I really only know the the news articles gonna just seen him in the last few hours Senate Senator wicker this is Walker here one one topic and I think you were alluding to this when we brought you on the show is tax reform I know the news broke within the last hour that Senator McCain has committed to at least voting for the current bill and it's the current form how's that looking I know a lot of things are going on today I've read some stories you all might be voting either tonight or tomorrow on this what's the that would be the so-called voter Brahma where all of the amendments of any kind are allowed and they can offer as many as they want to long into the night and into tomorrow that begins to begins I just may be around dark tonight and and so we'll be voting until our colleagues across the aisle get tired of offering amendments but you know I've been in this position before and had the red pulled out from under me but this does feel like victory today and and yes senator McCain's affirmative vote will help I think we've I think there have been enough assurance is given to to those two or three senators who are worried about the small business aspect of this the so-called pass-through corporations and it seems that we're making some progress evening out there treatment as compared to the larger C corporation - this all gets very very technical but it seems like we've made some changes and we've got the votes we need 15 and we'll we'll welcome Mike Pence into the chair again as he's had to do several times and break the tie and let me tell you I mean there's a reason why the stock market has been going up a hundred points a day for almost every day this week is good because the economy is anticipating that we are going to do this great thing for job creation and for wages and take-home pay for Americans they feel that we are about to do it and it's incumbent on us to do it we we have we've gotten very old fashions and in the way we tax job creators as compared to our competitors in Asia and Europe and we need to enter the 21st century and this is a this is a pill day we could join the House of Representatives and and actually put our money where our mouth is and get something close to passage I would have to go back to conference but I know the president is theirs thrilled at the progress we're about to make and I think we see a conference report signed before the maybe before the middle edition senator Roger wicker Republican to Mississippi has been our guest senator thank you so much you know your time is limited and valuable we appreciate you spending some of it with us here on today's issues well thank you for having me just give me a call and I'll be happy to chat with you again hope we have good news during the wee hours of the morning on the policy I hope so too Thank You senator thank you

we are hearing media reports that President zielinski of Ukraine will be coming to Washington tomorrow to address a joint session of the United States Congress I hope that is a accurate report I think it's important that he come this would be by the way the first time that he has left Ukraine in 300 days not since the start of the invasion which is now 300 days from today Against All Odds Ukraine has held out against the Russian assault many thought that they would only be able to hold out for a week or so instead it's been 300 days they pushed Russia back in so many places I'm glad he's coming because I know what he will do is talk about his deep appreciation for what the American people have provided every time I've been with him and I've traveled to Ukraine about 10 times since 2014. he talks about that but particularly over the last few months I've been to Ukraine twice and he focused on the fact that they couldn't do it without us and the Deep appreciation that he feels second I know he will give us a firsthand report of what's going on just this morning he was in Bak moot which is in eastern Ukraine this is what it looks like in Bak moot today so he's going from a a ravaged Battle Zone looks a little bit like a World War One Battle Zone when you see all the damage that has been occurring in this area he'll be able to tell us specifically what is happening on the battlefield and talk about the continued Russian atrocities are being committed in the country of Ukraine I'm here for the 29th consecutive week on the floor of the Senate to talk about this attack on Ukraine a brutal illegal and totally unprovoked War on a democratic Ally of ours who just wants to live in peace with its neighbors including Russia in each of these previous 28 speeches I've talked about the progress that's been made and some of the issues that the Ukrainian people still need to address particularly with regard to more technology and more weapon systems from the west and from the United States today I thought it might be useful to step back and take a look at how we got here and how far Ukraine has come over these 300 days let's consider what the Ukrainian military has accomplished since that initial Russian invasion of sovereign Ukrainian territory now over eight years ago this first picture shows Ukrainian soldiers taking up positions in Crema tourists back in 2014 this was again right after the so-called revolution of dignity when Ukraine decided to turn to the West the United States and Europe democracy free markets and the russian-backed corrupt government was thrown out Russia responded by attacking Ukraine taking Crimea in parts of the Dom bus these are the Ukrainian soldiers at that time you can look at this very basic hit old rusted weapons boots that don't look very sturdy helmets look like they're from the Soviet era and they probably are small anti-armor weapons that really did not have the ability to stop the Russian armor they couldn't puncture the armor in these Russian tanks and other armored vehicles these were the soldiers who were tasked with stopping Russia's initial invasion in 2014. again they look more like soldiers from the 1980s in those days the Ukrainian military was underfunded faced a lot of allegations of fraud had a lot of corruption was shockingly small and that was on purpose because the russian-backed government didn't want an effective military so in 2014 with the help of an assortment of militias they were able to slow Russia's Advance just because the ukrainians were taking the high moral ground but they were unable to push the Russian forces out of the country or to keep them from taking Crimea in large parts of the dombas which remained in Russian hands let's fast forward now to 2022 today and see what our help has resulted in this is a photograph of what soldiers look like on the front lines today this is an entrench in Bak moot where you can see modern firearms and helmets body armor additional gear and equipment on their uniforms for extended operations in the field and weapons that can actually make a difference for instance the American-made Javelin anti-rama missiles that were provided to them which are so were so effective against the Russian tanks and other armored vehicles there's an additional thing you can't see in this Photograph or any photograph but it's really important and that's training these soldiers in 2022 are far better trained than their predecessors and they're schooled in Western tactics they are competent disciplined and able to operate independently in uncertain circumstances this stands in sharp contrast to how Russia's military has conducted itself in this conflict overly centralized command and control poor discipline and unwillingness or an inability to learn from their mistakes this is the modern military that has shattered the sword of Russia's War Machine and it was all made possible through the combined efforts of the United States American taxpayers but also our allies across the world particularly the UK did a lot of training our European allies in the EU did a lot of training the Eastern European countries in the region also Canada we stepped up and we helped to train the Next Generation of Ukrainian military and through that we've helped professionalize arm and train Ukraine's military since 2014 to prepare for the exact contingency that now occurred earlier this year which is a full-scale Invasion by Russia our efforts are paying off as Russia's Invasion has floundered and its military has been truly denigrated if you need more proof about successful raid Ukraine has been over the years let's look at this map when The Invasion came in February of this year all of this area in blue was occupied by Russia Ukraine has now taken back about 55 percent of its own territory liberated these areas and they continue to make progress as you know here in Harrison and here in the harkiv region and throughout Eastern and Southeastern and Northeastern Ukraine Russia had thought it had an easy battle on their hands they thought that within a matter of days or weeks this entire map would be read that all of Ukraine would be theirs instead since February Ukraine has liberated over 74 000 square kilometers of sovereign territory and thousands and thousands millions in fact of Ukrainian citizens who have embraced these troops as liberators Ukraine's Fighters have strong morale but they'll be the first to tell you that none of this would have been possible without help from this body from the U.S House from the United States taxpayers to give them the tools they needed to protect their freedom we have sent Ukraine now billions of dollars worth of military economic and humanitarian Aid since that attack in February humanitarian Aid that has saved lives economic aid that helps keep the Ukrainian government and economy afloat and military aid that has enabled Ukraine's Brave defense of their Homeland Javelin missile launchers have helped stopped the mechanized Advance toward key back in February and again in March of this year but since the summer the most important weapon has been these high Mobility artillery rocket systems known as high Mars we have provided about 20 of these units not a single one by the way has been taken out by the Russian military it's extraordinary they shoot and they Scoot and they are very effective these same weapons have been provided by the way to the ukrainians by Germany and by the UK so we're not alone nor should we be our allies should be there for Ukraine as I've said in this floor many times these 20 launchers have been game changers in the battlefield by the way Sue my colleagues Senator Klobuchar is on the floor today when we were in Ukraine a few months ago we were talking to the U.S embassy personnel a small dedicated group who are there about what was happening they said the day before that they had ordered food in Kiev and when the food arrived in bags hamburgers by the way on the outside of the bag was written thank you for the high Mars thank you for the high Mars we are told that newborns in Ukraine are often taking the name heimar now that's the degree to which they know and appreciate what we have provided for them to be able to save their Homeland their families and their freedom it's the long range and high Precision of these weapons that has enabled Ukraine to be so successful particularly going after Russian Logistics command and control cutting off the troops as they did in Harrison forcing the Russians to leave that City the first major city that Russia occupied it's also critical that we send more air defense equipment particularly counter drone weapons to Ukraine right now we've got to continue to provide the ukrainians with these air defense systems including cost-effective electronic warfare systems that will enable them to control the Skies over the long term without exhausting its their stockpiles of anti-air missiles we know what's happening as Ukraine is making progress on the battlefield Russia out of desperation is turning to civilian attacks targeted civilian attacks that's what's happening every day every night in Ukraine I was pleased to see recent reports that the administration May soon be sending Patriot air defense systems to Ukraine to defend against Russia's critical bombardment on these civilian targets particularly on critical energy infrastructure in my view this is long overdue Patriots are defensive of course we should have sent those as soon as we could and train up the ukrainians on them and we could have avoided so Much Death and destruction but it's good that Administration is now considering doing it I would hope that we will hear something positive on that soon Russia's foreign Ministry predictably warned last Thursday that if the United States delivers these air defense systems to Ukraine it would be quote another provocative move by the United States end quote they said this would result in a swift response from Moscow ladies and gentlemen this is clear propaganda Patriot missiles are defensive by their nature they're not the same kind of missiles you would fire on on into another country offensively they are smaller missiles met to kill missiles in the air and drones in the air and airplanes in the air any reasonable person can clearly see that the provocateur here is not the United States or any other country it is Russia of course Ukraine has every right to defend its citizens and I believe America is well within its rights to help them do that this is more evidence that Russia's claims of American provocations are baseless they always have been Javelin Stingers highmars now Patriots and every time they have said that this is provocative and they'll continue to claim that anything we give Ukraine to disrupt this genocidal invasion is provocative so why do we keep letting these illogical claims stifle our Aid to Ukraine let's not let it happen here with the Patriots for the past 10 months I've seen news story after news story about the U.S refusing to provide this or that weapon to Ukraine for fear of provoking Russia they've been asking for weapons since the very start that we have yet to provide fourth generation aircraft f-16s that are in other countries that are willing to provide them but they need our licenses we need to approve it for those planes to go main battle tanks they want to make this a conflict where they have a chance tank to tank to be able to have Abrams tanks long-range missiles like the attacker missiles that Ukraine has asked for since the beginning of this conflict would have enabled larger Ukrainian advances than the ones you see on this map they would be doing even better the same fear of provoking Russia is exactly what drove the Obama Administration back in the day to refuse to provide any lethal assistance at all to Ukraine in 2014 and 2015 that certainly did not stop the Russians from holding on to Crimea in parts of the Dome bus it just emboldened them because they knew that the United States was not going to respond and therefore our allies without our leadership were not going to help likewise refusing to give Ukraine the weapons it needs now will not stop Russia's Onslaught no one can believe that Russia will only leave Ukrainian territory if it is pushed out by Force of Arms it will not suddenly decide to leave if we just give the end to their unreasonable demands and agree with them that because it's provocative we can't provide it we've got to continue to provide more Aid to Ukraine and do it as soon as possible we can't allow a stalemate to set in or Worse allow Russia to regain the initiative during this critical time every day this war drags on there are more impacts on our economy on the global economy and every day this war drags on there are more war crimes being committed by Russia throughout my several trips to the region since the invasion began 10 months ago I have spoken with women and children who have seen death and destruction that few of us would ever imagine our military aid can Propel the forces of Ukraine to Victory but the mental and emotional toll of this war will be felt for decades to come as Russian attacks on civilian infrastructure continued to knock out power around the country last Wednesday and Thursday seven civilians were killed and further in a further 19 were wounded according to a report from President zelinski's office yesterday only 20 percent of Kiev this modern city in Ukraine only 20 percent of it had lights and the war crimes do not end there in the recently liberated city of heresol Ukrainian officials discovered a room that Russian soldiers had used specifically for the detention and torture of children according to Ukrainian parliament's commissioner for human rights we saw the Rock Bottom in her soul the children were given little water and almost no food according to locals the children were also subjected to psychological abuse one fourteen-year-old boy was arrested and tortured just for taking a picture of broken Russian equipment who can hear these words and truly think that the ukrainians or the West are the true provocateers here and that's just the war crimes we know about and we know about a lot of them now we don't know what Horrors are still being conducted here behind the lines in occupied areas of Ukraine unfortunately Russia is making it abundantly clear that it will do nothing to hold its soldiers accountable for these crimes in Ukraine a new bill making its way in the Russian legislature would effectively legalize any and all war crimes committed by Russian soldiers in Ukraine if those crimes are quote aimed to protect the interest of the Russian Federation as many of us have said for months the pain and suffering inflicted on the innocent people of Ukraine is the point and now Russian soldiers will have official legal cover to commit those atrocities this is a terror campaign knocking out power putting people in the dark in the cold during the Ukrainian winter we can't allow this suffering to continue I'll be leaving the Senate soon and ending my time in this great chamber it's my last speech on the senate floor about Ukraine but before I go a couple of thoughts about the future Ukraine can win this war they've shown that that ending has been clear to many of us for a long time if we provide assistance compare Ukraine's military competence bravery discipline and creativity on the one hand on the other hand Russia's stunning incompetence and lack of ability to control or even Supply its troops there's a New York Times story over the weekend you may have seen the Sunday Times about Russia's inability to provide troops with their basic needs Russia has fumbled every opportunity it has had in this war from his failed attack on Cave at the beginning to the invasion of its to its poor defenses of parkeev obelost and in the West Bank of the nepro river even their supposed victories in the donask area have come after long grinding advances that come at the cost of thousands of casualties at best these are pure victories that reflect a serious inability and think or learn creatively in the part of the Russian forces Ukraine on the other hand has had the moral High ground and the morale and the spirit in this war since the first Russian soldiers crossed the border with Belarus in the North in the lines of contact here in the east Ukrainian soldiers have either outright defeated Russia's offensive as they did in the north where in the spring or slowed them to a crawl as they have done in the East right now Russian forces near the city of bakmut are advancing no more than 100 to 200 meters a day at a cost we were told of at least 50 Russian soldiers a day and on the attack ukrainians have been brave bold and Relentless their liberation of the harkivo blast in September was a matter of carefully testing Russia's defenses there once a weakness was spotted Ukrainian soldiers surged through a hole in the line one week later all the province was liberated it was a beautifully executed operation which will likely be studied in military academies for a long time to come and was American and European and Canadian training that allowed that to happen in the South near Harrison it was a very different kind of offensive their Ukrainian forces provided with these highmars from the United States we talked about earlier gradually whittled away at Russian forces to the point where the situation became untenable they couldn't be resupplied and so they left again the one major city that they had occupied one of the counter-offensive harkiv in Harkey have required quick thinking and an ability to rapidly exploit success the other in her song required meticulous planning in patients two very different operations jet Ukrainian soldiers pulled them both off that is why Ukraine can win this war its Defenders are bold creative smart and endlessly Brave they've proven it to us every Russian missile fired at the Ukrainian infrastructure to destroy the ukrainians people's will is a wasted missile why do I say that because the intention is to make the Ukrainian people want to back off to lose the resolve and this morale in the spirit I talked about it had just the opposite effect every time it happens which is that it makes the Ukrainian people even more resolved and even more intent to win this war Ukrainian people are unbreakable as we've seen and once Ukraine wins this War I believe it will join the European Union and eventually it will join NATO the EU granted candidate status to Ukraine in June which sent them down the path toward eventual membership that was a good sign since then according to the chairman of Ukraine's Parliament Ukraine has already passed seven pieces of legislation to adopt reforms that are necessary to join the European Union according to the Deputy Prime Minister Ukraine expressed to be a full-fledged member of the EU within five years that's the future regarding NATO by the way I have long supported Ukraine's intention to join this Alliance the most successful military Alliance of course in the history of the world none of this would be happening were they in NATO already and it's in line with NATO's long-standing open door policy the alliance has always welcome the applications of any and all eligible countries and once Ukraine pushes Russia out of all of its Sovereign territory I believe it can take this step they certainly would provide incredible military power Donato Russia launched its initial invasion in 2014 and is larger one in 2022 precisely to keep Ukraine out of NATO but all Sovereign countries including Ukraine have the right to decide their own path their own destiny their own alliances their own foreign policy we cannot legitimize the kremlin's ridiculous demands by giving up now plus it's hard to think of a more qualified country to join NATO than Ukraine Russia has been the greatest threat to the alliance for at least a decade what better country to induct into NATO than one that has extensive experience defeating that threat on the battlefield so it's in our interest but not just in our strategic interest to Aid Ukraine it's also in our moral interests if we falter in support of Ukraine we condemn millions of innocent ukrainians to a future of repression a future of summary executions like we saw in bucha and izum I've been there I've seen the damage they did I've seen the place where they had a mass grave bearing Ukrainian citizens a future of torture chambers built for adults and children alike a future in which the very idea of being proudly Ukrainian is outlawed and punishable by torture or death if we falter we allow President Putin to continue to threaten the rest of Europe and potentially start a war with NATO that will draw on the United States we cannot do that this aggression must stop here Ukraine and its Western allies are fighting to preserve freedom in Europe and globally how this war ends will have far-reaching consequences both on the rest of the continent and around the world we can stop Russian aggression here then we can deter other adversaries they're watching China's watching Iran is watching they're watching and thinking about whether they should start similarly horrific Wars of Conquest we must send a message to the rest of the world that America will not back down when Rogue Nations threaten free countries this has always been America's role today was the National Mall seeing the prayer that Franklin Roosevelt said on D-Day and this plaque has just been placed on the national wall based on legislation we passed here in this body and in that prayer Franklin Roosevelt says that American troops were not going to Europe for Conquest it was not for the love of Conquest it was not for the lust of Conquest rather it was to combat the Germans and to stop Conquest that American troops were there to liberate that's what we do in this case it's not our troops they aren't asking for our troops but they are asking for the tools to be able to be successful in liberating the people of Ukraine so I urge my colleagues to support the funding bill that was released yesterday that includes 47 billion dollars in assistance for Ukraine we talked about this before but it will support the military the civilians and the government in Ukraine as that country continues to fight off The Invasion I know these are significant Investments and we must be good stewards of taxpayer money and I'm very supportive of the accountability measures that are in that legislation that are very important the end use monitoring for our military equipment the fact that an American accounting firm Deloitte is there to ensure that the money is properly spent that the World Bank gives us regular reports and audits the funding this is significant and Ukraine by the way is for this transparency and we should be too but as we're good stewards of American taxpayer money let's also remember that Ukraine is fighting for all of us Ukraine is fighting for all of us and fighting for freedom and freedom is a worthy investment I yield back my time

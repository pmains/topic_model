thank you madam chair I'd like to begin just by giving the administrator a chance dance or anything that you didn't get to answer in the last question since you were being cut off repeatedly thank you I appreciate that you know first of all Obamacare has become affordable force unaffordable for so many families for the middle class they can't afford the premiums and if they're not getting a subsidy they have no alternative short term limited duration plans provide an alternative I was just talking to a family where you know the husband lost his job they have two kids in high school and they couldn't afford they couldn't afford premiums under Obamacare and so they looked at a short term limited duration plan it met their coverage needs they reviewed the benefits and felt like it was going to work for their family and so they were able to buy this plan you know these plans can be sixty percent lower than what's on the exchanges and so it gave them an alternative you know they may not need it for a long period of time but it's important that we have alternatives and absence of a solution we're trying to do something for the American people for the middle class Americans that can't afford Obamacare I want to say thank you I want to say thank you for your leadership I wanna thank you for say thank you for your commitment to making sure that we keep the promise especially to those on Medicare our seniors that are depending upon Medicare for those on Medicaid some of the most vulnerable in our our country I just want to say thanks for the work that you're doing I also applaud you for the work you're doing to ensure that we remain that we continue to lead the world in innovation and thinking of how we ensure that we have a healthcare system that is going to provide access and quality at an affordable price for everyone and I think the flexibility is so important I think that offering a variety of plans is so important to meet and individuals or families need particular needs certainly Medicare and Medicaid are critical safety nets and we we must keep fulfill the promise that we have made to those that are depending upon Medicare and Medicaid I am committed also to making sure that those with pre-existing conditions have the confidence and the certainty that they will always have quality access to quality and affordable healthcare I have a son with special needs with disabilities and I remember during the debate on Obamacare that I was I was concerned about the impact that it was going to have on those with disabilities within Medicaid according to the Kaiser Family Foundation they have reported that more than 450,000 individuals with developmental disabilities are on a waiting list today for Medicaid in this country 450,000 individuals with disabilities when I was when during the debate when I was when I said I'm concerned about people with disabilities being put on a waiting list for Medicaid I was laughed at today in Washington State 15,000 individuals with disabilities that are on a waiting list this is Washington state that expanded Medicaid to the to the furthest degree possible we have hundreds of thousands of people with disabilities that are waiting for care i co-chair the rural health coalition I have visited hospitals and health care facilities all throughout my district in eastern Washington it's hate heartbreaking when I hear from providers and hospitals are having trouble keeping their doors open because of the low reimbursement rates and the high populations of Medicare and Medicaid so Washington states at the highest level 130 percent of federal poverty level are covered under Medicaid the income threshold is even higher for children at two hundred and ten percent of the federal poverty level we need to make sure that we are protecting current beneficiaries because they need to have that certainty I wanted to ask you could you just talk to me about CMS and what you are doing to track those that are on waiting lists and how do we ensure that the populations some of the most vulnerable in our communities are actually getting the care that we have prom to them well I share your commitment to the vulnerable populations in the Medicaid program many of these individuals have no place to turn and Medicare is a vital safety net that is so critical to improving their lives the quality of care and their day-to-day lives one of the things that we're very concerned about is program integrity within the Medicaid program we're seeing some alarming data that that is showing that states aren't necessarily putting the right people on the program and that we have some high cases and problematic eligibility systems that are putting people on the program that don't belong and so we'll be taking action to make sure that we can ensure that the people on the program actually belong on the program because if we don't do that we're failing taxpayer the lady

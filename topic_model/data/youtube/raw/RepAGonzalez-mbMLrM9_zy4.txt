hello everybody Anthony Gonzalez here with another weekly update busy week here in DC but a very productive one so first an update on the battlefield cross bill I testified in front of the the Veterans Affairs Committee last week on it and this week we were happy to see it receive a markup and it passed unanimously out of committee so the next step there is for it to go to the House floor and then hopefully for it to marry with the Senate and and then ultimately signed into law I'm actually very hopeful about this right now last time the battlefield cross bill was introduced it didn't get a committee vote and so we've actually passed that point which is a great step and very excited about that so good good things to report on that front secondly we are going to name the post office in North Canton after Annie Dryden so Annie served in the Marines in Iraq and died on on our country's behalf and and so we want to pay tribute to her and her family and her sacrifice on behalf of our nation and us and so so we're excited to introduce that that's usually non-controversial I don't suspect there'll be any issues with that and so we'll hopefully get that done in the near future as well third thing I want to update on now we got a briefing classified briefing on the raid that killed al-baghdadi the the former Isis leader now deceased Isis leader can't get into the specifics obviously it was an Intel briefing and was classified but what I will say is that every single person in this country should be unbelievably proud of our Special Forces the the briefing we got was comprehensive we ought to actually see some of the videos and understand how they plan the attack and how they approached how the compound and what they did afterwards and the role of of the dogs and all those sorts of things and just incredible just absolutely incredible so to our special forces and to everybody who was a part of that or who has ever served boy we really owe you a debt of gratitude so and fantastic stuff and was really proud of our troops in that one and everybody involved and then finally obviously we had the impeachment inquiry vote I voted no on that I've spoken about it a few different times we released a statement earlier in the week I'd refer you to that but it at a very basic level and much to add beyond it but at a basic level I had the process from day one has been wildly insufficient and and unfair frankly I'm on a committee of jurisdiction I'm not even allowed in the room and so as somebody who's supposed to be looking at it but being shut out entirely from the process I can't possibly support that and so with that thanks as always for allowing me to be a representative and have a great weekend

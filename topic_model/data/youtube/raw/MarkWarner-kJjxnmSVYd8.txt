SHANNON? >> Shannon: WE WILL HAVE MORE ON THAT WITH THE PANEL COMING AT. LUCAS TOMLINSON, THANK YOU. JOINING IS NOW, DEMOCRATIC SENATOR MARK WARNER. THIS WEEK, YOU HAVE A HEARING ON WORLD BY THREAT ASSESSMENTS. YOU WILL HAVE THE DIRECTOR OF THE CIA THERE. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNING ABOUT CHINA ON MULTIPLE FRONTS. DO YOU THINK THAT WE HAVE LOST? >> I THINK PROLONGED TIME. CONVENTIONAL WISDOM WAS, THE MORE YOU BRING CHINA INTO THE WORLD ORDER, THE MOTHER GOING TO CHANGE. THAT ASSUMPTION WAS JUST PLAIN WRONG. CHINA EVEN CHANGE THEIR LAWS IN 2016 TO MAKE IT EXPLICITLY CLEAR THAT EVERY COMPANY IN CHINA, THEIR FIRST OBLIGATION IS TO THE COMMUNIST PARTY. SO WE HAVE NEVER HAD A POTENTIAL ADVERSARY LIKE CHINA. THE SOVIET UNION, RUSSIA, WAS MILITARY AND IDEOLOGICAL. CHINA IS INVESTING IN AREAS, THEY HAVE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THEFT, AND WE ARE COMPETING NOT JUST ON A NATIONAL SECURITY BASIS BUT ON THE TECHNOLOGY BASIS. THAT'S WHY NATIONAL SECURITY NOW INCLUDES TELECOMMUNICATIONS, SATELLITES, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, QUANTUM COMPUTING. EACH OF THESE DOMAINS, WE HAVE TO MAKE THE KIND OF INVESTMENTS TO STAY AHEAD. I THINK WE ARE STARTING THAT IN A BIPARTISAN WAY. WE ARE TRYING TO BRING SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING BACK, WE HAVE KICKED HUAWEI OUT OF OUR TELECOM SYSTEMS. THIS WEEK I HAVE A BROAD BIPARTISAN BILL I AM LAUNCHING WITH MY FRIEND JOHN SOON, THE REPUBLICAN LEAD. IN TERMS OF FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY COMING TO AMERICA, WE HAVE GOT TO HAVE A SYSTEMIC APPROACH TO MAKE SURE WE CAN BAN OR PROHIBIT IT WHEN NECESSARY. >> Shannon: DOES THAT MEAN TIKTOK? >> Senator Warner: TIKTOK IS ONE OF THE POTENTIALS. YOU HAVE 100 MILLION AMERICANS ON TIKTOK, 90 MINUTES A DAY. EVEN YOU GUYS WOULD LIKE THAT KIND OF RETURN, 90 MINUTES A DAY. THEY ARE TAKING DATA FROM AMERICANS, NOT KEEPING IT SAFE, BUT WHAT WORRIES ME MORE WITH TIKTOK'S THIS COULD BE A PROPAGANDA TOOL. SO THE KIND OF VIDEOS YOU SEE WOULD PROMOTE IDEOLOGICAL ISSUES. IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT TIKTOK CHOSE TO THE CHINESE KIDS, WHICH IS ALL ABOUT SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING, VERSUS WHAT OUR KIDS SEE, IS A RADICAL DIFFERENCE. >> Shannon: WE WILL WATCH THAT, BECAUSE THAT'S A BIPARTISAN OFFERING POTENTIALLY THIS WEEK. THIS PAST WEEK WE GOT INFORMATION, IT WAS REVEALED THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY AND FBI BELIEVE THE ORIGINS OF COVID WERE MOST LIKELY A LEAK FROM THE WUHAN INSTITUTE FOR VIROLOGY. EARLY ON THIS WAS CALLED A CONSPIRACY THEORY, THAT YOU ARE RACIST IF HE TALKED ABOUT IT. THE SENATE HAS UNANIMOUSLY PASSED A MEASURE THAT WOULD CALL ON THIS ADMINISTRATION TO DECLASSIFY INFORMATION WE HAVE ABOUT THE ORIGINS. WHITE HOUSE WON'T SAY WHETHER THE PRESIDENT WILL VETO IT OR NOT. WORLDWIDE, DO PEOPLE NOT HAVE A RIGHT TO SEE THAT INFORMATION? >> Senator Warner: HERE IS AGAIN AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT WE ARE DEALING WITH, WITH THE COMMUNIST PARTY IN CHINA. IF THIS VIRUS HAD ORIGINATED VIRTUALLY ANYWHERE ELSE, WE WOULD HAVE HAD WORLD SCIENTISTS THEY ARE. THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY HAS BEEN TOTALLY OPAQUE ABOUT LETTING AN OUTSIDE SCIENTIST TO FIGURE THIS OUT. USE OF SOME PARTS OF THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY THAT THINK IT ORIGINATED IN A WET MARKET, OTHER SAYING IT COULD HE GOTTEN OUT FROM A LAB, ALTHOUGH I WOULD SAY THAT ONE ENTITY SAYS IT CAME FROM ONE LAUGH AND 1 CENT FROM ANOTHER. AT THE END OF THE DAY, WE NEED TO KEEP LOOKING AND WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE, IN TERMS OF FUTURE PANDEMICS, THAT WE CAN HAVE ACCESS TO THE SOURCE OF WHERE THESE DISEASES ORIGINATE A LOT EARLIER ON IN THE SYSTEM. THREE AND HALF LATER, WE STILL DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO WUHAN. >> Shannon: THEY'RE NOT GOING TO COOPERATE ESPECIALLY IF THEY ASSESS INTERNALLY THEY WERE AT FAULT. HOW DO THEY PAY FOR THIS? BILLIONS OR TRILLIONS IN DAMAGES, MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF LIVES. HOW DO THEY PAY? >> Senator Warner: THIS IS WHERE WE NEED THAT UNITED FRONT OF COUNTRIES ALL AROUND THE WORLD, THAT THERE HAS TO BE CONSEQUENCES. POTENTIALLY IN TERMS OF SANCTIONS, ONE OF THE REASONS WHY, IF CHINA MOVES FORWARD TO SUPPORT RUSSIA AND UKRAINE, I CAN'T UNDERSTAND SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO ARE WILLING TO SAY, "I DON'T REALLY CARE ABOUT UKRAINE, BUT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT CHINA." WELL, CHINA AND RUSSIA COMMITTEES AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES, ARE LINKED, AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE PUTIN IS NOT SUCCESSFUL IN UKRAINE AND THAT XI DOESN'T FURTHER HIS EXPANSION PLANS AROUND TAIWAN. >> Shannon: WE KNOW THAT EVEN IF THEY ARE NOT SELLING BULLETS TO RUSSIA, THEY ARE BUYING UP COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF OIL, AND DUAL USE PRODUCTS THAT CAN BE USED ON THE BATTLEFIELD. XI DOESN'T SEEM VERY WORRIED ABOUT THE WARNINGS FROM THE U.S. AT THIS POINT. THEY HAVEN'T ACKNOWLEDGED OR APOLOGIZED FOR THE BALLOON THAT WENT ACROSS AMERICA, WE THINK CAPTURING AMERICAN INFORMATION AS IT WENT. IT IS XI AFRAID OF THIS DEMONSTRATION? TO OUR WARNINGS MEAN ANYTHING? >> Senator Warner: I THINK, AS PUTIN THOUGHT, WITH THE INVASION OF THE UKRAINE, THAT THE WEST WITH HER THE THE TOWEL. THE FACT THAT YOU'VE GOT THE GERMAN CHANCELLOR IN THIS PAST WEEK, THE FACT THAT WE'VE GOT NATIONS LIKE FINLAND AND SWEDEN TRYING TO JOIN NATO. I THINK PUTIN MADE A MAJOR MISS CALCULATION AND I DO THINK XI IS WATCHING THE WEST STAND UP AGAINST PUTIN AND IS TAKING SOME LESSONS FROM THAT. >> Shannon: YOU'RE JUST BACK FROM INDIA AMONG MANY OTHER COUNTRIES HE VISITED. THEY ABSTAINED FROM THE VOTE THAT CONDEMNED RUSSIA'S INVASION OF UKRAINE AND CALLED FOR AN END TO THIS. HOW IMPORTANT IS IT, A CRITICAL PLACE LIKE INDIA, THAT THEY CHOOSE A SIDE? >> Senator Warner: INDIA IS A GREAT NATION. I AM CHAIR OF THE INDIA CAUCUS AND I'M A BIG SUPPORTER OF INDIA. INDIA IS NOW A MAJOR POWER, FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD AND A PLACE WHERE REMARKABLE THINGS ARE HAPPENING. MY MESSAGE FOR THE INDIANS HAS BEEN, WE UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE HISTORIC TIES TO RUSSIA AND HE STILL GET A LOT OF YOUR ARMS, BUT YOU CANNOT BE A WORLD LEADER AND ATTEMPT TO BE A MORAL WORLD LEADER WITHOUT PICKING ASIDE. IN THIS CASE I THINK THE YOUNGER INDIANS GET THAT. SOME OF THE OLDER GENERATION, WE STILL HAVE WORK TO DO. >> Shannon: LET'S CONTINUE TO FUNDING FOR UKRAINE. ANOTHER $400 MILLION WAS ANNOUNCED ON FRIDAY. THERE ARE QUESTIONS, THERE'LL BE MORE REQUESTS FROM CONGRESS NO DOUBT IN THE COMING WEEKS ABOUT THAT. WHILE THERE IS STRONG SUPPORT, HERE ACROSS THE U.S. AND ACROSS THE WEST, IT'S PULLING BACK A LITTLE BIT. HERE'S THE REALITY FROM ANALYSTS. FUNDING FOR THE UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT HAS NOT DEMANDED ANY TOUGH BUREAUCRATIC TRADE-OFFS BETWEEN FUNDING PRIORITIES. IT'S NOT REQUIRING BOUNCING NEEDS AGAINST A MYSTIC SPENDING. WE HAVE HIT OUR CEILING, WE HAVE SOME KIND OF NEGOTIATION THAT HAS TO HAPPEN VERY SHORTLY. THERE ARE COMPETING NEEDS AND THEY ARE VERY REAL, SO WHERE DO WE ASSESS OUR FINANCIAL COMMITMENT? >> LET'S LOOK AT THIS. WE HAVE ALLOCATED $113 BILLION TO UKRAINE. WE HAVE ACTUALLY ONLY GIVEN THEM ACTUALLY LESS THAN HALF OF THAT, AND ON THE MILITARY SIDE, ABOUT $30 BILLION. WE STILL HAVE SOME RUNWAY TO GO. BUT I THINK WE NEED TO KEEP THAT COMMITMENT, AND THE TRUTH IS THE RUSSIAN ARMY IS BEING CHEWED UP BY THE UKRAINIANS. WE SPENT $800 BILLION A YEAR ON DEFENSE, AND MOST OF MY LIFETIME TO PREVENT RUSSIA FROM EXPLAINING THAT. WE ARE HAVING UKRAINIANS DO THAT RIGHT NOW, IN A SENSE, I THINK WE NEED TO CONTINUE THAT. I THINK WE WILL SEE THE VAST MAJORITY OF MEMBERS OF CONGRESS IN BOTH PARTIES. THERE ARE SOME LOUDMOUTHS ON BOTH SIDES THAT ARE PULLING BACK. BUT IF WE ARE GOING TO KEEP THIS COMPETITION AGAINST RUSSIA AND CHINA, PUTIN CANNOT BE SUCCESSFUL. AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE TO REALIZE AS WE LOOK AT CHINA THAT NATIONAL SECURITY IS NO LONGER SIMPLY TANKS AND TRUCKS AND GUNS AND SHIPS. IT'S ALSO TELECOM AND AI AND QUANTUM COMPUTING AND ADVANCED SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY. WE HAVE TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN THOSE DOMAINS, AS WELL, WHICH IS BOTH AN ECONOMIC INVESTMENT AND A NATIONAL SECURITY INVESTMENT. >> Shannon: SPEAKING MESSAGE OF NATIONAL SECURITY INTERESTS, THIS IS GETTING LOST IN ALL THE OTHER FOREIGN POLICY HEADLINES, BUT BASICALLY WHAT THE INTERNAL INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY TOLD US IS THAT THEY HAVE HIT 84% AS FAR AS ENRICHING URANIUM. THEY SAID THAT THE 90% THAT YOU WOULD NEED FOR A WEAPON. BRITAIN, FRANCE, AND GERMANY SAY THEY WANT TO CENSURE IRAN OVER THIS. THE U.S. IS HESITANT, THE REPORTING IS THAT THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION DOES WANT TO GO THERE. ARE WE SOFT ON IRAN'S NEW PROGRAM THEN EUROPE? >> Senator Warner: I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT. WE HAVE MADE IT EXPLICITLY CLEAR -- AND I WAS JUST IN ISRAEL RECENTLY WITH A GROUP OF SENATORS -- THAT WE AGREE WITH ISRAEL. IRAN CANNOT BE A NUCLEAR POWER. I THINK THAT HAS BEEN OUR POLICY AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE OUR POLICY. THERE ARE TWO STEPS IN THIS PROCESS, WHEN IS THE ENRICHMENT ISSUE, AND I BELIEVE YOU WILL BE TOUGHER THAN THE EUROPEANS. WE HISTORICALLY ALWAYS HAVE -- >> Shannon: THEN WHY ARE WE CENSURING, REPORTEDLY? >> Senator Warner: HAVE ALREADY SANCTIONED AND CENSURED MORE IRANI AND COMPANIES BY FAR THAN OUR EUROPEAN FRIENDS. THERE WAS ALSO QUESTION ON DELIVERY SYSTEMS. OUR ISRAELI FRIENDS ARE FOLLOWING THIS VERY CLOSELY. AGAIN, WE WILL NOT ALLOW IRAN TO BECOME A NUCLEAR POWER. >> Shannon: I'VE GOT TO HIT THE SAVANNAH SYNDROME. THE REPORTING THIS WEEK, AND ASSESSMENT FROM SEVERAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES THAT THEY DON'T THINK -- THEY THINK IT'S UNLIKELY THERE WAS A FOREIGN ADVERSARY CARRYING OUT THESE ATTACKS, WHATEVER THEY WEAR IT, WHERE IT DIPLOMATS OR INTEL OFFICERS AROUND THE WORLD HAVE SUFFERED REALLY DEBILITATING SYMPTOMS FROM THIS. SENATOR RUBIO, YOUR COLLEAGUE COME I TWEETED THIS. "THE CIA TOOK HIS INVESTIGATION OF HAVANA SYNDROME SERIOUSLY, BUT WHEN YOU READ ABOUT THE DEVASTATING INJURIES, IT'S HARD TO EXCEPT THAT IT WAS BY A/C UNITS AND LOUD CICADAS." SEE TO ANYONE WHO GOT SICK, WHATEVER THE SOURCE WAS, WHETHER THEY ARE CIA, DOD, STATE PERMIT OFFICIALS, WE OF THAN THE WORLD'S BEST HEALTH CARE AND WE ARE PROVIDING THAT NOW. FRANKLY, UNDER THE LAST ADMINISTRATION HIM A LITTLE ISSUE WAS SWEPT UNDER THE RUG. WE ARE NOW BEING SURE THAT HEALTH CARE IS PROVIDED. I KNOW HOW EXTENSIVE INVESTIGATIONS HAVE BEEN, AND I'VE MADE VERY CLEAR TO THEM, IF THEY NEED TO CONTINUE THAT INVESTIGATION, IF NEW FACTS COME TO LIGHT, THEY OUGHT TO PURSUE THAT. BUT AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME, I KNOW HOW THOROUGH THEY HAVE BEEN, AND THEY HAVE NOT FOUND THE EVIDENCE THAT I THINK PERHAPS THEY THOUGHT THEY WOULD HAVE FOUND. WE'VE GOT TO FOLLOW THE FACTS. AT THE END OF THE DAY THAT'S WHAT WE OWE THE MEMBERS OF THIS INTEL COMMUNITY, TO PROTECT OUR NATION, AND THAT MEANS HEALTH CARE. IF IT ENDS UP WITH SOME OTHER SOURCE

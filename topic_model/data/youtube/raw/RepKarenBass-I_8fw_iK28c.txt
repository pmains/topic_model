the ongoing still being told story of police violence against people of color in this country is a story that largely gets told in terms of the individual lives lost the individual police officers involved the individual court cases that have or haven't been brought against them but even though this story gets told case-by-case police killing by police killing the national movement that has risen up around this has inspired some federal lawmakers to try to address this systemically on a national level right now there is a bill pending in the senate that would dramatically change how policing happens all over the country it's a bill called the george floyd justice and policing act and it passed the house in march on a mostly party line vote mostly because one republican did vote for it though he later said he only voted for it by accident inspiring the bill among other things would require body cams it would ban military equipment for police use it would ban no knock warrants it would end the kinds of special legal protections that police officers have used in court to avoid accountability for excessive use of force and a lot more like i said this bill has already passed out of the house the lead house sponsor of this bill congresswoman karen bass of california says she is now working with democratic senator cory booker and republican senator tim scott to try to pass that bill in the senate and today more than any other time in the past it feels like there may be momentum to actually do this joining us now congresswoman karen bass of california she's the former chair of the congressional black caucus she is the lead sponsor of the george floyd justice and policing act congresswoman bass it's pleasure to see you thanks for making time tonight thank you let me just ask you about the verdict today and how much focus turned very quickly toward your bill being the next potential step that we could take nationwide to make a real change um a lot of people talking about that today state level leaders faith leaders members of the floyd family national leaders saying this is the thing that we could do to really make a difference well absolutely because we see case after case and then there's word that another case happened today so clearly we have to do something to transform policing in the united states i have been watching this and have been involved in this issue for decades and it's terrible that it took the world witnessing the torture and murder of an individual to bring about this type of change but i do feel like we're on the cusp of doing that so i am hopeful today i don't know what i would have done if the verdict had turned out wrong but it didn't and so i am hoping that the measure of hope that we all got today will be enough to get us over the finish line and put a bill on president biden's desk i want to ask about the focus in the bill and the bill has a lot of different components but there is a focus on police officers getting training around things like implicit bias one of the things that i found just disheartening about watching the chauvin trial was the focus over the course of the trial on just how much training he had had how many hundreds of hours of training that he had had and of course that played a role in the decision by the jury to decide whether or not he was following his training when he killed mr floyd but i wonder if there is if if there is reason to feel hopeful that some sort of different focus and training some sort of national standards in training um could make a difference in real life and not just on paper well i mean i think it has to i mean you also have to take into consideration what is the type of training he received i mean the woman that killed dante wright had been on the service had been on the force for 26 years after 26 years don't you know the difference between a taser and a gun so you know i would raise a question as to what is the type and quality of training and you raised a key issue there are no national standards we have eighteen thousand police departments around the country no national standards which is why chokeholds is okay one place and another place it isn't no knock warrants are okay you need to have standardized uh accreditation and and and pro testing for officers we want policing to be like most other professions that have national standards that have accountability and so when we looked at derek chavin look at the camera when he was torturing george floyd he did it with complete impunity because he didn't think anything was going to happen we need to take that away which is why qualified immunity is really important and why we have to lower the standards to prosecute officers so we won't see case after case that aren't even prosecuted congresswoman bass in the senate there is this reconciliation budget reconciliation process that allows for some legislation to get around a filibuster from the republican minority in the senate if something is perceived as having perceived by the parliamentarian to have a budget consequence it can be passed through reconciliation if there aren't going to be 60 votes the democrats could conceivably pass even some of this legislation by by that reconciliation process i'm thinking specifically about the provision in your bill that would ban the transfer of military equipment to police office police equipments police departments around the country are you thinking about some of those strategic factors in terms of how this might be able to pass in the senate well no what we're trying to do is to come to a bipartisan agreement i don't know if you could pull out a section of the bill and see if you could do it through budget reconciliation we haven't considered that but we have been having bipartisan discussion uh you you noted the two leads in the senate tim scott and cory booker and so we do believe that we can reach a point where we will get 60 votes uh in the senate congresswoman karen bass of california uh lead sponsor of the george foreign justice and policing act which has already passed the house it's great to see you congresswoman thank you for your time tonight thank you

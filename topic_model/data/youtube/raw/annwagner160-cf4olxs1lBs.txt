miss Wagner for five minutes I thank the chair for yielding dodd-frank must be very clear created a world in which size equals survival the Democrats law reduced competition in the banking sector it imposed barriers to entry for de novo or new charter banks and saddled financial institutions with approximately 400 new requirements that hit small midsize and regional banks particularly hard in short dodd-frank concentrated more risk in the nation's largest institutions and incentivized them to be as large as they are today that is the direct result of dodd-frank I have some questions some yes or no for both of you we'll do a little rapid-fire here and there'll be an opportunity for you to elaborate also gentlemen mr. King and mr. Rogers is there sufficient competition in banking yes or no yes yes what about among community and mid-sized institutions sufficient competition miss King yes now you can elaborate a little bit how has competition mr. King changed since dodd-frank and what would competition look like a decade from now representatives that is an excellent question and competition has changed dramatically since dodd-frank and it's primarily around the dramatic changes in technology our world is changing really really fast we all see that through and other changes in the retail industry and other industries it is profoundly changing our industry as I said in my opening statement historically for most of my careers in banking if you had a good branch friendly touch type of relationship with your clients that was satisfactory that is no longer okay today you have to have huge investments in technology to meet the requirements of consumers which is real-time satisfaction mr. Rogers briefly could you Robert thank you I would say also the competition is not only from banks so the competition has come from fin tech companies from a variety of different different outlets of the ability to compete as mr. King described from a technology standpoint at a service standpoint it's not just banks it's the field of competition is expanding quite significantly no competition has changes most particularly for community and mid-sized institutions in your industry broadly mr. King what effect has dodd-frank had on community and regional banks representative I believe dodd-frank broadly speaking has increased the requirements in terms of all our activities that has increased our cost there are many aspects I should quickly say that are very good about dodd-frank so I'm not ridiculing the entire bill I'm saying that it did in fact increase our cause and and what kind of effects did just have as a result on consumers effect on consumers representative is to cause the process to be more burdensome in terms of time and requirement and documentation in many cases especially in the mortgage area and as a result of that it drives up our calls and in some cases that causes basilar mr. Rogers I think representative that there are many things of dodd-frank that were positive for our industry in terms of elements like stress test and building more capital in the banking system which makes us much more solid today than we were pre pre crisis hmm are consumers better off now than they were 10 years ago consumer mr. king representative I would say in some cases they are and in some cases they're not mr. Odgers representative in some cases I believe consumers are having much more access to technology and I think the reasons we're here to talk about this merger is to be able to invest in the type of activities that will benefit consumers going forward that's what I care about benefit in the cost to consumers and to those consumers at Aaron Missouri second congressional district what do you believe briefly in my time I have left are some of the greatest issues facing regional banks today mr. Rogerson I think some of the greatest issues facing are related to cyber threats being able to invest and keep up being able to invest and keep up with the largest banks in the country to be competitive from product and service and capabilities mr. king I would say according to even mr. Roger sovereigns number one very much related is having the skill to be able to invest into technology to be able to provide the scale did you say the scale so sighs sadly is equaling survival I yield back thank

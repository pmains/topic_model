THE PRESIDING OFFICER: THE SENATOR FROM DELAWARE. MR. CARPER: MR. PRESIDENT, NORMALLY AT THIS TIME OF THE WEEK SENATOR CAPITO AND I ARE GATHERING IN FOR A FACE-TO-FACE MEETING OR MAYBE HAVING A MEETING BY PHONE AS SHE HEADS BACK TO WEST VIRGINIA. TODAY IT LOOKED LIKE WE WEREN'T GOING TO HAVE A CHANCE TO MEET, BUT HERE WE ARE. IRONICALLY MOST OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS WE HAVE ARE, WE'RE LIKE IN SYNC. MOST FOLKS AROUND THE COUNTRY PROBABLY THINK WE NEVER AGREE ON ANYTHING HERE, BUT P WE DO, AND WE ACTUALLY TURN OUT TO BE PRETTY GOOD FRIENDS. A COUPLE OF WEST VIRGINIA KIDE . IT'S ALWAYS A PLEASURE TO SERVE WITH HER. THE RIGHT TO BIPARTISAN INFRASTRUCTURE LEGISLATION. LAST WEEK WE WERE HERE TO PASS NOT ONE, NOT TWO, BUT THREE BIPARTISAN PIECES OF LEGISLATION, A COUPLE OF THEM PRETTY BIG. RECYCLING BILLS, ANOTHER ONE DEALING WITH THE WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT FOR THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS. WE HAD ONE NEGATIVE VOTE ON THE ARMY CORPS OF -- ONE. THE RECYCLING LEGISLATION, ONE OF WHICH WAS YOURILILL, I THINK ONE WAS MINE, AND WE WERE COSPONSORS ALL TOGETHER. WE HAD NO OPPOSITION ON THOSE BILLS. I WOULD SAY TO FOLKS WHO WATCH AND SAY THERE THEY GO AGAIN, YOU SHOULD HAVE TUNED IN LAST WEEK BECAUSE WE WERE ON THE SAME PAGE. HAVING SAID THAT, LET ME SAY THAT I RISE TODAY TO SPEAK ON A JOINT RESOLUTION OF DISAPPROVAL TO NULLIFY PRESIDENT BIDEN'S NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT REGULATIONS OFTENTIMES REFERRED TO AS NEPA, N-E-P-A. LAST YEAR AS WE DRAFTEDDED LEGISLATION THAT BECAME THE BIPARTISAN INFRASTRUCTURE LAW FOR OUR COUNTRY, SENATOR CAPITO AND I ALONG WITH OUR COLLEAGUES ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE, TO WHICH MY COLLEAGUE FROM ALASKA IS A VALUED MEMBER, AND SENATOR -- HE'S HERE AND HE'S OFFERED THIS, HAS OFFERED THIS RESOLUTION TODAY AND WILL BE BACK HERE IN A MINUTE, I'M SURE. BUT AS WE DRAFTED LEGISLATION, IT BECAME THE BIPARTISAN INFRASTRUCTURE LAW, SENATOR CAPITO AND I ALONG WITH COLLEAGUES ON THE EPW COMMITTEE CONSIDERED WAYS TO GET INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS DONE MORE EFFICIENTLY WHILE MAINTAINING EIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS. I'LL SAY THAT AGAIN. WE CONSIDERED A NUMBER OF WAYS TO GET INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS DONE MORE EFFICIENTLY WHILE MAINTAINING ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS. WE INCLUDED SEVERAL CHANGES THAT WERE REFLECTIVE OF THOSE SHARED GOALS. IN FACT, WE INCLUDED QUITE A FEW OF THOSE CHANGES. FOR EXAMPLE, I'LL GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF ONE OF THOSE, MR. PRESIDENT. THE BIPARTISAN INFRASTRUCTURE LAW CODIFIED SOMETHING THAT IS CALLED ONE FEDERAL DECISION, ONE FEDERAL DECISION PREVENTING STRUCTURE. IT SET A GOAL FOR COMPLETING ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS OF TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS WITHIN TWO YEARS, WITHIN TWO YEARS. IT ALSO AUTHORIZED THE FEDERAL PERMITTING IMPROVEMENT STEERING COUNCIL. BUT AS WE CONSIDER CHANGES TO THE WAY WE DELIVER INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS, WE ALWAYS TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE NOT UNDERMINING IMPORTANT ENVIRONMENTAL SAFEGUARDS. THAT SENTIMENT REFLECTS REALLY THE ESSENCE OF THE LAW THAT WE CALL NEPA. OVER 50 YEARS AGO, PRESIDENT RICHARD NIXON, A REPUBLICAN AS YOU'LL RECALL, SIGNED THIS BEDROCK ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY INTO LAW WITH OVERWHELMING BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. IN THE TIME SINCE THEN, NEPA HAS HELPED TO ENSURE THAT FEDERAL ACTIONS PROTECT OUR QUALITY OF LIFE AND AVOID COSTLY ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. NEPA IS NOT JUST A MEANS OF PROTECTING RESOURCES AND CONSERVING PRISTINE ENVIRONMENT. NEPA ALSO HELPS TO IMPROVE FEDERAL DECISIONS. HOW IS THAT? BY REQUIRING AGENCIES TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT THE IMPACTS OF THEIR AGENCIES BEFORE THEY MAKE DECISIONS. BEFORE THEY MAKE THE DECISIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, THROUGH THEIR NEPA PROCESS, JUST A FEW YEARS AGO OFFICIALS IN COLORADO -- HERE'S A GOOD EXAMPLE. OFFICIALS IN COLORADO HEARD ROBUST PUBLIC FEEDBACK WHEN PLANNING IMPROVEMENTS ON STATE HIGHWAY NUMBER 9. THAT LED THEM TO TAKE STEPS TO MINIMIZE DISTURBANCES TO COMMUNITIES AND TO THE ENVIRONMENT. THE FINAL PROJECT WAS ULTIMATELY DELIVERED WITH LOWER EMISSIONS, LESS HARM TO WILDFIRE -- WILDLIFE AND SAFER SPACE FOR CYCLISTS. THESE CHANGES DID NOT COME AT THE COST OF EFFICIENCY. THE PROJECT WAS DONE ON TIME AND UNDER BUDGET. THIS IS ONLY ONE OF ANY NUMBER OF EXAMPLES THAT I COULD CITE TODAY. MAKING SMART DECISIONS HAS NEVER BEEN MORE IMPORTANT. AFTER ALL, THE SCIENCE IS CLEAR WE MUST RAPIDLY DRIVE DOWN GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IF WE HOPE TO AVOID THE WORST IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. UNFORTUNATELY, THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION MADE CHANGES TO THE NEPA RULES. THESE CHANGES PREVENTED AGENCIES FROM CONSIDERING HOW THEIR ACTIONS IMPACT CLIMATE CHANGE. AND FROM TAKING COMMONSENSE STEPS TO MINIMIZE ENVIRONMENTAL HARM. THE REGULATORY ROLLBACK ALSO UNDERMINED PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT IN THE FEDERAL DECISION-MAKING PROCESS. THIS ROLLBACK HARMED COMMUNITIES OF COLOR, INCLUDING TRIBAL AND NATIVE ALASKAN COMMUNITIES THAT RELY ON NEPA TO DEFEND THEIR VOICES. FORTUNATELY THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION HAS TAKEN STEPS TO FIX THE ERROR OF THESE REGULATORY PROVISIONS, AND UNDER PRESIDENT BIDEN'S INSTRUCTION THE COUNCIL ON ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY FINALIZED A RULE IN APRIL TO MAKE A NARROW, TARGETED CHANGE TO NEPA REGULATIONS. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CHANGES WAS RESTORING THE REQUIREMENT FOR AGENCIES TO CONSIDER THE CUMULATIVE AND INDIRECT IMPACT OF THEIR ACTIONS. CONSIDERING SUCH ACTIONS -- CONSIDERING SUCH IMPACTS, RATHER, CAN HELP ENSURE WE AVOID ACTIONS THAT WORSEN CLIMATE CHANGE AND NEGATIVELY IMPACT COMMUNITIES. PRESIDENT BIDEN'S NEPA RULE WOULD ENSURE THAT AGENCIES CONDUCT ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROCESS IN A COMMONSENSE, HOLISTIC MANNER, ONE THAT NEITHER SACRIFICES EFFICIENCY FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION NOR THE OTHER WAY AROUND. THIS ACTION COMES AT A CRITICAL TIME FOR OUR NATION. THE BIPARTISAN INFRASTRUCTURE LAW WILL FUND MORE THAN $1 TRILLION OF INVESTMENTS IN PROJECTS THAT WILL LAST NOT FOR YEARS, BUT FOR DECADES AND MAYBE EVEN LONGER. I BELIEVE THE DECISION HERE IS CLEAR. THE PROJECT UNDER, PROJECTS UNDER REVIEW TODAY WILL EITHER HELP ADDRESS THE CLIMATE CRISIS AND PROTECT COMMUNITIES OR THEY'LL EXACERBATE EMISSIONS AND MAKE US MORE VULNERABLE. WE CAN BUILD NEW FACILITIES THAT ARE LESS EMISSION INTENSIVE. WE CAN BUILD HIGHWAY AND BRIDGES TO WITHSTAND THE KIND OF EXTREME WEATHER WE'RE EXPERIENCING ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY. IN FACT, ALL OVER THE PLANET. AND WE CAN SAVE MONEY WHILE WE DO IT WITH INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S BUILT TO LAST. BLOCKING THESE REGULATIONS FROM TAKING EFFECT IS THE POLICY EQUIVALENT OF BURYING OUR HEADS IN THE SAND. AND UNFORTUNATELY WITH THE SEA-LEVEL RISING AROUND US, AND IT IS, DURING THE COURSE OF DEBATE ON THIS ONE PROPOSAL TODAY, WE'RE GOING TO SEE IN THE STATE OF LOUISIANA, WHERE THEY HAVE TERRIBLE SEA-LEVEL RISES GOING ON, EVERY MINUTE THEY LOSE A PIECE OF LAND THE SIZE OF A FOOTBALL FIELD, AND DURING THIS DEBATE ALONE THEY WILL LOSE A LOT MORE FOOTBALL FIELDS IN THE DAYS TO COME. RESUMING -- THIS WILL NOT -- IT WILL NOT SAVE THE LIVES BEING LOST, IT WILL NOT STOP ASPHALTS FROM MELTING UNDER EXTREME HEAT WHICH WAS HAPPENING IN ENGLAND AND OVER AT THE TOUR DE FRANCE, TENS OF GALLONS OF WATER HAD TO BE SPILLED ON THE COURSE THEY ARE RUNNING THE BICYCLE RACE. LITERALLY TENS OF THOUSANDS OF GALLONS ON THE COURSE. BY ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE NOW, -- IF WE DON'T ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE, IT WILL COST US NOT JUST IN DOLLARS, BUT IN LIVES. I URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO VOTE ON THIS WELL-INTENTIONED RESOLUTION. IT IS A PRIVILEGE TO WORK WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM ALASKA AND WE BOTH WORE THE UNIFORM OF OUR COUNTRY FOR MANY YEARS, MARINE CORPS, NAVY SALUTES MARINE CORPS TODAY. WHILE I CAN'T BE WIT

i have been grateful to have worked with many of you and our organizations over the years on the paws act be heard act and most recently securing nearly a hundred million dollars to house homeless db victims including 43 million dollars in new funding we celebrate these successes but we know there is much more to do and the pandemic has provided even more challenges to addressing the issues of domestic and intimate partner violence i look forward to continuing our partnership as we work together to create healthier and safer future for our communities and i am excited to be joined by an incredible panel of experts and advocates on domestic and intimate partner violence we have laura van zant from reach cecia sanchez from casa myrna katya santiago sorry santiago taylor from barc hema sarang saminsky from jane doe and jesse senwa of transition house so we are going to start today uh by hearing from my friend laura vanzant laura has worked as an executive director for reach beyond domestic violence since october of 2004. in this role she is responsible for all aspects of operating a multi-service domestic violence agency providing emergency services and community education the agency has more than doubled in size in the last decade currently operating with 20 full and part-time staff reach provides assistance to over 6 000 people each year with direct services and education laura we will try to begin on a positive note could you share where you think you have seen the most growth on this issue and where do you think we have the most work to do thank you so much for joining us thank you congresswoman clark i'm really a pleasure to be here with you um especially after hearing you talk this morning to the local chambers and um with all of my colleagues um i think probably in the 15 16 years that i've been doing this one of the things that i've appreciated on my own learning curve is how this work has continued to evolve from a responsive structure a an emergency structure to one that is really committed to fostering the change that i think all of us are committed to i think each and every one of us get into this work because we are looking to make change in the world and we do that work alongside all the life-saving and life-changing work that's uh happening every day i'm excited about a lot of the efforts that are happening in communities organizing around this issue i'm also excited to see a lot of the thoughtfulness that's coming to our response model that something that i think we all know is that so many survivors actually do not engage with law enforcement um some do so against their will um and the structures that we've all built are inclusive of partnering with law enforcement but don't exclusively rely on that and so there's a lot of work that we do side by side with survivors not involve a police response and so i'm i'm i think i'm really heartened to see how all of us have listened to the voices of survivors in terms of crafting the variety of ways that we could be a resource to individuals families and their communities so that's wonderful thank you again uh not only for your work for being with us today and next i'd like to introduce cecia sanchez cecilia has served as the director of housing programs at casa mirna since july of 2018 and casa mirna delivers solutions to end domestic and dating violence through intervention awareness and prevention the organization was named for myrna vasquez an actress and activist who organized members of south end's puerto rican community today casamurna is boston's largest provider of domestic violence awareness efforts and of shelter and supportive services to domestic violence survivors their comprehensive range of services available in spanish and english provide survivors with the tools to recover from the trauma of abuse each year they serve nearly a thousand survivors through residential programs housing assistance financial literacy legal advocacy and community-based advocacy cecia thank you for joining us today and could you talk about the challenges of housing both generally and how that has changed during covid and what looming challenges do you anticipate as the pandemic persists furthering stressing the housing problem well thank you so much for us for having me here and um and having this round table available so like that we cannot chat and talk about all the issues that we all see um the housing prices have been so ongoing especially in the boston um even in massachusetts and for homeless families i i have seen so much amazing things happening during covet and so much more fundings when it comes into housing and sectioning vouchers that we had never seen before um that the city was able to launch a thousand vouchers um through boston housing and bps but those budgets will only benefit those families who had children in the boston public school systems and or homeless homelessness is a lot more than that and um we have a lot more other families that are not benefit from it i know that right now the city is about to do 500 more for boss for project-based section 8 vouchers that's something else that is going to be great to be able for the families who are in homelessness to be able to experience that the same with rapid rehousing fundings have increased so much and um the city has been able to organize themselves pretty well to move families as soon as possible out of homelessness now with kobe more than ever and i think those are great things that are happening but what's going to happen after covert right i feel this fundings have been available or could have been done before colby but now that the emergency happened is when this the lights being shined and and and it's being seen like it's just like an emergency right now but it's not it has been an emergency before it and what's gonna happen after clovid so to be able to see and and um and hopefully we can continue advocating to be able to have a lot more vouchers uh first section aid project-based long-income resources for apartments for families who are experiencing homelessness ongoing and not just with a crisis a cure will be amazing right i think that we all can can say that the domestic violence shelters have been built for for emergency from three to six months to be able to stabilize the family and we have been for years now seeing that the families are there for a year for two years for three years because there's not permanent housing there's no more that they need their emergency state um they will offer in the beginning of the safety right now is because there's nowhere for them to really go into something that is going to be permanent for them in low income right so hopefully we're able to move from that in the future and come and create programs initiative for housing that are able to actually have the masculine child to be something that is a three or six month stay for a family and for a child so they can secure permanent housing yeah thank you for that and uh very timely reminder these are not new problems and the emergency solutions are not going to be the end of the story of how we get to safer communities so thank you now it's my pleasure to introduce katya santiago taylor katya is the policy director and manager of legislative affairs for the boston area rape crisis center in this role she advocates for system-wide policy changes to support survivor survivors and manages barc's work on legislation that affects them katya has worked in the field of domestic and sexual violence since 1999 before joining barc in 2013 she worked in various positions at mova and also as a victim witness advocate for the suffolk and middlesex district attorney's office born and raised in puerto rico katya has a master's degree from northeastern in criminal justice katya it is great to have you here with us and i'm hoping you can share some of your thoughts on what you've seen during the pandemic with respect to sexual violence in our communities and campuses thank you so much for the invitation and for everyone in the panel it's so great to be with all of you here um so what we have seen is a little bit different we see a lot of isolation we have seen a lot of survivors trying to navigate difficult systems while not being able to be socially in the same place or physically together accessing services have become a little bit more difficult most of the services are available but they're virtual now so that removes the the touch the physical connection or the accessibility for survivors in service providers what we are seeing too is that healing of sexual trauma looks very differently now um and we're beginning to learn that survivors have their own way to heal and that we're here to support them and we knew that healing doesn't always look the same but we're beginning to be more creative in creating different spaces creating this different groups cree making um different services of a level um between the isolation and the contact um and the access that some um paper traders can have on survivors it can make it even more difficult to manage right because if you're in the same space with your abuser um you have no room to to separate yourself um so as a rape crisis center what we have been able to do is sort of become creative and try to support survivors where they are at um and update this the services our medical advocacy program can no longer go to the hospital because of covet in the emergency room but we have tablets and now we're providing the services virtually we're running groups of park because we know survivors still need them um it's a is a good way to be socially interactive connecting um and supporting survivors through their healing um so i think access is still there sexual violence is still happening it's still happening within the context of domestic violence internal partner and um non-intimate partners and is how we support survivors to manage their healing process and encourage them to figure out what works for them um speak up and so we providers can help them in that healing process because we know it looks differently for everyone well thank you for that and one of the things i admire about all the organizations represented and all the incredible women on this panel is the flexibility and continuing to meet the needs uh in a very challenging time in the best of situations so um just thank you for that and for for all the work you're doing uh in this unfortunate uh crisis of this pandemic uh next i'd like to introduce hema sarong simensky hema serves as the policy director for jane doe inc working closely with gdi members and numerous partnerships and collaborations to assess and improve how policies and systems respond to survivors and their communities across the state jema supports gvi members in advocating for funding and legislative changes to help survivors ema thank you for joining us and we'd love to hear more about your work and what policy changes you are advocating for on the state level thank you so much for this opportunity to be here and just for your tireless support of survivors across the commonwealth we just deeply appreciate it it's so lovely to have a champion for programs and for survivors so thank you for that um you know i appreciate your comment about the flexibility because i think when i think about systems and policy spaces that we are really looking to making change it really comes from the the wonderful input of our member programs we have 59 member programs and a variety of stakeholders outside of our coalition as well um and you know to be able to identify uh amidst a pandemic that the gaps that not only existed prior to the pandemic but also were so um you know so um you know when we talk about these dueling pandemics of systemic racism and of the pandemic itself um i think that there was a way in which you know programs across the commonwealth really sprung into action to to dive deep into what those gaps were and to identify those gaps to increase responsiveness to use all of the creativity of you know from those those crisis response skills that came in handy in in coming up with creative ways to make sure services were available and open to survivors really from day one of of the closure and that was so powerful to see happen um i just want to highlight a couple areas in terms of policy and systems advocacy directions that we are seeing um especially highlighted as a result of those dual pandemics that that i think we are so familiar with um these days um you know like i think like cece and others have said that the gaps in in the ability to provide services for survivors were already there prior to the pandemic i mean we had done a survey of our member programs that highlighted you know 60 63 of programs going back a couple of years ago were unable to meet the needs that were coming in to provide services a vast and a huge percentage of that was related to housing advocacy um certainly as as we've been talking about the housing crisis um you know and also a significant gap in ability to provide services to limited english proficient survivors and that's become a real interest and really magnified by the pandemic as we see sort of limitations in accessing courts what does it mean to be able to access courts other systems agencies when you are limited english proficient you know while in some ways access has expanded for some survivors because you know we actually just got some data from a program that talked about you know engagement is up in so many ways but we have to also ask the question of engagement of which survivors and who's being left out of that engagement so we've been really looking to increasing our advocacy around looking at language-based marginalization and what that looks like for for survivors who are limited english proficient in the commonwealth what is the responsibility of the commonwealth to provide additional services in that respect what does it mean to be able to envision a world where survivors have trauma-informed access to quality interpreters to get the services they need and so we're doing some you know building coalition building looking doing some survey work with our member programs and various stakeholders to to get there um it's one piece that i really wanted to highlight and we're following some local some state legislation that's looking into that area as well um on the i feel like on the housing front you know there's this monolith this issue of affordable housing that i think feels sometimes intractable especially in places like massachusetts um and that said this the creativity that that i think we spoke of um has really um been wonderful in you know we were able to use some of our cares act funding to to foster a partnership between the department of public health casa mirna peltgen associates and the governor's council on domestic and sexual violence to create this collaboration that was really going to look to bridging the gaps looking at what is keeping survivors from accessing housing yes there's an affordable housing crisis but are there other kinds of partnerships that can be built to help programs connect with housing providers in um to provide more wrap around services and one of the range of opportunities that exist to to do what we can with the resources we have and build partnerships um and foster those relationships between programs and housing providers um so that's been an exciting it's called safe housing we're really excited to be working on it with uh with a bunch of incredible folks and so that's one direction and i think you know certainly in terms of policy successes and directions you know we are really um i think as laura had raised earlier looking at some of the intersections between you know what does it mean to be providers um working with sexual assault domestic violence survivors who have differing experiences with uh criminal justice system responses and what is our obligation as providers to widen the scope of services that we can offer so we're looking at you know some of the unique issues that survivors who might themselves have criminal histories as this was so common what does that mean what are what are some systems advocacy or legislative solutions that we can look to to improve outcomes for those survivors um so many things and on the federal level we're very excited to see movement around uh bower reauthorization conversations increasing culturally specific funding for survivors to really you know again highlight the unique approaches and needs for survivors who are at the intersections of so many forms of oppression and just that the huge benefit of culturally specific linguistically specific services for survivors so excited about that and really championing the boca fix which i know you've been such a strong supporter of over time to get much needed um funds to to to programs who are receiving vocabs so so just some highlights well those are just wonderful highlights but thank you uh hema for you know and this is reflected in all of your work that at this moment of really uh racial reckoning in our country that you have been meeting that need making sure that all your work is done through a lens of equity and racial justice and cultural uh competency we're very grateful and it's good to hear about your even further work and expansion of that to make sure that access is meaningful to everybody and our final panelists uh last but certainly not least i'd like to introduce jesse senwa jesse joined transition house in 2015 and she recently became the director of housing services for the organization she oversees the organization's housing continuum that includes shelter transitional and permanent housing options for survivors of domestic violence jesse earned her masters in crime and justice studies and public administration from suffolk university and she prior to joining transition house work for the suffolk county district attorney's office as a victim witness advocate and as a shelter coordinator for two other agencies providing shelter services to families overcoming homelessness and domestic violence jessie grew up in liberia west africa where she watched and helped her grandmother run an orphanage home for children who had lost their parents during the civil war jesse it is great to have you here and i am hoping you would be able to discuss your work in the context of the pandemic and why it's so important that we invest in these continuum of care programs to provide the vital services that are needed welcome and thank you thank you so much for having me um congressman clark um it's great to you know be here with some colleagues that we see um we've been doing this work for a year now working through the pandemic but we know um i think one of my colleagues said that the pandemic just made everything a little more visible but these issues have always been there they will continue to be there once we get the pandemic you know under somewhat of a control working in the residential programs when you hear the stories about funding where you hear the stories of a policy on everything and those are all amazing work uh but seeing the families seeing the people who are impacted every single day but the things we go to work to do and the difference we go to make at times it can certainly be overwhelming um at times it can certainly be draining when you see a family in shelter who may have lost their job during the pandemic and then schools are closed so now children are home and you are in you know a 12 by 14 bedroom um and you're you're sort of stuck there now right you have no access to whether it's the medical facilities or counseling or you know doctors and everything else and you're still in this space and there's staff who have to work remotely so that removes another layer of contact that you had to be able to get through all the things you have to face the trauma and everything else and you see people becoming more depressed this is where isolation and everything happen um people are just more triggered and you talking about shelter where there's nine families in there and everyone have to go through through that you're also looking at food shortages right because the pandemic happened our partners could not deliver food like they would and then again kids at home from school we know kids eat um whereas if they were in school they may have had lunch there but now they're in the shelter space and they were eating three four times a day um families were struggling food shortages and everything else and that's something we had to deal with through all of this we had increase in hotline calls um they were you know calling to ask do we have shelter space or just looking for the emotional support because now they were stuck at home with an abusive partner where the space where a partner may have gone to work or they too have gone to work or have other relationships and family members to support them that was far removed and so we we we got you know twice as many calls just again trying to work with people to see how we can ensure safety for them those are just some things um through the pandemic that we are still we know we will still continue to deal with um as well but when we talk about you know the housing continuum in the emergency shelter says yes that is an emergency shelter it's not a space for you know two years or two years living it's a space where we can get people to safety get them settled get you know them access to meaningful resources and then we say well how do you move on successfully we know that stability is one of the highlighted things of why a survivor will return to their abuser if they do not have housing the chances of them going back is very likely so when we say well we're asking you to make that phone call to take this step to take the leap of courage to to leave your abusive situation and then when they called the hotline we said well we don't have shelter space because people are still there a year later or then they'll come to shelter and we don't have access to them leaving the emergency shelter so we open up rooms for other people again it goes back to well did i make the right choice did i do the right thing by leaving a situation where i knew i had roof over my head and i was getting abused my children was getting abused my pet was getting abused but in that place i knew i had some type of stability the other struggle is really migrant family i know you highlighted me being raised in liberia and for someone who is um from liberia west africa being in a country where i understand you know that immigration hurdles and so forth you have families migrant families who again remain in abusive situation because funding is limited for migrant families to access um stable housing so oftentimes you know we find families just being stuck in shelter with really little to no resources of where the next step will be um do suggest some things again like i said the pandemic highlighted those things but we will continue to face face these issues so thank you for having all of us here where we can share light to the community um constituents to be able to know the work that we are doing oh thank you jesse and transition house after touring there was really the inspiration for the additional funding for um shelter for survivors of domestic violence so we're so grateful for your work and your model and example and you know you talked about an increase on domestic violence hotlines that you saw during the pandemic we know that uh intimate partner violence has gone up are you concerned at all about um the partner violence that we might not be seeing or hearing about because people are in such tight quarters can you talk about what you're seeing on the ground and whether you think we are experiencing under reporting of the violence that's happening absolutely um we've always um you know there's always been under reporting of of domestic violence uh we know you know i think laura mentioned working with law enforcement right and i go back again to migrant families we know if you have other hurdles that you know if i were to report this i get the police involved there are other things that will affect me as the victim reporting this so that is already a barrier to reporting um or a crime to report an abuse that's that but then also really when you look at someone calling to report or abuse or fleeing the abusive situation where do where do i go what are the resources that's available for me we often ask survivors to make the trade-off that trade-off is leaving an abusive situation now i do want to highlight a believing abusive situation isn't always the safest we we do not advocate we really advocate for safety planning that if someone wants to stay in a relationship how can we help you stay safe in that relationship how do we help you stay safe and you if you're still in the home um but i can tell you this during the pandemic i answer a hotline call and there was a lady who has she was sitting in her car she sat in her car to make the call because the abuser and the children were upstairs in the house we were on the phone she she she wasn't looking to leave because she said if i leave where would me and my children go she took that moment it was about three minutes that she could make a call and say i just need to figure out what do i do how do i stay safe and we couldn't get through the call because the abuser realized she was no longer in the house and you could hear in the background the abuser running to the car and asking who the are you talking to and call hung up those are the moments that we face on the hotline those are things that we hear and again if we're saying make the choice to seek safety to seek resources um what are we what are we really offering to families um funding is always necessary one of the things i do want to highlight through the pandemic um we've collaborated more with so many agencies there's been so many collaborations and it's it's astounding and i said well you know we've all been here right we've been here we're still going to be here how can we continue this how can you know another partner agency has funding another partner agency have shelter we have um a contin a housing continuum with transitional living programs if we open our doors how can we get families um that is well how can we get funding to expand on permanent supportive housing to families uh that we work with but yeah well there were a lot of nodding heads to that collaboration does anyone else want to add to that i just wanted to briefly say i mean i think that's this is the importance of the wisdom of local community-based programs to be able to provide that kind of advocacy and outreach right it's that outreach piece that's so critical and i think there's been so much creativity around how that outreach is done and we're just so pleased here that you know our state legislature really invested in programs and advocacy and outreach during the last even amidst the pandemic and the economic crisis posed by that to really really listen to that need for additional outreach and advocacy um it's it's critical because you know programs know how how to reach the communities in which they sit and that's powerful i want to build off of what hima was saying um and jess thank you everything you said just i think my nodding told the story um [Music] as a local program i have colleagues who work very closely with survivors who who are primarily immigrants who speak spanish and the trust over time that has been established by their efforts to partner with faith communities with you know small businesses with individuals and to develop you know to really support people in becoming lay advocates in their own community that trust has you know really enabled them to be a resource that can help information get from one place to another can help resources get from one place to another in such a way that it's efficient it gets to the people who need it it's timely and i think that you know as to what hamas said is so important as a local program there are so many partners that we have in the community and there's you know our um you know our reputation and so when something like this happens it's really powerful to see the ways in which those trusted relationships can become so much more and can really make a difference for all of us in the midst of this really difficult time and you know there is something powerful i think about the work that we do and the idea that we want to create relationships in community that are respectful that are supportive um that are mutual you know we we want to model um what we're working for in this world right and so when the time came and the need was there even more urgently you know we were able to build off of those really strong relationships and you know do the work that needed to be done information about supporting teenagers for families who you know who may not have access to some of the stuff that's out there that's in english um information about taking care of your own health in the middle of the pandemic unfortunately our advocates have helped people plan funerals in this environment um and then you know when the vaccine came how to you know how to talk to people about that that's all been happening along with you know the funding that's been available to help us keep people housed so that they can avoid eviction even proceedings because eventually that money's you know gonna have to come from somewhere you know we've been doing food deliveries um we've been talking with people again about their technology and helping them improve the experience for their kids we've been able to do all of that because of these relationships and i think that's that's what's powerful about this advocacy role that we have it's it's the one-on-one level that we do every day with survivors in the community and it's also the systems level that we do again every day with you know those partner organizations and also with our you know our elected representatives i also wanted to add um so the pandemic has affected us like all of us if not most of us in one way or another and we think about the trauma the survivors of intimate partners sexual violence has have in their pocket in their backs and so our basic needs were compromised for most people and then you add the trauma so how do you manage the daily life am i going to have enough food at the table am i going to be able to help my kids um do their schooling am i be able to go to the shelter like all of that or am i going to be able to make the mortgage what or the rent um it might be able to go to my second job all of that and then think about the trauma the survivors of intimate partner and sexual violence have have on them um and so it does extra step that extra hurdle that they have had to carry um and at times i felt that most people were not even dealing with the trauma because they didn't have the capacity to work on it they were like i get i just want to have food i want to have electricity i want to have heat i want to have a safe housing and so many people put their mental health to the side um and now um i don't know a single person that's not emotionally affected by all of this um and again like there's so many survivors that are finally getting some sort of time to to work with with their emotions and still with the unknown because we don't know when this is going to end we don't know when we're going to have the vaccine um as a parent i see my kids struggling um i'm wondering what is it going to be deficiencies academically what are we going to see like what are the emotional struggles of my 50 mural like so can you imagine a 15 year old that was sexually assaulted or witnessed domestic violence or intimate partner and having to cope with their growing this year academically emotionally and then being sort of socially or physically isolated from their system their friends the people that could lift them up um so this is really hard um and in my opinion it would be great for the community in general to know that there's a lot of services out there um we're all trying to do as much as we can so we're still here for them um and to help them in the different process if it's healthy we'll help you with healthy isn't mental health we'll help you with mental health is it food will help you with food you don't have to get them all you will help you where you are and the need that you have right now and i want to echo when it comes to the mental health piece of it um we were in a meeting this morning that we do every other thursday the laura is part of it um and we're talking about mental health and whether we can um hire or should we hire counselors or kind of go outside and buy from our providers to be able to provide more of the counseling piece of it because of how you know with clover and everything else but what he came out of the meeting was that in reality the people are bought there's a six-month waiting list for even to be able to get counseling even if in the hospitals um in different like areas their book so that is a need that we're going to see and i think that as we progress with the pandemia and everything we're going i wonder what's really going to come out and what we're really going to see when it comes to mental health yeah because i know that for my peace this was this has been really hard and i know that we have been going and we have been providing services it's been amazing how we're being able to organize ourselves um but in the back of your mind you're like oh my god what is really happening here that i'm really important how can i adapt it's important to acknowledge the impact on all of our colleagues um because all of our colleagues are not only um you know supporting survivors of sexual and domestic violence they are also um dealing with their own challenges as you know katya um enlightened but and and this is going on and on and on and they're dealing with um partner job loss they're dealing with family illness and loss and so you know i think every chance i have i just want to lift up the incredible work that you know all of these people all of us are doing and you know all of us you know all of us strive for well-being and you know we talk about trade-offs we talk about stability we talk about safety we talk about this importance of connection and that's stuff that we all need um in order to um have a shot at well-being and earlier today um i i think you talked about housing you know housed healthy and hopeful and i i think so often people forget about that last part hopeful because there is something about being able to see to the other side to be able to have hope to be able to see a future and you know so often that's part of our work is standing with survivors and families and being you know being their surrogate hope maybe for a little while um as they rebuild their own and so i think all aspects that we've talked about you know the housing and access to health um services the hopeful part is just as essential and i'm so glad that you know you include that on the list of what everybody needs and deserves well i i am so grateful to all of you for providing us that hope and it's such a key focus um not only the mental health of the families that you serve but also of you all and uh your staff and the caretakers this is you are consistently meeting um uh the needs of people who are in uh the very toughest part of their lives and facing um the hardest of circumstances so that alone is difficult but then we are by our human nature social creatures and to do that in our own isolation is is really really tough and i think um cecia said we are going to see that in our school kids um you know we're going to see it really ripple throughout so i i'm glad to hear that you all are thinking of your own self-care uh because we are so um grateful and counting on your continued uh ability to serve um critical needs in our communities and i wonder if you could as you think about finally reauthorizing the violence against women act what do you think on the federal level in congress we should be looking at uh as some of the lessons that we can pull from this pandemic experience i i have a couple of thoughts one of them is prevention um i think laura was mentioning earlier we at least from barc's perspective we have been providing services for 46 years so we have been responsive for 46 years and we're not close to ending sexual violence um so we need to take that extra step in focusing on preventing and preventing should look like education healthy youth act congresswoman clark is still pending i know um and community accountability is about um we know that harm is done it's like how do we sustain how do we lift communities in general so they're not in a position where crime occurs where they're in a position of having their basic needs not met um so prevention by education by trainings by outreach by creating awareness um also by the stigmatizing what domestic intimate in sexual violence is um so it's okay it was not okay but you know if it happened like here we are we're going to believe you we're going to support you uh we're going to lift you up um and then create a system so we need housing safe and secure housing we need to expand mental health we need um latinas spanish speakers we need licensed clinicians to provide bilingual or monolingual like spanish all languages as many languages as we can clinical services um we need access to food job security build communities so um girl safe thank you thank you i gave the whole whole spectrum of all we all we really need um but two of it i just want to highlight it is definitely on building the building communities part because you know when you are in a in an area a neighborhood where there already exists um structural violence right you have to worry about everyday um social justice racial justice and all of those things you know you come to domestic violence and you like it's it's sort of it's under not on the valley but you have all these other things to think about and you're like i this is not um but we want people to be uh uh you know really that they can report being abused right we want people to know that they can pick up the phone and call we want them to know or they can also text right as times change as as the country change as culture changes as well all of the different tools that's available to survivors to say um oh we have this that space of meaningful um access to resources well you can say well call us no you don't have a a language person um you can't say well text us and you know they don't even have minutes on their phone um or things like that so really building communities uh strengthening communities that people have access to resources so when domestic violence is prevalent in the home they know that it can also be just as important to them to making the choice of saying i can report this right i'm not in fear that if i call the police or my partner who happens to be a person of color there will be some other thing you know some other racial justice issue that will occur and so while i stay in an abusive situation because that has more weight than my abuse we don't want that and again that goes back to building communities um the second thing is is the food uh you know food insecurity is really prominent uh prevalent when you know we see clients through our emergency shelter through our transitional living programs uh just this year alone every month at transition house we're spending almost five thousand dollars on gift cards to be able to provide supplements so that families do not go hungry we know it's not enough right if you have a family of three really what can a hundred two hundred dollars gift card do for you nothing um so we see that as well there are times i mean every month we're spending on instant card to make sure families one who don't have access to get to the grocery store we can also again make sure that they do not go hungry so those things are very very important um survivors of domestic violence oftentimes um feel as if they're sort of troubling somebody by asking for things that you know that you have access to and i will tell you often in in shelter i tell clients you are troubling me by not asking you're troubling us when we see you going through things and you don't speak up we are here for you uh there's a common thread with db this worker we do we say we come to this work to heal and so when you watch people in need and just really feel like well i don't want to ask because and i don't want to ask because and it it's no please do that's why we are here um and that's why we come to this work so we can make a difference transition houses um our mission is to break the cycle of violence in our communities um it's something every day we wake up to do we know it will be it's a hard battle right it might be a never-ending battle but we strive every day to break that cycle and and all the things that we building communities and food um security are ways in which we can continue to break that cycle on that note of breaking the cycle i think the other thing we have to pay attention to and i think has come to light um so much over the past years is the use of abusive behavior and you know abusive behavior is built on you know abusive values and how people have been socialized and how they have been impacted in their own lives and the intersection with you know the supremacy and um you know other movements and actions in this country i think cannot be ignored i mean the the fact that um domestic violence is a pattern of behavior um that one person uses to maintain to gain and maintain power and control over another person and so that pattern um must be interrupted and must be addressed in order for this to true this cycle to truly be broken and so i think paying attention to how when you know especially prevention when we're doing the kind of work that we're doing in community building up this understanding of where accountability needs to come from and how we need to shift those behaviors and values and attitudes in order to truly break a cycle that you know as katya says you know has continues and continues and we were celebrating our 40th anniversary this year and we have provided a lot of shelter and we have gone to court a million times i bet and we have answered thousands and thousands and thousands of hotline calls and the work that we're doing in prevention is a necessary compliment to that because if we aren't looking at you know how we're all learning in our life then you know it's just going to keep we're going to just keep going to court and we're just going to keep answering the hotline and we cannot do it alone yeah right absolutely it's a community effort we need to be able to involve everyone in our communities and not just the domestic violence programs this is everyone that we can involve to be able to change this and to break this pattern and you know well while katya was talking about i was just thinking about this is human rights she's human rights we're talking about food absolutely housing permanent housing we haven't even touched on immigration in the status of immigration and that's uh and and what that is but this is only humans rights that we're advocating for that we're trying to get the response that we need to be able to support the community the way that we need to yeah i mean i think going back to that piece around the culturally specific program funding i mean this is where this in many ways so many components of this movement that we are all part of came from the work of communities of color the leadership of folks of color doing this work to benefit their communities when system responses were varied right and i think that there is a wisdom of that i think the integration that i'm hearing in this conversation of prevention education um work with people who have caused harm of addressing our own you know the all of the isms that make their way into our own day-to-day practice and lives is because it is there in the air we breathe of you know working with survivors in creative ways that respond to the myriad of challenges and approaches that they want to take in terms of healing and i think this is such a there's such an opportunity to invest in in those culturally specific program funding in in you know um alternative solutions to supporting survivors uh to heal from trauma whether it's you know exploring kind of restorative or sort of justice related approaches to this work as well as a compliment too um not in lieu of existing responses um there's so much there just wanted to also uplift you know really strengthening i think there's been some deep uh harm caused immigrant communities over the past four years certainly and in in prior to but um to use an opportunity for our reauthorization to really strengthen the the restore some aspects of trust that immigrant survivors can have with um to access the services that they need by strengthening protections yeah well thank you all um you know our our time has flown by here but i asked you to sort of set out what you would think for vawa and re-ortho reauthorization around that and you really set out an agenda for how we meet this moment in our country where we are facing such a physical threat that has brought to light all these inequities that we knew existed and you've ticked right through them and it really gets to the core of the work you do which is in breaking um the cycle of violence in working to support survivors you are touching on all all the pieces that build strong communities and strong economy and a fairer and more just country and democracy so your local work this incredible work that you're doing has such a tie-in to all of our work uh in congress in in the commonwealth um and in communities across the country for for how we build um a a stronger country and democracy and so we're grateful for your work at all times but especially at this time thank you for setting out that blueprint of how each and every family can be successful and resilient and and just for the incredible uh moral clarity and incredible insight and work that you bring to your clients and to all of us every day thank you so much for joining us and thank you again for everything you do

well we do want to have a fair process in the Senate several people asked yesterday about the motion to dismiss and whether there should be one early my view then and now was that this process needs to be a process where everybody is heard and that the person who would benefit the most from everybody being heard is the president he hasn't had a chance to make his case he'll have that chance in the Senate the country the Senate owes that to him and I think the Congress owes that to the country that we can't just have a one-sided process that suddenly ends but a process to where everybody gets a chance to be heard we've heard a lot from the house we particularly heard a lot from the house about how urgent this all was until the last month when apparently it wasn't urgent at all but my view is this will be the first chance that the president's had to make his case he deserves that the American people deserve a chance to hear the other side of this which they haven't heard up until now

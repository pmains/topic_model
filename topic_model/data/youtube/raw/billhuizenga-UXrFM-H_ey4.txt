and I to thank my my friend and colleague from Wisconsin for his leadership on this and so many others and I just wish the American people could be here on this floor right now and feel the passion the frustration honestly the anger and I especially want to address my female colleagues that have been here and have had the courage to come and take a stand that that isn't always done and I think it was especially hard a little earlier as we were doing one minutes seeing a colleague watching a one-minute address from an apologist of Planned Parenthood calling these Horrors trumped-up trumped-up disgusting frankly it's just amazing this is one of the reasons why I voted and along with a number of my other colleagues vast majority of my colleagues on the Republican side voted to defund Planned Parenthood forty-one percent of their of their total revenue is taxpayer dollars 1.5 billion dollars in 2011-2012 we must never forget that we're not just talking about numbers on a spreadsheet we're talking about unborn children not not lab specimens we're talking about human lives we must continue to fight for every unborn child here I just just because their intrinsic worth not because of a spreadsheet or some sort of that Planned Parenthood or any other organization has put together we must continue that fight and especially when there are so many other options that that adoption option that is out there and when you see the the work being done by crisis pregnancy centers like in my area the lakeshore pregnancy center or the right to life organizations or or any of those others that are out there in the trenches praying for working for not just those children but frankly the parents that may be making a bad decision but we must continue to fight for them born here in Congress I know I pledge to do that I know so many my other colleagues do too and we must promote that culture of life and strong fan he's in West Michigan in this nation and around the world and I just like to again thank my colleagues for calling attention to this horrific horrific act that's been going on with that I yield back appreciate the gentleman's comments I'm about to

and now back to one of our top stories the release of internal Twitter Communications regarding the tech giant censorship of the hunter Biden laptop story we're joined Now by Republican senator from South Dakota and member of the Senate armed services and Foreign Relations committees Mike rounds he also serves on the Senate Banking and Veterans Affairs committees Senator thank you so much for your time really appreciate it I just want to get to this Twitter news off the top you know from that reporting it sounds like the first tools that were used to control speech were designed to combat spam and financial fraudsters but political bodies started lobbying to use them those tools for their own interests and you know decisions were not made even-handedly what do you think Congress needs to do next in light of what we've learned so far thing is get the information out these teasers that are coming out reconfirm what a lot of us thought which was Twitter was manipulating a lot of the information coming through but they were doing it in coordination with the Biden campaign maybe they have similar beliefs but this is something that never should have been allowed there needs to be checks and balances within those organizations that release information like that but right now it just simply confirms what a lot of us had thought which is that Twitter was in bed with the Biden campaign team you know the Hacked materials policy which Twitter was citing for the reason to suppress this story according to these documents requires an official finding or law enforcement designation of a hack but that doesn't seem to appear anywhere at least in what we've seen so far um do you see a need to haul people in before congressional committees to testify about these things does that amount to any reason to investigate if a crime occurred here I'm not sure yet if there was a crime but clearly it was an ethical violation on the part of a basically a news organization an open platform in which information should be shared freely and when you start to manipulate that information and intentionally try to mislead the public now you've got a real problem and and I think Congress will have a series of Investigations but it goes back and it reconfirs what a lot of us have thought which was Twitter was manipulating what information people were seeing first on their screens and that does not lead to a positive outcome in terms of people believing things long term or gaining additional trust for the American people and that's something that we should all be concerned about is is can the American people trust what they find online and how do you find an honest news source yeah we should note that these tools were available to both the Trump and Biden camps and both of the made requests and both of them were honored but Democrats had apparently more channels through which to log those requests and found their are woes adjudicated more often according to what we've seen than Republicans who were launching similar concerns one thing that struck me as rokana speaking up he's the only Democrat voice we've heard so far protesting this and at least what we've what we've seen would suggest that Democrats were eager to use this system to their advantage look politics go ahead politics politics brings out sometimes the worst in people and in this particular case not only were the people manipulating information at Twitter but the Biden election team was not only taking advantage of it they were promoting it they were getting away with it they knew what they were doing and they knew that they had cohorts inside of Twitter that would take their recommendations at a very sensitive time in the election cycle the ethics were not there and clearly the ethics were not there when it comes to Twitter this is and and and look there are some things when people intend to mislead the American public there are some things that we can do but it starts out with getting all of the information and as you suggested earlier I think there will be opportunities for investigations into how it happened who was responsible for it and whether or not there has to be some sort of a of a of a cost involved for an organization that that does this as unfairly as it appears they did I want to turn to the the Defense Forum that you're at in Simi Valley California obviously big issue is continuing Ukraine funding I want to play some sound from the president talking about the need to find Ukraine take a listen to this we must support Ukrainian people the idea that Putin is ever going to defeat Ukraine is beyond comprehension imagine I'm trying to occupy that country for the next 2 5 10 20 years if they could if they could so some of your colleagues might hear that and wonder are we setting ourselves up to be funding Ukraine for the next 20 years what's at stake here in trying to lay out what the U.S needs to get done and and how do you sort of mediate the concerns within your party over you know continuing to support Ukraine but also this issue of oversight and the concern that we heard in Jennifer's package earlier that Russian propagandists might use those concerns to their advantage first of all oversight is appropriate and if we're going to put billions of dollars in we want to make sure that the Biden Administration is doing what they say they're going to do with the money we want to make sure that it gets into the hands of the ukrainians and it goes to the right places we think the American people expect that of their government the second piece is we are all supporting the vast majority of us are supporting Ukraine and we would rather have Ukraine doing the battling on their ground pushing Putin back making Putin expend his resources rather than us having American troops there we don't intend to have American troops there but we do want the ukrainians to have the tools they need to defend their Homeland and to push Putin out in doing so that weakens Putin there's a lot of us that really question whether Putin can even continue this on economically for the next six months as we continue with sanctions he's running out of ammo he's running out of Faith back home but over the next couple of months in the middle of the winter if ukrainians us have the tools and resources and the desire to fight during the winter they're really going to take some opportunities that Putin would prefer to just simply sit back and rebuild and if they take the opportunity to continue to push him Putin is going to find himself in a very precarious position come spring and economically he may not be able to continue on without providing concessions okay we're out of time unfortunately appreciate the discussion Senator Mike rounds always a pleasure to have you thanks so much okay

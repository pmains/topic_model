thank you madam chairwoman might a town hall about a week ago and it was quite remarkable to hear my constituents wanting to talk about the work that's being done on this committee and I mentioned the the issue of youth vaping and there was a lot of interest in making sure Congress is taking action so I am so pleased that today we are taking action and doing more than just talking about a problem but taking steps to make sure we're addressing on youth vaping and the marketing that tobacco companies have been doing to communities of color and children is really unacceptable and it has been quite effective and we have seen a disparity among smoking rates in Los Angeles County while the adult smoking rate is about 13.3% African American and Latino men are smoking at much higher rates of over 20% children are specifically being targeted and the marketing is incredibly effective for instance a study found that African American children were 3 times more likely to recognize advertisements for the menthol brand Newport than any other child the bill today will go a long way to help protecting children including children of color from getting addicted to products that may ultimately lead to them becoming sick and potentially dying additionally our crisis our country is in a crisis when it comes to maternal health and maternal mortality the United States has the worst rate of maternal deaths in the entire developed world what's worse is women of color color disproportionately face a higher level of pregnancy-related death the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that black women are 3.3 times more likely than white women to suffer a pregnancy related death this is unacceptable and why I'm proud today to support these bills these bills will authorize grants for innovation in maternal health trained health care professionals to reduce and prevent discrimination including explicit and implicit biases and would access to Medicaid I'm proud to support these bills and look forward to voting for them and with that I yield back

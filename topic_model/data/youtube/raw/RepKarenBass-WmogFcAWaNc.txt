call on the chair of the Africa subcommittee of this committee miss bass thank you think Thank You mr. chair and I appreciate the ranking member in saying that people are beginning to wake up because you know whenever I hear about the Chinese or the Russians and Africa you know my thought is where are we and you know it's time for us to step up and so I appreciate the assistant secretary saying that you're going to come full force I I would love to hear the details as to what that means and then of course what concerns me about it is is that and I know you are genuine because I know you but then you know we have a 66% decrease in the budget so I don't know how you go full force and have your budget you know decrease so much so perhaps you can clue me in on the secret as to how you're going to do that and I appreciate Miss Linehan talking about addressing the root causes because I am concerned about our imbalance in that we put a lot more emphasis obviously we put emphasis on security but we all recognize that if you address the root causes you're addressing you know the security situation as well so perhaps if you wouldn't mind maybe assistant secretary you could give me some top lines as to how it'll be full force I also want to ask about Cameroon and Ethiopia so I don't want to run out of time go ahead thank you very much at Congress I want to very quickly I've worked for 7 different administration's different levels of budgets I've had some fat ones and thin ones all I can promise you that I will do the absolute best I can with whatever funds are made available on China specifically we're having individual embassy and country strategies we are putting deal teams together from the largest embassies to the smallest ones to do to both both sides of this support us businesses work with the countries to improve their business environment which will attract US businesses because all my discussions with US business they said we want to go to Africa but this is what stopping us so again that's a full-force press and also to make clear to people you know every time China builds a 50 see Stadium they get full page of coverage front page what has not said that there wouldn't be people to be in that stadium if not for you as government's billions of dollars saving millions of Africans from hiv/aids so so we need to make sure that both sides of the story is told on this and I'll stop there for sure and I know with my ranking member over there that we'd love for you to come to the subcommittee and perhaps we could drill down because we want to figure out how to be how to be supportive miss lennihan would you like to respond to the what you were saying in terms of addressing root causes but yet our focus is on security I do believe that we need to address root causes that I also know from the Department of Defense pull the microphone just a little closer to you - yes I do believe that we need to address root causes in Africa which my colleagues here from USA and state to a heroic job of doing so along with the many people out in the fields and within the department in order to do so additionally at the State Department at the Department of Defense we work on institution building which I also believe addresses some of the root causes in order to create those critical foundations and promote governance across the Sahel of note there's the security governance initiative which is focused on addressing a cross-cutting security sector improvements to develop governance and build institutions two countries Mali Indonesia are part of that thank you and I'm sorry to cut you off but I know I'm gonna run out of time so I wanted to ask in terms of the crisis in Cameroon in the Anglophone region we know it's been worsening over the last 18 months and so I wanted to know what we are doing along with our diplomatic partners to encourage negotiation thank you very much very quickly cameroon continues to be one of three countries that grieves my heart every night i sat with president be a couple of the other to Somalia and South Sudan okay I said with president be a couple of months ago in in-camera and we told he told me you know yes we're interested in dialogue and but the government has done nothing to show for it they've set up some in institutions which have not done anything we continue to press forward with our our allies we had an arias at the United Nations I'm sorry this is just terrible five minutes but I gotta get to Ethiopia okay you don't get best news on Ethiopia yesterday if you'd been at the State Department for our partnership forum on Ethiopia and seen the hundreds and hundreds of people's there from the Diaspora from US business and from the Ethiopian government your heart would have melted III kicked it off and I was just delighted because I knew we would get to this point going forward we are finding ways to support Ethiopia but what they need now is jobs jobs jobs and that will be brought by the business investment so we will do our best to promote that thank you very much good thank you

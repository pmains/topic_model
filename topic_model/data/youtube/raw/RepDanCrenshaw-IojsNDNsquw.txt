we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created as a member of congress i get to have a lot of really interesting people in the office experts on what they're talking about this is the podcast for insights into the issues china bioterrorism medicare for all in-depth discussions breaking it down into simple terms we old we hold we hold these truths we hold these truths with dan crenshaw has landed welcome everyone uh we are going to start off today with a very timely topic the topic of iran i have with me dr ray takei i said that right correct that's right ray takei he is a senior fellow for middle east studies at the council on foreign relations specializes in iran he's iranian and specializes in political reform in the middle east and islamist movements and parties before joining the council on foreign relations you're a senior advisor on iran at the state department and a fellow at the washington institute for near east policy you've authored three books you've written more than 250 opinion pieces and articles for many news outlets and you've testified before congress more than 20 times so you know what you're talking about and this is uh this is quite this is quite the week to have you for for listeners uh you know because because these podcasts aren't released you know as we record them uh this uh president trump struck soleimani just a few days ago the iranians responded and we've been debating this all week and i think we'll continue to debate it for some days to come so uh doctor thank you so much for being on the show it's happy to be here thanks for having me so uh you know before we get into some detail questions and we have many uh just your initial reactions to this entire week uh i think all together i would have to say it's been a positive week for the united states uh the elimination of general suleimani was a must delayed proposition it should have happened before uh and i think it took considerable amount of courage for the president to do it the operations seem to have been flawlessly planned and executed quite perfectly and i think everybody for a long time assumed that if united states engage in such an activity the reprisals would be quite significant what we saw is an iranian reprisal that seemed to be more symbolic yeah than than real so i think we have restored our deterrent power eliminated a terrorist a mass murderer and we have demonstrated that despite what many say the iranians aren't 10 feet tall so all together i think it's been a very good week for president for for the united states yeah for people of iraq iran globally yeah i agree and it's been perplexing to me to to see this debate play out um you know i understand the political motivations the behind many of the democrats comments but i would expect them to stay silent more than anything else like fine don't give the president credit but the the position they've taken is is pretty indefensible well it's the curious position because after the nice way to put it [Music] after the iranian attack against the saudi oil installation many people across the political spectrum said that president was wrong not to respond many democrats said that yeah when he responded they said he was wrong to respond so it's a position where he can't he you can't do right i i suspect and you know this better night our politics is are so polarized that we can't come together on suleimani that that's that's extremely concerning um you said something which is that solemnity should have been taken out much earlier and uh were there any actual opportunities to do that with because you know you look at this particular attack we have very good intelligence and and i know not everybody can see that intelligence but it is very good intelligence that he was about to commit attack plus you know it's i would just say this is an aside the president's taking a lot of criticism for implying that the solomoni was going to attack an embassy and people are saying well how do you know and i say well you know he just did attack an embassy right like it just happened well that's that's his job right that's the resume yeah that's that's his that's his business card he attacks american installations and so this situation to me seemed extremely defensible for all those reasons but can you can you identify any other situations in previous history where we might have taken them out and been actually as well off as we are right now my understanding is on two occasions during the bush administration an opportunity presented itself i don't know if it even got past centcom i don't know if he even got to the white house but i think the military leadership at that time decided not to and you have to recall that was a time if the time frame is correct during the height of the iraqi civil war yeah so there was a lot of concern regarding the fragility of the iraqi government preoccupied you're really going to start a fight with another country so the military for a variety of reasons i don't know exactly the reasons but they chose not to i don't know how far that got up to the chain of command because it wouldn't even get past saint call what about uh i didn't we talk israel down at one point from from striking soleimani i don't i don't know that episode i think israelis are always a little more cautious about this than people think uh although i think they would strike sulaimani if they had a chance uh and once solomonia came to the periphery of israel trying to establish fortifications on israeli periphery in syria then israelis struck back very hard against against the iranian fortifications and missile bases and factories and so on so they have demonstrated they're willing to defend their interests yeah i suspect if israelis really thought it was in their interest they might have done it but i don't i don't know the specifics of that episode yeah any time during the obama administration that there was really an opportunity not that i know of yeah and you know the question is would they have even taken that opportunity especially considering their their main goal was the iran nuclear deal yeah i suspect they would not have also because if you kind of listen to the commentary many of them believe this would be a prelude to war and the president obama was very concerned about getting into a war and getting into any sort of military confrontation in the middle east so i suspect he would be more reticent about it yeah let's talk about that philosophy for a second because that that is the driving narrative of many democrats if you do anything right it means war and i think that's an overly simplistic way of looking at things but but there's something else that concerns me about that narrative which is which is this um you know susan rice has come out and said that you know because of presidents trump's actions we've we've we we've seen a uh an uptick or a beginning of of shia proxies lobbing rockets on u.s bases that wasn't happening before and my first thought is okay so are you saying that our our strategic actions are actually decided upon by these homemade rockets like is that how a superpower is supposed to act because that isn't that is the implication of that narrative well the the again the democratic narrative on this is curious uh because susan rice and many others also say what the president has done in this case could get us evicted from iraq this is kind of ironic yeah it is uh like like where did they stand given the fact that in 2011 it was the obama administration that evicted this cell from iraq yeah so they have to decide whether they want to stay or leave uh in iraq but you know the president doesn't get a lot of credit uh i i just think if the president came out for milk they would oppose it and it's just the way the politics of this are working out as far as the she militias being more activated against the united states i suspect this a less than that because for a long time for 40 years predating the iran deal and all that the islamic republic had a doctrine a terrorism doctrine that worked very well namely they would employ terrorism against the united states and others but so long as that terrorism was done by surrogate and proxies then they would shield themselves from retaliation yeah even when it was obvious who was behind it everybody knows who was behind in 1983 borrowing of the marine barrack in lebanon everybody knew that yeah it was executed by hezbollah i know for a fact that clinton administration knew who was behind the 1996 bombing of the court tower's residence in saudi arabia right there was intercepts yeah uh and everybody knows who was behind a carnage in iraq against the american forces but so long it was done by surrogates iranians were thought to be immunized what is not stated here is that the president actually nullified that doctrine yeah what he said is if there is terrorism against in this case american installations even by the iranian proxies the address is tehran yeah that's a huge break from 40-year bipartisan pattern of conceding to iranian terrorism if there's some ambiguity about the source even though there isn't any yeah now how that message is received in iran remains to be seen but i suspect that will have a tempering effect now what happens the president is always consistent so what happens next remains to be seen but i think that in of itself is something that people have not sufficiently paid attention to because it's a disruption of a 40-year bipartisan pattern i have to say yeah yeah we've been allowing this plausible deniability for for a very long time i call it implausible deniability that's a better way to put it because there's none everybody knew who did it yeah everybody knew who ordered it yeah but we wanted not to have the altercation so we bought into the fiction that iranians offered us namely it was hezbollah it was uh saudi hezbollah or what have you right right yeah they they they wanted to i mean they're very good at surrogate warfare uh just coming from the special operations community myself uh we specialize in surrogate warfare we call it unconventional warfare but it's basically you you train but you know who's behind it yeah well well not if you're doing your job correctly but uh but uh but we we know it's iranians right and uh but they're but they've always been good at this they do it throughout the region and well because it's it's something that's worked for them they have inflicted cost without corresponding punishment right and and that continued and so and so the the next question that that rises to the top in this week's debates are the main one is are we safer okay and so as i watch the democrats rhetoric and it tends to shift quite a bit here and there they sort of moved away from the whether the president was authorized or not because that question has been answered i think very clearly uh they've moved into a to a more strategic question of are we safer and then why did we leave the the doctrine of appeasement via the jcpoa which is just for everybody that stands for the joint comprehensive plan of action which is also known as the iran nuclear deal so we left that which basically was a payoff right a payoff to say hey please delay your enrichment of uranium for us for at least 10 to 15 years it wasn't it didn't delay in richmond and richmond continued under the iran nuclear deal yeah they were they're limited it was like 3.67 but but we have very little let's talk about that okay so so what do you mean by that well the jcpoa the iran deal did not proscribe iranian enrichment iranian enrichment continued uh what is said that iranian enrichment has to be capped at 3.67 which is not a big deal yeah because you can you can't make a nuclear weapon out of 3.67 but if you can you can do energy yeah but if you can't perfect enrichment at 3.67 it doesn't take you that long to get to weapon grade yeah and they were supposed to ship out the enriched uranium that they maintained as a result of that and they have renounced all their obligations the iranian the iran nuclear deal was not a sturdy barrier to iranian proliferation right it allowed the modernization of the iranian nuclear program because it did nothing to stop the r d yeah and that was a real big deal for them because they actually wanted to modernize their program and not continue enrichment with primitive technologies right so they were going to phase out some of those center futures which they dismantled as part of the iran deal anyway yeah what they traded in was some capacity for the ability to modernize their program and get sanctions relief yep that was that was pretty good deal for them it was a great deal for them actually and but also we couldn't even access some of their military facilities either where they could easily be doing even more advanced enrichment it was it is a violation of not just the iran nuclear deal but their basic safeguard obligations on the npt when they prevent access right so they prevented access nothing happened but it was written into the deal that we did we didn't have access to some of those places so it was then the deal is a violation of the safeguard agreements right right i mean it's it's just a bad deal you know it's um people don't realize that you know they say well it prevented a nuclear weapon uh that that's far from clear you know and for a couple reasons we didn't have a baseline we didn't know how far they'd gotten in the first place that's that's a big argument against it right the second big argument against it is even if even if they did abide by it and had every intention of abiding by it which it's possible i'm not saying that's impossible not today not today but but even even before even when we were in the deal it's possible but it's it's not probable and i know these rallies had intelligence that show that they were trying to cheat um you know before we even pulled out but um but even if they weren't even if they were trying to abide by it and and showing patience which would be in their character because they are a patient you know regime right uh they're not like the us where we think in four-year terms they think four years fair yeah maybe less but two that would that would be an improvement yeah that's true or uh but they think longer term they're you know um they're one of the highest virtues in iran persian culture is patience cleverness and patience yeah and they feel they outsmarted us and so they they could look to 10 to 15 years and say this is great because what happens in 10 to 15 years you're going to come back to the table and try to tell us not to do something you're already abided by the deal the deal shouldn't be even if it was still in existence it would have to be thought of as an eight-year deal yeah because on year eight they would be allowed to install advanced attributes okay and it would take them from 2015 how many years would it take them to produce new generation of centrifuges let's see eight years it takes a generation to produce a new generation of centrifuges about eight years so it was really an eight-year deal in terms of modernization of their capabilities yeah and just to see how how poor of a deal it was look all the things they have done yeah since the ballistic missile testing ballistics they're installing new generation of centrifuges they're enriching uranium they the atomic energy organization in iran is expanding and it's been expanding since 2015 in terms of personnel technicians and engineers right now engineers design technicians build right uh so it's just the level of activity that has gone on which has allowed them to resume most of their activities with alacrity uh and that's so it the deals talking points that were used in 2015 were not wrong they were fraudulent yeah okay yeah it didn't block the pathways it wasn't the gold standard of inspection you're saying it helped the pathway i think it legitimized iran's nuclear legitimize that's a good word enabled it because they could have access to international technologies small example prior to the deal iranian graduate students could not be trained in nuclear physics abroad they can today so in a lot of ways the deal took a illicit nuclear program and branded the legal yeah it bought in within the community of nations legitimized it advanced it legitimized it advanced it and enriched it and enabled it right and under this false pretense that iran needs a nuclear program right which is well it doesn't have sufficient domestic indigenous enrichment to operate yeah uh national civilian that's never been a feasible explanation at all for energy purposes or anything else right right so bad deal yes so it's a bad deal i mean that's so that's the jcpoa and and the narrative goes that yeah but since since the nuclear weapon was taken off the table which again is highly debatable it's not debatable it wasn't enough it's not taking off the table um in fact we were put on a path towards that that we're safe i'm just saying what their narrative is um that that we were safer and uh again as susan rice says you know we weren't we were getting less rocket attacks in iraq what i pointed out was well sure for a period of time there's less rocket attacks in iraq probably because the shia militias were battling isis not because they just all of a sudden became good people and american lovers that's just not how it works because but let's not forget they also boarded a u.s navy vessel uh instigated multiple civil wars throughout the region uh tested i think over 20 ballistic missiles i think 16 of which that we know of were nuclear capable uh quadrupled funding to hezbollah more than doubled their own defense spending i mean i remember being in the military and we were seeing that the irgc kept talking about how they increased their funding after the iran deal yeah because they got a bunch of money so the the the the um the incredulous reaction from from democrats when trump had that had the audacity to say they used that money to pay for this and i was like well that is a plausible explanation actually there are two uh things one can say first of all beginning with the iranians and the iraqis and the americans everyone's better off that general suleiman is not around and they always say well he can be easily replaced i'll give you a houston metaphor you take james harden off the lineup and you go ask the coaching staff mike antonio hey can't you find another guy off the bench you can score 40 points yeah sometimes there are guys who are one in a million sumo money was a one million guy in a country of 80 million can they replace them at some point probably but those guys don't grow on trees no there are time when elimination of an individual like that does impair capability at least in short medium term right and his deputies are fairly lackluster character compared to him and he was a micromanager i mean he he and his relationships and his experience of course it's not easily replaceable it's nice it's foolish to think otherwise so that's one aspect of it the second in terms of the militias and so on uh i i suspect what the iranians are telling their militias tamper things down for now now it is possible that will be distracted and diverted there's always issues there's always elections there's always a crisis and the problem with our policy potentially is potentially is absence of discipline yeah that's what yeah we we are the inability to set those red lines and keep those red lines which is often and sustain them right across time which is a that is a marker of us foreign policy that it's not consistent enough well it's becoming more inconsistent right as because it's becoming a function of our domestic political polarization right where even elimination of suleimani is not eliciting a bipartisan bipartisan consensus right which is you know in here's another scenario um which is which is worth considering is worth hoping for and uh something i've said which is imagine if every member of congress just said hashtag free iran on on twitter what kind of message would that send to the iranian people is and this this gets to another question which is the the other narrative going on is we've unified the iranian people against the united states i mean is there any more like any modicum of truth to that not that i can't think of uh um what do you know are you from there uh the well let me the the iranian regime is a curious one uh on january the 3rd pro president rouhani website that used to run before he became president published a poll of residents of tehran tehran being the largest city obviously where 85 of the people said they were unsatisfied with the government yeah uh poverty repression corruption uh we just had protests in iran after the fuel subsidies were were withdrawn because of budgetary things so basically they had the same approval rating as congress uh lore maybe but i would say one thing uh upwards of 1500 people were massacred yeah in the november uprising uh if i was a parent of one of those 1500 i would be appalled that i'm not allowed to have a public memorial for my dead son but we're gonna have a three-day commemoration for general sulaimani yeah i would be appalled by that they can't have a regime is trying to stop that wow because that would of course well remind everybody that this was these people were killed by the regime and if she religious rituals uh you bury the dead you commemorate them 40 days later so it would be ongoing sort of a commemoration for a while and all those commemorations will become politicized and generate their protests also the people who were killed in november were there were the poor and the working classes yeah they were thought to be the regime's last mainstay the regime doesn't have support among the middle classes certainly not the upper classes uh they're working poor because they were the ones in whose name the revolution was waged in 1979. they're oppressed as they always are uh they're the ones who were tied to the government to some extent by patronage and welfare state which has been shredded because the regime doesn't have the budgetary so what we have seen in december 2017 and 18 that period and in november 2019 is a different kind of a revolt it's the revolt of the poor really so that means the regime has no constituency other than security services uh that's interesting the corruption of the regime is particularly galling to many people because it's the corruption of the religious classes yeah those who talk about piety and and and sacrifice and and and and and that sort of honor are deeply corrupt the class divisions are becoming quite provocative uh during the time of poverty at some point there were more bmws in tehran than berlin wow somebody was getting rich so the regime is in deep domestic trouble uh that's one so i don't see how this attack helps if you're poor if you're disenfranchised if you disaffected the death of one of the security service icons isn't going to endear you to them right uh and also uh the other thing to remember is that people talk about nationalism that this has generated nationalism the supreme leader ali khamenei has denounced nationalism for 40 years he thinks nationalism is a western disease you and i are all muslims he says persian nationalism arab nationalism turkish nationalism is wrong we are all muslims this is why they're so expansion yes well i guess that makes sense in the if it's the islamic revolution he never calls it the iranian he's not a nationalist he's a pan islamist yeah uh when the president talk about cultural sites the first people that try to blow up cultural sites the iranian revolutionary mullahs in 1979 because they view that as a relic of pre-islamic persian past yeah as a decadent so i don't think this redounds the regime's advantage as as a matter of fact i think it'll be down to his disadvantage because now most of the iranian people don't want to have a war with the united states right uh they understand the costs uh so the regime that is so aggressive in the region uh is not necessarily consistent with their foreign policy orientation to the extent that that can be deciphered what kind of access to information do the iranian people have at this point uh i think we can always do better on that front uh the information today is fairly porous because of penetration of social media okay so can they can they see what i'm saying on social media is that possible at all if you can get it up and get some translation and put it on bbc yeah or elsewhere well let's say they speak english like yeah are they seeing any do they have what kind of access if you're in tehran right now what can you go on facebook and see anybody's profile how does that yeah yeah they have it in at least in urban centers it's deep penetration by social media okay uh so the regime cannot insulate the country from information although they did one thing in the november protests which surprised me they shut down the internet for the whole country yeah no other country has ever done that yeah uh i don't know how much it costs them just how scared they are well it i don't how much you cost them in terms of finances but it's also demonstrated how they have thought about control in times of crisis but in ordinary times it's it's it's an unusual regime because there's a lot of flaws of the regime are pointed out in its own discourse yeah so so also we don't have to tell iranian regime to hate their government they already do yeah uh what should we tell them i mean you know if if i if i could put out the perfect message and i knew they would see it on social media and i could get the whole congress behind it i mean what would that what would that message be i think we need to talk more about issues of human rights about democracy about the regime that's accountable to his public i think too often we stay away from those themes because we are quote unquote afraid of the phrase regime change [Music] bad taste in our mouths and wow i don't think we should not talk about human rights an issue of democracy an issue of voter fraud and issue of uh transparently fraudulent government and its processes i don't think we should stop talking about that because they do yeah uh they understand the corruption they understand that they don't limit a representative government they understand that those are the things they want yeah and i think too often we stay away from those topics because of the in our mind the obscenity of the phrase regime change yeah and and would you say that there's a benefit to that i mean as far as moral support uh to people is there is there a real tangible benefit to doing that i don't think we can ever go wrong standing up for democratic values yeah in places where those democratic values are wanted and desired so so when they see that we're divided on this decision to kill somebody like soleimani after he did what he did and after we had the intelligence we had that's amplified in their press the fact that we're divided on that okay so commentary for example well the commentary coming from the united states this is not to suggest in any way that americans cannot be critical of their government right right i mean if they want to criticize yeah well let's assume let's assume good intentions for now if susan rice wants to criticize the policy of president trump i think she's perfectly entitled to do so sure yeah let's assume good intentions on the other side but but but how does the iranian government perceive that they tend to amplify yeah and republished commentary in american press by luminaries former officials whatever suggesting that americans are left safe the empowerment of iran and so on right uh those those do work their way back it plays into their propaganda machine it plays into their propaganda machine but again i it just it's just what it is i mean this is a price we pay for have a democratic system with pluralism and free speech so it is that is but but it's a fact too i mean it's it's important to note the facts and um you know again i don't think it plays into regime's narrative of empowerment and capability and instigating fears and a superpower yeah but that's something we have to live with what uh what would you tell people that they often misunderstand about persian culture or the iranian government what's one of the number one misconceptions there is an extraordinary difference between the way the iranian government thinks about its future and the way the iranian people think about their future the iranian government wants to meddle throughout the middle east most persians don't want their resources spent on arab civil wars most persians are indifferent to the plight of the palestinians and don't understand the confrontation with israel most iranians actually want to have better relationship with the united states and the west and they don't understand the confrontation between the two sides for 40 years which they have been victimized by yeah most iranians don't want to be governed by a religious democracy but by a representative government most iranians are intellectually mature enough to actually handle pluralism and democracy and all the things that go with it yeah most iranians are educated enough this is a country of 80 90 illiteracy to manage an economy as opposed to this corrupt bankrupt system that they have the gap between state is it literacy not illiteracy literacy yes yeah the gap between state and society is something that we often miss and that gap is unbridgeable whether general sulaimani or not the the the iranian people would like to be rid of the regime is there any chance of that happening uh i i well that's a complicated question yeah i do think that we'll get to that post-islamic republic period i don't think the islamic republic is a thousand year right uh i think we'll get to the post-islamic republic period simply because the business model just doesn't work yeah uh and the regime no longer has any kind of a reliable constituency and there's one thing that is now becoming crystal clear to the iranian public two things uh one the regime is incapable of reforming itself yeah uh number two and this happened around 78 877 with the previous iranian regime the monarchy at some point when the iranian economy began to decline in the 1970s all countries experienced recession but the economic narrative had a psychological tinge to it in 1970s it wasn't that we're having a recession is that things are never going to get better and i didn't get mine and i know who did you have the same psychological dimension to iran's current economic crisis that the good times are over they're never coming back and i didn't get mine only those people did yeah that's a very powerful and corrosive message divisive absolutely uh so i think we'll get to the post-islamic republic period uh so how does that happen i mean is it uh is it simply the iranian people rising up is there are there are there outside i mean well i know there's outside outside groups you know the the shahs right right i don't know if you can ever predict with precision how a regime like this collapses nobody have predicted how the soviet union collapsed right nobody have could predict it how other regimes could nobody have critical the way shaw's regime collapsed the monarchy in 1979 uh i what we can say with some measure of certainty that all the conditions for the collapse of the regime exist yeah and regimes like that decay for a long time before they finally collapse and we're seeing the dk they're following out the the sort of the exit of the elite the brain drain yeah most people don't understand how iran is affected by brain drain right uh because one of the clever things that regime has done is unlike the old soviet union if you got a degree in political and computer science and you can go to australia go ahead that removes an explosive political problem but it also creates a whole set of other economic problems as well so one of the way they have managed their political situation is by allowing people to leave yeah just just iran iranian-american communities iranian american communities here yeah there's an iranian community in japan right right india australia canada all over europe yeah uh it's not healthy for the future of a state a future of a government for the best and the brightest to leave well let me ask you about the structure of the government real quick i mean so there's there's a there's a parliament there's a president there's a supreme leader there's the irgc uh how does that work i mean who really is in control uh gridlock yeah you know i just can't pass legislation yeah uh the parliament is a venerable place because of a history of parliament going back to early 20th century and so it's part of a constitutional revolution and so on uh the president does command considerable authority because he oversees the bureaucracy and has some leeway on foreign policy as you saw with the iran nuclear negotiations uh the military there's a supreme national security council that features all the leadership that is chaired by the president the speaker of the parliament so there is this sort of a communal system that comes together in times of crisis or tries to there's a lot of internal divisions today in the system yeah uh they just can't agree on things uh particularly the question that divides the elite today the political indeed the islamic republic is a question of what ails our economy yeah what is the cause of our economic decline that's actually an issue that's been debated and the supreme leader's idea is what he calls economic resistance namely that we develop internal markets we develop local markets and not rely on the west and on the other hand president rouhani's idea was to get commerce from europe and so on so principal question that divides the elite now is what ails our economy and that by definition is a political issue yeah it's a foreign relations issue so and some people are saying some intelligent things namely that not all our problems economically have to do with sanctions a lot of mismanagement they do have a anti-corruption campaign going really but given the fact that everybody's corrupt any anti-corruption campaign is going to be selective yeah and it's going to be selective based upon political prejudice so they do recognize the problems but the problem they have is they can't solve them it's not that they don't understand their problems but they just can't reform themselves does the supreme leader though uh have final say yeah effectively every policy so there's a lot that's debated underneath that but for for the most part it's he can reverse just about anything there's no he's got power to reverse elections nullify them if he chooses uh he's a commander of the armed forces he's has two representatives at the supreme national security council right he he is the final say i mean the worst supreme yeah doesn't have it doesn't mean something uh doesn't mean a lot of people say solomonia was was you know was the the heir to that title is that no no i don't think so uh suleimani was a commander of a specific segment of the revolutionary guards uh that was responsible for iran's activity beyond its borders i don't think he was there is a succession crisis looming uh ali khamenei is 80 years old uh they're trying to groom one of his somebody to be his successor uh the in this entirely at this particular point the regime does not have sufficient internal consensus to manage a succession crisis oh interesting i wonder if that's the tipping point that's that's one of the tipping points because whatever his flaws ali khamenei is a glue that holds the system together yeah and they are actually trying to groom a successor to him who's ahead of the excuse me head of the judiciary now um uh ibrahimovic yeah uh he's got good credentials for the job uh he's a mass murderer yeah uh he sanctions all kinds of that's probably a checkbox you have to check yeah for a regime that's potentially hitting turbulence having some guy who's willing to pull the trigger yeah or provide religious sanctions for killing uh people always talk about the revolutionary guards versus the religious leadership who's in charge they used to say about prussia every country has an army in prussia the army has a country uh that's not the case here i mean it's a symbiotic relationship they need each other yeah the uh going back to the will of the people real quick because something came to mind which was solemnity's funeral um right you know well attended right uh we have some weird descriptions of that funeral from from from our country uh you know i mean putting it in glowing terms but so so given how unpopular the regime is how do you get that many people to turn out for a funeral is that just everybody is that the 15 that actually supports them the islamic party for 40 years has been very good at staging demonstrations okay they boss you in they you get free meal all this people in fact work offices and so on have a day off and you have to come in you get privileges they've been very good for 40 years of staging demonstrations interesting uh this is one of the expertise that they have yeah as revolutionaries who came to power through demonstrations they understand the street power yeah uh so they can mobilize demonstrations for something like that uh for funerals and some of it may be genuine expressions of yeah of you know of momentary expression of concern about what has happened uh but i do think that's this is a well-practiced craft of the regime to stage street demonstrations yeah it does have some mobilization power in that sense right yeah i mean if it's interesting the way you put it you know they have experience as revolutionaries and yeah if you think about radical activists in any country there's certain tactics that you use and uh we see it all the time yeah right so that that's uh that's interesting um so this is this is the week this is the second week of january uh you know how do you how do you see this playing out for the next month or two well they have to figure out what happened i mean we underestimate how unsettled they must be at this stage after 40 years of a certain type of foreign policy practice they have a problem now yeah uh they have never been able to understand president trump yeah they're unsettled by his unpredictability they don't have to deal with offer of negotiations terrorism uh punishment for attacks they haven't figured this out uh internally there's no consensus for how to talk to the united states yeah i think president rouhani wanted to but i think you're probably a poor agent my guess is at this particular point number of things happens first of all there's going to be a lot of intermediaries going to tehran and washington trying to generate some sort of talk whenever there's a talk of war it never leads to war it leads to diplomacy yeah so there'll be a lot of intermediaries coming and going between tehran and washington saying whether it's president macron again or france yeah whether it's prime minister abe whether it's the iraqis who have tried to mediate between united states and iran and have an interest in doing so today so i suspect we see a lot of back channel chatter uh but i think my guess is what the iranian government will try to do is wait to see what happens with our elections yeah if the president is re-elected they have to recalibrate again right and potentially approach him with a diplomatic opening right if somebody else is elected then there's not much they need to do because yeah the traffic will go down it's gonna yeah the the appeasement strategy will come back in full force well the traffic is gonna yeah go the other way they don't have to reach out they'll be reached out too they will they will again for the for the strange reasons the curious reasons that we talked about uh well i mean i guess and i guess in a sense you already answered this but what should we do i mean i ideally what does our strategy going forward look like i mean how is there is there a path to a a nuclear deal or a deal in general that's actually good well what i would say about the president's uh policy at every step of the way he has defied conventional wisdom and succeeded he said that well his critic says that if he leaves the deal the united states will be isolated not true if united states leaves the deal it will not be able to multilateralize its economic sanctions not true right if it sanctions or takes active measures against iranian military leadership will be in a war not true not true so so his critics kill the head of the irgc we're still not in a war so at every step of the way our maximum pressure strategy has succeeded right you cannot lower the iranian oil exports without just disrupting the global economy not true we can go to the checklist of talking points that have been negated uh what you would do now i i would sustain the strategy of pressure uh and i would actually try to get the europeans to re-impose the u.n security council sanctions those sanctions were in place uh and if iran violated the deal which they are today they haven't for a long time they you heard the phrase in 19 in 2015 about snapback yeah now it's time for the snapback to come in right so the first and the president referenced that that europeans should essentially snap back the u.n sanctions whether europeans will do so or not i'm not sure but the united states itself has legal authority to do that right that's one uh i think the strategy of pressure i would continually apply it because two things will happen either iranians will return to the table in a more humble way or the regime will collapse my guess at the end of the day is the islamic republic can break but it's unlikely to bend so i'm not sure if there's a deal out there along the parameters that are that are that are durable to deal with the problem right or the parameters that we would need to call it a good deal yeah um the the secretary pompeo's uh 12 points right from may uh 2018 right where he established the parameters of a good deal i don't think we should walk those parameters back yeah because they're sensible um the last question is the iran's neighbor iraq and uh you know the growing iranian influence there what do we do about the the you know the the shia leaders in iraq that are fully in the pocket and fully in the interest of iran instead of the iraqis um you know other people can speak about this more intelligently than i can uh i never believed that iraqis want to be dominated by the iranians [Music] and you saw the demonstrations that are taking place those demonstrations were very important because it was shi's revolting against a shiite government sponsored by a she nation across the street across the yeah across the boundaries uh i think there's a great deal of estrangement between iranian clerical community and the iraqi clerical community because what the iranian clerical community wants to do is colonize the iraqi clerical community and make it subordinate right so there's a lot of inner religious tension uh the fact that iranians are using iraqi territory as a segue to their grand imperial project the fact that they're using iraqi territory to smuggle and get around sanctions the fact that iraqi corruption is attributed to them the fact that they're corrupting the iraqi politics this has generated considerable degree of resentment against iraq against iran by the iraqis themselves uh you would think we could take advantage of that yeah you would think and uh i assume you believe that we should we should stick it out and not leave iraq i don't know i don't believe we're about to leave i don't think so either although they did just they they requested that we send um diplomats over to be to begin the withdrawal but we'll see how that actually turns out you know how much of that do you think is a show of well i i to be fair iraqis are in a very difficult position yeah because they don't want to be the playground or the venue of u.s iran confrontation right and that's i can see that point yeah they have tried to maintain a relationship with iran and maintain a relationship with the united states and maybe even mediate between the two uh they're in a position where they're subject to extraordinary degree of pressure from the iranians and penetration and they're not entirely certain about american intentions yeah it's one of those things if if you know that america's attention span is a little bit short then it's it's harder to put faith in that relationship and the kurds unfortunately uh recently found that out yeah and um and that's a problem we have with the inconsistency that that you mentioned um but we'll see how that turns out maybe by the time people hear this podcast will be a few more answers to that question um but uh until then maybe we'll have you back on sure with that so hey uh dr ray takei thank you so much for being on this show and uh illuminating uh what uh what is a pretty complex subject thanks thanks for having me

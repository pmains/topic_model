this is a national referendum a referendum on inflation illegal immigration indoctrination and crime at home and humiliation abroad a choice between soaring inflation and skyrocketing energy costs or affordable rents and gas and groceries for you and your family that was House minority leader Kevin McCarthy before President Biden's speech sending out his own warning ahead of the midterm elections joining me now is Arkansas Congressman Bruce Westerman good morning to you Congressman he's a member of the natural resources and transportation and infrastructure committees let me just ask you this because the Biden Administration keeps touting the fact that oil prices and gas prices have come down a little bit from their record highs but if you look at the Futures you can see natural gas is skyrocketing and people are bracing for higher heating costs this winter the pain is far from over and that was indicated by Jerome Powell last week as well your thoughts about the president's speech last night and also where we're headed well good morning Jackie good to be with you and y'all thank the president with just making a political move last night but I think Americans have to look at uh at life two years ago you know the pandemic was uh was much worse but the economy was much better and what has changed Joe Biden and Democrat complete control of Congress that's why it's changed and look at everything that's happened in between Uh Kevin was right we've got some tough times ahead we've been focused a lot on energy and we know energy affects all of the economy what I'm really concerned about our food process which are even outpacing energy on inflation we've had some tough times with agriculture not just here in the U.S but globally and uh with winter coming food prices are going to go higher I think food product food is going to be in more of a shortage and I think it is indeed going to be tough times ahead we need real leadership in Washington and we're just simply not getting that that from this Administration or from Democrats I just meant that last night's speech was a distraction in some ways from the real issues the economy inflation gas and heating prices food prices as you mentioned the Staples that are the kitchen table conversation at the average American family's home in this country people are worried about what's to come and they're worried about um you know their safety their security all these things yeah Jackie I think what Americans want is a secure and prosperous future and this Administration and Democrats in Congress are simply not delivering that we have a plan as Republicans we have a plan to get the economy back on track to actually use our resources that we have here not be reliant on on foreign countries on many of our adversaries you know it's just amazing of what this President does to American energy production to American jobs I've been back in my District in August talking to people and I can tell you the people who are hurting are those that are low income and fixed income where fuel prices and food process have the greatest impact yeah and it's really interesting because there's been a spending spree by the Democrats that started you know the moment Joe Biden came into office and has continued so we add the so-called inflation reduction act another another 739 billion and now the Forgiveness of the student loans the student loan bailout Republican attorneys General are considering lawsuits against President Biden to block the bailout and this is coming as Washington The Washington Post there was a report actually warning that quote a legal battle could carry Stark Financial consequences for millions of student borrowers who Rejoice last week after the Democrats delivered on this long-standing promise to erase some of their debt having said that Congressman um you know many people say the president overstepped his authority in that bailout and that this is something congress should have decided now even Nancy Pelosi uh said that we sent a letter to her asking if she still feels the same way uh but it's hard to keep up with how much money this Administration has spent and they just keep announcing more and more programs and again this student loan forgiveness it hasn't happened yet it's not really a forgiveness it's just it's just shifting the burden from one group of people to another group of people and actually a lot fewer people go to college than uh or don't go to a lot fewer people go to college then go and it's the people who didn't go the hard-working tax paying Americans are going to end up footing the bill for those who end up making more money over their lifetime yeah and a lot of people are angry about that um you know they they say it's just the whole concept behind it is unfair and that this was an obvious push to essentially buy votes ahead of the midterms um but having said that I want to go back to the food prices because I think that's really important too Congressman the Department of Agriculture estimating food production costs they're going to be up 18 in 2022 that's a highest jump that we've seen in history we've seen fertilizer costs going up as well this is a president that you know tried to focus a little bit on on energy by releasing you know the spr but he he didn't go to oil producers and roll back some of the regulations and say you're free to drill you're free to to do this he also missed the boat when it comes to Agriculture and the farmers that are hurting in this country yeah and Jackie this is the United States of America the world's leader in agriculture production the world's leader in Innovation we have the most advanced the best farming practices in the world and we're going to be hurting here at home and it's not because farmers are getting rich it's because input costs are getting so much higher you mentioned uh how natural gas is projected to cost even more that's the main ingredient in fertilizer it's natural gas costs go up then fertilizer costs are going to go up and fertilizer is the main ingredient in agriculture it's pretty simple and it's easy to see how the policies of this Administration are going to hurt in the pocketbook it's going to hurt at the dinner table thank you for making that connection very very important for people to understand how everything is all intertwined it's all related and that's why prices are moving higher because of the policies that we've seen from this Administration Congressman Bruce Westerman good to see you this morning have a wonderful week

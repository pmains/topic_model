am planning and of talking fast and I may be sending a letter with some additional questions but I want to flash back a couple of maybe a couple of weeks ago a month ago where this the Republican caucus met with the president at the White House one of my colleagues Reid Ribble from Wisconsin who is the chairman of a new committee new caucus that he created that I'm a member of the small business owners caucus some would say the job creators caucus got up and said you know mr. president there's three things that those of us in small business are looking for not one is consumer confidence to is credit availability and the third is certainty we're looking for certainty so that we can plan and and that really would be the basis and the foundation for recovery and I want to try to work through a couple of those and I appreciated my my colleague from California talking about housing my background is in real estate and developing and also in construction my family as a ready mix concrete company and I on our gravel company and gravel sand company so i can i can tell you on page three when you talk about residential construction is at extremely low levels that might be the understatement of your remarks especially coming out of michigan for protracted time here we've had some very difficult times but i want to kind of focus in on some what I'm concerned about consumer confidence which you reference on page three of your remarks as well but page eight you reference temporary shocks to the economy and and and I'm looking at that and I'm seeing inflation I'm seeing oil prices at which you know translate directly into at the pump food and commodities and those types of things then on page four you had you had also said that this rise in inflation is transitory and you expect inflation to subside and I'm curious what is going to society I will oil prices gas prices commodity prices are housing prices going to recover so that people are going to have that cushion that you were just talking about i'm curious i want to know what you believe is going to cause that that that confidence to increase well on the question of inflation you know we had substantial increases in oil prices earlier this year there was a better $25 jump per barrel in oil prices after the Libyan revolution began so oil prices were driven up about ten fifteen dollars above where they are now since then they have come down gone sideways so gas prices are down about thirty-five cents something like that so gas prices in oil prices were very big part of the inflation that we saw and that seems to be leveling off and coming down some same way same way with with food a lot of the increase in food prices I have to do with bad weather bad crops they've been some expectations now of much bigger harvests a in corn which is driving down those prices so we're going to see some relief in food prices as well so Aria I'm running out of time and I want to quickly move on to user I understand where you're going I do i do need to express though I was recently in Iraq in Saudi Arabia I had a chance to meet with the oil minister in Iraq share Istani and oil minister in Saudi Arabia both of them said after Libya they actually ramped up their production it is not a production issue we were asking specifics about you know why gas prices were going to be coming in and I broached the subject with his Excellency mr. Sheriff Donny and said what about the US dollar in the valuation of the US dollar he paused and kind of looked at me he said congressman I was trying to be polite they recognize that what we've done by devaluing our dollar as an artificial increase in oil prices because oil is paid for one way around the world US dollars and I'm concerned about that as well and I'm curious if you can address that well the falling dollar which is fallen for a lot of reasons by the way including a reduced safe haven demand and so on has contributed some to increase in oil prices but have an estimation that were the only factor that were the only factor prices and euros and other currencies would be going down in fact prices are rising in all currency so it's not just the dollar not accord to the two oil ministers it's a fact that prices are rising an old currency well we can maybe address that in some some of our dialogue but yeah and I'm concerned my wife is from Canada originally 18 years ago and I had the opportunity to marry her it took 64 cents to buy a u.s. 64 cents us to buy a Canadian dollar yesterday that was a dollar for to buy a Canadian dollar and and i just i simply don't see how we are not going to have to or how we are not going to avoid inflation in the future and isn't that sort of a consequence of some of our monetary policy as we're moving forward there are two separate concepts the buying power of the dollar which is inflation domestically and then the exchange value of the dollar externally which is what you're talking about we have kept inflation low and steady since the 80s internally internally yes and as far as the monetary policy is concerned the one thing we can really do is support the dollar is to keep our inflation rate low and that's what we've done so the reason the dollar is falling over long periods of time has to do with things like flows in the trade deficit and flows of capital in that in and out of the country and not not I'll do to us printing money Thank You Michele thang thang

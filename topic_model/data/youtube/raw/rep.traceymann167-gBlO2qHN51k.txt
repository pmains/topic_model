hi everybody tracy here with a quick man minute yesterday on the floor of the house i voted against the continuing resolution what this is is it funds the government for only three weeks it's far past time in my mind that we return to regular order that congress functions as it should where we have an annual budget where instead of just kicking down the kicking the can down the road for uh for a few months and this is three weeks we need to have serious talks about what the budget should be how do we reduce spending how do we get our fiscal house in order so that's something that happened this week also this week yesterday i introduced a veterans affairs bill that would make it better that would really help our veterans by improving the ability of whistleblowers to come forward with issues concerns those type of things i'm really happy to introduce that here in the house yesterday getting ready in a few minutes for a teletown hall so you might receive a phone call um asking you to join that also i think so far this year we've got about 20 town halls all over the district if we've not been to your county yet we will certainly be in your county in the next in the next few months so as always reach out to me anytime the other thing i'm really excited about is i've been taking the floor of the house a lot to give a farmville impact series basically talking about the next farm bill you know expires in 2023 uh providing commentary on it what needs to be included with some things that could be improved so feel free to reach out to my office at any time about that as well until next time have a great day thanks

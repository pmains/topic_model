secretary Walsh I want to thank you for your patience and I also want to take this opportunity to thank you for your visit to Northwest Indiana where we advocated for the bipartisan infrastructure Bill along with the steel industry along with the United steelworkers that being said I also want to take this opportunity to Advocate my strong support for the section 232 policies in order to protect our steel industry from over capacity and all the downstream Industries within my district of Northwest Indiana that being said there's been an increase in reshoring of domestic Manufacturing in the United States I just want to give you an opportunity to be able to talk about the bipartisan Innovation Act and the value of that to the workforces for the future yeah I I think that we a lot has been discussed here today we talked about we've talked about inflation several times we've talked about Workforce Development several times we've talked about issues around training and Workforce Development and job training apprenticeships and and the the opportunity in front of us with the bipartisan Innovation Act is really about bringing real strong manufacturing jobs back to America we invented the chip we invented the computer chip and everything that we have the computer the TV in front of me the two phones in my pocket the iPads and my my desk all that stuff needs computer chips the cars we drive everything we have and we don't create them in America and the bipartisan Innovation act would allow us the opportunity to create these computer chips back where we create we invented them so why not create build them here in America would help us not with not with inflation today but long term would help us with inflation creating Pathways into good jobs in Indiana and Michigan and Wisconsin all these places that Iowa all these different Congress people that we're here today talking at Virginia talking about their industry every one of those cities including Massachusetts has a part of the state that that is not the same as it was 50 years ago because the manufacturing base left we have such an opportunity to bring back good good jobs manufacturing back the United States of America the bipartisan Innovation Act is probably I would I would argue I myself in trouble saying this this potentially is bigger than the the infrastructure bill that was passed by this Congress this year because you're talking about long-term we'll build New Roads new Bridges clean drinking water Broadband but we're talking about creating a pathway for good paying jobs in communities all across America but we're also talking about being less reliant on Foreign imports can't agree with you more have been advocating for the Innovation act consistently with those same thought processes and to even create the ecosystem as I talked about Gary Indiana produces steel car manufacturers they wait for those chips they wait for those semiconductors and when they stop production those workers stop working in my community then the steel workers stop working that's why I have been advocating for that bill from the very beginning and then for the future I want to be at the seat at the table just to make sure that Indiana northwest Indiana is one of those Innovation hubs creating the next future job for the next future Generations I also have a next question about whistleblowers if I could secretary Congress and the public have benefited from whistleblower testimony in fact the study that has found that whistleblowing is highly effective at detecting improper and illegal activity and that whistleblowers were responsible for 43 percent of the fraud detection the voice of whistleblowers has led to improved safety in the workplace protection of workers rights and helped improve the Dignity of work however whistleblowers to the Federal Trade Commission the FTC are not protected from retaliation and therefore take their information to the Securities and Exchange Commission rather than the FTC regrettably whistleblowers from private companies are not protected by the SEC and currently have no protections my question is would the Department of Labor review the FTC whistleblower Act of 2021 which creates a right of action for whistleblower whistleblowers to have suffered retaliation for disclosing a violation of any law rule regulation or order enforced by the Federal Trade Commission let me my answer to that is let me look in to see what jurisdiction we have what we can do as a department I'm not aware of it at the moment I know somebody scrambling behind me to try and get me a paper right now but let me get back to you on that one I thank you very much I appreciate what you're doing and again let's work together as we have in the past to make sure working men and women have a future and an opportunity to provide for their families and you brought up Gary Indiana Working Families Diner great burgers in there absolutely thank you sir

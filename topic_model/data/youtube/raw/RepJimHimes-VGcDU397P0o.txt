Thank You mr. chairman and director it's to welcome you back before the committee again I want to associate my some of the comments of mr. clay the achievements of your organization is a new organization really speak for themselves and they speak with numbers and those numbers are in the billions of dollars of a relief that you have provided to consumers for behavior that frankly either side of the aisle I think would agree is not the kind of behavior we would want our constituents subjected to so I want to say thank you for your very good work I frankly director we've talked about this before I don't really understand the deregulatory thrust of my friends on the other side of the aisle I think we all agree consumers can make their own choices but we all know that across the board whether it's our toaster our automobile the insulation in the house or whatever it is we do have standards so that consumers are not taking advantage of somehow my friends on the other side of the aisle seem to believe that ink you know in contrast to the fact you can't buy a toaster that will burn your house down yah to be able perhaps if you so choose two digit by a mortgage that will burn your house down I don't get that and of course you know we see in the guise of reform ideas that would ultimately hamstring your ability to do what you have done ideas like appropriating funds and appropriating your budget of course that would make you the only regulator out there whose budget was appropriated and subject to the tender mercies of the politics of this Congress so I do want to thank you for what you do as I always do director I do also want to say while you go after the bad guys doing bad things please be very very careful of our smaller banks I continue to hear that they sort of feel like CFPB is a in there quite a bit and you're doing great work but please do be mindful of our smaller Bank

with that be happy to answer any pensions if you were to raise money in Congress how would that money get there sure so humanitarian money flows through partner organizations like America's but it also ends up in UN programs that are run on the ground delivering shelter and humanitarian relief and food many of these refugees will end up outside of Syria and so we can partner with countries that are taking many of these refugees so you know we have a long-standing history of supporting refugee relief all around the world we know how to do it we do it well and right now Congress needs to appropriate money in order to increase the assistance for people that are fleeing their homes well obviously you know we have not been in session since the news broke on Sunday night so we'll be returning to to Washington on Monday and we'll get a better sense of what is what's possible legislatively you want to change mine so what what do you think it would take I think the chances are the chances are slim that the president is going to change his mind and it may be too late when the offensive has begun the airstrikes are happening as we speak Turkish troops are moving in but it's not impossible that the president couldn't remove his green light at the very least he could work to come to an understanding with air Dewan as to where this offensive will take place how long it will last and to assure that the rules of conduct in conflict are followed but the president doesn't seem interested in any of that he just gave the green light to air Taiwan to do whatever he wanted in northeastern Syria and then he seems to have washed his hands of the whole endeavor so the chances are not great that the president will change his mind but that doesn't mean that we should stop trying so there has been some interest in imposing sanctions against Turkey I have concerns about that approach first it's not going to stop the war it's not going to save the Kurds second it relies upon the president enacting the sanctions the Congress has actually already imposed sanctions on Turkey for some of their other bad behavior in the region the president has refused to enact those sanctions so I worry that sanctions could give Congress the sense that it has done something without actually changing the reality on the ground so I'm you know I've expressed interest in talking about sanctions legislation but I'm not sure that that's going to make a meaningful difference I also think you listen I mean people like Lindsey Graham who to have a lot of influence over the president should be using that influence in using that leverage instead of giving up on the president and the White House and running to pass a sanctions bill that might not actually change the situation Trump just doesn't listen to it or what is the status as somebody who with McCain those guys have been talking about Syria for ages yeah no I just I don't know why you know these Republicans continue to protect the president you know I'm not sure what they're getting out of this you know relationship they believe to have with him given that he didn't check with any of them before he abandoned our partners in in Syria so you know they are they are his protectors today they are shilling for him every day and every night when it comes to the corruption he's been involved in overseas and yet he doesn't seem to take care he doesn't seem to he doesn't seem to listen to any of the people who are his primary protectors what do you foresee I think that's probably I would probably regret trying to predict what what Syria will look like a month or two months from now the Kurds aren't going to stand still they're going to look for someone else who will protect them if not the United States and that might be the Assad regime I mean the Kurds don't have many places to go other than to Assad so you might end up with a situation in which Assad is the primary beneficiary of this move and he ends up regaining control over parts of Syria that he does not control today so at the end of this you will likely have tens of thousands of Kurds murdered Isis back on the march and Assad stronger than ever before with Russia crowing on the sidelines right tell me how that is in the US security interests of the United States yeah I don't have you know I don't have the answer to that I don't know listen clearly air Doan has been previewing for a long time that he has wanted to march into northeastern Syria and Trump has been previewing for a long time that he was likely going to let them do it so none of this is a is a surprise but it doesn't mean that it isn't any less unconscionable communitarian operations are running as normal but as the senator mentioned there are already thousands who have been displaced and we anticipate over the days and weeks and possibly months to come that's gonna put additional pressure as more individuals are displaced on our partners and so we are absolutely looking at putting additional resources to this issue we already have additional shipments that are being built and are underway so we would love the continued support of our community here in Connecticut and around the globe to make sure that humanitarian humanitarian community continues to have the opportunity to make an impact here recent knowing of anything at the time right before the offensive so artists continue to operate as normal these are partners who have been there for many many years and who are just committed to staying these are some of the most impressive and dedicated professionals that I have ever had the opportunity to connect with serious the Syrian crisis is actually our longest ongoing response currently and we've been responding since 2012 so that number has been since that date 2012 Kurt well let me thank as Adam Kate and will for all of the heroic work that they do and thank you all for joining us here today

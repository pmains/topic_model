mm the senator from Oregon mr. president a senator klobuchar noted Democrats and Republicans are here to talk about this critically important issue and that is protecting the franchise for our people and I want to begin mr. president by saying the ink is barely dry on the indictment of the Russian hackers who tried to undermine our democracy and the president of the United States is trying to deny that it actually happened just put your arms around that one for a moment colleagues the indictment the Russian hackers is just days old the president's own intelligence officials are telling him that an attack on our democracy is a near certainty and he has just not been willing to step up and prevent it in fact he continues to refuse to accept the basic facts of the attack the Russians perpetrated in 2016 the fact however is Americans are learning more and more about what actually happened and it is becoming increasingly clear that what the president calls a witch-hunt is turning up a lot of witches the attack on our democracy was plotted and perpetrated by agents of the Russian government it came from the very top it wasn't perpetrated by some other unidentified country and it wasn't some random fella in his mom's basement it was Russia and somehow the president is to mesmerised by Vladimir Putin to admit that now the public learned from the indictments on sealed in the last several days that Russian intelligence officials hacked in to the computers of the Democratic National Committee stole data and planted surveillance software they were basically hoovering up voter data that belonged to a half million Americans they targeted our election infrastructure and searched for vulnerabilities that might have allowed them to get an effect the results a Russian national with ties to Russian intelligence intelligence used what was called a quote gun rights organization to infiltrate conservative circles and sway our political judgments those are the facts mr. president and colleagues and no matter how the president twists himself into a pretzel to try to describe it otherwise those are the realities in our election system and our digital infrastructure are still exceptionally vulnerable to attack the president's Director of National Intelligence our former colleague has said and I quote not months ago recently the lights are blinking red so our colleague Senator Leahy senator Klobuchar are looking at an important investment of funds to assist the states and there is no question in my mind looking at this challenge this will be a challenge that benefits from the additional funds since this is a national problem the director of Homeland Security said in response to my question you know we don't ask Delaware or Oregon or small towns if you're dealing with an attack on your democracy we don't say to a small town in Delaware or Oregon where you figure out how to do it we treat it as something where we come together as Americans to tackle the problem so we are going to need additional funds for tacking attacking this extraordinarily important challenge and I'm gonna be heading home for townhall meetings we have these sessions throw up in the doors everybody's welcome and folks are going to hear about what we're talking about in election security and folks are gonna say run what are the best ideas out there for stopping the Russians from hacking our elections and I will say to my colleagues we're gonna talk some more about this cyber security experts are overwhelmingly united on what is best for stopping the Russian hackers overwhelmingly this country's cybersecurity experts people who aren't Democrats and Republicans they're people who are knowledgeable in this field say the two things you need most our paper ballots and risk limiting audits those two things paper ballots and risk limiting audits tens of millions of Americans today have no choice but to vote on unsecured machines that might as well have the words scrawled on them please hack me comrade in Russian that's pretty much what you get with these unsecured voting machines the voting machine industry I think I've talked about this with my friends in Delaware has basically considered themselves above the law they have refused to share vital information about their operations with me the Intelligence Committee even basic questions what are really called issues relating to cyber hygiene but what we know is some of these voting machines have actually come pre-installed with remote monitoring software which the cyber security experts will tell you is a recipe for disaster the experts also will tell you that barcode ballot marking devices are not the heart of a solution to really secure elections and when you ask the companies that manufacture these machines they are ducking and weaving when they're asked even the most basic and straightforward questions about how they're protecting American voters so colleagues as we move to start this extraordinary important debate I want to be clear about what I think the most important challenge is our most important job is to build a new partnership between the states and localities and the federal election officials that actually protects American voters from getting hacked by the Russians that's what this is all about actually making sure we provide that added measure of assistance and security for American voters in the name of supporting that cause I proposed legislation called the pave act that in effect says we gotta build around common sense and what the independent cybersecurity experts say is important paper ballots and post election audits that in my view is the heart of what we ought to be looking for ways to support if a polling place starts Election Day with a line of people out the door it ought to end the day with a stack of paper ballots that is half proof a verifiable system that the Russians cannot touch if the United States is gonna go along with business as usual an election security status quo of paperless machines and not very many audits not effective audits you're almost leaving ballot boxes on street corners in Red Square so I'm going to close this way when you have a debate dis important about election security what it's really about is whether Americans can trust that control of our democracy is actually in their hands the easiest way to destroy what has certainly been waning confidence Americans have in our elections is to leave election systems vulnerable attack that is practically a surefire way to limit voter participation and it certainly is going to generate a new firestorm of conspiracy theories in every American election from here on so what I say to my colleagues and Senator Coons who really is the gold standard for working with colleagues trying to bring people together find approaches that make sense for our people he and I have talked I think we've agreed we'll take a good idea from anywhere in sight there's a good idea on this side of the aisle we're interested if there's a good idea over here we're interested the good idea here in terms of protecting the votes of the American people the American people who have been threatened by Russian hackers with the evidence as recently as a few days ago with the indictments the best way according to people who aren't in politics and are knowledgeable in the field is to have paper ballots and riffed limiting audits and as long as I have the honor to represent Oregon in the United States Senate will sure be talking about this at townhall meetings this weekend I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to advance that kind of approach which i think is the surest path to block those Russian hackers from doing again and again and again what they did to us in this past election the president I yield the floor mr. president senator from Delaware

senator Todd young Republican from Indiana serves in the Foreign Relations Committee how you doing senator and good morning to you today nice to have you it's good to be with you what's the next move well look I think the President did the right thing he stepped away from the table and now appears were prepared to ramp up economic sanctions and resume the campaign of strategic pressure abandoning the previous campaign of strategic patience which many administration's successively had adopted so you have to credit this president with giving us a shot at causing the North Koreans to pull back from weapons development and I think the answer is to continue pressure in a bipartisan way you know these sanctions are crushing him you know that right I think we can admit that it really strangling his economy he's looking for some sort of edge economically to get on a better financial footing but Trump and Pompeyo will have none of it and you have to really wonder what who makes the next move does Kim get on one knee and come back to the table or does Kim fire off a missile or tester Rockets sometime over the weekend in the coming weeks look we still have arrows in our quiver with respect to ramping up economic sanctions we need to pressure the Chinese to stop providing food fuel and sustenance to the North Korean regime we need to pressure our other partners there with whom we have strong economic relationships to also help us crank up the economic thumbscrews if you will against the North Korean regime and I think that's what we're going to see in coming weeks we want to resolve this of course not through diplomatic but through diplomatic and economic means not through military means and the only way we're going to do that is to have a credible threat of military force so our military's in the area as well so the Kim jong-un knows that this president is serious I'd say being in Hanoi last week I just had one question on my mind the whole time is chairman kim ready to change and i don't think we have that answer do you you know we really don't have that answer there's the fundamental question of whether he would ever give up his nuclear weapons under any circumstances that's a question that this president commendably is exploring and I think we need to have okay bill Richardson from earlier on our program today said this about what's happening I believe that both sides need to reassess their position I do think that some kind of agreement will be reached not at complete denuclearization but it should be at lower levels the negotiators not the president the president should not go into another summit like he did this last time he might be right about that but I think the whole idea was the let Kim show what he is willing to put on the table and you can only do that when you hear it from his own mouth and I think that's what happened last week I talked about the green you just want to say something about that well I you know look I respect Bill Richardson his service to our country but he's been part of those lower-level negotiations in the past and what have we seen we've seen continued weapons development and it's it's sort of Lucy pulling away the football and this president recognizes we needed a game changer changer and he's been part of that so I commend him for that thank you sir back to the Greek yeah go ahead read New Deal let me just set it up for you cuz Politico writes about of the following way Senate Democrats have figured out how to dodge Republican attempts to trap them on the green new deal though present that attacked GOP lawmakers is anti-science climate deniers but the strategy puts Democrats in the awkward position of backing away from a proposal that has garnered support from a half dozen the parties senators running for president how do you see that sir that's a pretty weak handed strategy this thing's gonna cost 95 trillion dollars that's 65 grand per American household per year now I can tell you who's your family certainly aren't prepared to pay for that they're not prepared to ride their bikes to work or tear down their houses and rebuild them in the way that this plan would have them do so they're not prepared to abandon air travel to go visit with family members so look I'm all for protecting our environment it's something I care deeply about and we in Indiana do a really good job with respect to our conservation efforts but we don't have to destroy our environment we don't know through this sort of big government program we can protect our environment keep this economy moving in which we've been able to do under Republican leadership here in Washington and I want to be part of that movement forward thank you sir senator Todd young from Indiana nice to have you back in the program thank you yeah thanks so much bill

hello everybody representative derek kilmer here welcoming you back to another edition of my ask Derek video series where I open up my mail and answer a question or two from folks back home this month Barbara and bremerton wrote in to express her anger and disappointment over the talk about another potential government shutdown Barbara I understand how you feel for the second time in two years Congress continues to play a dangerous game of political brinksmanship we just narrowly wrapped up a spending measure to fund our federal agencies until December honestly it's hard for me to explain the inexplicable imagine if of business had a management disagreement with the solution be to simply turn out the lights no way and yet once again we saw members of Congress proclaim that if they don't get their way on specific policy matters they won't support a funding bill that's right 0 our region can't afford refusal to compromise our region can't afford another harmful government shutdown you know two years ago we saw the impact of a 16-day government shutdown in our region it wasn't pretty we saw workers at our naval installation and a neighboring Joint Base lewis-mcchord face furloughs at the time I spoke to Realtors who had closings fall through because of those furloughs we saw the Olympic National Park shut down hurting employees tourists and local businesses that depend on local tribes social service providers and others faced funding interruptions the damage wasn't unique to our area nationwide we saw this shutdown cost our economy more than twenty four billion dollars crab fishermen in Alaska lost thousands of dollars a day in revenue and the Small Business Administration couldn't review around 700 applications for a hundred and forty million dollars in loans and that's just the tip of the iceberg so today I'm saying that it's time for Congress to act like adults it's time to end the grandstanding and take care of our nation's finances this shouldn't be hard to do we shouldn't face threats to turn our federal government's lights off just to advance a policy priority and I'll tell you I'll keep pushing for common sense and more responsible budgeting related to a government shutdown is Congress's continual failure to lift the sequestration caps on our nation's budget Catherine and Tacoma raised this in a letter to me for those of you who haven't followed this sequestration was put into law into a lot called the Budget Control Act it was included as a poison pill to force democrats and republicans in the house and in the Senate to come together and support a smarter approach to our nation's long-term fiscal challenges it wasn't it wasn't put there as an idea that it was good policy it was intentionally intended to be so non-strategic so thoughtless that it would force folks in DC to work it out and unfortunately Congress swallowed the poison pill again no family and no business during difficult budget times would blindly make across the board deep cuts across the board they would prioritize they wouldn't depend on gimmicks and that's what sequestration is it's a gimmick I've always said sequestration is a latin word for stupid and that continues to hold true if we lock those deep spending caps in place that means we have to do things like make deep cuts to infrastructure investment in education and national research those things that are critical to keeping us one step ahead of our competitors it also leads to proposals like one that went through the House Appropriations Committee the hindered FEMA their federal emergency management agencies pre disaster mitigation funding that's a program that's critical the state and local governments to invest in prevention and protection against severe storms and disasters funding for this vital program would be set at just 25 million dollars for the entire country that's a more than 175 million dollar cut for the President's budget Congress needs to do better Congress needs to end these harmful across-the-board cuts and focus on how we can build a better future for all Americans so please know that I'm continuing to add my voice and hopes of finding a smarter path forward and we'll keep at it so thanks for tuning in and please keep the mail coming

that's hurting every american family and we're going to have some real have to have some real solutions and we're going to have to get some relief pretty quickly as we well know and everything on the table considered in my opinion mr ness as we have seen in this year and last year the united states fossil fuel industry has been under attack by adversarial energy policies executive orders and federal regulations intended to these industries how do these actions contribute to the instability and unpredictability of the energy market as a whole senator hyde smith u.s oil production today is a little less than 2 million barrels a day less than what it was uh in 20 2020 2019. so we do need to increase our oil and gas production that will have a direct impact as the world's largest producer on the world supply of oil and decrease ultimately increase gas gasoline prices at the pump as the previous speaker mentioned what we have seen on the oil and gas industry coming off a very very rough period through covid we have just seen an onslaught beginning with cancellation of the keystone xl pipeline then the cancellation of federally mandated lease leasing requirements on federal lands everything has been slow walked and we see now the the creep of uh climate requirements into permits leases all of the provisions that operators need to do to get those permits uh out and put together a development plan that they can then bring to wall street to attract the type of capital they need to drill drill and expand and grow oil production in our in our country so uh we see this uh throughout our office and in north dakota on a regular basis we're commenting against federal rules and doing whatever we can but again back to those financial markets it can start today with a message to the financial sector to investors to workers to everybody that we need american energy of all of all sources we certainly lead that effort in north dakota we think it's possible our energy sectors can work together quite well in our state grow the production of all senators certainly senator holman has been a huge champion of that so we can do this but we need we need to get away from the transition uh away from to a transition to cleaner energy of all sources and we think the bakken's the cleanest barrel in the world and certainly american barrels are much cleaner than the barrels that we're uh seeking for other countries to send our way so uh we hope it starts here and uh produce more american energy of all types because we're going to need it i totally agree and it did not start soon enough how would energy prices as well as prices at the pump be affected if the department of interior were to swiftly finalize the five-year plan the leasing program for the outer continental shelf and conduct quarterly onshore oil and gas lease sales with of course equitable terms chairman hyde smith some of those plans of course are long-range plans but the message to the market in the world is immediate and when you begin to do that as i mentioned in my comments the bully pulpit has power and that message to investors into the investment community into the markets is strong that america is going to stand up produce more american oil and natural gas the russian equation must be factored into this it's a geopolitical issue at this point not just the pain that all of our constituents and your constituents are feeling when they pull up to the pump you're exactly right to hurt putin's ability to weaponize russian energy against us and our allies okay one other thing well i've got about a minute left and to you again mr ness i want to look at the necessity of natural gas pipeline infrastructure americans are obviously seeing and feeling the effects of the cancellation of the keystone pipeline and you will expand on will you expand on the importance of the natural gas pipeline infrastructure and while also looking at a streamlined permitting process and should congress authorize critical energy infrastructure projects to support the production processing and the delivery of energy senator hyde smith infrastructure is key to not only energy development but to lowering energy prices because of the movement from the production areas to the consuming areas to the refining areas and certainly the marcellus shale is not in my backyard but i know that the ability of that shale play is incredible to produce more natural gas we can not only supply our own citizens but we comply supply our friends and allies and we have certainly seen that in the bakken as we have we're now moving 700 000 barrels a day from the bakken to our largest refining center in louisiana gulf coast every single day responsibly reliably quietly environmentally soundly through the dakota access pipeline it's an incredible asset to our nation to be able to supply our own refineries in america with with homemade american bakken oil versus libyan oil venezuelan oil opec oil yeah just makes sense thank you guys for coming and being willing to testify today and i certainly appreciate it and my time is out

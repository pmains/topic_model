all across the state of Nevada and in SoCal - it's live and local now of course that also means that includes CD - where since 2011 mark Amodei has served proudly congressman Emmett a joins us from his office in our nation's capitol on our City National Bank guest hotline congressman the first question I got to ask you what's life like in the minority hey well Kevin it's nobody's first pick I can tell you that but it is diff do you find you don't have as many lobbyists coming through your door or you obviously you're not chairman of any subcommittees or committees so maybe your workload is lamb you know what is different for you in the minority well here's the and you've kind of hit on some of it it's like the the workload in terms of people who want to see somebody who's in the majority on the Appropriations Committee after 30 days is definitely less people are trying to get in to see you the workload in general is is all that stuff that goes on normally takes up whatever space has been open up in that and that's in terms of hey we got some problems with the railroad and in Elko we got some problems you know we're still working on national issues like obviously immigrations when everybody's thinking about but there's still healthcare work to be done there's still infrastructure work to be done you know all that other sort of stuff so the space fills up but I can tell you this we're not adding we're not adding any staff yeah I was just gonna say you kind of like the Maytag repairman you know it's kind of a lonely lonely gig I guess you would say you you reopened the government but now we've got a February 15th deadline do you take the president at his word that he might invoke a national emergency you know and and I'm speculating but here's my speculation for what it's worth and and I hope I'm wrong but I don't know how you say some of the stuff that some folks said about about barriers and border security and then go back later and say well actually it turns out although Kevin if you start looking around there's about 60 DS that said they think that barriers are a part of the mix and some of them are committee chairmen and some of them are steady Steny Hoyer and so we'll see I hope I'm wrong but it's but I can tell you this I don't think that there's any reverse in that pickup called Donald Trump in terms of we've got issues that need to be dealt with on the southwestern border and we're going to deal with them and and our primary input on how to deal with them is going to be the people who are actually working on the ground down there and guess what barriers are a part of the mix they're not the whole thing Kevin you know people forget it's like listen it's 1,900 miles we've got about 600 miles controlled now are you going to build one across the remaining or build a wall since that's everybody's lazy term across the other 1200 no you're gonna mix you're going to mix barriers where they're appropriate with roads where they're appropriate with with drones where they're appropriate with sensors with it's a mix but but to go hey guess what that's not one of the tools in your chest makes absolutely no sense we're a barrier in some of those segments is it is the best way to go and it's not because Donald Trump says it or Mark emiti says it it's because the people the professionals that work down there say this is what works best here and it's based on the homework and the history and the whatever so you know you know the challenge is like anything else if you can D politicize the thing that's never going to happen and just did it on the facts there would there would there would be nothing really to argue about which is why a whole bunch of them thought it was a good idea in 2006 but are you hearing in the cloakroom in in the in the house gymnasium the workout facility are when you talk to Democrats are they telling you privately yeah there's nothing wrong with a wall or no metal slats or whatever whatever you choose to call it are you hearing this from individual members Kevin that's not privately that stuff that's been said in the last 30 days Wow yeah I mean I'll tell you what why don't you here's something just for the fun of it because I saw some core one of them was a standing Hoyer quote a googol Steny Hoyer and-and-and-and barriers or walls or what ever the lazy term is and it'll come up well I know I know that in that in that Thursday song and dance that they do with with Steve Scalise that he mentioned that he wasn't adverse to a wall or that it's not I think the word way that it's not immoral so Steny Hoyer is on record I'm just curious though because I know Ann Coulter and a lot of conservatives accused the president of caving to Nancy Pelosi did he cave or is this part of a grand strategy you think to get what he wants well I'll just tell you this Kevin here's here's another fact point for people to check out don't take my word for it you name for me the shutdown that accomplished what either side wanted to have accomplished and and so I've only been here seven and almost a half years but I was a guy who voted to shut it down in 2013 over the health care thing and I was one of the guys who voted to keep it shut you know that old saying don't take a hostage you're not willing to shoot so guess what I speak from both sides of we didn't gain a thing in the health care in the whole health care thing by shutting things down Schumer shuts it down not too long ago over the doctor thing guess what when that one was done doctor had not moved down the road both issues which need to be addressed and moved down the road so with all due respect to Ann Coulter and Laura Ingraham it's like ladies I don't know maybe they're the only two people that are blessed with with absolute perfection and correctness a hundred percent of the time but it's like it wasn't accomplishing anything shutting down the Department of you name it to get somebody to do some on this is like you know what quite frankly it wasn't working so I mean you can keep doing it to prove that you're dug in but ultimately the proof in the pudding is going to be what happened on the southwest border and guess what that's why I think they're like I hope I'm wrong but there's been nothing historically to say okay everybody's going to come to Jesus now and we're going to get something and before Valentine's Day and yeehaw which is why I'd say like listen I wouldn't shut it down again I just say okay here's how we're going without you and you know the other piece is that the and by the way are you talking about a national emergency or yeah well or whatever I mean I don't know it's like listen what if the Congress won't do its duty which quite frankly is in the Constitution the Congress will regulate a system of naturalization if I'm not word-for-word it's in there and you know me I'm not a I'm not a constitutional genius but that language is in there and so it's like easy that the president should be mad it's like Congress it's your job but if you won't do it so what's I think it is the beauty of what he did like okay we're paying everybody again Congress if you won't do it you got three more weeks and then guess what I'm going to do some so whether it's national emergency or something but short of that and you should also know Kevin will send you the data there's a couple hundred miles already under construction for what we did form in last year's budget this is this year's budget and the problem is it's like so there's progress being made but quite frankly it's like hey with any major capital improvement project that is almost two thousand miles long it takes some time to get that you know through the Corps of Engineers you know here's the fact that not a lot of people know we don't own the border there's large stretches of that that are private property you know that amendment when the bill arrives so if it's not a willing buyer willing seller thing where somebody wants to sell us enough of their stuff along the border to build these things then you got to condemn it so it's one of those things that'll take some time but that's another one of the quite frankly in justices that a lot of the national reporting has done which is like oh hey this is a light switch if we win this it won't get built or if we win this it will get built it's like listen it's ongoing again congressman mark Amodei joining us from cd2 he's at his desk in our nation's capitol doing the the work of congressional district 2 I know that the the interim FBI director or I'm sorry the Attorney General is is saying that it's time to wrap up or or or mark or rather robert muller is close to wrapping up is he close to wrapping up and are you ready for him to wrap up I'm ready for him to wrap up I don't know whether he is is and I thought that from from coming from the Attorney General was was good news I hope it's accurate you know it's like any of these it's it's like do people have a right to know what went on they absolutely do should it be something where it's drip drip drip no and so it's like listen I think there's been a lot of time and so unless there's some investigative reason worth where you don't have all it's time to basically write your report would so which will be a rodeo when it comes out no matter what and let's let's move on because the the the the premise on which it was started I think is that there can be no doubt what's what's gone on hasn't gone on and it's probably more of what hasn't gone on based on what the indictments have have done it's like okay so we have that you've got this this tool in the process you've used it give us your work product and let's move on and and so I'm assuming you are for releasing the entire report to the general public not just parts of it redacted and parts of it not and you get the whole bit of this and a little bit of that well you know here's the thing kevin is it was it's all public business yeah so it's not like hey we got some secret deal and you know we got an airplane that nobody can see or or we got whatever it's like listen the accusation is is that there was collusion that's not national security stuff so tell us what you found out or didn't find out and let the people be the judge well I tell you what it's gonna be a fascinating few weeks if indeed he is wrapping it up and maybe there even as we speak writing the report congressman it's always fun I'm glad we got a chance to visit with you next time you're you're in this part of the state come on by will we'll treat you to some awful coffee okay hey yeah and you know what I'm looking forward to that could because you know wintertime is a good time to be in Las Vegas when you're a guy from up to there and I am you'll be seeing me shortly I hope so mark thanks so much man always good thank you so much for joining us yes sir we'll see you there you have a congressman mark Hamid a joining us from our nation's capital as any and he he says hey this is the people's business maybe we are entitled big doings that they are and see we'll talk about that more coming up live and local now [Music]

vestigation subcommittee mr. McHenry for five minutes well I want to thank my colleague on the other side of the aisle for bringing up those issues it sounds like he doesn't it's not really about Volker these talking about because bear and laymen didn't have a single deposit they're not depository institutions so the concerns that he raises her genuine ones and concerns that we've raised in a series of hearings on too big to fail in the oversight subcommittee the chairman is directed and the concerns we raised as a as a question of this is the scheme that dodd-frank puts in place that does not end too big to fail mr. Johnson would you agree with that that concern that we have that dodd-frank does not end too big to fail too big to fail is still with us congressman but unfortunately all of the all of the previously what we producing to his investment banks have now converted to become bank holding exactly when we talked that's an important part of the issue you can't and that's why I agree with mr. Lynch that these things are bundled together on a forward-looking basis whatever you think happened in the crisis right it's all bank holding companies but but Volcker actually doesn't end up protecting the taxpayer which is a genuine concern I have that institutions private sector institutions when they fail that the taxpayers become on the hook for this and look we've had good conversations about this as well but but the question I have for the panel today can you put a dollar amount on the cost the economic consequence of Volcker as is now set in stone by the regulators mr. Benson do you have a dollar amount no sir we can't because we're mr. funk do you have a dollar amount no sir all right mr. Johnson our professor Johnson suck yeah yeah yes congressman I think it's it's part of what's being displayed on on the wall here the quarter the Congressional Budget Office the effect of the financial crisis is to increase our debt over the cycle by battery I'm asking I'm 50 percent of GDP half of GDP call that a trillion a trillion dollars because of the financial crisis and depth of recession extra Volker local rule addresses precisely the way in which these largest bank holding companies as they are now can take risk can disrupt the economy their ability to do that understand I've got limited time and chairman's using the gavel today very very well I'm glad I got to ask a question before noon so but to your point mr. professor Johnson for me as a policymaker I can't simply say well Volker just saved us eight trillion dollars mr. cans do you have a dollar amount okay the dollar amount i have the seven billion dollars if the market moves ten percent it could be great could be greater than that but that's the amount that would impact the clo market unless there is some remedy very very quickly mr. Johnson i'm sorry mr. Robertson sorry there's there's absolutely no way to put a dollar figure okay so part of the concern is this we have as a matter that secures an exchange commission written policy that they will have a cost-benefit analysis before they codify rules we've had a lot of good ideas across the whole panel here today on ways to improve the Volcker rule as it's written if it's going to be there there's some genuine concerns that we can mitigate the downside of this and in and yet at the same time if we had an interim final rule we could resolve these things without in real time market consequences in the way that in the rush of these five regulators to get things done they've done in the rush was to get it to get the rule done codified in rolling and then try to tweak it in real time the trucks issue is a great example of this so I have an additional question mr. Benson who is the primary enforcer a Volker there's not a primary enforcer and are in our view there are five enforcers and maybe six if you add FINRA to the mix which I think ultimately the SEC will look to FINRA to do mr. funk I mean as a as a bank and look you've got we got plenty of regulators right we are a publicly traded banks so for us it would be three it would be the SEC it would be the FDIC and would be the Federal Reserve okay so professor Johnson's final moment I've got uh you as we said too big to fail is still with us you have been an advocate of simplicity simple institutions simple regulations what is happening in Great Britain within what Andy Haldane is done terms of this discussion on simplicity this is a complex rule and it would you think that there's a better approach to this I mean you you what you said is this provides a quote good chance that will reduce risk you're really not willing to go on the line and say this absolutely will read it reduce you know risk you're saying that's a good chance briefly I think it depends on the on the implementation I very worried a lot about this number up here and I don't understand congressman why you with your justified concerns about this number cannot draw the link the very obvious link between the depth of financial crisis in the future and the entire

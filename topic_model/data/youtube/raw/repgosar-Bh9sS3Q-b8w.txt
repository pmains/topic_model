I would like to recognize the gentleman from Arizona mr. Paul Gosar for his testimony five minutes mr. Kozar welcome to the committee well thank you very much mr. chairman we're Kida and ranking member of lumen our I thank you for the opportunity to testify today on my principal interests with respect to the fiscal year 2015 budget resolution the FY 15 budget put forth by Chairman Ryan Ryan Ryan will be the first comprehensive statement of the fiscal priorities of the House of Representatives for FY 15 and will hopefully provide a thoughtful roadmap for addressing the many challenges facing our nation I would first like to commend chairman Ryan for complying with article 1 of the Constitution as well as a Congressional Budget Act of 1974 by reducing a yearly budget which passed the House of Representatives in each of the last three fiscal years meanwhile the do-nothing Senate failed to pass a budget resolution for FY 11 12 and 13 and has no intention of even attempting to pass a budget resolution to the Senate for the fiscal year 2015 this reckless disregard for the law in our budgetary process is another example of why people are so frustrated with a democratically controlled Senate that refuses the tackle the tough issues unfortunately President Obama's FY 15 budget is more of the same and demonstrates that he's not serious about getting our fiscal house in order the president's campaign pamphlet of a budget includes three point nine trillion in spending for FY 15 which is a 250 billion dollar increase from FY 14 more government more spending and higher taxes are his general priorities the president doesn't even attempt to balance the budget this is one of the president's most reckless budget proposals ever and includes almost a trillion dollars in new taxes on American families I could go on and on about the president's unrealistic budget for fiscal year 15 and failed fiscal policies but the main reason I'm here is to talk about my priorities for the house as FY 15 budget resolution first I supported the Budget Control Act also known as the BCA because I was sent to Congress to cut spending and work towards a balanced budget not increase spending and baloon our national debt the House FY 15 should adhere to the caps put in place under the BCA prior to the passage of the bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 and extend the BCA spending caps through the end of the window secondly the fy15 budget resolution should include provisions that will balance our budget I would prefer to see an aggressive plan similar to last year's Republican Study committee's budget which sought to balance the federal budget in four three I would like to see significant tax reform in the FY 15 budget resolution corporate taxes should be lowered the alternative minimum tax should be repealed and the tax code should be simplified for businesses and American families additionally now it's not the time for additional tax hike and there should be no new tax increases in the FY 15 budget resolution just like last year's budget resolution the FY 15 budget resolution should repeal the Affordable Care Act and prohibit funding for Obamacare as this trainwreck continues to pile full steam ahead towards the American people I will continue to support a patient-centered patient friendly market-based alternative like the American Health Care Reform Act that I put a pen to the fy15 budget resolution should provide for a strong defense while ensuring our country's commitment to our veterans veterans as well as our men and women in uniform should continue to be a top priority to this year's budget a lot of wasteful spending occurs during due to cronyism duplication and effective ineffective programs we must target these abuses a critical part of eliminating wasteful spending and getting our fiscal house in order in returning in in order is returning to regular order in the budget process in FY 15 we should return to regular order and review each federal programs effectiveness through 12 different appropriation bills shockingly this process hasn't been followed in its entirety since 1994 there are numerous other priorities and reforms I'd like to see in an FY 15 budget resolution but in the interest of time I were fain I appreciate the opportunity to testify before the committee today mr. chairman and with that I yield back

F THE AMENDMENT. FOR FIVE MINUTES. MR. SCHNEIDER: THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. THE GREAT LAKES ARE A NATIONAL TREASURE AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC DRIVER FOR ALL OF US IN THE MIDWEST. THE LAKES ACCOUNT FOR MORE THAN 90% OF OUR NATION'S SURFACE WATER AND 20% OF THE SURFACE FRESH WATER ON THE PLANET. MORE THAN 30 MILLION AMERICANS RELY ON THE GREAT LAKES FOR THEIR DRINKING WATER. FOR GENERATIONS, THERE HAVE BEEY HELD, BIPARTISAN CONSENSUS ON THE NEED TO PROTECT THE GREAT LAKES. FROM INVASIVE SPECIES, FROM ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES, AND FROM IRRESPONSIBLE DEVELOPMENT. LOOK NO FURTHER THAN THE BROAD, BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR THE GREAT LAKES RESTORATION INITIATIVE. I WANT TO WORK WITH MY COLLEAGUES ON MAKING PROGRESS TO PROTECT OUR GREAT LAKES, NOT TO OPEN THE DOOR EVEN THE SLIGHTEST CRACK FOR DANGEROUS DEVELOPMENT. AND THAT'S WHY TODAY I OFFER AND AMENDMENT TO CLEARLY REITERATE OUR VITAL PROTECTIONS OF THESE GREAT LAKES. MY AMENDMENT ENSURES THAT H.R. 21 WOULD CONTINUE THE BIPARTISAN CONSENSUS THAT THERE'LL BE NO EXPLORATION, DEVELOPMENT OR DRILLING FOR OIL AND GAS IN THE GREAT LAKES. WITH NEARLY ONE IN 0 AMERICANS RELYING ON THE GREAT LAKE FOR DRINKING WATER WE MUST ENSURE THAT A DISASTER LIKE THE DEEP WATER HORIZON EVER HAPPENING IN LIKE MICHIGAN IS NOT ONLY UNFATHOMABLE BUT IMPOSSIBLE. THIS AMENDMENT ENSURES THAT THAT IS THE CASE. TODAY WE MUST SAY WITH ONE UNIFIED BIPARTISAN VOICE THAT THERE WILL NEVER BE DRILLING IN THE GREAT LAKES. TH

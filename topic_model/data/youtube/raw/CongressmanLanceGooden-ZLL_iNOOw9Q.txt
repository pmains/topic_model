the gentleman from Texas is now recognized for five minutes thank you madam chair chairman Powell the board's done a great deal of work with regard to foreign banking organizations but I'm concerned there's a lack of harmonization across jurisdictions with respect to these foreign banking jurisdictions and I just want to make sure that you all are working to ensure that our US firms are not disadvantaged in the foreign market place and could have hear a little more about your plans for that so I think here we we want we want to give national treatment equal treatment to foreign institutions and we fully expect and anticipate that we will get that from foreign in foreign jurisdictions that's that's why we give it here it's you know plus we want we want foreign institutions to come in and do business here and lend capital to people and take part in the capital markets that only helps our economy and we want our institutions to be able to take part in foreign economies many banks are work across national international lines now so it is essential that that there be fair treatment for you know non-native banks all around the world thank you I appreciate that Stan see also in your written testimony you mentioned trade tensions and slowed global growth as potential threats to the US economy between these and the debt ceiling and the lack of consensus in Congress what would you say your biggest concerns out of those out of those I really I really think that the most important thing is the what we've been calling the cross currents which are really trade tensions and concerns over slowing growth global growth around the world that those are interrelated there's a box in our monetary policy report that I recommend to you about slowing global growth and manufacturing and investment which is which is something we're seeing not just the United States but around the world and you know that is the thing that weighs on our outlook we see it here we see weak manufacturing here we see confidence surveys among businesses and fortunately the consumer part of the economy is doing very well but that's that's where the weaknesses and that's where their concern the other things are concerns too but I would put those at the top of the list so along with along with low inflation you know that's that's a concern that's the other half of our mandate and you know we are concerned that inflation not run below two percent more persistently than we thought it would so putting all that together the current state of the economy where you see us going on a scale of one to ten how would you rate where we are with respect to an economy one being bad ten being great I don't think I'll give you an actual grade but I will say this we are in the 11th year of this expansion that's a first in since we began to keep records on this we're at three point seven percent unemployment that's a 50-year low 50 year loan we've been there for 15 months and there's no reason why that can't continue we are committed to using our tools to make sure that it does continue and I just would again point out though that this expansion is now reaching groups that hadn't been reached in the first few years and there's a box on that as well in the monetary policy report all the more reason why it's so important that we keep the expansion going to the maximum extent we can well I agree with you and I thank you and I yield my time back

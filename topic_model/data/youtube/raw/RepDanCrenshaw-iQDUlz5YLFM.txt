we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created as a member of congress i get to have a lot of really interesting people in the office experts on what they're talking about this is the podcast for insights into the issues china bioterrorism medicare for all in-depth discussions breaking it down into simple terms we hold we hold we hold these truths we hold these truths with dan crenshaw hey everyone so wanted to do an update uh via podcast for our podcast listeners and uh obviously we haven't released any uh new episodes in a couple weeks because i've been a little bit out of commission so i wanted to um have this conversation with you um and uh along with my wife my wife is here tara uh i think it's the first time we've had my wife on so this will be really cool and you know she brings a different perspective to everything we've been through over the last decade and um so listen over the course of this episode i'm going to tell people a lot of things you probably didn't know um what was wrong with my eyesight before all of this a lot of people just wrongly assumed that i had one eye but that was it you know that was my left eye was fine but my left eye has never been fine um and so i'll talk about that and we'll basically give you a lesson in ophthalmology and eye anatomy for those who are interested um so i'm giving you a lot more in-depth information than um than you would have gotten from a lot of my posts recently and also i've just been bored uh i can't see anything i can't see anything as we're uh as we're recording this podcast and um we've had a lot of together time we've had a lot together time and so we're going to talk to you about how that's been going uh for the last what three weeks now yeah we're at exactly three weeks uh since surgery and um i don't know how many audio books i've listened to maybe ten yeah at least yeah it's good though it's good to catch up on reading and um i'll tell you i'll tell you some of the titles that i've been reading uh they have nothing to do with politics frankly and that's that's maybe been the best part about it but uh okay so let's start from the beginning um our last picture together when i had two eyeballs um was on the tarmac in san diego right yes yes it was yeah um but i think north island it was yeah it was north island so north island's a an air base in coronado there's like three different bases in coronado um here's where all the seals are and uh and then there's a amphibious base which is like a mix of navy and a bunch of things um and uh then there's the air base all of all of them are navy bases and uh so we fly out of uh of uh what's called a nazney naval air station north island and uh on our way to afghanistan and seven months later um i don't know do you want to tell that story from your perspective oh the brief version yeah so i was the brief version on june 15th is that i had my alarm set for about 6 15 in the morning and about 12 minutes before that alarm was supposed to go off my phone rang and when your phone rings that early in the morning when when your spouse is deployed i think your first thoughts do go to wait a minute something wrong and uh and i answered that phone call and it turned out there was something wrong and that was the start of this journey uh would they tell you like what were their first words well you know it's funny because the very first thing they asked me was they asked for me by my full name and it was very official and you know people don't normally do that when they call and then they identify who they were and the command and of course now i'm now i know something's really wrong and they said um actually i i asked if they were at my front door because uh well you were worried if they were like trying to knock and weren't getting anybody yeah because my uh one of my best friends had lost her husband a year earlier almost two years earlier and uh so i knew kind of the process of that because you know you sit by with someone else and you understand how they go about informing people that their spouse has been killed and that's i thought they were trying to get a hold of me for that and he said not quite but you are correct something has happened dan is currently in surgery and we don't know what the outcome's going to be and we have some reports we know he was hit on the right side of his head we know that there's bad damage to the right side of his head but as of now that's all the info we have and we have decided to tell you because he is still in surgery and we thought it was time to bring you in and know what was going on because this had actually happened the blast had taken place gosh 12 hours earlier and the blast had happened you'd already been extracted you were already in surgery it was going for quite a long time and the way i understand it is that they have a a period of time that they don't call to inform the spouse or knock on their door um because obviously that's a very traumatic thing and so they they wait until certain hours to inform the spouse yeah it's weird because um this has always shocked me because the story you were getting back home was was definitely a worse story than the reality um i don't know well well i do because i was there so that you know that it was definitely i mean i walked away from the blast um so you know that's true i didn't know that i tell people i'll give you the short version of what the blast was because i remember that very well um it's like getting hit with a truck and everybody in that truck is um is shooting you with bird shot like 12 gauge shotguns bird shot boom uh that's what it feels like and then maybe some then maybe you get like a bucket of a tabasco sauce poured over your body for for good measure so it's nice and stinging that's what it feels like but it didn't it never knocked me unconscious if i was unconscious i was unconscious for a split second but you know i was ears ringing like totally blacked out can't see anything can't really hear anything i'm like what happened immediately feel my legs um and i've written about this story in detail you know you can you can go into into a lot of detail on this um and i just never thought that i'd live through these some of these same moments again that i've written about um but here we are you know almost almost 10 years later and uh so you know i immediately felt my legs realized okay a bomb went off um i knew that knew um it wasn't me that stepped on it because all we think about on these deployments are ieds that's all we think about yeah we think about small arms fire guys shooting at us but they're not very scary they're not very good shots they don't know how to tactically maneuver very well um they're not they're not a they're not a very threatening force the taliban in general um if if if they're playing by the same rules we are but they don't they play with ieds and these things are dangerous i mean and you can't find them anywhere they're difficult to find and discover and they're and they're just in the most random of locations uh so that's always what we're thinking about so that's why it was not a surprise to me at all like i didn't have to think through what happened i wasn't like thinking well was it a mortar was it no i was it was an ied we know that's what's here um but it wasn't me you stepped on it so that's the second thing i knew i knew somebody else stepped on it and they were near me and and then and then that then that was confirmed rather quickly because i could hear the groaning of somebody else and and there's a very specific sound um when somebody steps on an ied it's it's like this it's not screaming in the movies everybody screams but that's just not what it is you don't have the energy to scream um you you let out this just just deep gut-wrenching moan um i've listened to a few guys who have um who've stepped on ieds and that's what it sounds like and it turned out it was rockmon our afghan interpreter and um yeah i couldn't see him but you know as later told he lost all four limbs right away um it was it was a big bomb and he's a very small guy and so i knew that's i realized that's what happened i thought that i just had dirt in my eyes and i thought that for a while i thought that until they knocked me out um they knocked me out when the helicopter came to take me out and it was about 45 minutes later probably so you know again again so from my perspective i'm not that bad of like i'm a there's no way i'm dead right like things are definitely bad for me i know that but there's no way i'm dead because i wa because i could get up and walk um and uh i didn't even think something was wrong with my eyes to be honest i honestly just never never crossed them maybe that maybe it was just it was self-delusion to stay sane so it just it just sucks because that information was not getting back properly um there is a chance that when they put me into that medically induced coma and because i didn't wake up for a few days after that uh that you know because i know i've had this problem in the past with um anesthesia and i think i think they were worried i think they're worried from that perspective um and that that information wasn't getting back home correctly so anyway so tara's living through that well i think you have to remember too that you were living the blast and it wasn't that the information wasn't correctly coming back to me it's that i am the information i'm getting is bad and you know the right side of your head was badly damaged and i know but if you hear that from somebody in the military you're thinking something totally different than what happened you know it that's just that's just the reality that's like the game of telephone um you know i remember you telling me that they were like we're not sure how is how is how his face looks like there's chunks missing which turned out not to really be true i mean look it my face look i mean the pictures are pretty bad don't get me wrong you looked awful but it looked like it had gotten blasted with a shotgun that's what it looked like well the other thing is too is you have to remember that you couldn't you never saw yourself in that state you you didn't really start to see until gosh months later truly be able to see months later and by that time you did look better but i saw pictures you know a week old picture your face was stitched back together there was a lot of shrapnel there's a lot of skin that had been it almost looked like as you can tell we're a married couple and we quibble over details that are totally unnecessary well i just think it's important because dan when you when you reflect back on this you have a very different view and you weren't looking at yourself i was looking at you and people were looking at you and they were saying this is what i saw this is what we're worried about this is what's going on and you know all of us were we're not we're waiting to find out the extent of your injuries yes and you ended up being getting better and being okay but in those moments no one really knows what that's going to be what it's going to look like how are you going to be out of this because you remember too one of the surgeons that actually worked on you in afghanistan ran into another seal buddy of ours years later and he never knew what happened to you and he was and he told our buddy he was like oh i worked on the seal but he's totally blind she like his one eye is completely gone and they probably end up yeah that was the doctor because the surgery they were doing probably when they called you was just removing my right eye that's the only surgery that happened in country in afghanistan um was just removed was in nuclear they call it nucleating the right eye and the reason they do that again i want to i want to go back to kind of giving people the medical information here the reason they do that is because i guess of the belief that your body will try to heal whatever wounds exist and if there's no chance that you're going to see out of that right eye again and again to this day i don't really know what was wrong with i mean it had been through a blast that's what was wrong with it but was the retina detached was it just torn to shreds i mean i have no idea but anyway so i understood it was torn to shreds that it was pretty much gone and yeah took out what was left and you can kind of see that like from the scarring of my eyelid on my right eye there's all these like tattooing around it so for whatever reason the blast hit that side much much worse than my left and you know thank god one side got hit and not the other well obviously they both got hit which is what we'll get to but i do wonder sometimes if you if when the blast came if you instinctively turned like you were going to turn your back or move and that's why the right side got it so much worse because who knows um so right side and also the right side of your face when you came home like you you did a lot of stitching i'm sure i was just turned slightly to the left and luckily i mean if i'd been turned slightly more to the left i'd you know probably would have never even left well oh well that's the mighty ducks analogy yeah you know but um in any case they they nucleated the right eye and um and so that's the surgery that happened and then i woke up in germany um kind of a violent waking up because of the the tube in an incubation tube intubation 2 being ripped out of my mouth and i'm like what's going on um again i go into a lot of detail about i've written a lot of detail about this you guys can you guys can confine that um and um so but what i what i don't think is is is is in the book is is the medical stuff and um and that's what i want to talk about today i think just to tell people what's what really goes on because i mean you see me in public life and it's like oh he just has a left eye and i appear to be doing things just normally like everybody else um jumping at airplanes i guess not everybody jumps out of airplanes but i you know i can the point is is i can clearly do quite a bit with this condition what people don't realize is i was blind for a long time and that's because the left eye was was so badly damaged right i don't think a lot of people realize that you know when dan came home he was he was completely blind and i was told by the doctors you know this is it he's not going to see again and we're going to do surgery to try and to help that eye but there's very small chance they didn't even think there was really a chance that you'd see again like we were being prepared to send i don't know if you remember the stand because it was early on but one of the things we were going to do is we were actually going to be sent to a specialized hospital once you were better we were supposed to go to another place that actually was going to teach us and teach you how to remember talking about that yeah an assisted living or not assisted living but like a training facility how to live blind blind training facility yeah yeah i remember talking about that i still never believed it i mean i was in a in many ways i was in a bad state mentally but in some ways i was in a good state mentally i was in sort of this like um the state of delusion um in in a good way in a healthy way in that like i'm just to see again i mean just do the surgeries and it'll come back i'll be fine and just just just tell me when you can do the neck surgery and the neck surgery so that i can time out when i'm going to go back to my platoon right meanwhile they'll talk to me about seeing eye dogs right and so the doctors would have that conversation with me and i learned later like they're like uh-huh just kind of like nodding nodding awkwardly and then they're like then they would tell you later on like this is this is not what's gonna happen right and so you know maybe just let me believe that for as long as i believed it but hey belief works some miracles every once in a while so you know i went back i had two major surgeries on my left eye one was the cataract surgery so here's what happened all the blasts shot a bunch of shrapnel through my eye and including copper wire and they they knew that was in there but they couldn't really do the proper surgery until we got back to bethesda um walter reed hospital in bethesda maryland so that's where the you know the big surgery took place and to remove the shrapnel and it also removed the lens so some quick eye anatomy in the front of your eye is your cornea um it's clear this is this is the thing that is it's it's shaped kind of like a you know like a it's a little bump out from the front of your eye this is the thing that say when you have lasik surgery they're changing the shape of your cornea um to get your prescription right for instance okay that's what that's what they're doing um same with prk surgery uh behind that is your iris and your pupil your iris is a muscle that can contracts and therefore dilates your pupil uh behind that in the middle of your eye and and of course in the scholar the white part of your eye it's like this sort of liquidy mucousy thing um in the middle is your lens okay that's what refracts the light which that light then hits your retina which is like the think of it like photosensitive paper on the back of your eye it's all the codes and rods and that's what that's what perceives light and then sends it down your optical nerve to your brain and so all these parts are pretty important the most important part of all of this of course is your retina which gets us to the modern day problem um back then the problem was not necessarily my retina not yet anyway but the lens the lens had been basically destroyed so you kind of think about this like like somebody just well that was one of the many problems sure sure but the so somebody basically thrown thrown up like a pile i think like a bucket full of tools exploded through a window that's sort of what happened yeah and then the question was you know do we do we replace replace that lens now when a normal cataract like somebody who's older um when a cataract happens they uh effectively their lens clouds over and you have to remove it and then usually replace it with a fake lens that's usually what you see in older patients who have normal cataract surgery me you couldn't do that because it was like the entire window frame had been blown away by that blast so my iris was also broken if you ever look at me closely you'll see my pupil is not a circle it looks like a comet almost yeah and the tail of the comet is shooting out to the i can't even remember now i think who cares shooting out to the side um it's uh and so that's because my my iris doesn't wrap all the way around um well the other thing is just to back up a little bit too because this was also very early on you'd only been out of the coma for a short time at this point but you have to remember when you came home when they flew you home from germany one of the things was that the tools that have been thrown in your eye these pieces of metal and different little rocks and such the metal was actually copper and so that was one of the things that we were very concerned about because copper wire will degrade tissue and it already been in there a few days because it wasn't just i got the phone call and then dan was home within a few hours you know i got the phone call that was days later that he would be stateside and this copper wires was sitting in his eye and depending on the percentage of copper that's that's present it can degrade that tissue and so that was actually one of the things going into that first major surgery stateside that i don't think you necessarily utilize you had a lot going on but one of the big things we were worried about was how much copper's in there and is the tissue already being has it already begun to degrade what's happening and um we didn't know because when they build when they build these these bombs they take pieces from old parts well i knew this was a problem that's why i was so i was like i remember waking up in germany and i'm like where's my flight and they're like well it comes tomorrow and i'm like that's not good enough yeah that's true i was like you get me home i need to get the copper out because i i heard about that problem pretty quickly and so you do remember yeah um and so yeah so anyway all this all this stuff kind of shoots to the eye and we think there's a big miracle occurring um because the surgery is at least successful i mean i think thinking back on okay what are surgeons worried about when they go in there i mean frankly you don't really know what you're gonna find until you're inside the eye so so they don't know so they're like so so they come out of it fairly optimistic they're like the retina is still there the things are still there um there was not a lot of optimism well you term yeah you're very very good at um when you take a bad situation you do find like hey you're saying there's a chance i can make this work there it felt good that there wasn't more copper in the eye like that definitely was exciting but also we didn't find that out for a while because they'd actually send it to the lab and get analyzed so when they took it out they didn't know what percentage was in there and that was more waiting um and it was like well we cut out the lens we removed what we could they're still little tiny pieces of metal and shrapnel in his eye because it'd be more dangerous to try to remove it at that point these were small pieces that were in there but you still were blind they still didn't think you're going to see again like because remember all the conversations about going to learn how to live blind getting the same eye dog that all happened after that first surgery yeah yeah so okay so they had no idea what i was going to see when did they start making glasses when did they deliver some like big coke bottle lenses because people just understand when you lose a lens it means most people if they have a glasses prescription your prescription is usually like negative two negative five something in the negatives mine is like a positive 11. um so so sometime in july okay so a couple weeks late so maybe a week after surgery so so at some point they removed the bandages so the blackness turns to some light right and then and then there's some optimism because i'm seeing light and in hindsight i'm kind of seeing what i see on a normal basis not one not right now but on a normal basis well the first time you saw light was amazing and shocking and it was it was a big moment and for you because you were like no it's fine i know it's fine and also because you had your eye had been projecting images anyways so when the doctor came in and i'm trying to think of when this was it's all it's been so long but when the doctor came in and removed the bandages after one of your surgeries that was the first time you saw light and it was incredible we were not expecting that the doctor was yeah well light and color i mean and there was a certain point where i could see the the the the colors of the flashlight american flag a couple of our buddies had hung an american flag at the foot of dan's bed and that was the first thing that you said out loud that we knew you could actually see something right and then and so and so i know that between because there's i'm getting the reason i'm asking this timeline is because there's a second surgery that happens um which is related to my current surgery but that second surgery happens after you know i've been looking through glasses for a good while now um not not seeing very well but at least like seeing shapes and stuff because you know these glasses aren't perfectly prescribed to me at this point there's still a lot of um damage and the eye's just not ready to see yet if that makes sense still a ton of inflammation all this stuff so you know we're just we're it hasn't settled down i guess so but but i remember wearing glasses because i saw i remember pictures of and i'm placing the timeline around uh president obama's visit and so because i remember that was like one of the first times i was like well i'm going to get out of the bed because the president's coming by to visit so i'm just going to go ahead and get up and he's like oh no i don't get up and i remember seeing a picture of us with me wearing glasses yes so you so i'm seeing a little bit but i'm not i'm not seeing him very well you didn't really see you wanted you wanted to see badly and so they said okay we're going to get you the thickest glasses we can and actually because they're very strict when uh the president comes to to see patients at the hospital and you're not like allowed to leave your rooms they check everyone's social security numbers all these things there's a lot that goes into it and you know snipers on the on the roof across the wall but uh i remember they called up and it was really close to the time that they were going to be shutting down the base and shutting down the hospital for his visit and said we got these glasses and i ran all the way down because we were in the wounded warrior section and to get your glasses it was way on the other side and i had and also that hospital was kind of amazed to me now i can get around it just fine but i sprinted they handed them back i ran back and got up out of the elevator as they were closing down the floor yeah so i had something to see i mean i don't really remember it that well so obviously i wasn't seeing that well because i remember the moment but um i don't remember it very visually so that tells me that i wasn't seeing very well um but it was kind of funny i mean uh i asked him to sign like this is a funny story i asked him to sign my flag and uh one of my buddies in in the seal teams goes oh hey dan uh no you can't read that but the president just wrote uh quit complaining and get back to work and president obama like turns to him with this like look on his face like what the hell did he just say and he and he goes uh dan don't don't trust that guy that's so my buddy uh has that his his favorite story is that the president told told uh said that he shouldn't be trusted um so that happened and so we're feeling pretty good about things but then we get bad news because during one of these uh tests that we're doing on the retina it turns out that there's a macular hole and right in the center of my vision which is a terrible place to have a we went into the room and it was up on the screen when they were looking through i can see what they're looking at and it was big enough that also i'd been looking at dan's eye yeah a lot and i could see the hole it was pretty big i remember the doctor walked in because um the tech or i'm not exactly sure the name but he you know takes a picture of dan's eye and then the doctor walks in to look at it and i i saw it and i said oh my gosh and the doctor walked in he goes well you don't be a doctor to see that hole i was like no yeah and so the problem with the hole is it doesn't just stay a hole uh if it did it wouldn't be so bad it just means you have a little blind spot there and um the problem is with a retina is it's uh there's tension on a retina and that tension is caused by a membrane on either side of it and so the idea is that you can you can you can't get rid of the hole however i will say that over the course of a decade that blind spot has gotten less and less prevalent now that could be due to my brain making up for it but i don't think so i can tell the difference um because that it's gotten smaller it's interesting um but in any case the way to stop the hole from spreading is is removing a membrane that causes tension because that tension causes tears to continue happening right it's so tight it just keeps spreading and and uh it's it's kind of like uh you know tonsils like we're not sure why you have it right um or whatever oh the membrane yeah like the membrane we're not sure why you have the membrane just anatomically speaking so the idea is that you can remove it and um remove it in previous surgeries that if they removed that membrane the possibility of the surgery being successful went up significantly yeah but in this case that is the surgery because the the only thing they can do they're not gluing anything back the retina is not detaching there's just a hole in it so that is the surgery is removing the membrane and so you got to go back into the eye which really sucks because it's just it's gone through so much at this point it's a delicate organ as it turns out and um and so we do it again and um well they gave me options at that point or they laid out some options because they're like look here's the thing it's really risky to do another surgery um so you have two options you can either go blind slowly and at least see what you can see for a limited more time um but you are going to lose your vision and you're going to watch it kind of disappear or or we do the surgery and there's a really good chance your retina detaches completely and we can't put it back together and then you go blind immediately and uh we were like well go big or go home there's only one choice here and i think they agreed with that too obviously they actually really came at it from the angle they said it more they're like look you're going blind no matter what you will be blind the surgery that we're gonna perform has a pretty high risk of you going blind from it but you're gonna be blind no matter what so we think we should go for it and they had you know their conference and there was like three of the main surgeons in the hallway and we just all were talking about it and well they were talking about with each other and we were just kind of standing there and um they were like yeah we gotta do it and they all were like yeah we should really do this because what's the other option just go blind yeah so we did it and um yeah it turned out just fine i mean basically and so you know this is uh this is for some reason like this is the part of the story that everybody's like oh my god because i don't know why but this is the part where it's where they put the big gas bubble in your eye because that acts as a band-aid for your retina but for it to be a band-aid on your retina it has to be pressed against your retina the only way for that to happen is if you're facing straight down so back then i had to be face down for six weeks um in hindsight just based on what i know now about these surgeries that seems to be a little bit overboard i don't think so but i think i think back then they were like you just need to do everything possible to heal this thing and i think they just i think they didn't want me moving i think i think that's why they told me well you tried to do push-ups in your bed and i remember finally someone was like because i was telling they weren't allowed to do that and someone came in and they were like dan if you continue to do push-ups you could burst all the blood like the new blood vessels that just form in your eye and we need those and you stopped being pushed up and you were like fine i mean i mean they weren't impressive push-ups still for that long is just so ridiculous um so yeah so six weeks down and for some reason like that's what everybody points to like how do you do that i'm like i mean when when blindness is the option like you can do it trust me it was pretty uncomfortable though i mean it's super uncomfortable but it's also it's super uncomfortable um it's also i i just compared to all of the other issues i'm like that's just that that's never that's never what's haunted me like i have a lot of haunting moments um throughout this experience and it's like laying face down was never one of them like we just kind of i just again i just listened to a lot of audio books and you know um you know just make ourselves comfortable and that was it like it just like it was this time and um and look over time it took years to get like the right contacts but people don't realize it you'd be amazed how often i get made fun of by people like when i because i take out reading glasses because so so fast forward a few months few years and my my vision is look i never fixed the cataract i've never had a lens in my eye so i'm a fake is the is the technical term for for the condition of my eye aphakia without a lens um and i've got a lot of scarring on my retina blind spots throughout it and i can't dilate my pupil some sensitive delight so that fast forwarding that's the current condition of my eye and um well not anymore it's worse now but for the last decade basically that's been the condition of my eye so what does that mean it means i need a very strong lens to see but i can only correct the distance i can't focus the way you can um normal people focus you know near and far just without even realizing it that's what you're doing i can't do that at all i need to have magnifications that that are associated with every single distance so you know distance for me is like a plus 11 magnification but i need to up that to like 13.5 to see up close but that doesn't help me with the computer i need to lower the magnification so i have bifocals constantly where the top is like for reading a computer and the bottom is like for reading my phone you know something a little bit more detailed reading glasses really honestly like most people would have reading glasses my reading glasses aren't any different but what's special is is the the main near you know distance vision that i see through a contact only one company makes the contact that really works for me or i work with these coke bottle lenses um so you know again that that's again it's funny how many people oh you're getting old getting old while you're wearing those readers and i'm like yeah it's not age just uh just a bomb to the face you know and i'm always wondering like how do you not it's one of the reasons one of the reasons i wear the eye patch is so that people understand the story right away um you remember in the team like when i was still because i still served for another four years after this after uh the explosion and um i would wear an eye patch for like special occasions weddings and yeah cause it's because it's you know it's it's an aesthetic thing really but um but at work you know i'm wearing my trident eye that's my favorite eye and i've dozen i want i've about a dozen eyes total they're they're fun to wear um but the reason you know and going into public life i basically permanently put on the eye patches so that people know the story right away and uh because you'd be when you wear a glass eye you'd be amazed the kind of weird questions that people ask that's all they can focus on and yeah they're not going to talk to you about legislation or you know yeah they just want to talk about that yeah they're just they're confused they're like what is that right you know is it a contact like what is going on here with an eye patch you know exactly right away yeah you know exactly what's going on so i'm always laughing when people are like whoa are you wearing readers it's like i don't know do you think maybe there's something going on here you know besides age like i'm in my 30s in the capital like told our chief they're like uh yeah dan doesn't say hi to me in the hallway oh yeah my chief of staff will get told in congress sometimes you know he ignores me sometimes in the hallway like we said hi i mean and my chief she's like you know he can't see you right like that's why i wear the eye says well maybe he should tell people and it's like we we do yeah that was literally how she tells us the story like it says some some guy responds to her and it was just like it's really unbelievable it's kind of one of the reasons i wanted to do this podcast besides just being really bored um not that bored guys we are doing official duties did a hearing yesterday i'm recording this uh friday i don't know what today's date is but anyway so all right back to business so um that that's the current state of my vision i'm hoping to get back to that normal so fast forward nine years to a few weeks ago and um i'm seeing these weird spots in my eye mostly on the left side of my vision and um it had happened before it happened a few months ago too and then went away so i i was foolishly not thinking through this very well i i should have gone to the emergency room right away but look a year out from our initial surgeries um we thought we were kind of in the clear because that's the most risk risky time it is it is but it's also with these type of eye injuries we really don't know what the future holds for these type of eye injuries and the surgeons they were very worried that your retinol would fall apart that first year and you know they talked about it to us we they were telling us if you have this symptom or that symptom you have to go to an emergency room immediately and tell them this is what's happening because we're gonna have to get into surgery immediately and hopefully if dan can keep his sight for a year because i remember this conversation very clearly and like we really don't know if dan will keep his sight because it's truly a miracle that he has it at all but we hope that if he can keep it for the next year maybe he'll be good to go because a lot of people they tend that first year is so crucial if they're going to lose it they lose it then so when we hit that one-year mark i actually guard went down quite a bit well and also i even mentioned it to you i was like oh my gosh we made it here and you're like so and i was like dan and i went over it with you and you're like oh i didn't really know it was that big of a deal i was like yeah well i tuned out all the bad news in the beginning um and in rightfully so you know there's yeah only only focus on things you control and that's kind of a lesson in going through this kind of stuff um focus on what you can control and i think positive thinking does help in healing um even if that positive thinking is derived from delusion which is effectively what i was doing well and even today talking about those first days you even still this day like i wasn't that bad it wasn't a big deal whereas i was sitting at home it was a big deal yeah it was yeah you don't get blown up every day but um so again fast forward here i'm seeing these splotchy um dark spots kind of appear it looks like you know imagine looking at a computer screen too long or a bright light shines in your face and you see those kind of spots in your vision and you thought that's why that was happening that's sort of what was happening and i thought well i you know i've always known that i have scarring on my retina it's more sensitive um maybe being out in the sun you know that's just what happened it'll go away because this happened a few months ago back in january and then went away now what was really happening back then clearly was the first onset of symptoms from this problem um look and basically here's what was happening the if you look at the retina like a poster uh on the back of your eye and that poster was unfurling now it could be a lot worse sometimes that poster just falls off the wall that's really bad you'll know that happens right away because you just lose vision and then you're like what just happened and then they'll hopefully attack if they attach it quickly back um you might stand a chance of seeing okay again but not a great one um in my case uh you know looking to the positive side it was basically tearing and unfurling at the edges and it was just coming in on me so it's like the world was just closing in i still and i still wasn't panicking about it i was like i went to an i did an event um the day before we'd set up an appointment and like i really couldn't see very well at that event i was like looking for people and again but i just thought like this this the fact that like the entire left half of my vision was gone because it kind of blinked you know and i was like ah it's just those funny sunspots well and also we you have lived with issues with your eye for so long that you got too accustomed to it you did and um although i did that won't happen again your pain level the the night before we went into no it was very irritating my eye was like yeah i was really uncomfortable yeah um but i didn't know why again i just didn't i wasn't sure why i was looking for every other possible explanation i was thinking allergies i was thinking um just sometimes this happens because of environmental um environmental factors like it just happens sometimes it's hard for me to put a contact in it's hard for me to see but it was blurry vision it was um it was bad and then so we go to the the appointment at the va the next day and um and uh the doctor i love doctors you know they just don't mess around they're just like i have very bad news for you your retina is detached he just didn't even play around which is good i wouldn't want him to yeah he was like you need surgery yeah we need to get you into surgery right away um and uh look long story short that's what happened and we were kind of surprised we were not expecting yeah i was still i was still kind of in shock i didn't i should have it's crazy that i didn't i didn't see that as a as a possibility i know enough about eyes to to know that's a possibility and i just didn't see it coming so to speak and um and uh so yeah that next friday morning early got that surgery in and it was getting worse and worse i mean i could see the vision just closing in and so what do they do that's scary oh scary when the vision was closing in so what do they do when they go in there um there was still some good news because i could still tell that like the center of my vision before i went into surgery was still clear which is really important because well that's how you see i mean the center of your vision is how you get your acuity right when you're looking at what 2020 is it's well it's wherever you're looking periphery is one thing um you'd like it to be clear but it doesn't matter as much if that's not clear like it's unlikely that my periphery because that rhett in the part of the retina was falling off is ever going to be as clear as say you yours is but still it's also not that noticeable because it's your periphery um so hey skydiving's still okay yeah it is diving yeah no everything's okay i can literally do anything um once this once this heals except you like take heart you can't get in a car crash um you know there's you have a higher higher chance of your retina detaching you know in that case but then again so do you and so does everybody um you know anyway so what is the surgery they did just so people understand um well they uh they cut into your eye and in my case they put a silicone buckle around the retina and around the eye to hold it in place i don't exactly know how to visualize that i'm not exactly sure what that looks like look it up on youtube um and then they also took a laser and basically you could call it gluing the edges of the retina down really what they're doing is they're burning it and then three days later it heals and that healing is like gluing uh so and then they of course stick that big glass bubble gas bubble back in your eye just like i had nine years ago and um tell me to sit face down but this time i only had to sit face down for uh seven days so that was very exciting because the surgery is a little different i think um it's been nine years yeah and more advances in the way they do the techniques so you know i don't know but that's your that's your basic lesson in ophthalmology but we didn't know it was going to be only seven days they they said it could be longer it all depended on how your retina looked when we went back in for that one week checkup sure yeah yeah it's kind of terrifying to imagine what they were looking for i mean would it have still been unfurling and then at that point i guess we're just hoping that sling face down and the bubble pressing up against it puts it back in place but luckily we didn't have that conversation so um so now now three uh done i've done three follow-up appointments since all all good retina is staying in place we're out of the woods so to speak um at least that's how the surgeon tends to react and uh great surgeon by the way at the at the va uh we're lucky here in houston this is a kind of a premier uh va hospital they they have a partnership with baylor um baylor medical center and um so a lot of the doctors practice in both places so always want to give a shout out to the great doctors at the va great doctors and nurses um for taking care of me there and so we had some amazing nurses too um yeah we're lucky to happen to be here because there was no way i was traveling anywhere and gosh if we had been on a trip somewhere traveling anywhere else um because i mean every hour the my vision was closing in so that surgery just had to happen so quickly oh yeah they had to get us in as soon as they could and by the time they did get you in you know your peripheral we know that it was tearing away from the outside because all the peripheral was closing in but also by the time they went to surgery there was one of the tears had gone towards the center it hadn't completely detached but it had torn yeah yeah it was coming towards the center pretty quick so um they closed the eye back up after that and um like we couldn't fly anywhere because the change in pressure would have been very dangerous i can't fly anywhere now um for six weeks you can't fly anywhere yeah but it would have accelerated the tearing of the red oh oh you mean before surgery correct yeah yeah well if we're out in the middle of nowhere you'd have no choice i guess so we were lucky to be in houston um anyway they they finished surgery that friday and i got to go ride home and uh sit face down and hang out um a lot of pain i mean you tear open your eye it's a it's painful it's still a little sore still throbs but getting back to normal if people want to understand what i see now again put a dive mask on cover the right side of it and tape so you can't see out of your right eye and fill fill the mask with this like like a bubble like a bubble bath solution and um and then wipe some vaseline on the outside of the lens of the mask uh to make it nice and blurry that that's kind of what i see uh that's don't actually try that at home that bubble solution yeah okay but uh but if you want to imagine what it's like that that's sort of what i see and that's basically what i'll see for the next uh six weeks until this bubble goes away um and then i'm lucky that my prescription has now changed because that buckle i talked about changes the shape of my eye so which changes your um your optical distance and your prescription so i'll have to get new contacts and glasses and all that but um but i don't think it'll be that it won't be that different from from what i had so look trying to get back to normal sooner than later um but just can't leave houston uh we can't even drive away because you can't we're looking uh with some things you know places to go and um can't go there because even driving um puts us at an elevation above 1500 feet which we cannot go to until after that bubble is completely dispersed so stuck um but i guess i guess the one lucky thing about all of these uh silly pandemic practices we have in washington and remote everything uh for situations like mine i guess it works pretty well so i've started doing hearings and i'm doing all my official duties just fine and normally um you know at all and i can't read but i can listen and um and uh we're keeping up just fine so you know and uh don't no need to feel sorry for us this is uh i always say this i raised my hand a long time ago and asked to go to war all of our veterans have we have an all-volunteer force um and uh i wouldn't trade that experience for anything in the world that might sound crazy but it's uh it's exactly what i dreamed of as a kid and uh i wouldn't trade it for anything so changed our life either and it is it is what it is um and uh again if you got those audio book recommendations or a good podcast besides this one i mean this is probably the only podcast you really need to listen to although lately i understand we haven't been putting out the content and uh don't worry we've got a lot of good episodes coming up i think we have some stashed actually that we should start releasing um after we release this one so um we've got some fun ones coming up i'm going to get back into doing this i want to talk to the people again and um and get back into the fight so i'm optimistic that uh just based on what we're seeing so far that i'll get back to my sense of normal that normal i described to you earlier and um we'll be back so appreciate everybody's well wishes um it has it has been great to see um you know very overwhelming yeah yeah from from from across the board and i always appreciate the people who uh are totally on the political opposite political side than me who don't qualify their uh well wishes yeah you know one of my biggest pet peeves and you know who you are if you've done this i really disagree with dan on so many things but i hope he gets better why do you have to say that just just say you know if you hope somebody gets better just say i i hope they get better yeah it's been interesting i never i never qualify my statements if i'm going to say about somebody who's like a a democrat or a fellow republican who just who does you know whoever it is because it happens from both um it's just uh i appreciate everybody who just who just has an unqualified well wishing you know i think that's that's it it's nice and that's mostly what we've seen um what else how's life with me been tara thinks it's been great oh it's been wonderful amazing so much time together a lot of time together and we can't watch any shows no so we've been we've listened so many audiobooks and a lot on physics dan has been all about the physics books so yeah i minored in physics in college and i like uh i like books on um on uh theoretical physics yeah they're actually more they're more readable than people realize they they are interesting there are moments that uh that i might not be completely fully engaged in dan tara are you listening are you paying attention i want to talk about this tonight over dinner yeah okay i also read a couple good um like mystery thrillers um just finished uh um the murder house by james patterson that one was pretty good and then you read the stephen king stephen king the institute um i don't know why it's always why are why are children always getting hurt in stephen king books like that's i don't know what's going on there um but it was it was decent he's a good storyteller um i've tried to read some other books and i just can't get through them um so those are a couple good ones but god i think we're on like book 10 by this point um there's some weird ones that would that i've that i've read and i'm gonna try and have those authors on this podcast here in the next few weeks so stay tuned for that and uh and here it has to do with

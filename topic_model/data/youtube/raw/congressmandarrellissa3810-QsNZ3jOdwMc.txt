this is congressman darrell Issa and yes we've had another tough week but it's been a week of hope the president released a bold plan to put America back to work in empowering governor's to make the final decisions but setting up a guideline for safely returning to work additionally there are good signs of breakthrough medicines that are going to make this pandemic not just go away now but go away forever there were some other things that we discovered this week obviously we now know more about the WH o--'s collusion if you will with China to mislead us and the effect that's caused in both trillions of dollars of loss to around the globe and of human life and that's going to have to be researched and is going to have to be a remedy next year after this pandemic is behind us so this doesn't happen again last and probably the most important development of this week we began to push back on the misconduct and wrong thinking of a number of people around the country but specifically governor Newsom who decided that in fact religion and churches were non-essential well marijuana clinics were I joined with others to push back on that in a lawsuit where we're asking the court in no uncertain terms to state that that our people of faith should not be put at a disadvantage to other essential activities that doesn't mean reckless behavior but it does mean that if in fact 200 people can be in the parking lot of a Costco why can't 200 people if they choose worship in a parking lot with the same separation those ideas and more will continue to be part of America moving forward and I look forward to all of that

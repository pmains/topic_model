Thank You mr. chairman gentlemen we've already discussed throughout this hearing today the tyranny of distance in the Pacific and some of the challenges that we face I myself grew up in in Southeast Asia living in Singapore Thailand Indonesia so I am personally and Hawaii familiar with eternity of distances and you talked a little bit to Admiral the the need for increasing our Sealift capabilities could you discuss a little bit other requirements such as air lift heavy lift aircraft that sort of thing that we need might need to plus up in order for you to be able to more efficiently and able to react more quickly to any type of changes in the situation in the Pacific thank you ma'am I would just add you know one of the key areas we need to do is better cyber defenses of our logistics networks which touch commercial industry you know so profoundly both in terms of the people that we help contract for the support both in the United States but overseas as well some of the inroads was ZTE in highway in some of these other countries are going to challenge our ability to use our existing logistics network without adapting adapting it in the cyber sense moving forward so are you speaking to upgrading and improving the capabilities of organizations like Transcom or in addition to the cyber capabilities absolutely Transcom bears some responsibility for those networks to support their logistics operations that that's absolutely one of them and as you mentioned earlier the airlift is going to be critically important out there in the indo-pacific region Thank You general Abrams can you expand a little bit on the work we've done and the work that still needs to be done to ensure we have the necessary logistical tail to support US forces Korea in any contingency senator there's been extensive investment by the services over the last couple of years under the leadership of chairman Dunford and then secretary mattis to properly not only posture the force to improve our posture in terms of munitions and other key supplies to appropriate levels based on where we were in 2017 but also made the right investments now in the supply chains to be able to sustain that if we ever had to get to a point of hostilities pink you can both you give me your brief assessments of how the recently passed asia reassurance initiative act will affect our relationship in the region and what more needs to be done to make sure it's effectively implemented I'm sorry senator could you repeat that I apologize sure no worries I'm the last questioner so totally understandable um can you speak a little bit about the recently passed asia reassurance initiative act and how that will affect our relationships within the region you know the importance of our alliance is in a no Paycom particularly Republic of Korea and Japan I don't think it's something we stress enough I think that the successes that were having in the region diplomatically and politically really also stems from the fact that we have a solid alliance militarily between us Korea and Japan and and that must remain strong in order for us to move forward in on the other fronts I thought I couldn't agree more ma'am we've we've talked frequently about a whole-of-government approach and the reason it can't just be in a military space that we're competing out there and the area the AR IA act is going to be one of the key vehicles in which to advance these relationships going forward senator the only thing I'd add that specifically in Northeast Asia no stronger allies than the Republic of Korea and and Japan and so I absolutely agree with that Admiral Davidson said in terms of can it's it's a whole-of-government approach that can only serve to strengthen those two great democracies as well as our own thank you I mean finally my last question Admiral could you speak a little bit to the role of the state Partnership programs in terms of the forces that you and the work did you do in countries like the Philippines and the like and end availability of those troops to attack ment and augment your active duty forces the state Partnership programs not only in the Indo Pacific Command reason but excuse me for the other command command where you answer senator Reed presiding have been quite important to us building military-to-military relationships the frequency in which those state partnership programs can can touch some of these other nations is is quite good and we've been able in just the last few minutes to expand one of those state Partnership programs in the Oceania region I don't want to say where and who just yet because we haven't announced the final selection of who the state partner will be but it's an area in which I'm looking to expand some relationships in the region as well thank you thank you gentlemen

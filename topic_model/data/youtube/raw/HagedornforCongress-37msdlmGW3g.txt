jim hagedorn is in the faculty lounge he's a congressional candidate from southwest minnesota and uh he is in a primary which will take place august 12th in southwestern minnesota there's one other republican it's a winner take all deal whoever gets the most votes on august 12 will face the incumbent congressman in the election uh coming up in november of this year um agriculture yeah okay i'm gonna make a blatant statement that i don't really believe but a lot of people do believe so i'm just gonna say it okay farmers have had it too good for too long they've had all these subsidies all these supports all these special interest things on and on and on and on and on it's keeping farms going simply because it's the american dream or the american nightmare we're tired of it get rid of the farm bill well i come from a farm area my dad was a farmer grandfather farmer grew up on a farm myself i i think that the farm bill the purpose of the farm bill is to help sustain agriculture in times when when things go wrong you know how farming is it's up and it's down and it's dependent a lot of times on weather and luck and everything else and and if we run little farmers and others out of the business now and then what you're going to get is a lot more big farmers and uh so i know i i support the ag bill i support the the programs and and the things that are needed to to make sure that we sustain agriculture now can we move towards more market-oriented agriculture as we did at one time in the early 80s yes but i believe that those steps should be taken and phased in in such a way that it doesn't undermine what's already working now okay um another hot button issue national international the changing climate and i'm not going to get into whether it's man caused or not all right because that's an interesting discussion that could take days but all the scientists government non-government are telling us the climate is changing so what do we as a society a country citizens of the world need to do in your opinion to adapt to that reality well based on the premise your question the way you put it together i think i would ask this if we did everything that president obama and congressman walls and the the i what i would call extremist environmentalist types would like us to do to transform our society and to change the way we do things and to move to other types of energy if we did all those things what difference would it make usually they come back and say that after 30 or 40 or 50 years it would make some minuscule little difference that isn't gonna isn't going to do anything if you believe that man is causing this problem which i i don't really believe that if you're looking at one or five percent of all the emissions caused by man depending on how you how you look at it but here's where i can these these types of climate change procedures the cap and trade bill the regulations against the coal-fired power plants that congressman wall just voted for here in the last couple of months those things that are going to transform our economy our society it's going to drive up costs for consumers it's going to make us less competitive around the world and i frankly oppose them i'm i'm for the other side energy independence based on fossil fuel development on private on public lands for sustaining coal for nuclear for renewables and conservation and then all the infrastructure to use the natural resources that god gave us and we have more natural resources in the united states than any other country in the world okay and i understand that answer and it's pretty good however the the coca-cola nike and some of the major private corporations in the world are changing the way they do business because of droughts floods and things like that that are affecting how they do business in various parts of the world my question is what does what does the united states government either getting out of the way or providing leadership to not necessarily change how we do things but adapt to the reality that the glaciers are in fact melting they are that is happening water is rising and you can blame whoever you want but the reality is that's happening so what do we do as human beings about that well i think you and i are just in a little bit of disagreement i don't subscribe to all those things and and what i would say is that if if we're if we're going in as a country to move to uh energy sources that are cleaner and these types of things i have no problem with that i don't believe that the the government should push us into it before it's ready you look at wind and solar and things like that and there are there are areas where it makes sense but there's also battery technology that's needed in order to make it efficient so the cost can come down and and people aren't going to be charged two or three times more for their electricity for instance

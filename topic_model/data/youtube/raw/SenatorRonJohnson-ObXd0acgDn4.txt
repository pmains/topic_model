so hearing will come to order I just want to thank all the witnesses everybody in the audience for attending what I think is a really important hearing the title is connecting patients to new and potential life-saving treatments we're going to be talking to Darcy Olson who has certainly been at the forefront of trying to pass and a successfully passing of legislation called right to try and States and trying to take a look at that on federal basis you know from personal standpoint don't expect anybody to understand my story but our first child or daughter Carrie was born with a pretty serious congenital heart defect and you know first day life you know modern medicine saved her life of the procedure eight months later when her heart was the size of a small plum they rebelled the upper chamber of her heart so her heart operates backwards day but she's 32 years old and she's lived a perfectly normal life when we were going through that the term medical practice I always kept running through my mind because I never thought of it in terms of what it really meant medical practice that there's nothing certain there's no there's no therapy there's no procedure there's no drug that performs exactly the same with every person every person is different and so the advancement of Medicine really does rely on the expertise of individual doctors working with patients patients that should have the freedom to be able to try things particularly when we know the end result so this hearings about allowing patients at freedom in it's so common sense it seemed to co will just let people try but then when you start getting past the obvious that well people should have the right to make these decisions themselves you start getting into the problems the legitimate problems and concerns of whether it's the FDA or the companies that are producing the drugs or the procedures and their legitimate concerns it gets complex pretty fast but in the heart at the heart of this issue it really is about people and we have and I would asked my opening statement to my written opening statement be entered in the record without objection we also have a binder of 200 letters submitted to this committee in favor us of us holding this hearing I just I normally don't spend a whole lot of time an opening statement but I just want to read a couple at least one this comes from Tim wendler of Waukesha Wisconsin he's the husband of the late trickett wendler who I did meet back in 2014 she had ALS and Tim writes my wife trickett wendler passed on March 18 2015 after two-year battle with ALS when she was first diagnosed we scoured the country to find the best doctors medicine treatments etc the only treatment drug prescribed for my wife was the exact same drug that was prescribed to her father over 20 years ago literally no progress I will tell you that once we were out of options our desire to transform the possibilities became the singular focus of our life I have three small children with a hereditary gene that predisposes them to this intolerant disease that is why it is infinitely important to provide patients with alternatives where none exists the right to try provide something the doctors drug manufacturers legislators etc cannot provide hope sadly my wife do not have this option but I write to you today to implore you or to implore it to you the importance of providing hope where none exists I pray every day that progress was made to find a cure and that my children are not given the same drug that their mother and grandfather were given but if none is made i pray that my children have the right to try now I read that one because when it did meet Trickett this was quite honestly after I'd shortly after I met you Darcy and you know it was made aware of what you're trying to do and right to try and without prompting without being asked I made the statement you know I've I know I know about this this initiative I'm fully supportive of right to try and tears started streaming down her cheeks that has an effect and the purpose of this hearing now is to put a face a human face so that we in Congress can make some intelligent decisions here so we can try and break through the legitimate concerns whether it's the FDA of the drug manufacturers and give people give patients the freedom and the access so they have hope and that's really what this hearing is all about I again thank the witnesses a very thoughtful testimony will be powerful testimony and I just want to thank my colleagues for coming because this is I think this one the most important hearings we will we will hold with that Senator Carper

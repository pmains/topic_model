welcome back now to the school lunches kansas senator roger marshall reportedly considering blocking a bipartisan bill that bill extends federal school lunch funding because the biden administration's guidance on banning discrimination against lgbtq students now the policy states that state schools and agencies who participate in federal food assistance programs cannot discriminate based on gender identity or sexual orientation or face potentially losing funding my next guest recently penned a letter signed by 25 other state attorneys generals calling on the administration to withdraw this controversial policy joining me right now is ohio attorney general dave yost a.g yost it's great to see you this morning thanks very much for being here and i want to just share with you something that one of my sources in the senate told me that he has spoken to former usda attorneys who believe that the administration's rules allows them to withhold school lunch funding if any school does not allow biological boys to compete your thoughts well that's exactly what this proposed guidance does they're trying to avoid the rule making process for starters but the the incredible thing here whatever side you fall down on on this policy dispute uh and the extension of bostock we're talking about taking food out of the mouths of hungry children can't we at least agree that using hunger as a weapon in a policy dispute is a bridge too far that that violates basic human decency so what you're saying is under the current biden administration rules if any school uh does not allow uh what they'd like in terms of transgender competing then they will block funding for school lunches that's exactly right and it's not just public schools it's the private not-for-profit schools that participate in this program as well uh as well as some day care centers uh i i just can't get uh my mind around the idea that we're using hungry children as a human shield in a policy dispute between adults this has never been the the battlefield for policy imagine for example if the desantis administration a few years from now said hey if you don't arm and train your teachers against an active shooter scenario we're going to cut off funding for for school lunches and school breakfast uh there would be an outcry on the left that would stop everything else um and yet i hear nothing but crickets that and the biden administration has actually proposed this as a good idea it feels like a some kind of perverse new version of hunger games well i mean to use funding for school lunches as a way to force this transgender issue seems to me so wrong-headed what can you do about it i mean you've sent this letter are you suing the administration to stop this well the letter is a precursor to i'm sure uh a possible court action if the administration doesn't withdraw it you know there's enough reaction around the country and as your intro indicated in the congress and senate uh i i still hope that the administration may come to its senses and say that this is not where we want to be we don't want to weaponize food but if they don't i can't imagine that uh some of my colleagues and i won't uh go to court seeking to restrain this unlawful action and here's one other thing you're going to hear people on the left that say well this is just an extension of the supreme court decision in bostock which you know was a title vii case the decision in that case expressly said you can't take this and put it in other contexts and it doesn't apply to title ix which is what we're dealing with here um and the bible administration is forging full speed ahead anyway taking away congress's role of writing the law and making up the law on its own they're not allowed to do that and i think that provides a pretty good basis for us to go to court and complain about this executive overreach in america the president doesn't write the law he enforces it well that they've done that a number of times haven't they i mean really a.g we saw that with the vaccine mandate okay we saw that with remaining mexico we saw that within iran deal all of these things the administration has gone around congress and you know what we've been in court fighting over those things and the osha vaccine mandates great example the supreme court said no you're not allowed to do that right yeah let me bring a former member of congressman doug collins jump in here hey uh aj thanks for being here one of the questions i had though is i think it's bigger than if you read the actual letter from the uh agricultural department on this issue it's more than just the transgender athletes it seems to also imply that if there's not access to bathrooms locker room spaces unisex bathrooms in your reading from my legal side it does appear that it is basically expanding it beyond just participation in sports yeah i i think that that's a correct reading and that's a big concern if you look at this i mean it's it's more than just the it's more than just sports here and i think people need to understand they're holding food hostage for a very radical agenda that's exactly right and i appreciate your leadership and and your colleagues in congress that are calling the administration out for these unlawful acts yeah that's blackmail that's incredible dave yost we'll be watching your action and uh what response you get from that letter they

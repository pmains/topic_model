congresswoman barbara Lee who's been outspoken about fears of mission creep in Iraq and Syria joins us from Capitol Hill from and when it comes to Syria and US involvement what concerns you the most first of course my main concern right now is that Congress has not done his job in terms of debating and authorizing the use of force in Syria I believe it's way past time that we have a debate and really begin to move forward and do our job I wrote to our new speaker mr. Ryan and suggested to him that in the past we've been asking for this debate and authorization but up to now we do not have that and I will continue to ask our speaker for that but don't you see ISIL is the threat of threat not just the Middle East but to the United States no one ever said that ISIL is not a threat i believe Isis is a threat they're a terrible terrorist organization that barbaric there it's really something that is hard to even believe that human beings can do the things that they are doing that's not the issue the issue for me as a member of Congress is the Constitution and the authorization to use force to do what is necessary whether we agree or disagree that is what we have to do and when I am saying whether you agree with the use of force and not whether you want ground troops or troops you are in the war the end the war we need a boat of both Constitution requires that well that's what I'm saying but do you believe in the use of force in Syria and Iraq first of all we have to look at all of the options that are out there we're not going we've been in Afghanistan for what 14 years I think Afghanistan and Iraq has shown us that there's no military solution we need a comprehensive solution led by the people we need more diplomacy we need more political initiatives and negotiations the military option is always there but I think if we're going to really see a step Middle East and we're going to really ensure our own Nash security in the United States we have to look at this from a multi-faceted point of view a debate in Congress will give the public all of the options and then we would have a vote and determine what the best course of action is well you have the distinction of being the only member of Congress to vote against military action in Afghanistan after nine eleven with that in mind what is your solution to Syria and Iran let me say to you that that resolution was a blank check that resolution said the president any president mind you not just President Bush but President Obama any future president is authorized to use force against any nation organization individual wherever forever whenever in a letter to the New York Times you wrote this you said greater involvement in Syria and Iraq will not make us any safer but it will cost more lives in an endless war with no exit strategy what what a building we have no we have no exit strategy as a release Afghanistan or Iraq 14 years of military action what the where are we where are we in terms where are we where are we in your ability in terms of in terms of any stability and in terms of security in those countries you can sleep many many many violent actions taking place there civil wars taking place in these countries and before we engage militarily with especially ground troops the Congress should win and we should have a debate the Congress may decide to authorize the use of force in Syria that's the Congress's decision it congresswoman it's good to see you again thanks for joining us tonight

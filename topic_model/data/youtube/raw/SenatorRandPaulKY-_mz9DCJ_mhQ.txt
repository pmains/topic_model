i joined this filibuster because history needs to demonstrate that someone actually cares about the deficit the deficits do matter we have a 28 trillion dollar deficit there's probably no agency in government more wasteful than the national science foundation this bill increases the budget by 68 this is the agency that funds studying the mail mating call of panamanian frogs to see if the country frogs have a different mating call than the city frogs this is the agency that funds whether or not we should study whether humans should eat ants to slow down the warming of the planet whether or not sitting in a hot tub makes you less stressful whether or not or why people go gray during times of stress ridiculous and crazy stuff that no american would vote for if the american people knew that we were increasing the budget by 68 of an agency that does this kind of ridiculous research studying whether or not japanese quail are more sexually promiscuous on cocaine that's the kind of stuff your federal government's spending money on the american people would be alarmed and would rebel if they knew it's disappointing that many of my republican colleagues will vote for this i'm standing with those who do care about the deficit we will continue to fight and i think we are making end runs thank you and we'll take a few questions this is a debate about a despicable waste of money it's a debate about the debt and whether everybody cares no democrats give a fig about the deficit they're honest new monetary policies spend whatever it takes for whatever it takes our side most of them say they care but there's only a few of us who are willing to say no we're not voting for more wasteful spending to one of the most wasteful agencies in government that's what this is about an amendment here there this is about wasteful spending whether you care about the deficit we do we're going to tell our people at home about it and i guarantee if you ask if you did a whole of republican voters 90 of them were with us and these people would be embarrassed and that's the point we're going to take this to the american people and then they can say explain yourself where you come also

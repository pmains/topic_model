  >> THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. MR. MCHENRY: I RISE TODAY TO   SPEAK ABOUT THE OPIOID CRISIS  THAT'S DEVASTATING FAMILIES AND  COMMUNITIES ACROSS OUR COUNTRY,  INCLUDING IN MY FAIR STATE OF  NORTH CAROLINA AND MY DISTRICT   IN WESTERN NORTH CAROLINA. LIKE THE REST OF THE COUNTRY, O  NORTH CAROLINA'S NOT ESCAPED   THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC. MY STATE HAS SEEN THE  TERRIFYING RISE IN THE NUMBER  OF OPIOID RELATED DEATHS.  FROM 1999 TO 2016, THE NUMBER  OF DEATHS TIED TO OPIOIDS GREW   MORE THAN 800%.  IN 2016 ALONE, THERE ARE ALMOST  2,000 OPIOID RELATED DEATHS IN   NORTH CAROLINA.  IN JUST ONE OF THE COUNTIES I  REPRESENT, THE COUNTY I GREW UP  IN, GASTON COUNTY, THE NUMBER  OF DISPENSED OPIOID PILLS ROSE   TO MORE THAN 20.5 MILLION  PILLS. THAT'S IN A COUNTY OF JUST OVER  200,000 PEOPLE.  THAT SAME COUNTY EXPERIENCE HAD  A 13 FULL JUMP IN -- 13 FOLD   JUMP IN HEROIN DEATHS. WHILE I COULD LIST FACTS ALL   DAY, IT'S ONLY BY TALKING TO   LOVED ONES THAT HAVE LOST  FAMILY MEMBERS DUE TO OPIOID   ADDICTION. OR THOSE THAT HAVE COME THROUGH  ADDICTION ON THE OTHER SIDE. THAT'S THE ONLY WAY WE CAN   TRULY UNDERSTAND THE   DEVASTATING EFFECTS OF THIS  CRISIS.  SO TAKE, FOR EXAMPLE, ONE OF MY  CONSTITUENTS.  JENNIFER KLEIN.  JENNIFER LOST HER BROTHER,   JAKE, TO OPIOID ADDICTION. BEFORE JAKE BECAME AN ADDICT,  JENNIFER AND HER BROTHER SHARED  A VERY, VERY CLOSE   RELATIONSHIP, BUT OPIOID   ADDICTION TURNED HIM 23450 A --  INTO A PERSON SHE BARELY KNEW. EVEN THOUGH JAKE WENT TO REHAB,  AND HAD A FAMILY WHO SUPPORTED   HIM THROUGH THIS WHOLE PROCESS   THROUGHOUT HIS ADDICTION, HE   STILL LOST THE BATTLE AGAINST  OPIOIDS. I HAD THE HONOR TO -- OF   MEETING WITH JENNIFER AND SHE  HELPED ME AND MY STAFF HOST A  WORKSHOP FOR LOCAL LAW   ENFORCEMENT IN MY DISTRICT.  WHERE SHE SHARED THE   HEARTBREAKING STORY OF JAKE'S  ADDICTION. HER AND JAKE'S STORY IS A  POWERFUL REMINDER THAT WE MUST   DO MORE TO ADDRESS THIS  EPIDEMIC.  THAT WE'RE NOT DOING ENOUGH. AND THAT THE HUMAN TOLL OF THIS  CRISIS IS VERY, VERY REAL,   INDEED.  LIKE JENNIFER, I HAVE BEEN   WORKING HARD TO HELP RAISE   AWARENESS IN MY DISTRICT, THE  10TH DISTRICT OF NORTH   CAROLINA, AGAINST THE DANGERS  OF OPIOID ADDICTION, WORKING   WITH LOCAL BUSINESSES, LAW   ENFORCEMENT, AND OTHER   COMMUNITY LEADERS TO COMBAT  THIS CRISIS. I HOSTED ROUND TABLES TO HELP  FACILITATE DISCUSSION BETWEEN  COMMUNITY LEADERS ON DIFFERENT   WAYS WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO   COMBAT THIS CRISIS.  AND THIS EPIDEMIC. AND I HAVE BEEN THERE AS LOCAL   MUNICIPALITIES HAVE RECEIVED   FUND FOR TOOLS THAT ENABLE SAFE  DISPOSAL OF UNUSED   PRESCRIPTIONS AS WELL. OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS, THERE   HAVE BEEN DOZENS OF BILLS  PASSED IN THE HOUSE THAT WILL  HELP PEOPLE LIKE JAKE AND  PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR FAMILY   MEMBERS LIKE JENNIFER. THESE BILLS ADDRESS THIS ISSUE   FROM ALL SIDES.  SOME OF THESE BILLS HELP WITH  THE PREVENTION OF ADDICTION. OTHERS ENSURE EVERYONE HAS   ACCESS TO TREATMENT AND HELP   FACILITATE THEIR RECOVERY. STILL OTHERS PROVIDE IMPORTANT   SUPPORT TO COMMUNITIES AFFECTED  SO THAT THEY CAN HAVE THE TOOLS  AND RESOURCES THEY NEED TO   COMBAT THIS EPIDEMIC.  LAST FRIDAY, THESE BILLS WERE  PASSED IN THE HOUSE OF   REPRESENTATIVES TOGETHER AND A   BILL H.R. 6, THE SUPPORT FOR TH  PRESIDENT'S DESK FOR SIGNATURE.  BILL H.R. 6, THE SUPPORT FOR   PATIENTS AND COMMUNITIES ACT.  IT'S NOW HEADED TO THE UNITED  STATES SENATE AND HOPEFULLY  THROUGH THE SENATE TO  THIS IS AN IMPORTANT STEP, A   HOLISTIC STEP THAT THIS CHAMBER  HAS TAKEN ON A BIPARTISAN  BASIS. -- BASIS TO HELP COMBAT THE  OPIOID EPIDEMIC AND HELP   PREVENT THE TRAGEDY EXPERIENCED  BY THE KLEIN FAMILY FROM   HAPPENING TO OTHER FAMILIES IN   THIS COUNTRY.  WE ALL HAVE STORIES. WE ALL HAVE LOVED ONES AFFECTED  BY THIS CRISIS.  AND CONGRESS MUST DO MORE AND  WE'LL CONTINUE THIS FIGHT UNTIL  WE ERADICATE THIS EPIDEMIC ONC

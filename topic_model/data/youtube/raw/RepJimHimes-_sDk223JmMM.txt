it is possible of course that the mother investigation could lead to impeachment proceedings against President Trump 20 years ago after President Bill Clinton was impeached Arkansas Congressman ASA Hutchinson was one of the Republican house managers and presented an obstruction of justice case to the entire United States Senate it is simply any corrupt act or attempt to influence or impede the proper functioning system of justice it is a criminal offense a felony and it has historically been an impeachable offense the obstruction of justice is of great consequence and significance to the integrity of our nation when committed by anyone but particularly by the chief executive arm of our land the President of the United States well joining me now is Asia husband a sahaja s'en who is now the governor of Arkansas and a former member of Congress and from Stamford Connecticut his Democratic congressman Jim Hines who sits currently on the House Intelligence Committee welcome to both of you come on let me start with you a simple question here obstruction of justice if that is among the chief charges against President Trump that was something that you brought to the United States Senate against then President Bill Clinton how serious in your mind is an obstruction of justice charge against a president in the United States was very serious of course and that's one of the reasons we pursued that back in President Clinton's the impeachment trial but you also have to remember it's a very high bar as that was presented there was not a sufficient vote in the Senate to convict on that and the American public they look at any charge against the president's with great scrutiny as they should so it's a very high bar and in in this instance I think that's probably one of the most interesting aspects of the anticipated Moeller report as to what form it would be in you've got to remember that first of all Kenneth Starr and his independent counsel review four year investigation that was preceded by Robert Fisk this one is less than two years and so it's being presented will there be specific itemization of crimes that could constitute an impeachable offense that was the outline with kenneth starr i don't anticipate that happening in this instance but that will help guide and direct congress as to what there is on that congressman Himes what do you what are you looking for from this report and is it is it an automatic that we're gonna see at least an inquiry into impeachment well first and foremost what i'm looking for is you know a report that that that gets to the truth and that gets out there and this is really important you know the preface of your show you said democrats are hoping for this and republicans are hoping for that and and and look it's a political world so i do think people have their hopes but more than anything else you know the question of the russian interference and the possibility of collusion by the president and his people has twisted our politics into something unrecognizable for the last two years including behavior on the part of the president attacking the FBI attacking bob muller you know everything about this has become political the way to end that of course is for the truth to be out there and if that truth indicates that president trump committed no crime impeach a bull or otherwise so be it if it indicates that he did that's a much more complicated world but first and foremost given that we've been on the edge of our seats for the last two years on this issue everyone in this country needs to know what happened and then we decide where to take it from there governor you said something in interesting you said you you lamented the fact that there was you couldn't figure out a way to make the impeachment proceedings in the late nineties more bipartisan which of course on one hand you think well though of course you couldn't but i understood what you meant meaning but you couldn't even get bipartisan cooperation for the mechanics of it all right how do you convince your fellow republicans today that that was a mistake that Democrats made with you don't make the same mistake if Democrats go down this road first of all you have to try and that's a big part of it is you have to have conversations as to how should this be approached in a bipartisan way how to deal with a molar report Bert so if what should be disclosed the timing of the disclosure as well as you know what's the next step so of course it all depends on what is there and again you know this could be a simply a report that does not outline any offenses against the President of the United States then you're going to wind up having investigations by different committees it's gonna wind up partisan right now which is a disappointment but I think you first have to try to say let's communicate what is the right thing to do here what could be done to bipartisan way congressman Heim said look the House Intelligence Committee to me has proven pretty difficult to see bipartisan cooperation we did see we've seen some on Senate Intel side is there anything that has changed in the Intel committee since the chairmanships changed well one obvious answer to that question is that the Chairman is no longer Devin Nunez and Devin Nunez is chairman of course very early on in the last Congress sort of turned over his activities to being the defense of the President and Devin is part of that group and it's not a huge group but a part of that group in the Congress that is really fully dedicated facts be damned to defending this president and I I sort of chuckle at governor Hutchinson's optimism and he's absolutely right you know we need to try to make this bipartisan in how we approach whatever comes out it's it's more important today than ever because of course today facts are disputed I mean I remember the Clinton situation in the 90s there wasn't a lot of dispute about the facts now each and every fact is disputed and and by the way I'd point out that we're gonna get sort of a feel for the partisan warping of our system this week because there will be a resolution in front of the house saying that the president's emergency declaration that is decision to spend money contrary to the will of the Congress is not constitutional and you know it's going to be quite a lot of the Republicans who were in the Obama administration who called him a king and a dictator and the pen in the phone was such a startlingly damaging thing to our Constitution I suspect they're going to vote to not hold President accountable for going around the Constitution on the issue of his wall look I've got two final questions for each of you congressman ions let me start with you Michael Cohen's going to be testifying in front of your committee this week what specifically are you looking for for from him well you know Michael Cohen is going to jail for lying to my committee so obviously step one is to react him the questions that he felt he needed to lie to us about when he when he testified in the last Congress so we're gonna want to get to the truth allow him to correct the record and then of course the question is okay now that we know the truth what are the follow-ups it's gonna be an interesting week in that regard because of course he'll appear in my committee right after he appears publicly in the Oversight Committee so we'll also have an opportunity to ask follow-up questions and remember there's always some question here about whether Michael Cohen feared retribution for his testimony yeah I don't think he's going to say a lot that is classified but he may have some things that he doesn't feel say comfortable saying publicly that he then wants to say either to the Senate or to the House intelligence committees in closed session Kevin Hart said I want to actually ask you another question governor Larry Hogan at the National you're here for the National Governors Association governor Larry Hogan has lamented that the RNC seems to be rigging the rules to even prevent a challenge as a challenge Republican primary challenge to the sitting president do you think the RNC should look let the chips fall where they may well is his president Trump's RNC in the sense that he appoints the chairman so obviously there is something that is Pro the White House and the administration but obviously in our system of democracy and in our party anybody is free to make the challenge sometimes it's a more difficult environment than others in this with President Trump's record with what he's accomplished it would be very difficult for somebody to mount a successful challenge at this point there is a debate in your party do you think that's a debate that should be had this cycle or not well you're always going to have a debate but like I said you know there's people who criticize President Trump because we don't like his style you don't win campaigns on style I mean you might win but in terms of challenging incumbent it's about policy what you've accomplished and what he's done in terms of increased border security and the court deregulate more authority to the governor's in terms of D emphasizing North Korea as a problem and resolving that he's had tremendous success and so that's the record that he would present the primary be difficult for anybody challenge there all right governor ASA Hutchinson Republican Arkansas thanks for coming by and sharing your views Congressman Jim Hines Democrat from Connecticut will be watching you this week for those Cohen hearings and thanks for coming on as well much appreciate it thank you when we come back it's been a big week as you know and it'll be a big week going forward president Trump's headed to Hanoi Michael Cohen's testifying before three congressional committees and oh by the way the field keeps growing of Democratic candidates trying to challenge mr. Trump panel is next

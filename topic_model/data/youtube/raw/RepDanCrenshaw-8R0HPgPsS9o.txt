we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created as a member of congress i get to have a lot of really interesting people in the office experts on what they're talking about this is the podcast for insights into the issues china bioterrorism medicare for all in-depth discussions breaking it down into simple terms we hold we hold these truths we hold these truths with dan crenshaw ladies and gentlemen welcome back to uh one of the greatest podcasts ever i was going to say greatest but our guest today may have an even greater one and i don't say that about many of my guests this guest is a bit of an intellectual hero of mine dr jordan b peterson jordan thank you so much for being on thanks very much for the invitation i'm looking forward to it well uh i had the honor of interviewing with your daughter michaela at uh at some point last year uh that was a lot of fun and i've been really hoping we could do this and uh here it is so i actually as we were prepping for this came across a little bit more details in your bio which which even though i'm a long time follower some of these things i didn't really even know um and so if you don't mind i just want to want to read through that real quick uh sometimes in a situation like this i would say this this this guest needs no introduction but let's do it a little bit of it if you don't mind so it's dr jordan b peterson a professor of psychology university of toronto clinical psychologist author of the best selling books beyond order uh 12 more rules for life and uh the original 12 rules for life and antidote to chaos raised and toughened in the frigid wastelands of northern alberta uh you have flown a hammerhead roll in a carbon fiber stunt plane i'm not even sure what that means pilot today it's quite the trick are you so you're a pilot no it was my brother-in-law he has a carbon fiber stunt plane and the hammerhead roll you you orient the plane straight up until it stalls and then it falls backwards on its tail and plummets straight down that sounds like fun it's uh it's it's it's physically um strenuous i was up with him i've been up with him a number of times 45 minutes and i think i slept immediately after for like four hours so he did a lot of different stunts he's quite a good pilot and it's it's an amazing plane it'll flip around like this on its axis faster than an f-15 will roll wow yeah yeah that's for sure but uh you've also piloted a mahogany racing sailboat around alcatraz island i've done that i don't know about a mahogany racing sailboat but uh i did uh as soon as i got my bear boat captain's license we sailed in uh san francisco bay and it's amazing that we got back uh in just fine because that was that's quite the place to sail um you've been a dishwasher a gas jockey a bartender a short order cook a beekeeper an oil derrick bit re-tipper plywood mill labor and railway line worker taught mythology to physicians lawyers and businessmen worked with all sorts of famous people um you've lectured across north america europe and australia by far one of the most well attended book tours that has ever been done and look just all in all just an amazing inspiration to millions i i think that's not an overstatement to say and um look we're going to talk today about your new book um beyond order 12 more rules for life and you know how that relates to a lot of i think ongoing discussions and um in our modern society and things i'm concerned with the philosophy of governance so this is really well and i think it relates rather well because a common theme in a lot of your writing is rules i mean it's it's in the namesake of your books and then it seems like every time you you're imparting a lesson you always go back to this theme of rules and a deeper a deeper question of how we derive these rules you often use biblical references i've done the same thing a lot in my own writing and it's it seems that your success is rooted in identifying this need for a real discussion about rules as our society has become more secular it's become more liberal it's become more post-modern a phrase you use a lot in a place where old laws and rules and institutions are cast aside for no other reason than that they're just old and why is why are rules so important to you why do you think that's happened that that trend towards discarding them just because they're traditional and one thing you wrote about in chapter one you mentioned freud you often mentioned freud and you you noted that the the conversation about the id and the superego and as i was reading your analysis of that my i guess my last part of this question is has the id taken over the super ego is that what is causing this sort of decay in traditionalism well that's a lot of that's a lot of questions the first thing i would say about that is that you don't want to think about everything it's too much you need a stable place to move from and so those elements of your life that you can routinize and in some sense make into rules habits and and and maxims and that simplifies you and then you can expend the energy you do have for creative exploration in those limited areas that you might be able to master i mean people don't like uncertainty not not above a certain degree it produces anxiety and destabilizes people and so you know everyone says they want freedom but you want the sort of freedom that you have when you're playing a disciplined chess game you know you're playing chess you don't throw a basketball in the middle of the in the middle of the of the board there's plenty of options with constraints and it's the case too in the creativity literature let's say that constraints produce creativity i think he used the example of the spam haiku archive in my in one of my books so it's a very funny website and it's devoted to haiku which is a very limited form of poetry very constraint written but you can also only write the haiku about the luncheon meat there's like 50 000 of them and they're very creative now of course it's completely absurd but what people are doing is showing that limitations especially when they're voluntarily accepted produce freedom rather than interfering with it because freedom isn't just i can do anything i want all the time no one wants that that's it's too much so and this is something for republicans to chew on i would say one of the things that i noted that was very very interesting to me on my book tour was that every time i talked about the relationship between responsibility and meaning and i was talking about the meaning that helps people endure their suffering the audience would always go quiet and you know i'm interested in what the democrats have to sell their constituents but the republicans could be selling the meaning of responsibility to young people well it's it's like when we say the dignity of work yes that's a variant of it the democrats often use work as it's almost like a punishment to them and they they express this this discontent that people even have to work uh on the on the very far end of the left spectrum yeah well they think of it as oppression and and and uh um exploitation you know and and they're it's a funny way of thinking about things because people work to some degree so they don't starve now that's a very negative way of looking at it but much work if not all is also routine and socialization and commitment and meaning i talked with a psychologist yesterday from north dakota state who wrote he studies meaning from an existential perspective and he wrote an article in newsweek criticizing the idea of universal basic income and the reason he criticized it was because well he noted for example that one of the things that drives people to suicide is the idea that they're a functionless burden and so imagine that you identify a segment of the population and you essentially say to them we can't think of anything useful for you to do but it would be annoying to watch you starve so here's some money i mean i'm being very cynical about that but it's it isn't obvious especially that conscientious people would respond to that with anything but despair and so obviously we need to take care of dispossessed people but but that's a complicated problem and merely giving people money is not a sufficiently sophisticated solution and that does go to the dignity of work right the need we're like pack animals we need to pull now some people more than others it's it's really tightly associated with trait conscientiousness one of the big five personality traits but conscientious people who have nothing to do they're they despair it's it's not it's not in their nature to to not work i think that's absolutely right i mean when we have constantly asked about veteran suicide and and what i say is the you know why aren't we talking about active duty military suicide why is it when you become a veteran you're somehow more prone to suicide now there's some in ptsd this is very interesting my intuition is that it's a loss of purpose and mission well you know one of the things i studied military people for a long time with the u.s naval academy that's a whole story in and of itself i'll tell you but we were looking at what predicts military success among uh among their their students we could predict it quite well and the most salient predictor apart from general cognitive ability which predicts virtually anything complex and that's iq essentially was trait conscientiousness and the thing about conscientious people is that they live for duty they are they are like sled dogs man if if they don't have a purpose there they'll become desperate and it's like the upside to conscientious conscientiousness is it makes you more successful because you're a harder worker let's say you put in more hours but the downside is if you lose your job for example you're made superfluous for one reason or another you'll eat yourself up with despair can we educate our or people who don't have psychology degrees on the on the five big personality traits and and what conscientiousness actually is is defined on definitely okay so psychologists from all over the world have converged over the last 30 years in a personality model and this was all derived statistically so people were asked very large numbers of questions about their personality hundreds of thousands of questions hundreds of thousands of people and statistical techniques were applied to the answers to see how they grouped so for example you might say um i keep my room in good order and i work hard and it would turn out if you answered you know if you answered eight out of ten to one of those it was very probable that you'd answer hi to the other and so you could identify how things group i like to party i like to tell jokes those groups group i often feel desperate and alone i'm highly anxious i get irritated easily those group i like to take care of people my social bonds are important to me i don't like conflict those group and so we know the major groups there's five and they can be broken down into two each so the first group is extroversion and it's associated with positive emotion and extroverts like to be around people they're not warm and friendly that's a different dimension they're gregarious their their basic environment is a social environment they like they're enthusiastic they tell jokes they speak first they're noisy so i'm extroverted and extroversion it consists of assertiveness and enthusiasm and so that's and an introvert is someone quiet and maybe someone who likes nature someone who likes to be alone someone who too much social contact makes tired rather than energizing them so that's extroversion first dimension second dimension neuroticism negative emotion anxiety frustration disappointment despair grief guilt all the negative emotions clump and some people are far more sensitive to negative emotion than others and so you could say they're more risk-averse and so they're they need more security and they're not so likely to take risks um and and you can imagine that there's benefits and costs to that that the cost being that you suffer more but perhaps that you're safer especially in dangerous environments that's the second dimension the third dimension is agreeableness agreeable people are compassionate and warm and so they're they're they care for others it's a part of the maternal dimension and women are higher in agreeableness than men low agreeable people are more combative and tough-minded and competitive and and brisk and they'll tell you the truth even if you don't want to hear it they'll engage in conflict without being crippled by that emotionally let's say or by hurt by it and in the extreme that can be well that's the personality characteristic that best predicts antisocial behavior in the extreme so conscientiousness dutifulness industriousness orderliness and conservatives tend to be more orderly and then the last dimension is essentially a creativity dimension that's also associated to some degree with intelligence and that's openness to experience and open people like fiction and literature and art and music and movies and so they're they're on the creative end of the spectrum so so based on that definition of conscientiousness it seems rather obvious that if you score high on this you will do well in life since it's it being a dutiful being orderly being hard-working and okay so back to our discussion about about veterans they found that you're more likely to be successful if you score high on these on these particular traits and but again to the point of of mission and to the point of meaning and deriving meaning um in in your in the literature or or in your discussions with veterans is my intuition at all correct you think it's definitely the case there's a good literature showing that conscientious people who lose their jobs are much more likely to become depressed yeah because like they're you know these are these are fundamental sub personalities that's part of the way that you might look at it so you're made of you're you have a position in each of these traits and that gives you a personality if you're really really high in openness let's say if you don't create you die like that's your life if you're high in extroversion if you're not with people you you you dry up and blow away so these are these are deeply rooted inside of you and conscientiousness is a trait like that and so people who especially conscientious people they need purpose it's not optional it's it's it's the it can be their defining characteristic so and that's definitely true for military people i mean the military is built for conscientious people it has to be yeah well it's you see one of the things the navy the the naval academy wanted us to do was to uh see if we could select for creativity as well right because they wanted independent thinkers and so forth and it's really tough because most of the military regimen is is suited primarily to to uh conscientious people now if you're open and creative that might work really well if you're in an advanced leadership role but the question is how the hell do you get there because if you're not highly conscientious you're going to get in trouble as you rise through the ranks and lots of companies have this problem by the way because at the low end conscientiousness is vital and openness might be merely disruptive i wonder if that test has ever done on the seal teams um i i find the seal teams to be exceptionally open to new experiences um and um creative as well there's sort of an outside the box thinking kind of mentality yeah well they might be more on the entrepreneurial end for military types yeah you know but i suspect still they're very conscientious oh they must yeah we must be i don't think you can i don't think you can remove that from the equation uh also openness is associated with intelligence so something very very intelligent well like to express how intelligent we are yeah well and it's true i mean it's true it's it's a high demand occupation and so you need a high general cognitive ability and that's openness is the one personality trait that's associated with intelligence so so getting getting back to the how we frame rules and why they're important and really i want to get down to like where they come from i'm not sure we'll ever get past chapter one because i just i have so many questions i think we could go down a lot of deep conversations on on every one of these themes but i i do enjoy and actually throughout throughout the book you talk about you know the ten commandments you talk about a a variety of mythological characters and histories and i think that the the common theme throughout all of that is this sort of trial and error process of how we come to the set of rules that we live by more importantly how we define them as even being good and the reason that i asked you is the id overpowering the super ego and i'm going to kind of scrub the definitions of this but as i understand it the id is sort of my feelings and the superego is sort of the the social structure around us that keeps us from being you know overly emotional wrecks and it does seem to me um in today's society in today's politics and maybe just because i live in the political world that the id is constantly overpowering the superego and it seems to be a maybe a problem that you identify in the first chapter which is don't tear down institutions you know or or at least tear them down well we have people who aren't very well educated think that rules are arbitrary constructions derived from the expression of power and that's rarely true in fact it's not even true of chimpanzees so i'll speak biologically so i just finished a couple of books by friends to wall who's been studying chimpanzees for decades he's very smart and you know there's this popular idea that the that that the top chimp is a tyrannical patriarch and that he rules by force and that that's perhaps even more true of chimpanzees than of human males let's say but it isn't true the top male has to be very affiliative he has to attend to the members of the troop and he has to reciprocate constantly so he does a lot of grooming and a lot of conflict negotiation if he's a tyrant and i'm sure this is familiar to you in a military context if he's a tyrant well what happens is a couple of subordinates band together and take them out and so dewall demonstrated very clearly that even among chimps who are much more physically aggressive than we are this stable leadership is a consequence of a kind of enlightened reciprocity and so now and you talked about rules so imagine this so and i'll speak biologically again so as we advanced through the ages certain patterns of behavior allowed us to group together harmoniously to cooperate and compete to prefer to fulfill our individual destinies and we didn't really know what those rules were you know that was before we had bodies of law let's say well then but we we could watch each other act and we could see who we admired and we could see who we had contempt for and then we could tell stories about those people and then you could say we aggregated the story so we had an aggregated story about what was admirable and we had an aggregated story about what was contemptible and part of that is in some sense it's part of the dawn of religious thinking to abstract out admirable as such that would be christ in christianity or contemptible as such that would be the adversary or satan right these these supernatural figures are transcendent figures that represent these poles of being all right so you capture that in story first well then once you have it in the story especially once you can write it down but that's not absolutely necessary you can start thinking about rules so imagine someone is watching a wolf pack interact they're an anthropologist they can write down the rules well the wolves aren't following rules because wolves don't follow rules but their behavior is patterned and you can describe the patterns with rules well we can do both we behave we tell stories about how we behave we abstract rules from the stories and then the rules can interact with the stories and the behavior and so it isn't like a group of tyrants got together and formed a conspiracy and decided they were going to produce a bunch of rules that would keep the serfs and the oppressed people in their place it isn't that at all unless you're unbelievably cynical about the structure of human civilization and you know i mean there are aberrations there are totalitarians there are tyrants they're a psychopath we all deviate from the ideal but part of the culture war right now is about this absurd proposition that the central organizing tendency of our culture is the expression of arbitrary male power and that's it's absurd i can't believe that we can't defend ourselves against that well what i've noticed just being in politics is the reason it's hard to defend against these sort of post-modernist ideals is because you never see them coming and so it takes some time to develop the arguments and then develop the effective messaging oh yeah and i tell conservatives all the time stop stop acting like victims just because you're on defense all the time that's what it is to be a conservative is to be on defensive get used to it yeah well you're also called upon to defend things that you have no idea how to articulate so let's look at a family yeah like marriage let's take marriage it's like well if a family should have a mother and a father no the criticism would be it isn't necessary for a family to have a mother and a father it's like and if you you're a bigot if you say this yeah well okay it's like oh no now i have to come up with an articulated defense of a dual sex family it's like i don't know how to do that everyone agreed that that was the ideal and even the norm so if it's the norm and if it's the ideal for that man it's widely shared you don't need an articulated defense because or marriage is a is a an oppressive patriarchal uh exploitative relationship it's like well wait wait a second men stick around for 18 years or longer to raise children like that's actually that doesn't seem exactly like a tyrannical structure and then while the rich get married but the poor don't so why are the rich choosing to oppress themselves and the more educated the woman is and the wealthier she is the more likely she is to get married so but like you said those it's not like you have those articulated arguments at hand right now we need you to do that well we've we've also produced specialized groups of people who are publicly funded who do nothing but critique right and that's those those are those the university departments out of which all this nonsense is emanating and like there's a place for criticism and obviously but it's criticism tempered with gratitude and it's somehow gained a foothold that is um really disturbing you know and again you you can label it post-modernism and i think that's probably the right label i know it's a label you use a lot to describe what's happening and and i guess maybe the definition of that would be this sort of challenging of basic truth and and and this this march this march through the institution that marxist did since the 60s that has created this sort of false sense of authority to back up this this destruction of norms and truth and this destruction of basic traditionalism well you know it's an open question if you subsidize a number of highly intelligent people who perhaps have a bit of a chip on their shoulder for four or five decades what's the consequence for your society i mean someone who has a job that isn't merely thinking about the structure of institutions is doesn't have much time to engage in such activity but if you're a tenured professor in a women's study department let's say well essentially you have time to do nothing but that and there's no consequences to your criticism that are negative right right it doesn't affect your ability to make a living and so well so we're stuck with this we have these criticisms that constantly arise and they seem to me to be radically unbalanced so and par and so we're set back on our heels constantly about the fundamentals of our society and you know the other thing that annoys me about that is that i don't also buy the idea that the postmodern people the critics who are influenced by marxism they're influenced by marxism because marx wanted to view the history as a battleground between the working class and and and the master class let's say the the owners the capitalists and you know that produced a lot of catastrophe and so french intellectuals essentially played a sleight of hand in the 60s and transformed that into something like oppressed versus oppressor on non-economic grounds right so it's the same bloody thing it's just in new guys it's and so the problem with that is that there's there's nothing in it that's grateful there's nothing in it that and and furthermore you know there's this insistence that these ideas i was reading for example there's a document of an image produced by the museum of black history in washington i haven't got the name exactly right but it attributed a number of characteristics to to white supremacist culture essentially and they're basically i know exactly yeah we talked about on this podcast it was very very normal things well they're conscientious they're trait conscientious attributes it was like being on time was one of them there's no evidence whatsoever that they're limited to a given race or culture in fact the personality there's very little evidence that personality tests produce racial or ethnic differences so so so but the idea these things that are being critiqued often are tossed off as arbitrary presumptions of western culture and i don't believe that's true i think they are laudable expressions of the central human tendency towards large-scale civilization and there are western variants but there's a core there that's fundamentally human and that's then even deeper than that it's linked with the emergence of ethical activity in animals it's associated with stable games in in game theory so you know we all play games in some sense with one another which is why children like games so much because their practice for life and there's a rule for winning a given game but there's a different rule for winning a series of games and if you and i are going to play a game like this conversation let's say i could dominate you completely hypothetically in the first minute or you could do the same to me and you would be the victor but i'd stop playing or you would and so then the conversation would degenerate so we have to reciprocate enough to keep the spirit alive in order to maximize our participation in the game across time this is critically important this this idea because it's one of the reasons that a stable morality emerges in group interactions across time it's not arbitrary rational rational imposition of something like power well it's how we learn how to act and you you talk about sanity being you know a definition of sanity being the the ability to speak with others and learn from them you know i think i think one problem with extremism in modern times is this this tendency to get into social media bubbles and then you no longer have that that interaction that back and forth it would seem to me that's how extremism happens and maybe why it perhaps got worse as the internet took hold it just allows you to be in that echo chamber a little bit more definitively the the other when you brought up games and how children play games how important these games are it occurs to me that bringing that out to a to a broader conversation about our society and culture is more and more it does seem to me that those who do not compete that well within those games claim that there's an injustice happening claim that the game itself is corrupt and so how do we defend against that how do we say how do we define what a proper set of rules is what a proper game is because the what what the what the left will say is these people aren't winning this race so we must choose we must change the rules of the race a conservative says are the rules just and if they are then the outcomes be what they will that's probably at least in part a represe a reflection of temperamental differences too because that emphasis on justice would be associated more with conscientiousness and the emphasis on inclusion more with agreeableness and so those are competing moral motivations and one's more maternal that would be agreeableness and once well at least symbolically more masculine well that's interesting because because the left always uses the word justice now i don't believe they define it correctly i think the way you just defined it is probably a better way to encapsulate what they're really saying yeah we're really saying justice is blind and therefore impartial but that isn't the kind of justice that social justice is pursuing it's pursuing what says what it's in it's pursuing it's pursuing something like equity which essentially is equality of outcome the presumption that if there are differences between groups in terms of any given hypothetically desirable outcome that that's an indication that the system is unjust and it's actually a hard argument to counter because without engaging in relatively sophisticated philosophical exchange because on the face of it it looks correct if you accept the assumption that talent is randomly distributed then and you look that and you see that outcomes aren't equal then you think well perhaps the game is rigged and that is one possibility and i would counter that with well compared to what well compared to the utopia in my imagination it's like yeah well you should bloody well be careful about that utopian your imagination because that justifies any means on your end right because the outcome is so beneficial that you can do anything you want to bring it about it's justifiable and like my sense is and this is probably more a conservative sense is that we should compare our culture to other cultures not to hypothetical ideals and now it's hard again because like we have a vision of an ideal culture all of us do and so right but there's people suffering they say there's people suffering and why don't you want to help them and that's just a far more complicated question than i think they would make it out to be somebody who can't compete in a in a hierarchy that is that is not corrupted that is as just as we can possibly make it with a set of rules that is as good as we can possibly make them there are still people who will of course not be able to compete as well and for yes and it turns out that it's generally most people because you don't get a linear distribution of competence in a in a just hierarchy you get a pareto distribution so what happens and marx pointed this out although he wasn't the only one you know money tends to aggregate in the hands of fewer and fewer people and now the thing is those people change you know but it's still the case that a tiny minority of people controls the vast proportion of the money but it's the case in everything like a tiny number of people are stars in pro basketball or any pro league a tiny number of record recorders produce almost all the records almost no one who sings professionally makes money but those who do make a tremendous amount so you get these non-linear accruals of of value and that also looks like an unjust system and it's certainly troublesome i mean there were many societies that um well they would redistribute income on a seven year period for example because some people would get rich at the not so much at the expense of other people but that would cause a certain degree of misery and so there'd be radical redistribution once every seven years to to stop the probability of of revolution and that that's the thing that conservatives have to contend with you know is that because this distribution tends to be radically unequal even in just systems i mean think of what happens when you play monopoly one person takes everything that's what happens and it's basically a random game but if you play a random game long enough between people and there's a zero point so people can fail one person will eventually take everything their physicists have studied the distribution of money and they use physical equations to account for this it's really a pronounced tendency it's not merely a consequence of capitalism like marx assumed that's that understates the problem but it's something that conservative types have to contend with is you set up a just system your your institutions are functional they do what they're supposed to do and they produce what's of value to other people but the benefits accrue to a tiny minority so what do you do about that well you might say that's the best we can do we can multiply the number of games and that's a good solution but it's still it doesn't address the problem and to the left though we never will because to conservatives we would say well we would um we would have a safety net and you would you would have some sort of safety net that doesn't hinder the necessity for incentives because you know taken to the logical extreme of marxism nobody would have any incentive to work and that's been proven in history over and over and over again it's proven what the ubi discussion it's been proven here in america where we're having um problems with people going back to work because we've we've amplified their unemployment benefits and so nobody can hire anyone so it's very obvious that incentives matter quite a bit and so the conservative would say we're already out of balance we've gone too far on this on this question and the left would say we haven't gone nearly far enough and i wonder if that if if that balance will ever be struck or if we just forever live in these different dichotomies it won't be struck it's it's necessary for that conversation to continue forever because you can't get it right right because you're trying to optimize two things at this two contradictory things at the same time their intention and the reason that i'm an advocate for free speech above all let's say is because the conversation about how to balance those competing values is what keeps them balanced there's no permanent solution yeah and i agree with that i think it never changes and you know it's the in the thomas seoul version of the the unconstrained versus the constrained vision i that's my favorite way of describing the two dispositions between the and i think one represents the left the unconstrained vision this sort of belief that government can and a centralized authority can truly be trusted to continue to solve problems and to continue to build towards utopia in the constrained vision having i think a much more realistic view of what is possible and and the necessity for a set of incentive structures that optimize society to the maximal degree and that doesn't mean perfection so i would consider myself of the constrained vision sort i think these dispositions are innate i think they manifest in the in modern political discussions as the left and the right but i don't think they ever go away no i don't think they i don't think they can ever go away because the environment keeps switching on us transforming and changing and so we're faced with the necessity of keeping up well one of the things you you say is like the need for this balance whether you call it chaos versus order whether you call it um you know the creative types versus the institutional types the left versus the right the need for balance i tend to agree with that i often say look we have to listen to what liberals are saying sometimes they point out things that we should also want like access to health care um like a cleaner environment but i think you need conservative problem solving to get there i don't think they can be trusted to optimize solutions correctly i think conservatism is by definition a series of principles and frameworks by which we solve problems it's a process-oriented philosophy well you know in businesses the open types are okay so politically people who are high in openness are more likely to be liberal and open people are more likely to be entrepreneurial but openness doesn't predict managerial competence or administrative competence conscientiousness does and so it's it you can make a very strong case that open types innovate and conservative types implement and yeah and i i can't i think all all the relevant data in psychology and this is a solid element of psychology solid aspect of psychology suggests that you you can't have a group of open people run a company no maybe in its early expansion phase but not once it's implement not not once it's routinized right you can't have the disorganized creative types doing all of that it just doesn't well they won't even want to do it you know they'll get bored yeah yeah no no no they they'd find that completely stultifying because they they don't find if they're low in conscientiousness they don't find any real intrinsic satisfaction in let's say in duty or routine one um i don't know how often you really talk about populism or if you really define it i talk i tend to talk about it a lot especially because it's i i hear more and more on my side of the political aisle saying i'm i'm a right i'm a i'm a conservative populist and they'll say this with pride now i think populism is unbelievably dangerous i hate it and now now people will say well what are you defining it as and i say well i define it as telling you what you want to hear your feelings just mirroring your feelings back to you because that's an effective way to connect with somebody on an emotional level and then i can get them to do it whatever i want like vote for me as opposed to telling them the truth right telling them the nuances and the the truth behind what is necessary to fix social security and solvency as opposed to just telling them we're never going to take it away from you well of course that's what you want to hear but so that's populism as i define it too many others i think define it as um you know doing what's right for the people instead of the politicians and the lobbyists now to me that just sounds like like platitudes um i don't think it means anything you might make a distinction between telling people what they want to hear as populism and listening to people as something appropriate for a leader and so i i talked to a conservative politician in canada who started a political party and which became the official opposition in canada and he would go around western canada because that's where it came from making stump speeches but what he really liked was the q a and that's because he could hear what people wanted now he crafted his policy partly in response to what he heard that people needed and wanted but it wasn't because he was trying to tell them what they wanted to hear to get elected you know so that's a that's a real careful distinction to make right because you want to listen of course but of course but that's not the same see i think one of the things that hitler did for example if you want to consider him a populist you know at the absolute extreme i've studied his behavior and his success let's say trying to account for it and hitler was extremely good at tailoring what he said and his emotional responses to the crowd and so he allowed his voice to become well this is this is a psychoanalytic idea but he allowed his voice to become the articulated mouthpiece of the unconscious of the crowd and it isn't obvious that you want the unconscious of a crowd in control right there's a lot of dark things down there that wouldn't find their expression you know in normal day-to-day civilized behavior so that's that's a real danger how you balance that with actually listening to your constituents well i suppose that depends on your intrinsic ethics right you said well you want to have a commitment to the truth well to your point it's important to define populism and the reason um the reason i brought it up in this context and of of your writings is because it does appear to me that that the populism is i defined it okay going and doing town halls and listening to constituents something we all do all the time i certainly want to define it that way i define it more as um the way i see a lot of people currently defining it which is like just simply doing what's popular well uh writing everybody two thousand dollar checks the stimulus payments is of course popular it's it's very easy to to take a poll and get a 65 75 you know approval rating for that it doesn't mean it's good it doesn't mean it's based in in truly good policy or that it's even defensible yeah well it's like ruling by referendum imagine that every single policy decision was put to a referendum i mean we've had referendum on separatism for example in canada and of course there's a referendum on brexit in the uk and now scottish independence is you know the scots are pursuing the same pathway i mean there's there's some utility in having people who have some specialized knowledge be intermediaries between people and and policy yeah and and you hear it in politics you hear it all the time and in political science you would ask look are you a are you a delegate or are you a trustee you know and the answer is you might be a mix of both it kind of depends on the issue but what you do owe the people is a legitimately true an explanation based in truth or why you're doing what you're doing i see it far too often in modern politics where it's very easy to make a specific populist political statement to say something like and i think again the reason i'm connecting it to your work is because the a populist a typical populist cry is the system doesn't work for the people right and you hear that on the right and you hear that on the left and that really gets at our conversation about rules and institutions and whether those institutions are just or not and it's so easy to to just claim that they're not it's so easy because an outcome isn't isn't the what you yourself would desire what do you think the best governing philosophy is the governing structure and you know is it a pure democracy is it a is is there ever such thing as as a sort of um benevolent king who makes all the right decisions is it a republic the way we have in the united states um of course i'm biased i tend to think that our constitution is as good as you can get i'm not sure how you could improve it there's only trade-offs at a certain point not so much you know clear improvements without any trade-offs but what would do do you have thoughts on that well i don't think there's any evidence that any systems other than representative democracies work work well i mean what would we compare them to even if you have a benevolent monarch and you could imagine that that might have some advantages in terms of short-term efficiency you run into the problem of leadership transformation and you know i mean i've often i've read that george washington wasn't a great man because he became president he was a great man because he stopped being president and that's really really important and you know one of the great advantages of a system like the american system but i think it's characteristic of well-structured democracies across the world is that they do handle power transitions generally speaking very well and they're also really distributed so they're hard to take out i mean even if a terrorist did something absolutely atrocious and took out most of congress it wouldn't materially affect the democracy for more than a couple of months because the institutions are so distributed that they would just they just pop back up you don't get that with centralized authority even if hypothetically centralized authority is upon occasion more efficient and efficiency isn't everything because you can move very rapidly in the wrong direction if you're efficient and people ask that all the time why can't you guys go up there and get things done just do what makes sense and i say well you know what makes sense is a it's a vastly different question and answer for every single group of people every single individual for for starters and when when discussing complex issues what makes sense is um is nuanced and yes and it needs to be subject to argument because there isn't any difference between argument and thinking you know there's two elements to thinking right you ask yourself a question in some sense and you get an answer and so that's a revelatory element of thinking but then there's the discursive element you you take that idea that has appeared to you and you subject it to argument internally and we do the same thing with political discussion and we don't know a better way to move forward than that and and i would agree with that it gets back to get everything gets back to this sort of set of rules that we live by and argumentation and and what is what is seen as a good argument versus bad argument what is seen as truly critical thinking versus just uh you know the opposite of that whatever that might be and it what scares me about modern times is the normalization of the opposite of critical thinking something that passes as an argument but really isn't sort of the shorthand and identity politics is used as shorthand cancel culture is used as a shorthand uh to to bypass argumentation delib real real argumentation demagoging is used to bypass argumentation um the the the assertion that you're a bad person because you because you want that policy that's intended to you know just impugning your motives is intended to bypass argumentation and like i've been in politics that long but it does seem to me we're losing the battle it does seem to me that and maybe i'm just romanticizing the past but sometimes it seems to me that that that argumentation or that that set of rules by which we played was was more concrete in the past than it is now yeah it's really hard to say isn't it because our memory of the past is very fragmentary and partial and i mean it isn't self-evident to me that things are more unstable say in the u.s than they were under nixon and certainly they're not as unstable as they were under lincoln of course so right so and and and and of course there was the depression in the 1929 stock market crash and perspective is always in order yeah well and there is no shortage of conflict under all those circumstances now it does seem to me that things have heated up in the last four or five years relative to say something like 25 years before that and i don't i can't account for that exactly i don't know exactly what it is i mean it does seem like there's less trust in the us particularly between the political parties and you know part of that might be also that your elections have been so unbelievably close for so long right it's you're so split exactly down the middle and to we we we have a true a truly split country in ways that other that other countries do not when it comes to conservatives versus liberals you know you compare ourselves to the you know i i don't think anybody's debating how to reform health care in canada any real way i'm not i'm not sure i'm correct about it in the uk but in the uk that's certainly the case you know the conservative party in the uk would be would be tarred and feathered by our conservatives here they're just they're just not they we we would call them traitors to our cause because we we just would so it doesn't seem like the art like there's it seems like we're the last bastion of conservatism in a class well you also have a two-party system which in some sense might produce un under some circumstances more polarization i mean in canada we have a three-party system basically we have conservatives who are to the left of your conservatives we have liberals who i think are roughly in the same ideological position as the democrats and we have the new democrats who is that's where the radical leftists hang out to the degree that they do and they have influence at the provincial level sporadically but have never managed a national party but there the voice is there but it's sort of par partitioned off in some sense right because it it it's rare that they have direct federal governmental influence of any massive sort and so they can generate all sorts of utopian ideas some of which have some utility some of which are then adopted by more centrist parties and so it's hard for me to say to what degree that would be advantageous in the us i mean the democrats in particular seem to be spanning a very wide ideological spectrum at the moment and they're i know i talk to democrats a lot they're as a group they're far more centrist than you would assume by watching from the outside and to me that is because the center and this is a big problem for the republicans too the center doesn't have a compelling story and yeah this the center is a knife edge well there's that too but i mean try the thing about the radicals is that they've got something romantic to market right you can stand up against malevolence you can demonstrate in the street there's there's a romanticism about it that that's associated it's it's hard to have a fiery campaign speech where you say well on the one hand this but on the other hand this and you know i think that's there maybe there's some truth to both yeah you're not going to get an applause for them yeah well there's the old joke you know what do we want incremental improvement when do we want it in due course right and so that's sensible and and and old in some sense i mean people become more conservative as they become older and perhaps more patient but it's not fiery and may not the democrats i've been talking to are trying to generate messages that are more centrist as an alternative to the more radical stories that seem to dominate the media and certainly dominate the public debate and they are definitely in the majority and it would be lovely to see the republicans do the same thing but for the life of me for example looking as an outsider i can't see what the republican story is now i talked to dennis prager about this week ago or two weeks ago and he said well you know the thing about conservatives is mostly we want to be left alone and fair enough but but there's a paradox between that and also telling a story that's appealing and well that's why i think that your best bet in some sense is to is to make the case to young people the relationship between meaning and responsibility i i've talked to um conservative youth groups in the u.s um with charlie kirk's group and so quite a number of thousands of them very young people and they're very very receptive to that idea because they're searching you know the world's fractured up partly in this post-modern way people don't know what to believe they don't know what rules to live by and what that means is that there's a hunger among young people for a message that that has a meaning for them and conservatives can sell that in the guise of responsibility if it isn't just simple moralizing yeah and i think we have to i think we also have to make it clear to people that conservatism is about proper problem solving it's not just about being left alone that's libertarianism and we have to distinguish ourselves better from libertarianism which which really is it's it's it's live and let live to the extreme the sort of individualism to the extreme conservatism i define it as a as freedom based in moral code as our founders defined it that's what we're trying to conserve and then to your point we have to define what that moral code is and defend yes i think we've defined it over time but we have to do well yeah you have to tell young people let's say because that's perhaps the primary target is why they should care about that what's in it not so much what's in it for them but why is that valuable and when it's when it's parodied by the left as the mere rantings of the privileged i mean that's easy to understand especially if you're young i mean one of the best predictors of being wealthy is being old right so you accrue money during your lifespan to sort of stave off the disadvantages of aging and that's not so unreasonable but it does put young people at a disadvantage economically let's say and something has to be sold to them that that they can abide by and they are fragmented they are looking for meaning and purpose and identity as you can tell because identity politics wouldn't be so powerful if that wasn't the case it isn't obvious to me that the right is doing a good job of addressing that need it's a real i mean i'm it's i'm not a blaming because it's not easy to come up with it's very hard it's very hard it's very hard and and the attempts to do it have what in my in my belief are what has caused the populist right because it's this it's this need to to define an enemy and to engage in resentment politics and and to even elevate victimhood which is just something that the left has done constantly but i i get concerned when i see the right starting to do it as well in order to compete yeah well you can and it's sort of you could take your definition of populism and describe it as an appeal to resentment yeah that's really dangerous like i don't know of any emotion that's more dangerous than resentment it's really a dangerous emotion yeah yeah well and you do see that on the right and the left and b well once you're resentful you see yourself as an unfairly targeted victim and then you look for a perpetrator and then you look for someone to go after and that's a very bad road to walk down so yeah and it no longer becomes about the the proper form of governance or the proper governing philosophy and that's what you vote on you know it becomes about who's a worse person that this is this is the the toxifying of of politics in general is when it becomes about who's the worst person as opposed to who has better or worse ideas and you tend to we tend to take the worst people from a given side and and use that as an excuse to say that's why they have bad ideas now for some reason it seems to me that democrats can bypass that a lot easier than we can i don't know why that is um but it's it seems to be true i don't you know what do you mean that they can bypass that more easily that it's it's harder to say it's harder for conservatives to make an argument that their ideas are bad because because their motivations might be bad or they have some scandal yeah well maybe it's because the you know the democrats claim that their motivations are in some sense altruistic and devoted to other you know to the to the group rather than the individual and that's an easy argument to swallow at the face of it because it's easy to identify what's for the individual with what's selfish even though that's not a very sophisticated way of looking at it but it's a simple way of looking at it i think they're rhetorically much more skilled and i think i think they've been they've been at this longer what i tell when i talk to conservative groups i say look we've got to get used to being activists again the left has a long history of it there's you know they wrote the 12 rules for radicals you know decades ago the labor unions have long been organizers they're very good at this conservatives are not right we are not march on the street types of people again the battle cry is what do we want incremental change i mean it's it's you know so this is trying to trying to now and and i think i think a lot of people are woken up to this to become proper activists now i think a lot of people take that and mean we need to scream and yell as loud as we can and i try to tell them no that's not persuasive in politics to in order to be in order to fight and win you must be persuasive and we have to think through those things a little bit better than well can i ask you some technical questions these are things i've been curious about since spending time in washington so when the last couple of times i went to washington i was quite struck by the relative lack of a like a narrative generating function within the political parties with a messaging function with all of the apparatus that might generate policy technically and then communicate it to people and i was also struck by the fact that the elected officials have to spend so much of their time fundraising that and outside their offices behold to their parties that they have a paucity of time to attend to the things that you might regard as central to the problem of governance and so some of this looks to me like a technical problem what do the republicans have at the party level for a policy and communication generating function like technically speaking i mean you're using youtube you're doing that on your own it's like well there's youtube like why aren't the republicans using youtube it's the biggest television network in the world and it's free so the the answer is technically speaking institutionally speaking those mechanisms certainly exist i mean there's a on the campaign side there's an rnc and an rcc uh here on the official side in the house there's a there's a leader there's a whip there's a conference chair they're in charge of that messaging for the most part it goes out but what you're not seeing is marketing and so why why am i doing why am i having this conversation right now why am i because nobody's talking about marketing and so i do the marketing so i think what i do is i do represent that next stage of evolution and how we get our ideas out there and i think we're becoming more and more successful at it as a party what i you know one of the concerns i have on my side i've talked about this in past podcasts is you can kind of divide people up in here between you know legislators and performers people who just you know legislators doing the work that you're talking about there's a lot of them they don't get any credit though in fact they're called rhinos and establishment yahoos by our own side then there's the performers who basically just go down their list of slogans of what they think they're supposed to say that will that will deliver the the the the the hope you know the reaction that they want from the base and they go on tv and they say it and they can fundraise off of that rather yeah they're the enthusiastic sure sure that's a that's a temperamental difference too the conscientious strugglers are in the back doing all the work but but you have to do the work and you have to show people that you're doing the work right right so so i try to do both because i you know i i do disparage the performers but only if that's all you do and so you have to be both i mean i jump out of airplanes for my campaign commercials clearly i like to you know do some sort of performance but you have to do both because you have to bring people in you also have to connect with them and then but then you owe them a sophisticated argument that's why i do the podcast because i owe my audience a sophisticated argument that i can actually dive into and we have experts on on all sorts of subjects and so but but the other thing i'll say about your question is there's the grand myth of the establishment in washington everybody always talks about it the establishment and all the you know the swamp and all this and everybody's going to go clean out the swamp and they never seem to you know why because there is no establishment if there was then you wouldn't have this problem of of what seems to be a lack of coherent messaging or or even an ability to exclude people from the party who are embarrassing us and there's a number of them that i you know would like to exclude but we don't seem able to why because the part it's not that the parties are so strong it's that they're not right right right yeah well that's that was exactly what i observed and like for again from an outsider i mean i've been talking to some democrats about infrastructure development ideas for example which seemed to me a hell of a lot better than playing identity politics if you if you had to make a choice but it's oh don't worry they they play identity politics oh yes of course of course and everything gets contaminated with everything and so that's part of the reason why the debate has to continue constantly right so that things get pared down to something that's appropriate but i do struggle at the moment to understand what it is that the republicans are offering to people as an alternative vision and so what what do you see as what's being offered how would you formulate it in in a manner that would capture people's imagination well it depends on the issue because i i do need to define it within every issue but i think in i think in philosophical terms i say you're a republican because you believe that the primary purpose of government is to protect your natural rights life liberty and the pursuit of happiness so you start with that basic truth that's very important and you start with three pillars culture the political institutions and the economy and when it comes to the culture it's a foundation and personal responsibility everything is derived from personal responsibility and the meaning that you get from that everything now i would actually go a step deeper and i would say like it's it's fortitude is underneath that because you can't be responsible if you're not mentally and physically tough so if somebody asks me what the number one crisis is in the world it's a lack of fortitude and and then very closely related to that as a lack of personal responsibility which is i i would assume would be your answer to that question um but i don't want to make assumptions about you and so that's on the cultural side i would add a lot of as a other that's the thing i think that's what's made me able to talk about responsibility without getting a backlash is that i more or less offer it as an adventure and that's a real crucial difference because when it's a lack then that points to a deficit but if it's an adventure it's a call to action and it's a and there's a statement of faith it's tricky you know and because i've really thought about this a lot because i think well why are people responding positively when i talk about responsibility when there's been no shortage of people in their lives lecturing them or hectoring them about responsibility and i think it is because i'm framing it as an adventure or because i regard it as an adventure because i'm not merely framing it it's not manipulative i'm trying to say what i believe to be the case and that's different than you know you should act properly it's like well if you adopt responsibility then you find meaning and that can sustain you in your life better than anything else better than the pursuit of happiness better than anything else it'll fortify your relationships it'll make you successful all of those things but it's the adventure of your life and everyone is everyone well you know i've i've had exposure to lots of audiences it's it's a message that isn't being delivered well as far as i can tell and so that's partly why it seems to stop people cold and so and it is what i think the conservatives have to offer is that adventure of personal responsibility exactly and it follows quite nicely into we are for the free market the left is basically not now moderate democrats might be but i i would i would argue that every single thing they vote for um is an attack on that uh in every single way so you know but but but that thus is the the honest and unnecessary debate between how much do you regulate and how much do you not you know just because one regulation is good doesn't mean that ten more will be so that's that's sort of our argument so the you know best what to do with your money you know best what to do with your business and in the nature of competition things won't be perfect but if we also have a set of rules that prevent someone from infringing on the rights of others see conservatives also define rights in the negative sense meaning i can't infringe on your life liberty and property that's that's how we define it i do think the left tends to define it as positive rights meaning i'm owed something by you maybe through your taxation i am owed a visit to a doctor and we don't think that's a right now it might be a service that is worth providing that's how i feel about healthcare for instance but in canada they call it a right well it's only a write on paper you can't possibly conscript the doctor's services to make them do something for somebody and that's actually how it plays out in practice with long wait lines and so you know what conservatives provide is is a more sensible approach to problem solving and and and i think the libertarian side of conservatism will well will get trapped in this this non-answer to these questions of like well you know they'll always have an excuse not to do something and that's not necessarily what it is to be a conservative now if it was a voter asking me that question i would say what do you care about what do you care about because because i can go on every single issue and if it now they probably won't say infrastructure people will say that's an important thing for our country to do but they they probably won't say that they'll probably say if they're a moderate voter i care about the environment i care about health care and i say okay environment well i'm a rational environmentalist i'm not a radical environmentalist that's the first thing what does that mean it means i think we do have an inch i think first of all the world's not going to end in 12 years it's not even going to end in 100 years it doesn't mean climate change doesn't have some amount of cost and it doesn't mean we couldn't mitigate that cost in some ways but you might do so um by first of all preparing for it the way we have been doing for a hundred years and also investing in energy that is both reliable and clean like nuclear i always joke it would be really funny if we had this rock and we just like like heated it up in a reactor and then it provided clean energy for 25 years so you know i think we win that debate rather quickly to be honest um healthcare's conservatives have not done so well on but fundamentally what i tell them is look you have to look at healthcare the way you look at food food is something it's not a right at least in the negative sense you can't make it a right because someone has to produce this you can't conscript the service of others that's not a right but it is something we think people should have in a modern society so how do we get it yeah well in the problem with the health care issue too and from a free market perspective or perhaps a problem is that there's an unlimited demand for it and it isn't you know the free market works really well in in virtually every way that a distributed decision-making system possibly could and that's a conservative argument that young people aren't taught enough about is that well the world's really complicated okay so how do we deal with that well we distribute decision-making power as broadly as possible because that's the best computational approach and that's technically correct the problem with health care in some sense and i might be wrong about this is that there's no limit to the demand and it isn't obvious to me how the free market can respond to a problem where it's got a it's got to be a mix and so you know our answer is empower the patient with money um you know in canada there's a single-payer system in the uk there's a there's the the nhs and this is basically like the va for the entire country what we say is you have to empower the patient and this is why i use the food analogy because that's how we provide food to people we give them food stamps it's a voucher that you go purchase food that you want at the grocery store and it's not necessarily unlimited i mean it's high it's higher than we'd like it to be but the demand isn't necessarily unlimited you don't just make random visitations to the doctor no money if you're dying absolutely but we spend it anyway in america we spend it anyway it's not like anybody doesn't get their care it's sort of a trope that the left uses you know people dying because but that's just not true what is true is that our payment system is is a mess and so fix the payment system in a way that creates choice and competition which lowers overall costs but without sacrificing the quality and the innovation that is that is highly unique to america only you know and i point this out all the time about look how many how many vaccines and and because covid really really made this apparent when you look at the number of vaccines and treatments being worked on and being approved in the united states it's well over 300 china comes in at number two at about 30 something where we're the big innovators of the world you know people might go to canada to get cheaper drugs but that's a cost reason they're going there for cost people leave canada to come to the united states because they can't get that hip replacement they just can't get it they can't get the cancer drugs the cancer treatment because you know we have access to far more of the cutting-edge drugs for instance than other developed countries why because well there's a negotiation that goes on and sometimes they just don't get sold um to to country x y and z so there's just the trade-offs of health care are unbelievably complicated and my big goal as a legislator is to simplify that to the maximum extent possible without being very dishonest you know because it's easy to demagogue and do that but enough about me i want to bring it back to um one thing you talk about a lot one thing i talk about a lot perhaps because you've influenced me over the years which is heroic archetypes and the heroic archetypes we emulate and it's related to the political discussion because you know you and i probably agree on a lot of the heroic archetypes that jesus being the ultimate heroic archetype the perfect man one thing i am constantly wondering in the post-modernist movement what are their archetypes who could we even look to to understand what their next move might be again we as as somebody either a traditionalist or a conservative you always feel like you're on the defense because you never know what they're going to do next well i think that the the fundamental archetype in some sense that underlies the radical left is the the tyrannical father everything's viewed through that lens is that the world is best construed as a tyrannical father and so their heroism is the rebellion against the tyrannical father and it's it's a powerful archetype because there's an element of truth in it because every system is insufficient and arbitrary to some degree and so there's plenty of motive power in it but it's it's an ideology because it's incomplete that's that's my view because it's not only a tyrant and you're not only the hero you know the person who's rebelling against it and so it's it's uh it's a truncated religious it certainly is and it's it's very emotionally compelling because it is a form of heroism to rise up against the tyrant i mean every american knows that because that's part of the founding story of course although i don't know if england makes the world's best tyrant but it doesn't really matter no it doesn't um hey fourth of july is coming up and we love to talk about the english uh being tyrants it's just it's it's it is it's part of our story it's scenarios that we tell ourselves but you mentioned ideology and um that's that's another chapter in the book is abandon ideology um like the first thing i think of when i when i heard that was well wait a second am i wrong because sometimes i'll say well i believe in conservative ideology so how do you define ideology and how do you i guess differentiate that from just following a set of principles well that's a very good question well i think in ideology we talked about archetypes and so i think there are fundamental ways of construing the world and that a proper religious system offers all of them what let's look at freud for example just for a second now freud wasn't a religious figure but his ideas uh what would you say they were replacements for the same territory you know the the freudian psychoanalyst played the same role as the archetypal healer the priest all right so why was freud successful his theory why was it so powerful and i mean his influences waned but not really it's just become saturated in our culture to such degree that we take all of his insights for granted now and can only see where he made mistakes id well that's the natural world and for freud the id had a positive and a negative element right because it was the source of all your energy but it was the source of all your wild impulses and so that was nature and then there was the ego and that was you and well there was the positive part of you and the negative part and then there was the superego and that's basically the father in some symbolic sense and it had a positive and negative aspect very well balanced culture had a representation as positive and negative nature had a representation as positive and negative and so did the individual and that's that's typical of a well-developed religious system in my estimation ideologies take pieces of that and claim in some sense that they represent the whole and so you see this particularly it's particularly evident right now on the radical left where you know the rebellious activist is a hero fighting against the evil tyrant it's like well wait a minute what about the benevolent father for example and there's no appreciation for that at all and of course that's that's what the conservatives put forward in some sense is the archetype of the benevolent father i think that's probably accurate um is ideology then or the bad kind is it just a an unthinking adherence to an outcome like a preferred outcome or a preferred maybe mechanism might be the right word like it has to be done this way and like so for instance i i this is how i think about environment radical environmentalism versus what i would call rational environmentalism it has to be solar and wind renewables you can't solve climate change any other way i mean that seems to be yeah well part of it and i do address this in the chapter is that it's it radically oversimplifies incredibly complex issues and there is no environment that there's no problem with the environment that can be solved right all of those conceptualizations are far too low resolution so you have to decompose it and that's that's troublesome and it interferes with your feelings of omniscience you know you could ask someone for their opinion about the environment and they would give it to you and then if you asked them if they could run a nuclear power plant they would say no yet it's obvious that the sum total of our energy infrastructure is far more complex than one nuclear reactor and yet people are perfectly willing to offer proscriptions that cover the entire territory and so they want a map that's complete but it has no definition and so that's part of the attraction of ideological thinking it makes you think you know far more than you know it covers up your ignorance and your ignorance is terrifying and so then you have to decompose well because there's so much of it there's so much you don't know i mean think of what happens when you're driving down the road and your car quits i mean you don't understand your car for you it's this thing that gets you from point a to point b and as long as it's doing that your understanding is sufficient but as soon as it stops you're lost and the entire western industrial infrastructure is a lot more complex than your car but people are perfectly willing to put forward ideological solutions it covers up their ignorance so that's true you know i'm an admirer of bjorn lomberg he's an he's an intelligent environmentalist and he's done i worked for the un at one point briefly on a subcommittee that was looking at millennial goals and there were like 200 of them and i thought well these have to be rank ordered it's like you're not going to pursue 200 goals why aren't they rank ordered and part of the reason was well no one had the technical ability to do that and part of the reason was every goal had its constituency and if you rank ordered one over the other you would offend that constituency so you just had a mishmash of 200 goals well lomberg hired teams of economists to rank order them in terms of return on return on investment very intelligent very particular thinking you know and and now you might criticize his approach but i haven't seen one that makes more sense it's like here's the problems okay can we agree on the set of problems well roughly which ones could we address most efficiently and what would be the consequence of addressing them now you know that runs into the problems of economic prognostication which isn't trivial but if you don't have a better method that's a pretty good one i mean what he showed and lombard is a believer in climate change he thinks we'll hit the the the un uh climate committee's estimate for temperature increase over the next 100 years or so but when he did his team of economists analysis and then aggregated across them he found that investing in early childhood care for example around the world was far more effective in terms of ameliorating human misery than than money haphazardly spent on climate change the thing that bothers me about the climate change environmentalists is that i'm more afraid of their interventions than i have of the climate change well especially when you consider what the un's data says on this the unipcc will tell us that by 2100 the cost of climate change will be a reduction in in global gdp about four to five percent from what it otherwise would be now that's not a trivial amount however you also have to take into account that global gdp will double or triple in size by that time yes at least so it's not a trivial amount but it's but it's pretty close to being trivial um and it's pretty close to being extremely underwhelming this is another point jordan lombard makes all the time very underwhelming when compared to all sorts of other issues yeah well it's that it's the difficulty of considering all those others issues isn't it like you read lomberg and you think well wait a minute if you're part of the radical left why wouldn't you be radically in favor of providing cheap services to poor children around the world and then you conservative could say yeah and look at the return on investment it's like 200 to one something like that far outweighs anything else that well lomberg's team could to could come up with and so then you wonder well what what's driving this exactly and there's a kind of anti-humanism that's characteristic of of extreme environmentalism that's driven archetypally as well because the environment's environmentalist story is evil human being so that's the adversary at the individual level corrupt culture that's the negative father raping mother nature the benevolent feminine that's the archetypal structure so it's it's i just love how you you unpack those just to help people understand where this comes from because a lot of us who see this is crazy you know this this refusal to even acknowledge that there's costs and benefits with any policy discussion which is the proper way by the way to to approach any policy discussion an honest assessment of costs and benefits and trade-offs there are no solutions there are only trade-offs you know and it very very almost almost never can you find a a particular policy prescription that has only good things attached to it and no trade-offs what's yes and also no unintended outcomes which is another thing that conservatives stress it's like are you so sure that that intervention is going gonna do what you think it is it's like right there's a series of questions that we might ask you know does it infringe on local rights does it infringe on the rights of the individual um does it provide a disincentive to do a a good thing in society does it does it have unintended consequences is it fiscally responsible in the long term the reason i don't get along of a policy perspective with so many democrats is because they ask none of these questions they just ask is it compassionate this seems to be the only question compassion is a very interesting virtue because look if you're compassionate and your baby is crying and the baby is six months old the right thing to do is whatever is necessary to stop the baby from crying because the baby is right and you're wrong compassion isn't sufficient virtue that's partly why we have conscientiousness which is a more cold virtue it's like well it might be compassionate now but what makes you think even with infants the problem arises it's like well you don't want to treat your three-year-old like he or she is six months old right you want to start fostering their independence because you're looking at you're looking at more than immediate suffering you're looking at the stable structure of their existence across time and conscientiousness in some sense is better positioned to do that yeah this default to compassion is well it's it's a problem and we have a hard time and we have a hard time articulating the right answer to that in a way that doesn't make you sound like an uncaring uncompassionate person and it's like a tr i mean it's a rhetorical trick you know when somebody hits back at you if you disagree on a policy with but don't you don't you care about the the people who need help and and now the the technical answer is well yes i do but you have to do this a a b and c and by the time you're explaining you've already lost the argument because it's a it's an inherently emotional argument you might be right from a pragmatic point of view but you don't sound compassionate you don't want to spend the money on the new program you know and the program might be for the puppies and who doesn't love puppies right right and how could you be against that right you know and you might now you might be against it because you don't think the program will have a good bang for its buck or that it'll be or in the long run we'll continue to amass more funding and really not be as effective this is about you're already explaining and you've lost the argument so i don't even know i don't know if you would if you've encountered that yes it's unbelievably powerful it's a very very powerful problem this default to compassion it's it's a very big problem and going back to what you talked about before in ideology and how the great religions have have created a structure that is i i don't know what the right but that is very well done i suppose the perfect structure for to think about it's complete why is it so easy for still despite that just why is it so easy for so many in the modern society to just dismiss the truths of religion and attack it so so viciously well i think it's partly because we're not sure exactly what it is you know an atheist will say assume that the statement i believe in god is akin to i believe that a table is real and the evidence for god isn't the same as the evidence for a table and so you lose right off the bat in some sense if you're religious and you accept that level of argumentation but it's very complicated it's like well people ask me if i believe in god and i say well i act as if god exists and they don't like that answer but i thought through that answer a lot it's like well how do you judge someone's belief by what they say or by what they do and that just starts the philosophical argument it's another example of the fact that it's very difficult for us to rationally defend evolved institutions because they weren't exactly constructed on the basis of rational argument they they emerged across time like marriage emerged across time all these institutions it wasn't like a central planning committee sat down and thought them through precisely and so we don't have an articulated defense at hand i think the reason people don't like your on either side of the argument maybe don't like your answers because they want to get at the question of faith and they're trying to make you answer that right but they have a misconception about what constitutes faith like i can give you an example so you might say well faith means that you believe things that can't be empirically demonstrated or i could say well no wait a minute if i say i have faith in you that doesn't mean i believe you exist that's foolish i have faith in you because i think well i think there's a spark of the divine in you and that you might be willing to allow it to manifest itself across time i'm willing to take a risk on you in the belief that taking that risk would increase the probability that that manifestation would take place i have faith in my fellow man let's say and that's an act of courage and that's faith it's like well why look at how vicious and vindictive people are yeah so there's plenty of evidence for that but i've decided that i'm not going to consider that evidence crucial partly because i believe that if you meet someone with open arms let's say you radically increase the probability that the best in them will emerge that's faith so people are miss they have a misapprehension about what constitutes faith and i can understand that you know because like religious fundamentalists are said on edge by rational critique scientific critique and the scientists come at them hard you really think the world is 5 000 years old it's like they don't know what to say yes because the bible says that well not really one person who interpreted the bible made that case but there are many interpretations that don't depend on that particular viewpoint but that's beside the point it's like that isn't the right level of argumentation and it's so hard to get this right and so it devolves into something like a competition between theories and you know another question i'd have for you you've done so much work and so many lectures on the bible it's um they're quite incredible and especially with genesis i i love the way you unpack the garden of eden um but my question from that um i don't know what you mean by that well these stories sometimes if you see what they're driving at they hit you so hard that you can hardly stand it like the story of cain and abel i've never recovered from that story when i once i understood what it meant you know that if your sacrifice if your sacrifices are not accepted by god that you'll become so resentful that it'll drive you to murder and genocide it's like you packed all that into one paragraph and it is tiny paragraph and and that isn't all that it contains you know and those are the first two people in history hypothetically because adam and eve well right they weren't born they were created and so that's the central diagnostic of mankind according to the old testament jesus if that doesn't make your blood run cold you didn't understand it it's terrifying and i guess what strikes me and i think what strikes you about these biblical stories is that there's a lot of truth packed into them fundamental truth absolute truths now a christian would say this truth is derived from revelation it was revealed to us um somebody like an atheist sam harris would say no they just wrote down what we'd been figuring out via evolution so how do you answer that question well i think the revealed idea it's part of it eh it's part of it because when you think there's a revelatory aspect to your thought which we'd never really take into account so imagine you're thinking of something and an answer pops into your head you think i thought that up it's like really isn't it more like the thought appeared in the field of your consciousness and where did it come from well who knows where it come came from because we don't know anything about consciousness so there's a revelatory element to thought but then there's a critical element too and even in the bible it says you have to test the spirits to see if they're of god and so revelation is part of it but you know the bible was aggregated out of a much larger collection of books over a very long period of time so there was an element of critical analysis too which is central say to to jewish culture certainly that critical element trying to understand what the revelation means and elaborating on it and so it's not that it was just delivered in its impeccable form and there was no discussion about what was what would you say the highest revelation and what was lesser there was plenty of discussion about that and i mean i would say you know what and i think biologically i do believe that the universe is 15 billion years old and that we've had this incredibly lengthy developmental history and i believe that's accepted by mainstream catholics it's certainly accepted by the vatican what that means for the place of human beings in in the cosmos is very difficult to determine but i see it at least in part as the unfolding of consciousness across time and and it's a and and and i i love that answer because the way i answer that is what's the difference in shorthand i would just say what's the difference between revealing it and coming to it you know i i think it's the same thing because if you believe in the divine then how you thought about it and how you came to it is it self-revelation it doesn't have to necessarily you might build a story about about god literally talking to you but what's the difference between that and your own thoughts if you truly believe in god well that's a good question that's a good question what the difference is you know i guess one of the things you'd say is well because you're steeped in sin it isn't necessarily the case that you can always trust your own thoughts as divine revelations right and so and so they have to undergo that critical analysis but but but but perhaps the the thoughts that that stand the test of time and that are shared across and gone through the critical analysis that that the books in the bible did perhaps that's how we come to that well i think historically that's the case i mean what i try to analyze religious thinking the same way that suggest policy should be made simplest explanation first most local explanation first well so when i look at christianity for example i would say at minimum christianity is the consequence of a millennia long discussion more than one millennia many many thousands of years discussion about what constitutes the ideal towards which we should all strive and imagine that that striving towards that ideal is what unites us so it's it's not belief exactly except insofar as belief is expressed in action so say well if you're a real christian you're striving to make that ideal manifest within you does that mean you believe in it well depends on what you mean by belief but i tend to take an existential uh perspective on belief and say well i'm going to assume that what you act out is what you believe so you're trying to make that ideal manifest within you and within your community well that's an indication of your faith because you've staked your life on that that's faith is what you stake your life on it's not what what fact you say you believe that's and i know that it's a sophisticated distinction but it's a crucial distinction it's very important it allows religious people to defend their belief and it doesn't fall under the category of scientific discussion anymore it's no i stake my life on this that's what the belief is that's right and you know i see that's a great idea to someone this element of logos right that's the divine word well that's the idea that underlies the the sacredness of free speech is the divine word redeems the world well that's what you believe if you believe in free speech and that's belief and moving on and i do love that i think it's a great way for people to think about the attacks on their on their faith is to think about well i do have faith that the moral structure that god and the bible have built for me is absolutely the right one if i'm going to take aim at the highest possible there you go that's yes exactly and so how do you argue with that i mean you can't you can't bring up a fact-based argument against that it's like no i've committed to this that's what faith means is i've committed to this and so one um you know related to to it's related to religion but but i love the the last chapter in your book um be grateful in spite of your suffering is something i've written about a lot this idea of perspective and also this this this notion that you bring up quite a bit which is self-imposed hardship or you know otherwise known as challenging yourself is unbelievably important to moral and you know physical well-being and so i mean talk us through that how and and and also how have we gotten to a point again in modern society which did it i do think this is different than 30 40 years ago where there's this belief that all suffering must be an injustice any kind of hardship or challenge must be an injustice that must be dealt away with and that's easy for politicians especially to demagogue and say my primary promise to you is that all your suffering will end and this is where it gets a little biblical this idea of being a savior that government can do this for you and i think it's rather dangerous well i think it it relates back to this idea of an ideal you know it is a person what he or she is or is the person most properly understood as what they could become and i think we understand ourselves essentially in terms of what we believe we could become our conscience upgrades us for failure to move in that direction and so one of the things you do if you challenge yourself is you attempt to transform yourself through tempering into that which you could be and we're always becoming we're not static entities and we always exist in relationship to this ideal and so the religious pursuit is an attempt to specify the ideal and also to specify it communally and then we could say well you impose challenges to yourself to facilitate your transformation toward the ideal and the people everyone understands that well of course you do that and you ever meet someone who isn't operated by their conscience for not being more than they are i don't think such a person exists you know maybe the hypothetical psychopath you know i yeah so and the gratitude i would say that's also insofar as it can be manifested that's also a decision because you could say the anti-natalist the people who think consciousness is so unbearable that it should just be eradicated they think well the world is so corrupt and so rife with suffering that it would be better if it didn't exist at all and you can make a perfectly logical case for that dostoevsky did it all the time in his novels so well you can take the opposite tack and live out that and that's a decision to be grateful is something to strive for it's something to attempt to manifest like to be truthful and it is in spite of your suffering because the suffering can be absolutely overwhelming it can be over unbearable so what do you do in the face of that resentment isn't a good answer but although it's it's certainly understandable you know what they guys say a lot in um in certain talks that i give if the subject matters is correctly associated it's look there's there's something that's absolutely true whatever you're going through right now you've probably been through something worse so you can handle this now if this is indeed the hardest thing that you've ever gone through it well might be i can promise you this somebody else has gone through it and they've dealt with it a lot better than you're dealing with it now and that gives you some some perspective and it it's it's it's also you know it's a bit of a tough love thing it's something that's um noted to us in the seal teams all the time when they say you know ten thousand guys have gone through this before you so what the hell are you complaining about it's a bit of that tough love for sure yeah well there's an ideal lurking in there too yeah and so it's it's an important essence of perspective just telling people that hard truth like you you've you you might have been through something harder others have certainly been through something harder um the complaints of the modern world are are they they can't even compare to even 50 100 years ago i mean it's unbelievable what what our ancestors not too far from now uh dealt with and yes and you can say there's that really gets that's greater than you think that you could call on and the evidence is that other people have gone through this and that isn't so much again pointing to a lack in you necessarily as it is um something that's hopeful but you can't yes exactly exactly and you say you know there's a psychologist carl rogers and he thought you should have unconditional positive regard for your clients and i don't believe that's true you should have unconditional positive regard for the parts of your clients that are trying to get better now that doesn't mean you criticize and and deal harshly with the other elements that's not the point the point is when you're dealing with someone are you dealing with who they are are you trying to foster who they could be and which is the better attitude and it's certainly the case with young people and perhaps with all of us that we like to interact with people who are calling out the best in us there's nothing we like better than that you know we might turn away from it because we're resentful and angry but fundamentally all of the interactions when you look at the ten commandments um honor thy mother and father do you think that's a deeper representation of gratitude yes that for sure that is because it's not as though there is any shortage of stories in the bible about fathers and mothers going wrong right right right you might want nobody else right so it's more like it's more like a decision well why do you want your mother well what happens to societies that don't worship the virgin and child the mother eternal mother and child well if they don't have any children and they disappear and what happens to societies that don't revere the father well they they break apart and become chaotic and disintegrate and so so those are moral obligations and they're not exactly dependent on the specific conditions of your life now you might say well one way to honor your father is to rebel when necessary and i believe that's true because it's the fundamental spirit that you're trying to affiliate yourself with right and so you may have a moral obligation not to follow an unjust law for example something like that but that should still be motivated by the spirit of reverence for your father and when i approached genesis that's what i tried to do i thought well this book is great mystery let's approach it as if it has something to offer since it's stuck around for several thousands of years and and and i wonder if it actually kind of came up with this question as we were talking about it i wonder if it's even deeper representation for honoring honoring the truth of institutions yeah so i think that's the same thing like look we have this idea right now that's being touted that the central animating spirit of human culture is the arbitrary expression of power it's not it's something more like god it's something more like that that central spirit now it's god insofar as he's only able to be partially manifest through you know fragile and shattered people but i don't think it's appropriate to view the entire entirety of our history as the expression of arbitrary power and exploitation it's so cynical and this is people often comment on the hypothetical attractiveness of my ideas to young and white men angry young white men they love to get you on that and honestly when you talk about this can you also answer why is it that you're attacked so much more than even i'm attacked does it make sense i i don't know is it because it's because you're more of a threat in some ways i think well you know i don't think i am a particularly i don't know i i thought about it i think it's because i sort of stand for science and the enlightenment and i also sort of stand for religious tradition at the same time and so i'm not an evil patriarchal tyrant and that's annoying because i'm supposed to be and and i'm not so it's something like that i mean i can't figure it out it just it drives me to distraction it seriously because it's such a mystery um but these angry young white men that hypothetically i'm appealing to well why do they need someone to appeal to them well because the claim that our culture is an arbitrary expression of power and let's say of white supremacist power is a direct attack on their ambition it's like well let's say you're a young man who wants to make his mark in the world well you're just a tyrant in training well that's christ that's a terrible thing to tell young people that's a you couldn't tell them anything worse than that and you tell them they're noble they're striving for something good if they could see it and that they're fundamentally to be trusted even though they're prone to error and sin that's that's the right answer not you're a tyrant in training and you know you should check your privilege and and shut the hell up and be embarrassed about who you are and could be god it's so awful i mean the entire movement of uh again against masculinity and this sort of elevation of toxic masculinity um as as a talking point is deeply concerning and it's just so naive you know it's it's malevolent in the way that you frame it as well but it's also naive and the reason i feel that way is because i come from the seal teams yeah where that kind of masculinity is is necessary for the defense of the country it's also it's necessary for survival in a very profound way well look i talked to joker willing about his experiences with the navy seal teams it's like he said that one of the things that you guys are taught all the time is to have your partners back yeah well so there's a recep there's a reciprocity in there there's that's not the mere arbitrary expression of power i know it occurs in the military context but then the question might be well what makes for an efficient military structure and brute tyranny is not the answer because no it doesn't work that's the thing it doesn't work in the special operations okay you can control because there's not because you must have respect that that's that's the fundamentally respect and reset respect is gained well through a whole variety of functions and leadership traits sometimes it's good judgment sometimes it's good management we can respect the fact that this person has good management makes decisions that are that are tactful that are what we would do if we were in their place or if they were not what we would do at least they provide a a serious explanation as to why these are all these are all leadership traits yeah well it's better to inspire them to compel right so that's a leadership philosophy better to inspire than to compel and how do you inspire people while you inspire them by appealing to their better natures collectively and and and getting them to do things that they otherwise wouldn't do not because they're forced to but because they believe in that higher goal and that higher mission you know it's it's like for instance i i'd have a hard time contracting a lot of people go out leave special operations and then then they go contract um because you make good money i i would personally have a hard time putting my life on the line for that now i might be able to do it it sort of depends on what the contract is maybe it is serving some sort of of higher goal but it's hard to get it out of my head that i'm just that i'd be doing it for money and therefore it's very hard for me to run into a hail of gunfire um and i know i suppose the only reason anybody would do that is because they're saving somebody on their side anyway certainly wouldn't do it just out of out of the blue um yeah well that naivety is you know that's a very interesting it's it's an it's a naive description of fundamental malevolence it's not nuanced and it also it doesn't take into account what actually structures functional social organizations it's not tyranny and the conservatives need to do a much better job of articulating that and understanding it because the the assault is very poignant and it has a romanticism about it that's very difficult to counter so yeah it's extremely difficult and and what makes it more difficult is i might be able to help i might be able to articulate that effectively in a long-form debate but we generally don't have long-form debates we have five words or less and it's very easy for somebody to say you're not a good person you're not a compassionate person because x it's very difficult to explain the proper the proper social hierarchies and and why they manifest the way they do and that compassion is not the only virtue and that sometimes it's even a vice i mean the psychoanalysts they said freud i think this was freud's statement the good mother necessarily fails why well because compassion is devouring if it's taken to its extreme because it infantilizes and i think i think the best example of this is covet 19. all of the great political philosophy debates i think manifested in the last year with with kovid and one of them was this immediate this immediate belief that one death is too many but of course that's not even how we think about all other forms of risk not at all and what and the way i began responding to that would be look if if eliminating any and all infections was the only possible goal then sure you would lock everybody up in their homes and not let them out until the disease had completely been eradicated or or they were forcibly vaccinated or something along those lines but of course that's never your only goal again policy making is trade-offs and and i think that the greatest problem with the last year and the reason why i think public health officials have lost an enormous amount of trust is because they they treated us like we were so foolish like so stupid that we couldn't understand trade-offs that we couldn't understand risk assessments and or even the ability to take on personal risk at a church like you do when you drive the way that you see fit mm-hmm and everything and now driving is spectacularly dangerous and yet we still allow everyone to do it weirdly enough yeah even right well because they have to learn you know and the issue with covid isn't what we did with this epidemic it's what we're going to do with the next one because we've established this weird precedent and so now the question is well at what level is a disease sufficiently serious to warrant the abdication of all civil liberty and no one knows the answer to that that's a terrifying one and uh and i think because the public health establishment has lost so much trust on this because i think more and more people are coming to the conclusion that this particular disease did not warrant maximum lockdowns and the data now that we have suggests suggests extremely strongly that it didn't even have a positive effect on limiting the spread so why on earth would we do it again and yet we're not having an honest conversation about that but what's worse is what if we have a disease where you actually probably should lock people down because it's actually quite a bit more deadly than kovit was nobody's going to trust you anymore because there was too many lies told that that's a real problem when it comes to dealing with future pandemics and i hope the conversation becomes more honest maybe um i'm going to go a little off script here for the last couple of minutes because i want to ask you something when i was um i recently had a detached retina and um i was face down for a whole week um which is actually not as bad as the first surgery i had and when i was blown up in 2012 when i was had to be face down uh for six weeks but that's not the important part the important part was that i'd not only did my retina detach but i detached from all politics it was quite nice and i i read a lot of books about our government's history on paranormal psychology or parapsychology uh remote viewing programs all of these things that are rather interesting even interviewed a couple on this po a couple guys on this podcast an old army officer that is apparently a remote viewer i i've asked him to do an experiment with me so we can prove this um and uh another psychologist who's written a couple books on this who worked at the stanford research institute and and conducted a lot of these experiments and there's some really hard to understand evidence on this i'm just wondering if you've ever gone down this rabbit hole not not to any real degree i mean i protect myself against that i suppose to some degree by saying that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence and i've looked at some of the data pertaining to paranormal psychology in the standard psychological literature and haven't found it particularly compelling i mean i would ally that with a belief that things are a lot stranger than we think they are and there's so much we don't understand that it's beyond comprehension so but you know i generally limit myself to what's conventionally acceptable in those domains i think it's maybe because i take risks in other places yeah so so that's all right i've worked the reason i looked into it is because there's actual government funding that actually yes no i'm aware of that in the united states which is just fascinating it's fascinating that that the argument could be made in a manner that was sufficiently convincing but that was also pretty much at the height of the cold war if i remember correctly it was that's why it started ended in the mid 90s and i'm trying to figure out if there was anything to it because it's it's a rather fascinating discussion i had a feeling you wouldn't you wouldn't bite on that one but look um you've been extremely generous uh with your time it's um it's a great book another fantastic book and really appreciate you writing it i think um i think the world needs jordan peterson and um it was we were all very worried when um you know you were having your your health issues and we're glad to see you back oh thank you it was a privilege to be talking to you and i wish you the best of luck in your messaging and your legislative attempts and everything that you're doing politically it's it isn't a job i would want the job that you have it's it's a very demanding job and it comes with more than its fair share of trouble and criticism and i don't think that people who occupy political office are given the credit they deserve for what's often a thankful difficult task so it's i appreciate that it certainly feels that way that's for sure but there's a lot of good people to say a lot of nice things and um they they keep you going they keep you going it certainly can be thankless but um this is this has been a true pleasure of mine jordan thank you my pleasure i hope if i get to washington again that we can meet again

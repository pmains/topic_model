chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona dr. Gosar thank you very much administrator McCarthy in August 2011 President Obama acknowledged in a letter to Speaker Boehner that seven new proposed regulations would each cost the economy at least a billion dollars annually in fact out of those seven four of those regulations were put forth by the EPA I repeat for how many new regulations has the EPA proposed proposed this year that will cost the economy at least a billion dollars annually I don't have that figure sir can you provide those names and those numbers and estimates to the quality now as you know Congress has repeatedly rejected previous cap-and-tax energy plans proposed by the president and as big government allies knowing he can lawfully enact a carbon tax plan he can't he's instructed you to circumvent Congress and oppose these new regulations by Fiat do you believe the AP the EPA should follow the intent of Congress when implementing new regulations I believe that EPA is actually following the law that that Congress enacted in a way that we are supposed to implement and I think that's been been confirmed by the Supreme Court every time it's been asked of them relative to carbon pollution 83% and so remember that carefully here and I'm glad you bring that up so will you return the new waters of the u.s. proposed rule to your agency in order to address the legal scientific and economic deficiencies of that proposal I'm sorry was there I didn't go so in citing the Supreme Court again and I want to just give you a little background the Supreme Court has issued for decisions that reinforce the limits of the EPA's jurisdiction and waters of the US yep yet you seem to have another effect that you want to violate this with this current set of rules so I'm asking you so will you return the new waters of the u.s. proposed rules to your agencies to address the legal the scientific and economic deficiencies of your proposal well it is an is out for public comment now sir and it was specifically put out in order to address the concerns raised by the Supreme Court in terms of the joints again clean water it's identified legally with economic deficiencies and scientific deficiencies yes it has thirst for sight there's four Supreme Court rulings you just acknowledged the gentleman from Virginia that the Supreme Court had the rule and there are four jurisdictions from the Supreme Court that limit the EPA and his jurisdiction of the waters of the US will you return it to your to your agency I'm happy to have more discussions about this sir but the reason we put out the waters of the US was exactly to address the issues that the Supreme Court has put squealing I don't I think I don't think that's true okay so and furthermore David Sundlun the founding director of the Berkeley Water Center and professional professor in the College of Natural Resources of the the University of California Berkeley found major flaws in your agency's economic analysis of waters of the u.s. proposed rule and claimed the area errors in the study are so extensive as to render it unusable for determining the true cost of the proposed rule once again does your agency have any plans to correct this flawed economic analysis when you put stuff out you have to you have to cede proper information to the public and you are not we certainly we are in a comment period we'll we'll take a look at what what might that criticism and and whether or not it is substantive and how we would address it we have recently extended the comment period 90 days exactly because we know that this concerns raised about the proposal and we want to provide clear public opportunity to comment on this so we can understand doing that but you have to provide the public proper information and this is completely flawed now I got limited time okay your greenhouse gas rule proposed to threaten the close of the Navajo Generating Station and kill a thousand jobs in Page Arizona approximately 80% of those positions are good-paying jobs for Native Americans in a very rural area besides being a critical employer of the Navajo Generating Station provides the power that delivers more than 500 billion gallons a Colorado River water to more than 80% of Arizona's population do you believe yes or no that the Navajo Generating Station should be closed I have no such belief no okay do you share my belief that this power plant is a special situation due to the tribal Indian congressional dialog trust obligations that were constituted by Congress in directing the constant of the construction the direction the obligations water settlements labor law directives associated with that plant my understanding of that plant is is one of the most complicated situations we've ever had to deal with so it's fairly unique yes it's a very because of where it sits on tribal land and all over sight so it deserves a special attention instead of what it's been getting late actually so we've been giving it special attention because the the proposal that we put out on our clean power plan actually didn't speak to the Navajo Generating Station we actually left that the tribal units so that we could do a more extensive and understand that which is known in the compact in in the trust obligations the jurisdiction over the tribes and those contracts is this body here Congress have you directed those conversations with Congress as well actually I don't I don't know what conversations you're referring to EPA definitely has been given the obligation to regulate pollution from that facility if we feel like it's necessary for Public Health we have actually worked through a lot of tough issues with Navajo Generating Station working with the Navajos working with the other tribes that have an interest the Navajo the Hopi and the Gila River we've actually worked very closely with the state Salt River Project I understand how complicated this issue is we've worked through some pretty big challenges in creative ways and I'm sure we can work through this when the time comes but we have not yet proposed any regulation I would caution the lady that there's also another jurisdictional aptitude and this is this body this body of Congress that oversees the trust obligations of the tribal entities and that is not occurred so fYI include us I yield back the balance of my time

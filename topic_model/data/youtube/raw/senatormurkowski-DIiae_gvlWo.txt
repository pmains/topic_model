so we just wrapped up the State of the Union Address delivered by President Biden it was a it was a message of optimism from the president he spoke about bipartisan accomplishments and and there certainly have been significant bipartisan accomplishments um I have been part of them certainly the infrastructure bill that we passed into law uh last year which was very very significant for the state of Alaska delivering great benefits and it's something that I'm proud of and I think that the President should be proud of as well there were other measures The Pact act which is going to help our veterans that have been exposed to toxic chemicals so there was good work but I think I think In fairness that the president struck a note of optimism that alaskans are certainly not not feeling I'm hearing from alaskans that are concerned about the the continued price of inflation what they're paying for for fuel what they're what they're paying in the grocery store the fact they cannot get eggs they the reality is is that it is still a very very tough economy we're worried about a recession in the state of Alaska so this this optimism this Rosy Glow that all is fine I when we talk about the State of the Union the State of the Union the president is right is good because of the soul of the American people but it's not good right now in the sense of a healthy economy we've got a ways to go the president spoke about different measures that that he is going to push by by in America I am all over by an America but boy you couldn't you couldn't point to a better a better place to do that when you're talking about resources in our ground with American workers our jobs our resources our benefit we've got a project that is ready made the willow project in the National Petroleum Reserve Alaska Mr President do the right thing and approve that project so that gets alaskans to work it helps our native people who live in that region it helps our state it helps our country and it helps our allies that's that's made in America that's by America so there's some things that we can work on I'm all about bipartisanship it goes both ways we can make this happen but it has to be more than just words it has to be that full-on action so we've got a new Congress ahead of us I'm looking forward to a lot of good work we're we're going to do it together because that's how you benefit alaskans but it has to be it has to be going both ways so

Thank You chairman Lewis for convening this hearing and I want to thank the witnesses for being here today for sharing your stories those of you have suffered loss our sympathy to you and your families your experience your loved ones are ones we will never forget and I appreciate you being here this hearing is an important hearing about how the tax code subsidizes hate I think if there's a lesson I want to take away from it is that hate can have no safe harbor in the United States and the next thing we have to say is that hate and hate groups can find no comfort within the United States tax code that is not a matter of speech I think that is a matter of principle and that the tax-exempt status is a privilege we extend organizations that are working to benefit the public good we've highlighted today several organizations that are using their nonprofit status not for good but to spread hate and it's important that we hold these groups to account but there's also a second group that is abusing or are abusing their tax-exempt status to enrich their leadership in deterrence individuals through self dealing or misappropriation in that vein I turn to you to you mr. Owens and have some questions leaning particularly on your perspective as a former director of the IRS exempt organizations division recently as you may be aware there been a number of revelations about questionable financial dealings by the leadership of the National Rifle Association the NRA NRA is a non-profit tax-exempt organization an example of there's reports are indications that the NRA has been using funds to pay for more than half a million dollars in high-end Italian suits and lavish international travel for their CEO and executive vice president Wayne LaPierre it appears the spending was primarily routed through the NRA as longtime public relations firm Ackerman McQueen my question is does the fact pattern of more than a half a million five hundred thousand dollars spent on high-end clothing and travel does that raise questions to you about what's happening with the NRA and their tax-exempt status lutely it appears to be the sort of diversion that I actually testified before this committee about 30 years ago regarding and that is the use of non profits assets its income for the benefit of the people in charge and Congress enacted section 49 58 after those hearings which provides an excise tax and applied it to both Section 501 C 4 organizations and Section 501 C 3 organization thank you and it's it's not just Italian suits and travel there was reporting indicating that the NRA was involved in plans to purchase mr. Lapierre and his wife a home intact in Texas and by home I mean a six and a half million dollar mansion again there was money routed through Ackerman McQueen NRA issued a seventy thousand dollar check to a newly formed LLC tell facilitate this purpose Thank You mr. Owen is it normal and customary for a non-profit to buy or even consider buying a mansion for its leadership that is unusual but not unprecedented okay in your mind you think this would qualify as an abuse of an organization's subsidized nonprofit status residents of that size and that cost is an extraordinary benefit and calls into question whether his total compensation is excessive under the conditions imposed by Congress in Section 4958 of the code I mean is the concern not just protecting American taxpayers who are subsidizing these types of organizations but the donors to these organizations who are submitting their dues or contributions whatever it may be to further the mission of the organization not to buy a mansion for the home of an executive that's right and it may come as a surprise to the members of the organization who pay the dues so I'm staying in this is vain with respect to the fancy clothes and extravagant trout travel and the purchase of a lovely home these were all paid for through a vendor in this case through the PRF ackerman McQueen as opposed to the organization should what may appear as a laundering of these expenses to an outside vendor should that raise questions by the IRS yes the the standards that I've referenced the standard of an excess benefit transaction applies the indirect transactions that is transactions enrichment that has run through a separate organization and then cycles back to the individual in place of control that's not an uncommon way that divergent happens great well thank you I'm out of time but I will make clear for the record for the record I have asked Ackerman McQueen for documents related to these activities that could expose the violations with respect to the IRA I believe this is just the tip of the iceberg based on the reporting and these information will be very important I'm hopeful that we can get that information from Ackerman McQueen the NRA is blocking that but I look forward to getting that information at a later day

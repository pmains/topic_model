thank you very much mr. chairman and mr. chairman first let me thank you for your thoughtfulness and making it possible for me to come today and I very much look forward to working with you and senator Klobuchar and I have discussed these issues as well over the years mr. chairman you've got a busy schedule so I'm just gonna try and make a few key points and perhaps you could just put my full statement into the record according to the latest numbers at least 44 million Americans and perhaps millions more have no choice but to use insecure voting machines that make hackers and hostile foreign governments salivate it is in my view inexcusable that our democracy depends on such hackable voter technology made by a handful of companies that have been able to evade oversight and in fact have actually been stonewalling the Congress for years the efforts by Russia obviously during the 2016 election highlight the vulnerability of our election infrastructure and the serious threats that our people face as you and I talked with chairman I recently introduced a new cybersecurity bill to focus on the reliability and accuracy of federal elections and it seems to me enormous ly important given the prospects that these foreign hackers can get access can hack the voting machines used by the states my legislation focuses on two common-sense measures that are backed by the overwhelming number of cyber security experts in our country paper ballots and risk limiting audits and I wrote this bill in spite of this campaign of ducking and bobbing and weaving really stonewalling from the major voting machine companies over the past year you and I have touched on this as a member of the Intelligence Committee I reached out to cyber security experts election officials and others and I wrote big voting machine companies asking them basic questions about their cybersecurity these were not complicated questions they were have you been hacked do you employ in-house cyber experts really the basic sort of cyber hygiene 101 the companies refused to answer how or even if they are protecting their systems and the votes of the American people earlier this year the New York Times published a story revealing that es and s the largest voting machine manufacturer with selling devices that came pre-installed with modems and remote monitoring software the experts say remote access to election infrastructure is now a five-alarm crisis when it comes to security my view is you can only make it worse if you were to leave unguarded ballot boxes in Moscow and Beijing so I kept writing to the company following up with the same common sense questions they ignored those as well it is clear to me mr. chairman these companies want to be gatekeepers of our democracy but they seem completely uninterested in safe Guardian five states exclusively use voting machines that do not produce a paper trail the only record of the votes cast is a digital record which could be hacked and which is impossible to audit reliably that strikes me as a prescription for disaster Americans need paper ballots marked by hand until that system is adopted every election that goes by is yet another election that foreign governments hostile foreign governments including Russia can hack earlier this year the Congress appropriated 380 million dollars to help States upgrade their election technology the money is now in the hands of the election assistance Commission on the way to the States it ought to be used to bolster security unfortunately it's not clear at all how the election assistant commission is actually using the money to do this and like my concern is you and I have talked about mr. chairman as the states could go out and buy a whole lot more hackable technology from these stonewalling voting machine companies let me just wrap up by saying before we conclude the statements of the commissioner who's number two at the Commission Commissioner McCormick also concerned me greatly she stated publicly last year that she disagrees with the intelligence community that Russia sought to influence the 2016 election miss chairman you and I have heard again and again that it is the view and sir Langford has heard this as well it is the overwhelming view of the intelligence community that Russia sought to influence the 2016 election so I can't for the life of me figure out why the number two official the election assistance Commission is dismissing the analysis of the government's the administration's intelligence experts you can set aside the outcome of the 2016 election no matter who you pulled the lever for the last time around all of us here in the Senate have to care about defending our elections from foreign hackers going forward again mr. Chairman I want to thank you for your courtesy in the time you and I have spent talking about this and I look forward to working with you in the days ahead

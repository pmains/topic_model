mr. McKinley is different in rural areas there's different challenges welcome to do that I live on a dirt road but Google Maps send you up a place that is like a horse trail now you know you're a tough guy from West Virginia so you probably make it but somebody like Leonard Lance driving his fancy car would have a hard time Earl Darwin a lawyer there are real real challenges in rural America it's everything from the mapping system in in whether the car is going to be able to navigate some of the roads in rural America but also its it it just it just has a lot of different challenges so I appreciate your Amendment and I know we'll be working on this later but thank you very much

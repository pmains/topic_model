thank you all very much and uh senator thank you for the kind welcome mr president thank you for allowing us to be here i had a chance to go join the house a little while ago and and and speak with them and meet with them for a little while and and great that you all allow a lowly lowly house member over to the house of lords i appreciate y'all allowing us to be here jerome zerang was telling me when yells crawfish bowls you have other people peel them for you that's that's impressive house members i hear uh now look seriously um thanks for for what you do i know most of you do it for the money but um but but but louisiana's something to fight for it's worth fighting for we have an amazing state with amazing people and amazing resources and we're seeing right now what's happening in the state of louisiana where population we're brain drained relative to the rest of the nation we're going down where economic activity despite all the strategic advantages we have it's going down and y'all right now are making investments in key infrastructure that is the issues that are holding us back including important infrastructure priorities like a new bridge in lake charles a new bridge in baton rouge and i think you all funded at least the fishing pier portion of it we appreciate that uh getting i-49 which mr president i know a critical priority for you i-49 completed from lafayette to new orleans in the upper section shreveport into arkansas we've got to address these infrastructure vulnerabilities but it's not just the roads and bridges it's our ports it's our flood protection and restoring our coast we've announced over eight billion dollars in new infrastructure investments in south louisiana three billion dollars in new project approvals just last week and 400 million dollars in flood protection and hurricane protection and coastal restoration projects just today but the great thing is is that what you're doing it complements really well with what we're doing to address cost shares to align priorities and look here's the thing moving forward just like y'all are working on this session the opportunities and best playing the great strategic advantages of the cards that we have in louisiana it the only way this is going to work is if we are lined at the at the local level that we're aligned at the state level and we're aligned in the congressional delegation and so i want to thank you all for for your efforts in addressing some of these priorities for addressing some of these opportunities and impediments of louisiana's future in success let me say it again louisiana is a great state with great people great resources and it's worth fighting for because this trajectory that we're on right now watching this brain drain our best asset are young people leaving it's unsustainable for our state we need to give them the same great opportunities that we've all had in the great state of louisiana so thank you all and god bless

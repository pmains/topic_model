joining us right now to discuss this topic is democratic congressman Raul Ruiz of California he's a former emergency room doctor good to see you again representative flash soccer it's nice to be here yeah so you were just appointed to the house energy and commerce committee where you'll be dealing with health care policy what's your thought here what if you can do at this point to stop the repeal or changes of Obamacare that have been discussed so far that you disagree with one is vote against every measure that they do that will produce uninsured people and raise health care costs for everyday Americans to is to let the constituents and the American people know how their plan is no new plan just old ideas that have failed in the in the past and that will actually harm them or their family or a friend that they know who may have pre-existing condition who are women and who are young who are rely on their parents health insurance and who are senior in other words who may need nursing home care or have saved two or three thousand dollars a year on pharmaceuticals due to closing of the Medicare dome mental so there are real consequences to real people out there you have offered in your conversations some if you will helpful criticism to aca Obamacare and one of the ideas that you've discussed is how to help small businesses describe that yeah so you know when I think what we need to do is improve the Affordable Care I not refill the good stuff in it so one of the things that we can do is to provide an exemption for small businesses who are on the verge of bankruptcy or who have proven characteristics of economic hardship so they don't have to pay the business so but what we really have to do overall Richard and this is very important because if we repeal the Affordable Care Act premiums and health care costs will skyrocket they are already out of control they diminish in their rate of rise but if we repeal those measures they will skyrocket so we need to address the root of the problem and that's overall health care costs so that American people don't pay exorbitant amount of money out of the pocket for their premium we need to protect Medicare or our seniors are going to pay a lot more out of pocket with about your system we're going to be able to reduce costs by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies and also we need to make sure that people have transparency in what healthcare costs really are when they go for a routine procedure for example a colonoscopy right you can tell whether one Hospital is charging five times more than another hospital in your same neighborhood and then you can make better choices representative you were very aware of the vote that happened on Friday the beginning if you love the process of the idea of repealing Obamacare ACA here and it was voted down by one specific Republican Charlie dent who we spoke with yesterday and he said it's fine that we consider this idea of repealing ACA but we have to have a replacement first and he went through some of the ways that he thought you can move forward keep certain parts as you're stating fix certain parts and repeal other parts are you working with any of your colleagues across the aisle like Charlie net yeah you know I send my hand to work with any Republican who wants to have common sense resolutions and ideas that will put people above partisanship and solutions above ideology in order to get more people in health care and get them to see their doctors live a better life but oftentimes it is very difficult to do because with somebody across at all who was that conversation go oh I have spoken when some of the some Republicans especially the physician to talk about what can we do and here's a common point that we need to address one of the things that we can work together is to the increase the amount of providers that we have in our country what people don't realize is that we are very severely short on the amount of physicians per population and I know that by my own life experience I grew up in coachella my parents are farmworkers I lived in the trailer park growing up so this day it is very medically underserved right here in my district there is one physician nine thousand residents in certain parts of my district there that statistic is staggering given that the recommended number is one to two thousand so we need to do what I've done here in my district which is create pipeline programs for underserved community use who want to serve in underserved communities we have to expand medical schools and seats and create residency programs in those communities so that fits young people who want to be doctors can can get educated and trained in those underserved community and be like you that great story becoming a doctor congressman dr.

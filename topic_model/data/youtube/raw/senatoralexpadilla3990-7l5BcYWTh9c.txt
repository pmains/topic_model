thank you madam chair appreciate the flexibility senator capito one of those days you're all familiar with smack between homeland security and budget so with my limited time appreciate the opportunity to raise a couple of issues and priorities and ask some questions uh and i'll begin by uh uh sharing with you mr secretary my background and the reason for my interest on your digitization comments you know at my home state of california we've long believed in the importance and necessity of recording and remembering our shared history for students of california history and for those and maybe news for those who aren't aware in 1850 the very first law signed by the very first governor of california established the the requirement of the maintenance of the public archives very first law by the very first legislature and governor that tells you what a priority is today the california state archives is a division of the california secretary of state's office the position i had the honor of holding for six years prior to joining the senate and one of my priorities at the time was to make sure that yes the historical treasures of california as required were not just preserved not just protected but as available as possible for the general public to view and to enjoy and part of my strategy was to increase digitization efforts of the state's archives collections uh curating exhibits etc so that they could be accessed by any person with an internet connection not just anywhere in the state but frankly anywhere around the world and we did this through strategic utilization of state resources as well as engaging in public-private partnerships so i know the mission of public access of our shared history is something that the smithsonian shares but the incredible knowledge and history held within the museums is for the most part still limited to only those who are able to come and visit in person you've spoken to digitization through your opening remarks and i'd like to just expand for a minute on what other short-term and long-term goals there might be or plans there might be to share our content with a broader audience well i think you thank you very much um you know when i actually did honest work as a historian now i shake hands i was a california scholar so i know a lot about what california has done in its archives and for me what's important is to realize that the treasures of the smithsonian are too important just to be in the hands of those that can come visit so we've really made a major concerted effort first through the educational work that we've done to make sure that people have access to the collections through the smithsonian learning lab you can go into that and you can go type oh california or type women's suffrage or butterflies and get everything the smithsonian has we've also made sure that by the work that we've done with both the latino museum and with the smithsonian women's history initiative what we've done is made sure that those stories are being told so these museums are being birthed digitally so therefore we're making sure that story is being told it's important that every museum from the air and space museum to the african-american museum to the museum of american history has major projects of making their collections accessible digitally but what we want to make sure is we also want to make sure that we give people the right portals into that not just simply putting out material but really making it of use for teachers for educators for parents so this is really a priority of ours and and uh if i can also just add not just static representations of what's in the collection but with an eye towards that user experience even if it's digitally someday a vr experience and maybe someday soon second i just want to echo uh the prior comments made by the chair by you mr secretary on the our commitment to the two new museums that were recently approved uh sharing the stories of american women and latinos across the country is part of telling a more inclusive story of the united states of america i appreciate the update on the site selection process we'll add my voice to those others that are urging an on-the-mall location and i know there's uh multiple options there but in my final seconds here just want to raise the uh topic of a sort of maintenance in some cases deferred maintenance and the increased risk of climate change i know you read as i read recently in the new york times an article about flooding issues in a number of the institutions climate change is only going to continue to become or to uh to grow in terms of the threat that it represents what help do you need from congress to help address this issue before we begin to lose treasures thankfully we haven't lost anything yet from my understanding but what do you need from congress well obviously climate change especially in washington is a federal issue right it's the national park service it's not just the smithsonian what we've done is really two things one is we created a climate action plan which allows us to make sure that one is an institution we're thinking creatively about sustainability what are the things we need to do so for example when we built the national museum of african-american history and culture it was the first green museum on the mall so sustainability was at the heart of that when we make changes like we're doing at the national air space museum it's also about sustainability and permitting in materials that would protect through pumps and walls to protect the collections what we've also done is recognize that we had to make changes so we have moved most of the vulnerable collections up so that that's not an issue but we've also had a special response group of staff whose job it is in an emergency to rescue collections so we've we've taken all of those steps i think the reality is the challenge is going to be how do we how does congress help the mall the entire wall deal with the issue of flooding part of that is what we're building in terms of being able to make sure that we can handle flooding but also is to have a plan that includes the smithsonian the national park service that allows us to come up with the right strategies thank you and i'll just warn you that next week there's going to be two young americans one age nine one eight seven who uh are gonna be visiting some of the smithsonians they've visited a few national parks already have their junior ranger badge collection going and so i know if it's a passport book they're gonna be stamping or something but i'm sure you'll be hearing them no doubt

mr. chairman I'm going to depart from my prepared remarks initially here because I've just learned that the department has in effect put into practice de facto amnesty because in the news reports in Seattle where ice had raided a company for hiring illegal aliens who were using false documents to obtain employment at the plant now the department has ordered that those 28 workers have been released and not only that they were given permission to return to work by the department that's supposed to be protecting us against illegal aliens entering the country and gaining unlawful employment I don't know why we need the Customs and Border Protection organization or ice or any of the others even the Department if we're going to say that it's okay to use false documents lying to obtain a job and then on top of that being illegally in the country why are we here now I know the this the agency it's not this is not their bailiwick but I don't know why we need a Customs and Border Protection if we are not going to enforce the laws that are on the books by people using false documents to gain employment while illegally in the country and then released to go back to work I'm flabbergasted this this is this is de facto amnesty de facto amnesty now tomorrow we're going to be hearing from the immigration enforcement and employment verification people and believe you me there will be some hard questions they will be needing to answer on this matter because this is an absolute wholesale change in policy that affects every American and every illegal alien in the country and the criminal laws of the country by by lying to gain a job while being an illegal alien and then releasing from from being held without bond and then giving a permission to go back to work a work permit mr. chairman what's happened here have you seen the reports no I have not but I intend to I'll let you read the newsroom news accounts it's absolutely uh well we will have a range of immigration officials before us tomorrow and they better welcome a better come well armed

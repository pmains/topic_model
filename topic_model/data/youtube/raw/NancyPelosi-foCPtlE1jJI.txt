in our studio madam leader thank you very much for being with us tell me this there has been some recrimination back and forth some a few Republican members taking the fact that this man this suspect was on line against Donald Trump against the Republicans to make this more of a partisan issue what is your response to all that I think that's something that a path I don't want to go down right now because it is inappropriate right now we're all praying very hard using all of our energy to transmit to Steve that he'd get well to give our comfort to his family and again also to the others who were who were injured I think it's completely inappropriate for them to make the comments they're making and I think it's we're going to have that conversation we can save it for another day I wanted to show you something that just in the last hour once said to our colleague on the air of course he was the first Republican member of Congress to endorse Donald Trump from Buffalo let's watch actually somebody that needs to also measure my language and response and not necessarily punch right back but let's just do at least that half a step back so yes I do regret certainly what I said at 8:05 in the morning that's an apology that's good I'm glad he was a Chris Jansing yeah but especially now I mean again there's enough vitriol and out there that aroused people to do things I don't know how I think the investigation will be interesting I don't know how we got the guns evidently he has challenges but let's again it's like it's a family thing every death in our country is a sad one especially from gun violence and we've said for all of them again close up our friend we're really very sad and I'm glad that he backtracked from what he said what has changed - if anything since Gabby Giffords suffered that grievous wound we understand it was estranged of course of events this weekend I led a delegation of member to Galveston Texas where we commissioned the USS gabrielle giffords whereas only over a second woman to ever be so honored gens have argued why named Devon Martha Washington who was alive two others who like sixteen women had where ships named for them but while alive and Gaby there was a real tribute to a triumph of of her courage her strength and motto of the ship and of Gabby's I'm ready I am ready so to have just seen the tribute to her for overcoming the challenge he had using the time since then to promote gun safety and then come here and have this canvas need for a triumph spirits over what has happened hopefully Gabby will be an inspiration to all of us there seems to be a move among Democrats that it is too soon too when we talk about gun safety governor McAuliffe did but after Newtown we saw immediate outpouring we've seen the demonstrations last year Chris Murphy's efforts the filibuster but nothing happens don't forget to sit in on the House floor they don't know how that we're going to through a feeling now that politically that you can't emphasize that issue no no no it's just that we were more than 24 hours when maybe 30 hours since this happened and we're addressing the emergency that we have right now which is to get Steve through this the others through this and then there will be a time to have those discussions about the appropriateness of some comments that people have made about again the need for background checks but again it's it's I don't think for 2000 there was an all house meeting obviously that you were co-leading with the speaker at this point how concerned are members about their security and how do you balance those needs for security versus the needs of every member to interact with your constituents right well our concern for security is not just about us personally the concern that members have expressed is concern for their staff for their constituents who visit them the press that covers them whether it's in the capital or in their district offices so I think we're going to have to take inventory as to what exposure we have and what is reasonable to expect and how we mitigate against any sort of danger any threats in the rest and this capital police have been wonderful if we've all found their praises for what happened yesterday but they take risks every day we lost two at nineteen eight that they lost their lives and so they have the best appraisal of security a danger of security and we're working with them as we go forward are we going to need to have more security at townhall meetings for instance in districts for people other than members of the leadership well I you know somebody was telling me all observe said because protesters showed my tell me this is a democracy and yes if there seems to be a need for local law enforcement to be involved than a judgement will be made but we must not misinterpret the spontaneous outpouring of voices of the American people as a threat I wanted to ask you about the other big story of the day which is reporting now confirmed by the by NBC News The Washington Post first broke the story that Muller's investigation Robert Mulder's investigation now is into the possibility of obstruction of justice so it's moved from past campaign practices possible collusion to current activities or recent activities since the president was elected I can't speak to that as you probably know as a member of the gang of eight I can't speak to whether we were breached or if any breathing what are your concerns about for instance a former Speaker you're a former Speaker Newt Gingrich today this is a speaker who back in May tweeted Robert Muller is a superb choice to be special counsel his reputation is impeccable for honesty and integrity media should now calm down today news which mothers now clearly the tip of the deep state spear aimed at destroying or at a minimum undermining and equipping the presidency mother is setting up a dragnet of obstruction financial questions in every a so once I'm clear et cetera who cares what he said I mean obviously they change their tune the fact is what we really need is an outside independent commission that would be able to right now we have Muller who's highly respected and when you respect somebody for their objectivity in law enforcement it doesn't change the way this obviously a new thing the political news calling it you know which on you know Newt is going after they're going after Robertson I understand and this is something that should be a message to American people what a very highly respected person accepted that responsibility I respect him as well and but I said we should have an independent commission as much as I respect him because he is accountable to the Justice Department officials who were appointed by Donald Trump so this is one path a good path I think but nonetheless inside the Trump Justice Department then we have the investigations from the Congress worthy investigations and Congress should be doing that House and Senate but it's inside the Congress we mean an outside objective completely objective review of the events and had the peak American people now the Russians it's a fact hacked probably altered definitely leaked information to undermine our election in our country so regardless of Donald Trump what is important for us to know is how we can protect the integrity of our own elections by overpass reporting the president said to according to a memo written by the former deputy head of the National Security Agency that the president is still rejecting the conclusion of the intelligence community that the russians hacked and tried to interfere what can I say about the president admit really the objectivity of Muller investigation hopefully the integrity of the research or the investigation in the Congress all their input we need and outside and because I don't know whether the president obstructed justice but I do know that he abused his power but let me ask you if there is not an outside investigation if the president were to try to pressure the Justice Department of fire robert muller what would be the reaction do you think Republicans in the house I don't have the key would do that well I mean who knows what he would do but I don't think she would do that I think the repercussions would be so serious clearly been thinking about it according to all the reporting he's been using about it and sounding office inside the White House about it well I think that what the president needs is a good night's sleep for several maybe he needs a good good legal advice because clearly he's flirting with obstruction of justice he clearly has abused power but that is a different story from reduction of dress obstruction of justice and again it's not about him it's about the United States of America it's about our electoral system it's about a president I asked the question all the time what do the Russians have on president Trump politically personally or financially that he would question the value of sanctions on Russia for their aggressive behavior in Eastern Europe that he would put in question article 5 of NATO that he would give back opportunities for diplomats to be here that were that were exacting on the Russians for what they did hacking into our life something's wrong with this picture something is wrong with this picture now is it criminal that remains to be seen what is it a beaut of power very clearly what if Robert Muller does report to Congress and has a case to be made outlining obstruction or some other some other issue involving the president and Republicans in Congress refused to take action well that is too different than he would not necessarily be reporting time his investigation would go to the courts he might have information that is maybe not but if a president cannot be indicted and only a Congress can take action if there are issues that need to be resolved do you think the Republicans in Congress who now control Congress would ignore that or do you think that that we would then go down the route of impeachment well without stipulating to the fact that they are investigating the president under that's not necessarily what robber Muller is doing he's investigating the situation and so that part of it can go to the court as you say not the president there would be information that might emerge from his investigation that would be useful to the congressional investigation which is a different threshold a standard of a judgment as to impeachment but you know what I don't even like to use the word because it's only about two things the facts and the law it's not a bad opinion or anything else and let's get the facts so that we can clear this up one way or another but the fact is that decisions are being made and statements are being made by the president which are laudatory of Putin dismissive of our own country and we want to know why now let's hope that they can clear the air and we can go forward I think impeachment I think everything decision we make should be a decision to unify the country to unify the country to unify the country if the facts speak to a different place you asked for the Republicans except that well it depends if the American people accept those facts and that's why it has to be free of politics but only about about the facts and the law final issue there was certainly a suggestion from the father of this young man who emerged from North Korea in a coma no and the only suggestion that the previous administration did not do enough to try to get him out have we failed in our ability should we be paying ransom should we be doing more to try to get these people out when they are imprisoned in these horrendous places if this young man is now in a coma and has been for a year the decision by a government to release a prisoner is something about their own timing I don't call him a prisoner a hostage whatever to release a person is their own in their own time is not necessarily a reflection of what in other countries timing is so for some reason the North Koreans decided that they would not that they would release him that's really the question what is in their mind not one a few people has been to Pyongyang North Korea you know a lot of people have been to hell and John on the border I've been there it's a very very dangerous and strange place I don't think that the that the president of Korea is reacting to anything outside I think it has something to do with his own decision-making and we'll see what that there you don't fault the previous administration know if it's about most people don't want us paying ransoms they don't want to because then that will only increase the number of hostages so you know you have to calibrate weigh the equities as to have it's an outrage that the North Koreans took this young boy this boy took this young boy in the first place but again the issue of hostage a paying ransom for hostages or prisoners and the rest is a deep discussion in our country and most people to the place that it will just encourage more kidnappings or arrests in the rest but again you have to judge every situation on its own or its own merit but no I don't fault the previous administration I think this is something to do with the timing within North Korea senior Pelosi thank you so much my pleasure and tonight it will be playable yes it will all be on team skully tonight well being our different sides to play the game with all the camaraderie that goes with it but team Steve Scalise that's when we'll all be on rooting for him indeed we will thank you very much and so ahead more on that Russian investigation bombshell special counsel robert muller investigating the president's with possible obstruction of justice stay with us right here we'll be right back it's an important question you asked but what I think with a simple answer wherever's need

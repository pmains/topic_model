among the reasons why it's important to recycle to two major reasons stand out first of all we're a little state we don't have a lot of extra room and if we end up using a lot of our extra room just to landfill the stuff that we're throwing away that's not very smart the second reason why we need to recycle is because we use a whole lot less energy when we take aluminum cans or 10 or glass or a paper and we simply find ways to reuse it that's a lot less expensive in terms of using energy and we have a huge demand for foreign oil we want to reduce that and recycling helps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil

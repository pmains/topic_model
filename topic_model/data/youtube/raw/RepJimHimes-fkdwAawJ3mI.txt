it's the mass shootings that get the attention and make the headlines its San Bernardino its aura Colorado it's Orlando but the reality is the vast majority of American gun violence does not look like mass shootings it looks like what happened here in the store behind me this is Fairfield Connecticut beautiful New England town couple of colleges churches a beautiful main street in the store behind me in 2005 Tim and Kim Donnelly were closing down for the evening when a drug addict with a stolen gun came in and into botched robbery attempt shot them both five times it didn't make the national headlines it devastated this community finding out the shock is paralyzing your brawl just stops and it takes a decent amount of time for your mind and your body to even comprehend what's being communicated to you and what's happening it's horrible and it's not something that you're ever prepare for and something that no one should ever have to find out anytime you experience a tragedy or lost this magnitude of your life instantly is split between before and after and in my case life of my parents and life without that life with my parents was good it was happy it was fun life without them is much harder to articulate its endeavour stating in addition to not having parent figures in my life everything that they're missing out on there's so much that has happened that they should be here for and that's never not set during middle I would say to the lawmakers I hope that they're listening to the voices and stories of people in the communities that they represent this is the intersection of Pembroke and James streets in Bridgeport Connecticut the city that has seen more than its fair share of gun violence in fact three days ago right here there was a gang-related drive-by shooting that resulted in a young man being shot twice he's now in the hospital but he's one of the lucky ones Bridgeport Connecticut like Norwalk like cities all over this country have seen too many families lose family members to gun violence it was devastated i mean i can deliver this woman he just went on before he just glad to came back home it doctor worse I don't have work to say how I feel and this is my my other two kids feel then his absence in the house every kid has his own personality obviously mine my trick is always been different and he has something like even kind of special and the other kids are getting getting some problems at school as well it tastes too much what my perspective over the years have just been and become intensified because of all the rash of shootings and senseless shooters that I must deal with out of 12 month period it depends but it's out of the 12 month period I'm probably involved in at least four to five shooting incidents that involve the victim dying and me either coordinating and are doing the service or participating in some kind of way in the service recently there have been two shootings literally around the corner from the church and so I've had to physically go around the corner and be with the community persons they are so seeking to be present on the state national level I'm part of co-chair of congregations organized for New Connecticut which is in the village of the industrial areas foundation and on the national level we have engaged in a strategy called do not stand idly by based on the biblical scripture do net that says do not stand idly by while your neighbors being spilt in the streets I think Congress can do their part in sort of making sure that our government doesn't side with gun manufacturers but rather sides with the victims at best and at least not be an active participant in protecting gun manufactures if I were to ask legislators to pass legislation around gun violence or gun control it would be to rethink the legislation that's already put before them background checks no fly no purchase that's what I would ask we lose 30,000 Americans every single year to gun violence in two years we lose more Americans to gun violence than we lost in the entire duration of the Vietnam War this does not need to be the case there are any number of things that we can do universal background checks no fly no by an assault weapon ban limiting the number of rounds in the magazine the use of technology to make sure that only a guns owner can use that gun if we could get a bunch of those things done we would save thousands of lives the opponents of doing anything are right no one thing is going to end gun violence in fact will never end all gun violence but the rest of the world doesn't have this problem we do because we're a nation awash in guns and it does not need to be that way the only thing we can't do is to continue to be silent and to do nothing

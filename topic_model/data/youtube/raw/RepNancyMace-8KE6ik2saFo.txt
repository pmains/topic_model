joining me now south carolina congresswoman member of the house transportation and infrastructure and oversight and veteran affairs committees nancy mays congresswoman will this make a difference in offsetting ransomware attacks cyber attacks well no it doesn't doesn't really mean a hill of beans at this juncture it's just a memo i'm calling it a memo to sell with some future goals there's no meat on the bones here and look in december of last year in 2020 there were 11 federal agencies that were hacked by organizations aligned with russia we saw with the colonial pipeline earlier this year how devastating that hacking was there were chinese actors that hacked verizon and we could go on and on but cyber security is national security and it doesn't seem like it's a real true priority right now just this week i worked with democrat ro khanna on legislation i'm hoping it will come to the floor for a vote in the house today or tomorrow before we recess and that particular measure would allow the federal rotational cyber security workforce program act and would allow our federal agencies to operate more like a business and a bureaucracy with rotating cyber resources around the federal agencies and so we need to take further steps to ensure both the private and public sector are protected against these hackers it's a major major issue and is affecting all of us you've entered you've introduced your own bipartisan bill to address these issues and along with uh congressman roe khanna uh what does this this build do what does it do beyond what the president is doing well would allow federal agencies to operate more like businesses do in the private sector allowing rotational workforce individuals and employees to go around and work at different agencies and use and learn and utilize what they've learned the technology assets they've learned in those jobs being rotational allows them to take on broader skills and learn more at their job and while they're working that's what a lot of the private sector does there are other things that we should also be doing in cyber a lot of times when companies are hacked they're often sued or fined by the federal government and that's something that i wish the biden administration would address and allow us to work on some of those issues we have i mean companies that get hacked spend millions of dollars investing in their businesses to protect their their customer data we've also got to protect the american people's data and the rotational workforce program would allow us to do that would allow us to use ideas and resources like much like a business would but doing it in different federal agencies i want to get your reaction to the senate moving forward on that 1.2 trillion dollar infrastructure package there were 17 republicans that voted yes on it and some notable republicans said heck no rick scott a no ted cruz no tim scott wrote this i voted no on infrastructure a week ago because there was no legislative text my mind hasn't changed there's still no legislative text or explanation on how to pay for a one trillion dollar infrastructure plan he tweeted that about 11 hours ago some of the ideas on paying for it are well typical budget gimmicks like extend extending cuts to future medicare spending that never happened however what are what's in it for the republicans in this what is the offset what did they get in return for agreement nobody knows yeah nobody knows uh there is no bill there's there's no language to look at and read no one really knows what it'll look like at the end of the day they had a cloture vote last night on a bill that doesn't exist so i'm sort of like forget human infrastructure this is ghost infrastructure they're going to be debating and voting on this measure likely tomorrow they'll have mark-up next week but the bill literally doesn't exist it's not worth the paper it's printed on right now and there's some things i saw outlined i was following twitter last night because that's how i had to learn about it there were no i guess you know nancy pelosi's bipartisanship is to allow no house members including the ranking member and chairman to be part of those bipartisan negotiations i think that's wrong but there's some things that concern me in what i've seen more money invested in amtrak than literally almost anything else in this supposed package also electrical vehicle uh charging stations that could be an entire sector in the private energy industry i don't know why the government wants to take it over um and then we just don't know how we're gonna pay for it and there's over a trillion dollars floating around of covid relief funds that haven't been spent yet couldn't we use some of those dollars about 200 billion would be used to pay for this new infrastructure package joe's opinion is here i know he wants to jump in joseph yeah absolutely congresswoman i mean to that point we're talking about a trillion dollars that has not actually been spent on coveted relief that had very little to do with covid you talk about the eminent threats of infrastructure you know in many ways in order to address a problem you have to acknowledge the problem exists how do we get uh people to kind of walk away from the peak stupid happening in the swamp where we understand intuitively that these individuals in russia are hacking at the behest at the kremlin not in spite of the kremlin these individuals in china are hacking at the behest of the chinese continent party not in spite of them this is what's happening right now these are people acting effectively at the behest of the government and our government seems to want to pretend that their government knows nothing that's happening right they want to issue memos and have verbal slaps on the wrist and i sort of liking it to this right now with russia and china the united states can't get out of the locker room right now and china's out there bench pressing 200 pounds and on supplements we need to be stronger on russia and china regarding hacking and cyber security both in the public and private sector we need to do more to support businesses when they do get hacked rather than sue them and you know find them allow them the ability and the resources to ensure that that data is protected in the future give them those resources and i just it's really confusing to me this is why congress is hated this is why some of us up here hate congress voting on measures we don't know anything about we don't even know what's in what specifically is in the bill congresswoman nancy mays thank you so much for that

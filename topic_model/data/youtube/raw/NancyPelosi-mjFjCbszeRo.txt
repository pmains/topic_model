all of a sudden the Republicans in the House have seen the light they're willing to reverse a vote that they took not more than a week ago one hundred percent of them voted for the Ryan budget which would allow that interest their interest rates to double from three point four percent to six point eight percent thank God they've seen the light Thank You President Obama for shedding some light on this and and now they say they're for stopping that but but how do they want to pay for it they want to write they want to take it from their favorite target women's health I don't know why it hasn't dawned on them yet that the health of America's women is very important to the health of America's families and so they want to take the funds from women's health and and then also childhood immunizations that's very important the immunization of every child in America is important to every other child in America and that's where they want to take the money from with the emotion that we have here today is to say instead of taking the money instead of robbing Paula to pay to pay Peter we should be taking the money from the tax subsidies that go to big oil in our country that's what we should be doing isn't that a better show of what our values are that we value the health of our women and our children why would we and not only to make matters worse not only are they suggesting that that we take the money from the prevention fund the immunization and screening for breast cancer and cervical cancer and other health it women's health issues not on earth we should take the five or six billion dollars from there they're saying we should take the additional five billion dollars that would be left in the account repeal it repeal it we're not even you know we're taking twice as much money as we need for the student loan bill because we want to do away we're going to use this as an excuse to do away with this prevention initiative that affects women's health so directly that rageous it's outrageous we prefer tax subsidies for big oil rather than the health of America's women once again they're targeting women's health and so I am urge my colleagues to vote against the moat the previous question so we will have an opportunity to at least put before the house an alternative that says give us a choice to choose between whether we want to pay for the future that are young people's education by removing some of some of the subsidies to big oil or we want to take it out of women's health the very idea that the Republicans would deny us a vote to do that speaks very clearly about how focus they are on targeting women's health is something that they want to cut so again I urge my colleagues to vote no on the previous question which would allow that the house to vote on a democratic bill that reduces the interest rates it keeps them at 3.4 instead of raising them to 6.8 which is in the Republican budget and if we cannot do that I urge my colleagues to vote no on this ill-conceived way out of whack statement of values that we would that we would make health pay for children's education when you we should be doing both and so no on the previous question we're not allowed to do that at least even take a vote no on the bill and let's admit that we can do better than that with that mr. Chairman I Mr Speaker I yield back the balance my time the gentleman from Florida continue to reserve gentleman from Florida reserves a gentleman from Colorado Thank You mr.

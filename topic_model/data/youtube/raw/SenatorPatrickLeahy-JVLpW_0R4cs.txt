i appreciate the extremely hard work that the majority leader and i've told him this and the president i've told him that i distinguished chairman i've told him that that they've the work they've done to get the best possible deal under extremely difficult circumstances and now we're saying that with the final resolution i will not be able to vote for it as i assume others in the vermont delegation would not i'm afraid that it creates a foster bargain it averts a government shutdown at the expense of our overall national interest this year congress spent most of its time negotiating three rounds of deeper and deeper cuts in the current year's budget and exercise and oftentimes misguided wheel spinning which ignores the fact that discretionary spending is but a relative fraction of the overall budget or addresses some of the most pressing and urgent needs of ordinary americans advocates paint disagreement in moral terms i agree with them on that budgets are about our real priorities and there's so much in this budget packet that's inconsistent with basic vermont and american values drastic cuts to anti-hunger programs for low-income women and children elimination of vermont's weatherization program cuts to economic development programs that grow jobs in my state of vermont are not my idea prudent sacrifices it is no moral credit to congress to cut vouchers for homeless vermont veterans who serve their country honorably nor does congress cover itself in glory to deny first generation vermonters help in going to college because of cuts of the trio program is a moral good to eliminate housing counseling for low-income families facing foreclosure or to sly small stipends for seniors were on meals on wheels now estimates of these cuts in my little state range as high as 150 million dollars tremendous burden at a time we face the worst time since the great depression now the reason we're here is a column pointed out very well in our national papers yesterday is because even though we had an agreement to pass an omnibus bill last december the last minute uh those in the other side of the aisle who had agreed on that reneged and of course we were not able to get the 60 votes necessary in the senate i had supported that omnibus budget bill even though there was enormous cuts in it it would have enacted tens of billions of dollars in carefully drawn reasonable reductions below the white house budget proposal there's a thing where senator from why he had worked very hard and encouraged us to make cut after cut after cut and we all agreed with him i agreed with him it was in the omnibus and if they had been passed we wouldn't be here but because those who had agreed to support it changed their mind at the last minute they killed the omnivorous bill it forced the congress into a series of top gap funding bills and now onto a slapdash continuing resolution in addition to the cuts in the omnibus bill i also supported reductions of billions more and i voted for billions of dollars of cuts in short-term reductions in the continuing resolutions earlier this year now some who tout this round of cuts as the most important and has the largest cuts of discretionary spending in history are the same ones that push through hundreds of billions of dollars of tax cuts to companies that ship jobs overseas american jobs overseas great the adding to the profits of our oil companies are now charging charges four dollars a gallon for gas and more push through for multi-multi-millionaires many of whom said they didn't want the tax cut pushed it through none the less and the correlation between those spending cuts of those unfunded tax cuts is direct it's unflattering to the proponents of both initiatives and frankly madam president i'm tired of being lectured on fiscal sanity from those who voted for an unnecessary war in iraq saying that that is because of 9 11 even though as we know from every single report that has come out iraq had absolutely nothing to do with 911 but we spent a trillion dollars thousands of american lives tens of thousands of other people's lives in iraq and then for the first time in the history of this country instead of paying for a war as we always have in the past we say oh no we'll borrow the money and by the way we'll give you a tax cut too so who paid for that war in iraq the men and women who valiantly fought there and their families who waited wondering if they would come back alive broken or dead and often are given the worst and grimace news they're the only ones that sacrificed everybody else got tax cut and we brought all the money from china and everywhere else to pay for a war we never should have been in a trillion dollars later 10 years later we still are spending tens of billions of dollars there now some corporations some others made a lot of money we didn't and then we spent another eight or nine years we shouldn't have been in afghanistan doing the same thing for all the money for those so it seems that our soldiers paid a great burden american people paid a great burden but boy some made out like bandits and i don't want any lectures from those who gave the bandits their bag of gold i yield the fork

uh let's get serious senator bill cassidy republican from the great state of louisiana joins me now mr senator a 50 cut in emissions by 2030 that's the target is it doable without a huge gas price increase so first thing about this is it's going to be 40 since relative to 2005. we've already reduced emissions by 17 since 2005. so so we're already almost halfway there now that's their claim they've not shown us objective evidence rhodium has done an analysis said that they could get down to 35 percent in u.s emissions i'm skeptical because initially at least and into the whole 10-year period they are going to drive products coming from asia here if you make a car battery in asia it is incredible a minute of process global greenhouse gas emissions may increase even if we're able to continue to decrease u.s emissions and global is what counts by the way under current law we could reduce emissions by as much as 34 relative to 2005. the improvement in this and u.s emissions is marginal but once more may be offset by global increased emissions don't we need to change the targets and realize that we're going to be using fossil fuels a lot for many decades to come absolutely the the international energy agency says that that that we will continue as a as a world to continue to br to use increased fossil fuel through 2050. now we in the u.s produce fossil fuel in a much more environmentally responsible way than they would in russia than they would in iran et cetera so if we're going to produce oil and gas let's produce it where we create american jobs where we use american environmental standards and where we strengthen our economy and not the economy of our enemies i think those folks in the white house have it all wrong mr senator thank you very much for joining us this morning from the great state of louisiana an energy state you know what you're talking about and we appreciate that thank you senator

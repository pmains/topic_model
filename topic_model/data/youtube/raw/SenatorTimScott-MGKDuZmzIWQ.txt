thank you all for coming i'll make this uh short and sweet as well uh american energy independence and national security security should be as close as what is to the water they're inseparable and so when we talk about the importance of shutting off russian energy in america we're talking about shutting off 60 million dollars a day over the last 12 months we've sent ukraine about a billion dollars every day we're sending the russians 60 million dollars if we're serious about our national security we have to be equally as serious about our ability to produce our own energy and then to become a net exporter

UNBELIEVABLE SO DIFFICULT. LET'S LET'S BRING IN CONGRESSMAN NOW. LET'S BRING IN, UH, CONGRESS. REPUBLICAN TEXAS CONGRESSMAN TONY GONZALEZ, WHO REPRESENTS DEL RIO, I ALMOST THAT WAS GOOD. I WAS LOOKING AT MY NOTES. SORRY ABOUT THAT, CONGRESSMAN. MY CONCERN, SIR, IS 12 AND THEN JOHNSON. MAYBE UP TO 15,000 PEOPLE. KAMALA HARRIS AND JOE BIDEN HAD TO KNOW THIS WAS COMING. YOU'RE AT THE BORDER. YOU HAVE 800 MILES OF BORDER YOU REPRESENT IN YOUR DISTRICT. DID THEY CONTACT YOU? DO THEY ASK YOU FOR SOME ADVICE? NO THEY HAVEN'T AND THAT'S THAT'S ONE OF THE UNFORTUNATE PARTS OF IT. YOU KNOW, I WAS IN DEL RIO. I REPRESENT DEL RIO, ALONG WITH 800 MILES OF SOUTHERN BORDER. I WAS IN DEL RIO ON ON THURSDAY. MATTER OF FACT, I SPOKE WITH JOHN. I SPEAK WITH JOHN REGULARLY. HIM AND OTHER BORDER PATROL AGENTS. AND TO ME IT FELT LIKE A CATEGORY FIVE HURRICANE. HAD HIT THE LAND LOCKED CITY OF DEL RIO. AND HERE YOU HAD BORDER PATROL AGENTS DOING EVERYTHING THEY POSSIBLY CAN, UH, THROUGHOUT THIS ENTIRE CRISIS, BUT THIS MOMENT IN PARTICULAR, IT WAS JUST GUT WRENCHING TO SEE THE CONDITIONS THINGS WERE IN AND THIS IS SOLELY DUE TO A POLICY DECISION BY THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION. THEY SIMPLY DO NOT CARE ABOUT LAW AND ORDER AT ALL RIGHT. THEY DID AWAY WITH. UH SOME OF THESE TITLE 42 FLIGHTS FOR A SHORT PERIOD AND THAT SHOWED US EXACTLY WHAT THE FUTURE IS GOING TO BRING. IT WAS AS IF A BAT SYMBOL WENT UP IN DEL RIO, TEXAS THAT HIGHLIGHTED TO EVERY HAITIAN COME AND COME NOW IT'S AS DANGEROUS AS CAN BE. WELL SENATOR CRUZ IS AT THE BORDER A COUPLE NIGHTS GUY HE WAS LAST THURSDAY NIGHT OR SO AND. AND HE HAD SAID THAT HE EXPERIENCED A TON A TON OF HAITIAN MEN GETTING ON CELL PHONE SAYING, HEY, THEY'RE NOT SAYING YOU'RE BACK AND NOT SENDING US BACK. COME NOW AND WHAT HAPPENED WENT FROM 4000 OR SO ON THURSDAY TO UP TO 15,000. TODAY IT'S WHAT IT'S THE WAY IT WORKS. YOU GET ON THE CELL PHONE. YOU CALL YOUR FRIENDS AND THEY SHOW UP AT THE BORDER. NO IT'S ABSOLUTELY A REFERRAL SYSTEM. YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU GET OVER, YOU CALL BACK AND YOU REFER OTHER FRIENDS AND FAMILIES TO ALSO MAKE THIS DANGEROUS TREK. LOOK I'VE BEEN PUSHING FOR SIX MONTHS OVER SIX MONTHS ON WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION NEEDS TO DO. ONE OF THINGS I ASKED WAR IS TO ADD MORE BORDER PATROL AGENTS TO THE EQUATION AFTER SIX MONTHS AND A CATEGORY FIVE HURRICANE HITTING, THEY FINALLY HAVE DONE THAT. WHAT WORRIES ME BEYOND THIS, I THINK WAS IMPORTANT FOR THE AMERICAN PUBLIC TO UNDERSTAND IS ALL THESE. BORDER PATROL AGENTS ARE FOCUSED ON WHAT'S HAPPENING IN DEL RIO. WHAT THAT HAS DONE IS THAT HAS CREATED OUR SOUTHERN BORDER. WIDE OPEN IN THE SECTOR. NEXT DOOR, THE BIG BEND SECTOR VERY REMOTE. WHAT I AM WORRIED ABOUT IS ANOTHER 9 11 TYPE OF EVENT HAPPENING DUE TO THE LACK OF SECURITY THAT OUR SOUTHERN BORDER IS UNDER UNDER RIGHT NOW THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO FOCUS ON. YOU CAN SEE IT COMING A MILE AWAY. NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE TO DO THIS, BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR SOUTHERN BORDER IS PROTECTED. FROM THOSE THAT WANT TO CAUSE US HARM. SO YOU MAKE A VERY GOOD POINT. CONGRESSMAN THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS WHEN YOU IF YOU UNPACK THAT STATEMENT, WE HAVE TO THESE PEOPLE ARE INVENTED. THEY'RE COMING OVER IN THOUSANDS. THERE'S NO WAY OF GETTING WHERE WHO THEY ARE WHERE THEY CAME FROM. DO THEY HAVE A CRIMINAL HISTORY NUMBER ONE? ARE THEY COVERED? INFECTED BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THEY'RE BEING TESTED OR VACCINATED AS THEY COME ACROSS A NUMBER TWO AND NUMBER THREE ARE YEAH. ARE THEY TERRORISTS? WE DON'T KNOW WHO THESE PEOPLE ARE. SO HOW DO WE HANDLE THAT? IT'S DANGEROUS ALL THE WAY ALL THE WAY AROUND. YOU KNOW, ROUGHLY, YOU KNOW, THROUGHOUT THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS AROUND 20% OF MIGRANTS TESTED COVID POSITIVE. SO IF YOU'RE TALKING 15,000, THAT MEANS 3000 OF THOSE MIGRANTS ARE COVID POSITIVE NOT ONLY COVID. THERE'S OTHER ELEMENTS THERE TO, UH MEASLES AND OTHER OUTBREAKS. IT'S DANGEROUS FOR AGENTS. IT'S DANGEROUS FOR OUR COMMUNITIES. IN GENERAL. WHAT THIS ADMINISTRATION NEEDS TO DO IS IT NEEDS TO REVAMP THE REPATRIATION FLIGHTS? SEND THESE FOLKS THAT DO NOT QUALIFY FOR ASYLUM BACK TO HAITI USE EVERY FORMER FASHION. IT'S THE ONLY WAY THEY'RE THAT SLOWS DOWN THIS PROCESS, PEOPLE NEED TO BE RETURNED TO THEIR COUNTRY OF ORIGIN, AND THEY NEED TO KNOW THAT OUR BORDER IS. SECURE NOT IN WORDS, BUT IN ACTIONS AND THAT STARTS IN THAT ENDS WITH THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION. AT THE LONGER THEY DO NOT ACT, THE MORE DANGEROUS AMERICA IS GOING TO BE FOR 9 11 TYPE OF EVENT CONGRESSMAN ONLY ABOUT 20 SECONDS OR SO, UH, SECRETARY MAYORKAS IS ON HIS WAY THERE OR IS THERE HAVE THEY REACHED OUT TO YOU YET? AND IF THEY DO WHAT WE TELL THEM? HE HAS NOT REACHED OUT, AND UNFORTUNATELY, THAT'S ONE OF THE DOWNFALLS TO THIS IS THIS ADMINISTRATION IS TRYING TO GO IT ALONE WHETHER THAT'S ON THE BORDER WITH ELLEN'S ON AFGHANISTAN AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS THEY'RE ABANDONING AMERICANS. THEY'RE ABANDONING TEXANS, AND IT'S JUST THE WRONG APPROACH. ALL THE WAY AROUND. MY PHONE IS HERE. PLEASE REACH OUT. I LOVE TO HAVE A DISCUSSION. HATE TO LOSE A REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN FROM TEXAS, BUT THEY REALLY SHOULD MAKE YOU THE BORDERS. ARE YOU THE ONE WHO KNOWS? FORMER BORDER AGENT REPRESENTING THE DISTRICT, 800 MI

hello everyone congressman pete sauber here I'm sorry that I cannot be with you today but unfortunately our schedule requires me to be in Washington DC however I do appreciate this opportunity to update you on the work I am doing in Congress as a pro-union Republican who supports project labor agreements prevailing wages and davis-bacon I know that the economy and our state relies on our working families and our working families are the future that being said I made sure that the first bill I introduced will create good-paying jobs and unleash the economic engine in our part of the state my superior national land exchange Act builds on the strong work done by my predecessor former congressman Rick Nolan and codifies the polyMet land swap mining is our past our present and our future the polyMet project will ultimately result in nearly 1,000 new construction jobs in northeastern Minnesota with polyMet receiving its final permit my bill becomes even more crucial to protect the project from litigation and ensure that we start developing these precious metals we must continue to develop renewable forms of energy but we cannot shut out conventional affordable sources on which millions rely that's why I proudly support the replacement of Enbridge line three replacing this pipeline will safely transport the energy that fuels America through a pipeline proudly built by Minnesotans and their skilled union workers in fact workers employed directly for the pipeline will have a total payroll of almost three hundred and thirty four million dollars while building and maintaining this energy infrastructure our energy infrastructure is not the only infrastructure in need of an update we all know that our nation's roads bridges and highways are crumbling as a member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee I am optimistic that we can pass an infrastructure package that will bring Minnesota's infrastructure into the 21st century and create thousands of new construction jobs well the economy is currently running on all cylinders there's still more work to be done a concern I often hear reflected in my meetings is the difficulty of finding skilled workers to fill jobs one priority of mine is supporting programs that prepare the next generation of workers with the hands-on experience necessary to fill high-paying labor jobs therefore I strongly support labor recognized apprenticeship programs registered with the Department of Labor these are crucial to ensuring a high standard for future workers along with helping to create opportunities for Minnesota workers I am committed to ensuring that they don't lose the benefits they worked hard to earn over a lifetime that's why I co-sponsored HR 397 the rehabilitation for multi employer pensions Act more commonly known as the butch Lewis Act this critical legislation would help financially support these multi-employer pensions so they don't fail and millions of Americans don't see their retirement security security decimated the great news is that this vital piece of legislation has passed out of both the education and workforce and the Ways and Means Committee and is awaiting consideration on the House floor I want to conclude by saying that as a former Hermantown city councilor and st. Louis County Commissioner I had the privilege of working closely with both the Iron Range and Duluth Building and Construction Trades Council and have a good friendship with both their presidents Craig Olson and Mike severs root as your congressman I'm looking forward to working closely with all of you for years to come if there's anything you think I should do be doing better in supporting Minnesota's working families please do not hesitate to reach out it is a privilege to serve you here in Congress please know that my door is always open and enjoy the rest of your day

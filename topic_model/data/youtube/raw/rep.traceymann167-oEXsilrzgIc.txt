madam speaker i rise today to to once again call attention to the disastrous situation that president biden has created at our southern border the first priority of any administration must be to protect a homeland and keep americans safe we have brave border patrol agents putting themselves in harm's way every day doing just that and meanwhile their calls for a complete southern border security system are falling on deaf ears in washington they know that it would make their jobs easier and our country safer and the funds are already appropriated why then is the administration forcing these agents who deserve our unwavering support to do their jobs without anything other than the most comprehensive technology available across the globe from our southern border lies afghanistan where there exists yet another disastrous situation president biden created make no mistake the fall of afghanistan to the taliban is not an isolated problem in a land far far away the taliban could redistribute their terrorists across the world in a matter of days and our southern border is about as secure as a welcome mat inviting terrorists who hate america to come and set up shop president biden didn't just torpedo this appeal of afghanistan last month he also put americans in danger which highlights yet another need to address the southern border crisis immediately i yield back

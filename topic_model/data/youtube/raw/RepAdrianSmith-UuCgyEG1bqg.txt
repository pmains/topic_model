Thank You ambassador for joining us this morning I appreciate that certainly you're dealing with a lot of issues and we appreciate that you take the time to be here this morning president Trump is time and again expressed his concerns for our farmers and ranchers he has certainly made the National Farm Bureau Federation annual conference and an annual event on his schedule he's been steadfast in his insistence that agriculture be a part of any negotiations we undertake with the European Union for this and much more of the rural community is appreciative there are many long-term issues to be considered in the China negotiations including intellectual property issues barriers to biotech products and many other non-tariff trade barriers however I do want to make sure that we don't lose sight of the fact that commodity prices are down in the breadbasket of the world being America has been negatively impacted by the cumulative impacts of the tariffs and certainly non-tariff trade barriers as well we should never lose sight of this fact in our deliberations because it is so crucial and these talks come to a successful conclusion I'm grateful for the president's personal involvement I along with many members of this committee asked last summer that the president engaged directly with President Xi to move these talks forward I urge him to continue to do so and that remember the sacrifices being made by our producers AG producers in your daily discussions in addition to China we need to continue to move forward with us MCA we need to bring down the 232 tariffs on Canada and Mexico and eliminate the retaliation our producers continue to endure in order to facilitate the agreements approval I'm grateful for the progress made in the Japan Talks every day our producers face tariff rates higher than their competitors when doing business in Japan is a last opportunity to expand and defend their market share so once again and time is of the essence with the President's commitment to US agriculture in mind I would appreciate your thoughts on the 232 tariffs on Canada and Mexico and also your outlook for the Japan negotiations yeah thank you very much congressman first of all in the context of China is not just about purchases we have we had many many hours of discussion about a whole variety of it which I won't go through because most members well most members would evidently some interest from biotechnology to specific issues involving beef poultry aquatics meats I mean it's just I could go through it all a lot on rice I mean beyond the purchase a lot on just they have the SPS issues so we spent a lot of time on there we actually had long discussions on ractopamine for those of you who are from the beef producing areas with the Vice Premier of China so it was pre detailed discussion so having said that to sort of jump ahead I want to go to Japan very soon the dates probably going to be in the next month I want to have a trilateral meeting there on this issue of China with these being I also want to start our negotiations which we've now vember we've gone through the process of TPA with everyone with the Congress and now we're beyond our 90 days so we can start the actual negotiating we feel a certain urgency be a real urgency because of the combination of market access from TPP in Europe in this sort of thing you alluded to and it's going to have a real effect on our on our farmers so it's something that we feel very strongly about on Canada and in Mexico in the context of maintaining the integrity of the steel aluminium program we wonder I work very much to work out an agreement with with Canada and Mexico and we're in the process of doing that whether we'll succeed or not I row but it certainly is my hope that that will do that

questions my name is kelsey and i'm the district director for congresswoman clark i want to start by saying our team is here to help you while our office may be physically closed we are available to answer your questions and hear your concerns the best ways to contact us are by calling our office at 617-354-0292 or contacting us through our website www.katherineclark.house.gov if we don't get to your question tonight i encourage you to contact us independently and we'll get back to you as soon as we can if you do have a question during this event please press zero on your keypad and a member of our team will put you into the queue while we wait for more participants to get on the line here are some helpful resources here in massachusetts to get up-to-date alerts sent directly to your phone please text covid19 excuse me covid m a seven seven seven you can also call the informational and referral hotline at two one one for the latest updates on the phase rollout of vac season massachusetts you can visit math.gov covid19 vaccines and if you have specific questions related to vaccine distribution or where you fit into the phase rollout you can email those questions to dash kovid-19-vaccine-plan dash m a math.gov again if you have a question at any point during this event please press zero on your keypad and a member of our team will put you into the queue and now i would like to turn the call over to congresswoman clark thank you very much kelsey and good evening this is congresswoman catherine clark thank you for joining tonight's tele town hall i know so many in our communities are suffering right now the loss of life and livelihood over the past 10 months as a result of this pandemic has been devastating and i want you to know that we hear you we see you and i am working to bring relief and resources to the fifth district so that we can crush this virus and move toward an economic recovery that is robust and inclusive for all it is undeniably exciting to finally see the first vaccines being approved by the fda distributed to states and administered to front-line workers and it is an especially proud moment for massachusetts as our own moderna is one of the first vaccines to be approved for distribution but as president-elect biden says it is one thing to have a vaccine it's another thing entirely to have vaccinations the federal government needs to provide the financial assistance to local and state governments to support the equitable distribution of a vaccine that is costly and logistically challenging at a time when city and state budgets are stretched thin at the end of last year congress did pass an emergency coveted relief bill that included 69 billion dollars for testing tracing and vaccine distribution but this is just a down payment we are looking forward to working with the by then harris administration to implement a coordinated national strategy to crush this virus and make sure vaccines are available to everyone as quickly as possible now i want to introduce two important experts that we have with us on the call to help answer your questions about the development and distribution of coven 19 vaccines first i'd like to introduce dr assad saya dr saya is the ceo of cambridge health alliance a vibrant innovative health system that is committed to serving all those in need throughout his tenure at cha dr saya has spearheaded efforts to improve the quality efficiency and accessibility of health care services for many of the most vulnerable in our communities prior to joining cha he held leadership roles at several area hospitals including director of emergency medical services for brigham and women's hospital associate associate chief of the department of emergency medicine at st elizabeth medical center and chairman of the department of emergency medicine at keratos good samaritan medical center i'd like to welcome dr saya to offer some brief opening remarks and thank you doctor for joining us tonight good evening congresswoman clark and thank you very much for getting us together this evening and i want to thank you for all your effort and work in advocating for all of us in washington dc many thanks to your staff and everybody that's been involved in arranging this this call tonight it is my pleasure and honor in joining you tonight and joining a longtime friend juliet came in really giving some very essential and critical information to the community it is very important that all of us are involved in providing the community with as much information as possible and easing up a lot of the the misunderstandings out there regarding the the vaccine and straightening out the record about how important this is let me share with you our experience at the cambridge health alliance and my experience working very closely with the state and the department of public health throughout this ordeal starting almost a year ago we have vaccine on hand at the hospital we were one of the first organizations to receive vaccine from the department of public health and from the state so far we have vaccinated slightly over 3 000 of our uh 5 400 employees with the first vaccine and of those slightly over 3 000 about 1200 have received these a second dose it's been very much welcomed by all our staff from all walks of a professional background and we have had almost no reactions or side effects or any situations that require folks to think twice about receiving the vaccine let me assure everybody on the call that this is this vaccine is extremely safe it was a very thoughtfully developed and the fact that it was developed over a short period of time does not mean that there were any shortcuts or any missteps or anything that was supposed to happen that didn't happen it was just that happened done fast i personally encourage encouraged all the staff and continue to encourage the community including my own family i had a conversation with my elderly parents who are there in their 80s and they can't wait until their turns come and my daughter who's expecting asked me about the vaccine and i encourage her to get the vaccine when her turn comes so if that's an indication of how convinced i am from as a scientist and as a physician of the safety and the importance of the vaccine i don't know what else i could tell you thank you so much uh and next i'd like to introduce uh also my good friend uh former department of homeland security assistant secretary for intergovernmental affairs under president barack obama and during her tenure juliet played a pivotal role in major operations including the handling of the h1n1 pandemic and organized major policy efforts in community resiliency julia has been instrumental in helping us navigate the unprecedented challenges of the past 10 months thank you again oh thank you good evening that's so sweet thank you so much congressman just you know gosh um i am so sorry for everything that is happening but so grateful for all of your work and leadership for all of us um uh out there and and to my uh neighbors uh because you are my congresswoman as well uh i wanted to say hello uh so it's been uh quite a week uh and i'm gonna now shift gears because i also have been very involved with uh with what has been happening uh uh with the domestic terror threat and look at i think um uh uh the news and i i'm gonna put this in the national perspective just so you could get a sense of where massachusetts is but also what to expect with the bynum plan that's been announced at 7 15. um i work with uh uh the teams down there about sort of where what the thinking is and then what what they're seeing and what you may be hearing i want to make it clear that an anecdote does not make a statistic and i think uh for those of you who may be savvy on social media um or you know what what do they call it doom scrolling uh uh it is not that things are great but it is it is it is far from being a disaster as you just heard uh uh systems that have to get into place like this often take a while the united states is a big place but let me just give you one data point on january 5th the united states had only vaccinated 5 million people by to yesterday it was 10 million so that's the kind of exponential growth you know so while you have the horrible exponential growth with the disease we're starting to see the grease work in its way through a very very complicated system that system has actually four parts and i thought it'd be helpful to just hear what those are i mean the first is obviously supply slash demand uh we um uh the goal is to get more vaccines on the market uh you'll be hearing about johnson and johnson relatively soon that's a single dose which makes people who who work in logistics very happy and it doesn't require uh the cold storage which means that more places will be able to deliver the vaccine one of the challenges logistically is of course the cold storage reduces the number of places uh so the first is demand and then working with communities to make sure that uh we don't have too much vaccine hesitancy on that front we're starting to see some good numbers too i'm not saying this is great i just want uh you know we have to be hopeful about something uh where um even just two months ago more about 50 percent of americans said that they were very skeptical of a vaccine the numbers look very different now part of that has to do with i think the election of president biden part of it has to do with when a vaccine exists that feels very different to people than talking about it in theory so right now we have 40 of the american population ready to take the vaccine like yesterday and that i'm in that category but i'm gonna have to wait um the other 40 and so for those of you who work with communities that might might be more skeptical the other 40 are not at no they are at not first in other words their skepticism is i i'm i kind of want to watch a while so that's a group a community that we can work with right because that hesitancy is something that that's our neighbors needing to know that you took it that's you know that's if it's faith leaders and and stakeholders and and influencers as the kids call it getting out there so that um so we may begin we may have a vaccine uh supply issue uh but hopefully that can get cured uh relatively soon the second is of course allocation we're all in different allocation groups and i think you're seeing some creativity on the local and state level to make that a little bit more flexible so that vaccine doesn't go to waste but we also have to make it fair so the more flexible it becomes the less fair it may become so one of the reasons why we have these stringent lines about group a and group a 1a and 2a and 3a is just because as a society we've made a decision that health care workers um and then you know uh essential workers and people over a certain age so um the third is distribution and that's where uh you know that's what we call the last mile that was really rough i would say in the first month i think that is also getting better you're starting to hear both of smaller places opening up and then the large facilities like gillette disneyland i heard and other places so we we just need to throw everything at the wall because once uh once we get to larger allocation um uh groupings lots of people are gonna show up i you know the system will not be perfect uh but i think we're starting we're seeing the trajectory that someone like me looks for which is the exponential growth and then the fourth is is essentially the kind of society we may live in and people may feel uncomfortable with but we are going to have to have some verification system uh in the future i don't know what that future looks like and what that verification is but in terms of airline travel you might see private businesses concerts movie theaters begin to have requirements for vaccination um absent a um extenuating circumstance uh uh and i think that's what society looks like you know to get out of this um so i'm just gonna end with this to how to think about the next six months um is uh as a split screen uh the the horror of the numbers that we are seeing and they're going to get worse uh uh and inexcusable as we know but also new leadership that is gonna is going to mandate certain things uh but we we will hit six seven eight thousand dead a day that's just unfortunately i don't see any stopping that uh in the foreseeable future on the other side though is hope right is that this this thing is starting to move and what you're going to see in the binding plan tonight is obviously focused on helping our communities and financial stresses uh so many are under uh but also you know what i would call a lot of um basically a lot of uh gas in the tank it's just gonna it's going to be a lot of resources to deliver to state and localities so that they can pay for uh uh increased capacity you're not going to see a federal takeover of this so i went on too long but that's sort of the the net the tectonic plates that we see going on uh uh not as bad as a lot of the news stories certainly not where we want to be so thank you well thank you and we are so grateful to have both of you with us uh we have gotten a lot of questions from constituents ahead of tonight's town hall and so we're going to try and get to as many as we can but i'll start with some that we hear most frequently and dr saya you've already touched on this a little bit but we have been hearing a lot of concern about how quickly these vaccines were developed and approved you know a matter of months when they typically take years could you explain the steps that pfizer and modernity would have to go through to get this authorization for emergency use and how these are different from other vaccines we are familiar with and why we can still be confident they are safe and just to add a little bit more to that if there are any differences between these two vaccines and if people have a choice uh should they be trying to get one versus the other great questions and let me see if i can sort them out the the science behind the two vaccines let me start by saying the physical and the modern vaccines are very very similar and they're based on a very similar scientific background and basis this science is pretty new science but not completely novel science that was developed between 2008 and 2012 related to immune therapy and therapy related to mainly oncology and cancer and how to be to go to the next phase of caring for cancer patients particularly cancers that are very very difficult and we did not have treatments for them in the past they are based on a messenger rna which is basically a piece of code that carry with it with it information to develop a certain protein and to say it simply it is the recipe not the cake so the messenger rna basically has the recipe with it not the cake and it has the recipe to teach our body how to create the immune response the defense if and when we are exposed to the virus in the future the the messenger rna is a small length of code covered with a protein and that's the reason why it's so fragile and it needs to be stored and transported very cold because under a normal environment and without being gently handled it will break apart and it will not be very effective and that's why those vaccines when they're constituted and they're warmed and they're ready to be delivered they're only good for a few hours one long slightly longer than the other one developing the vaccine was very methodical very appropriate went through all the steps that a normal process will take in years but it was shortened over a short time but all the steps were done in parallel versus in normal circumstances we do them in sequence so we do the first step then we evaluate then we write papers on it then we do the next step then we get more funding and evaluate and write papers on it scientific papers then we do on and on and on the funding for this as we all know was all put ahead and the evaluations were happening in parallel as we were developing the actual code this code has been tested by tens of thousands of people humans for efficacy and for safety and therefore we know one the process is safe and it is reliable two the outcome is safe and is reliable i.e efficacious and it is about 95 97 percent uh protecting people who have been vaccinated by both doses one to two weeks after the second dose from getting covet infected so it is it is pretty effective and the uh the the amount of side effects is very minimal and it's mostly mild the vast majority of side effects if not the whole totality of side effect is mostly mind which is local pain fever muscle aches all will go away after a few days i feel personally very comfortable with the science after reading and investigating the science i feel very comfortable in advocating for the vaccine with our own staff our own communities my own family and i encourage everybody out there to trust that this vaccine will work and will protect us and our loved ones from getting um the infection from getting covered and hopefully eventually will protect the whole nation because um you know the the alternative is is is not very pretty uh without the vaccine if this continues the only way we're going to get out of this is if enough people get the infection and that's eighty percent of the population gets the infection and if you do the math one to two percent death uh that's a couple of million people dying from this that's not a pretty picture no and you know one of the questions that we have received is for those who have an underlying condition or an allergy to other vaccines is it safe for them to get this vaccine are there people who should not get it that's a great uh great question there is no contraindication to this from an allergy's point of view the requirement is that uh particularly for people who have allergies that they were are observed for 15 to 20 minutes for 15 to 30 minutes particularly after the second dose uh usually if you have any reaction it's more likely that it's going to happen after the second nose but the recommendation is that they are observed after both doses each of the doses uh for if it's they're going to have an allergic severe allergic reaction it's going to happen pretty quickly and for those folks that have pretty a severe pre-existing condition or severe allergies to other vaccines they should probably get vaccinated in a clinic or in a healthcare environment where an intervention can take place if they have a reaction for the general public um the likelihood of any of that happening is almost zero and how what do we know about how long immunity will last are we going to need the annual booster like we have now for a typical flu vaccine that's a great question the answer is we don't know and right now we're confident that we have that this vaccine will provide immunity to the virus as we know it today and all the variants that we know of today as we all know viruses mutate and the reason we need another flu vaccine every year is because although we developed immunity for last year's virus this year or next year's virus has changed and it still became a new entity to our body and therefore we need to prep the body with a vaccine for the new form or the form of the new virus and that's why we need additional vaccinations for the flu the question you need is of two part will our immunity last how long does our immunity last and we don't know the answer to this and the second piece is will this virus mutate that will require a different vaccine or a slightly different vaccine downstream to prep ourselves for the new form of the virus we don't know the answer to those two questions well thank you for for all of that and juliette i want to ask you everyone is so grateful to see frontline medical workers nurses doctors those working in nursing homes and assisted living getting vaccinated and we know that there is hesitancy and we need to address that but many folks just want to know when they are going to be eligible can you walk us through why it's important to prioritize certain groups and what can we expect going forward as more vaccines hopefully get approval yes so this is a great question and and i want to say there's no right answer this is probably one of the most ethically logistically you know every every the hard issue comes up with allocation because the the especially in a nation like ours that is suffering so badly do you just want to stop stop the you know people from dying and you know what category that is well that seems obvious but then you think okay but we gotta get society moving again as well so then we're gonna we're gonna look to other pools so basically you're gonna see a big compromise but no one disagrees with number one is medical health uh workers there's going to be debates about who who falls into that we should don't get as i said before you don't get hung up on hearing that five people got it i mean we're talking in magnitudes of millions at this stage so so uh that's going to be that is your first category the the second category is critical there's variations on that but let's just i'm going to just cut to the chase which is critical or essential workers with um uh um uh over uh uh and i think the first grouping doctor chris is a 75 year old so you're going to do a combination of i want to stop bad things i want to stop the death rate which is essentially uh older people plus i want to get society moving again and it depends on which state who you're defining in the uh essential worker pool but it is if people who satisfy the supply chain satisfy critical infrastructure i forgot to say something uh on the first round on the first allocation which is of course uh a residence of long-term elderly care because just what we saw was the virus just you know basically killing large swaths of that population uh then to think of the vaccination program as a rolling recovery and as we pick up speed it's like a tidal wave things will just move faster and then we get to general population uh after uh after some age distinction so we're gonna we're basically after critical infrastructure it is then gonna be age focused and then general population for 55 and under and how states are going to do general population we don't know yet and the binding uh team may have the neck their next thoughts uh or new thoughts on that so that's how it's going to look my what i'm looking at is is is how fast are new vaccines going to satisfy this growing demand because we don't have the hesitancy that we worried about originally uh we think moderna and pfizer will last us about a hundred million between the two of them will last through april so the hope is you can get johnson and johnson online although there has been some news reports that they're a little delayed i don't want people to worry no one's changing their trajectory much but you'll you'll hear about little gaps in timing so that's how it's it's going to work and you should keep income basically notification should be the congresswoman's office will certainly hear uh when new allocations are opening up and new places are opening up so many of you that may have been notified and then your local health care facility or primary care physician or or looking online the cambridge i live in cambridge the cambridge nightly covid report is phenomenal i am sure other towns uh in the district are doing it as well and it gives you a sense of how things are going there as well so uh so the local uh the local news will give you a sense of that and how do you see the vaccine being distributed when it is available to the general population i know we are watching uh gillette open up as a mass distribution site do you see that we will have a combination of at your doctor's office at a cvs or walgreens and some of these bigger sites is that what you anticipate yes i do so so uh so the big site and some of them are drive through so and you're and and i'll tell you something because i look at this nationally the states you would least expect to be great are sort of doing well which is frustrating because they often were horrible or you know horrible unmasking and stuff but arizona seems to be doing well uh and some other states uh i'm glad for them we need to be doing better where massachusetts is about in the middle which we shouldn't be just given who we are and the resources we have so there will be the bigger sites red sox gillette uh uh some of the big fall festivals and uh uh our places the big e will open up uh but then remember with the new vaccines that don't that may not require the specialized storage uh you'll start to see uh a much more nimble vaccination process and i think eventually getting the private sector and other entities involved i i agree i think it's going to be all hands on deck and i believe that we need to roll out the process a little faster and make sure to get the vaccine in the hands of the professionals so we can deliver it to to the general public and when we are able to get people their vaccines tell us a little bit about how important is it do people need to continue to adhere to the recommendations about social distancing and wearing masks or once you have the vaccine can you no longer carry the virus i think for the foreseeable future the right thing to do is to maintain the etiquettes that we learned over the last year of hand sanitizing and social distancing and wearing masks again for the foreseeable future i truly believe that eventually things will improve and will be in a different place remember you don't know who the next person is and you don't know how sick they are or not and you know the fact that somebody is vaccinated they're not 100 immune they are 95 96 immune it is important at least for the foreseeable future until we have enough spread of the vaccine and data and science behind it that's appropriately analyzed by public health officials that this will continue the other piece also the etiquettes of the social distancing and and washing hands is very important because there's a whole lot of other diseases out there than covet that we will benefit from from from uh continue doing these things anyways that is a good point i have noticed that i have not had a single cold yeah because of the masking and all the and all the precautions you know speaking of things that are highly contagious uh like this virus so is disinformation and i wondered if you can tell us are there some common false claims that are being made that we should be wary of and and try to combat yes i monitor the oh go ahead sorry go ahead juliet i was going to speak about the science and you know etc yeah go you do that and i'll talk about the distribution you go first okay so um the the false claim people and i've heard rumors which are completely false that the the virus will go into somebody's dna and they will change their dna make it that that is absolutely false the the messenger rna does not get into the nucleus which is the part of the cell where the dna is stored all this the whole process uh happens outside the nucleus it's called the area called cytoplasm where this the this this code is processed and develops a protein and the protein will help our own body develop the appropriate immune response if and when the virus if we're exposed to the virus so there is no effect on the dna the messenger rna does not get into the area where the dna is in the body it does not change the things the way that the cells behave and it is it is pretty much safe it is basically as i said before it is the recipe not the cake and it is the recipe that she teaches our body how to respond when we are exposed to the virus juliet yes this is exactly right so this this information is uh coming from foreign enemies who are uh catering to the divisions in our own society about vaccination the divisions that we have uh generally and they go both to the science and then to the information about the uh uh about whether you're vaccinated enough or not so sort of a health security information uh you know what i say is however you get your news uh if you feel it's re reliable stick with that news i will uh i'm gonna uh i'll say moderna gets all the hometown love but i'm also going to give hometown love to uh boston globe's stat news s-t-a-t news it's free um it's only online though the boston globe a couple years ago created its own health bio division and now it is it is a national go-to source uh and uh and if you get a chance if you're able to get online that's where i get all my information it's sort of the economist for the pandemic uh the other place to go uh for monitoring vaccination uh the reality versus the uh not reality the cdc is fine but actually bloomberg if you look at bloomberg online again none of this is um it moves so fast that it's sort of online charting it has a daily tracker which i find very very reliable great well i think we have a few minutes for some questions from the queue um we have gus from framingham who has a question gus you should be uh congress hi congresswoman um gus from framingham i wanted to thank you for oh hello i just was saying hello gus thanks for joining us oh hi congressman thank you for congresswoman thank you for holding this call um first i wanted to thank you and your staff for helping with the casework issue this fall they were super responsive and got back to me and solved the issue within a matter of days so thank you for that i also i had my first dose of the vaccine last week and yeah right with what the doctor said i didn't have any bad side effects or anything um so just have to wait for for the next dose but my question is and they just talked about misinformation i think one of the biggest issues i've had especially with some of the women that i supervise is they're concerned about its impacts on pregnancy or if they were pregnant and so i know the doctor mentioned that his daughter is pregnant and he recommended that she get it so if he could expand on why he feels comfortable with that or any disinformation that he's seeing with that so that when we're talking to people who bring up that specific concern we have some better answers absolutely and and uh thank you for asking the question um we don't have enough science to definitively give an answer one way or another but i can tell you getting the covet vaccine we know for from for somebody that's pregnant is not very good for the mother or the fetus we know that because we've had pregnant women get go with vaccine and the potential complications there are high we also know that some of the some of the volunteers that got tested with both uh moderna and pfizer vaccine got pregnant they were not pregnant when they got the vaccine but got pregnant at some point and a few of them got pregnant actually between the first and the second dose and it was proven to be safe so with this little anecdotic information when i personally weigh the pros and cons and there is a lot of data out there i would encourage uh people to go online and get information and to the cdc has a very good review uh regarding expecting mothers and and covet and also the the vaccine there is no true 100 recommendation right now to say they should be vaccinated or not and the recommendation is to speak with your obstetrician but reviewing the data and speaking with our staff and many of them are well-known obstetricians a couple of them were just named top of obstetricians by the boston magazine in the last week or two the recommendation and i research it not only for our staff in the community but for my own family is to get vaccinated i hope that answers your question great next we have elaine from wall sam elaine you should be unmuted hi um my question is with the new [Music] more self-stable vaccines that are coming out like from johnson and johnson are they as effective as the vaccines coming out from moderna that's a great question we anticipate that that vaccine is as effective otherwise it's not going to get the approval to be given to the to the public needs to be one safe and too effective um still reviewing the data on this and the science and i'm sure over the next month or two there'll be a lot more data and science coming out but so far uh it is very promising great next up we have a seraphino on the line you know you should be unmuted hey good evening good evening sir seraphina yes yes can you get you can go ahead with your question thank you oh i'm sorry i'm confused um i have an autoimmune disease and i've had it for over i've probably said about 30 years now which was unexpected but uh i've been dealing with the cdc a lot and trying to take uh different um medications um trying all different types of chemotherapy to control it to control my uh immune system because my immune system is out of control so um are you saying that it's okay for people with uh serious autoimmune disorders or like lupus and all that kind of stuff mine happens to be myositis it's okay for them to take the vaccine that's a that's a great question i can tell you so far the indication and the science and the evidence is that it is safe but i would encourage you to speak with your own immunologist who really knows your situation specifically and can guide you specifically regarding what you need to do with with with your case with your situation but so far the data and the evidence is that it is safe even for folks that have autoimmune diseases okay thank you so much you're welcome thank you next up charles from sudbury has a question charles you're unmuted thank you and i appreciate the opportunity of this evening it's terrific um president-elect biden has advocated one dose that holds back that second dose that people are uh waiting for i guess they're looking to um and the question is the accuracy of of that process will if someone has to wait three months i don't know what the time frame of course would be three months purely as an example will the uh the efficacy be the same will we now be at 95 or um will that booster shots not really have the same benefit that's a great question and in in both physical and modern vaccine the first dose alone will give people somewhere between 80 and 85 percent immunity and the second dose will bring that up to 95 plus percent so 85 is pretty good uh but it's not ideal and um you know the question is uh do you give more people one dose or uh hopefully we have enough vaccine to give everybody two doses and get them to 95 plus percent um and this is this goes back uh to juliet's initial introduction uh you know production and availability and etc on the other hand also it is important we don't we can't we don't know how many people are going to step up and get the vaccine too i hope everybody does yeah i do too i really um i can't you know i i cannot uh describe enough from the non-medical perspective as we as i said this ruling recovery uh how different things will be not just economically but our frustration levels our our sense of unease everything that we're feeling as we begin to open up i wanna just i wanna say one thing about um about the one dose debate a lot of you may have followed you know the single dosage verse uh debate earlier and i just want i want to clarify because there was some confusion i think uh for a non-medical person i was confused and i consider myself an expert so i got some clarity there was a proposal on the table that the fda shot down uh biden may try it again which was to basically only do the one shot and just get as many people 65 or 70 percent immunized because we knew the first shot went very far that that's not an illegitimate proposal it because we're all desperate to get some immunity but it wasn't what the fda had approved so the so that was pretty controversial and i think split a lot of the medical community what you're hearing biden say is different the biden proposal is if we can make consistent the supply chain so that we know that another 20 doses are coming one week from now why would we hold 10 doses half of 20 doses back uh if we know another 20 are coming so that those are differences so so the the biden um uh folks are are not proposing single dose for a two dose tested vaccine and and i think that's a very important clarity in here the approval is for two doses and the testing for efficacy is for two doses so and i agree if the supply chain is reliable that's the direction we need to go we need to go i agree i thought i heard that it was 50 uh effective for the first error that's not 75 percent no it is actually over 80 percent four the first shot yeah after first for the first shot yes and that's both true for both pfizer and madonna for both for both yes wow okay that's good news yes thank you so much charles i think we have time for just one more question from the queue and we have marilyn from melrose hi thank you so much uh i have an underlying condition and i'm over 75. i just want to know do i need some sort of proof of what my the condition is i have some scarring in my lungs so that's what i was wondering yeah uh it is safe in your situation uh

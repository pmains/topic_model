yes the will report the motion motion to instruct conferees on HR 4348 offered by mr. mckinley of west virginia mr. mckinley of west virginia moves that pop managers on the part of the house at the conference on the disagreeing votes of the two houses on the senate amendment to the bill HR 4348 be instructed to insist on the provisions contained in title 5 of the House bill relating to coal combustion residuals pursuant to Clause 7 of rule 22 the gentleman from West Virginia mr. McKinley and the gentleman from California mr. Waxman each will control 30 minutes the chair recognizes the gentleman from West Virginia Mr Speaker I yield myself us seven minutes gentleman is recognized for seven minutes Thank You mr. speaker concrete concrete is a fundamental element of roads bridges and infrastructure projects an important element of concrete is coal ash this is now the fourth time the house is reaffirmed and reaffirmed his support for the beneficial use of recycling coal ash currently the conference committee on HR 4348 is deep in productive negotiations and strong bipartisan compromises have occurred relative to the co s provision my intent today is to urge the conferees to continue this bipartisan negotiations and retain this important cost-saving provision in the final bill we're not here to rehash the same ideologically motivated arguments we have heard from the extremists simply put we are here to help put people back to work to give American businesses certainty and to protect the health and environment of our families and friends for those who say coal ass is irrelevant to roads and bridges they couldn't be further from the truth concrete suppliers have been incorporating coal ash into concrete mixtures since the construction of the Hoover Dam over 80 years ago without Co ash the cost of construction projects would increase by one hundred billion dollars according to American Road and transportation Builders Association thereby reducing the amount of monies available for roads and bridges and infrastructure in America keep in mind less construction results in fewer jobs by retaining this bipartisan section of the highway bill Congress will be also protecting the 316 thousand jobs that are at stake in the recycling of fly ash jobs involving concrete block brick drywall ceramic tile bowling balls and even in the cosmetics industry for those who've been asking where the jobs bills are this is a jobs bill among the supporters of this language are the Chamber of Commerce the National Association of Manufacturers the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers the United Mine Workers the United transportation Union the road in the American Road and transportation Builders Association the International Brotherhood of boiler makers and the afl-cio Building and Construction Trades consider these quotes mr. speaker removing coal ash from the supply chain would increase the price of concrete by an average of ten percent according to the National Association of Homebuilders according to the National Association of Manufacturers co s contributes six to eleven billion dollars annually to the United States economy through revenues of sale for beneficial use avoided cost of disposal and savings from use of sustainable building materials Mr Speaker currently 60 million tons of fly ash is recycled annually according to his own data Co ass replaces between fifteen and thirty percent of the Portland cement used in concrete the EPA has noted that the use of CO as in concrete has resulted the savings as much as 25 million tons at greenhouse gas emissions annually and as much as 54 million barrels of oil the EPA has indicated the annual financial benefits of using coal ash as a substitute for portland cement contributes nearly 5 billion dollars in energy savings 41 billion dollars in water savings 240 million dollars in emission reductions and nearly 18 billion dollars in non greenhouse gases related pollution the EPA itself states that coal ash leads to better roads in two studies one in 93 and 2000 both under the Clinton administration's EPA found that Co s did not warrant the regulations being pushed by the Obama administration in 2005 the EPA the Federal Highway Administration and the Department of Energy collaborated with the private sector to craft guidance on the appropriate uses and benefits of coal ash and highway construction Mr Speaker I reserve the balance of my time gentleman reserves the gentleman California Speaker I yield myself five minutes gentleman is recognized for five minutes reauthorizing the federal Surface Transportation programs is important for communities across the country it will help revitalize our transportation infrastructure and will create jobs the transportation conference committee must work together to finalize a conference report as soon as possible to get people back to work the Senate worked on a bipartisan manner developed a strong bill that will create jobs and and help the economy they focused on the core issues ignoring the temptation to attach side issues to this important legislation unfortunately the transportation bill is now being jeopardized by extraneous and anti environmental provisions being pushed by Republicans in the House instead of working to come to agreement on important transportation policy provisions House Republicans are holding the bill hostage for a legislative earmark for the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline provisions a steamroll environmental review of projects and the McKinley coal ash bill that eliminates existing authority to protect human health in the environment from the risks posed by unsafe disposal of coal ash this motion to instruct is the latest effort to push these positions it would instruct the transportation conferees to insist on the McKinley coal ash bill in the transportation bill but the McKinley coal ash proposal is extraneous if we do nothing on the transportation bill to address coal ash disposal then coal ash will continue to be available for use in concrete for transportation projects just as it is today current federal regulations do not restrict the use of coal ash in concrete and counter to what you may hear today EPA has not proposed to regulate such beneficial reuses although some may suggest that recycling of coal ash will decrease because of the stigma experience has shown that when waste materials are regulated there's EPA is proposed to do for coal ash the race of recycling and reuse increases this has happened with other regulated wastes it happened with coal ash in Wisconsin which has a robust regulatory scheme there's a very simple reason for this disposal in safe pits is inexpensive but environmentally dangerous when reasonable environmental safeguards are put in place the cost of disposal will increase that makes alternatives like using coal ash in concrete more attractive the coal ash legislation that this motion seeks to include will not ensure the safe disposal of coal ash it will not prevent coal ash impoundments from catastrophic ly failing it will not pretend protect against significant environmental and economic damage and it will not prevent contamination of public drinking water systems the McKinley coal ash bill will not stop another spill like we saw in Kingston air pollution like we've seen in Gambrills Maryland or water pollution like we have seen nationwide what this coal ash proposal will do is stop the transportation conference from succeeding this motion to instruct attempts to lock the house conferees into a position that the Senate will only reject and it will doom the transportation conference committee to failure we can retreat to intractable positions on extraneous issues making a transportation bill difficult if not impossible to pass particularly in the time frame that we have set out for us or we can work together in the time we have to produce a transportation that will be signed by the president and will keep our economy on the mend a vote for this motion is a vote against completing the transportation conference I do urge all members to say yes to transportation and vote no on this position I an honest I reserve the balance of my time gentleman reserves the gentleman from West Virginia is recognized Mr Speaker I yield three minutes of my colleague from Illinois mr. Shimkus gentleman Illinois is recognized for three minutes without objection so ordered Thank You mr. speaker it's great to be down here and this is why this provision of this bill is we pertinent to the highway bill here it is flex Creek fly ash lighter more durable I got two documents I brought down to the floor the second one reads in the acknowledgments this document was prepared by the US EPA in cooperation with the following agencies and associations Department of Energy Federal Highway Administration American coal ash Association and you and the utility solid waste activities group well what's interesting about these two books one published in june 2003 the other one published in 2005 is they go through all the great uses of fly ash in construction and i'd like to read just a few of those here's one fly ash improves workability for pavement of concrete remember do t book epa-approved do he approved the next one has fly ash concrete is used in severe exposure applications such as decks and peers of tampa bay's Sunshine Skyway Bridge nice photo here beautiful bridge so this is stuff this is not new this is reaffirming what the construction industry has been doing for decades and actually in this other pamphlet i'll talk about even of greater use here's another one fly ash concrete finishing again this is a federal highway administration book Department of Energy book sponsored by the US EPA all saying good things about fly ash in road construction full death reclamation of a bituminous road another one flowable fill used in utility trench applications all dealing with fly ash fly ash and structural fills and embankment nice photo of them using that in the construction sector also the stable is a soil stabilization to improve soil strength all using fly app applications we have a highway bill and that's why this provision is very very important because if the EP has EPA has its way and a label fly-ass has toxic guess what no more flex concrete no more building of buildings that have fly ash applications this this is one of my favorite ones use of ash and construction through the ages the ancient time the Romans added volcanic ash to concrete to strengthen structures such as a Roman pantheon and the Colosseum both of which still stand today the first major use of coal fly ash and concrete in the United States occurred in 1942 to repair a tunnel spillway at the Hoover Dam one of the most impressive concrete structures in in the country is hungry horse damn near Glacier National Park in Montana was constructed from nineteen forty eight to nineteen fifty two with concrete containing you guessed it fly ash we're in Washington DC what are the great things we see here in Washington I asked for different 30 seconds additional journals recognized from do in Washington see both the metropolitan area subway system named as metro and the new ronald reagan building an international trade center were built by you guessed it fly ash and concrete other significant structures you'd like coal fly ash is concrete including the Big Dig in Boston and decks and peers of the Tampa Bay's Sunshine Skyway Bridge that's why this is applicable to the highway bill I commend my colleague and I yield back the balance of my time the gentleman's time has expired the gentleman California is recognized to speaker at this time I'd like to yield five minutes to the gentleman from Illinois the ranking member of the energy subcommittee mr. rush zone Romelu noise recognized for five minutes I want to thank the ranking member and the Energy and Commerce Committee and let him know how much I appreciate not only his leadership on other issues but particularly his leadership on this issue here Mr Speaker I stand here astound and amaze and the muse at the remarks of the past speaker you know he wants the American people to be convinced that fly ash is as healthy to them as it as it can be and that they should in fact maybe go out and go to a local drugstores and ask for a model of Flyers so they can sprinkle it over their dental dinner meal as they would maybe salad dressing I don't think that the American people would be pleased with that Mr Speaker I stand in strong opposition to this motion to instruct at a time when we are facing historic levels of joblessness in communities around the country in the african-american communities and other minority communities Republicans are playing chicken with the transportation bill which is intended to provide American jobs and repair our aging economy is not to further the contamination of the water supplies their supplies in our most vulnerable communities so why don't we stop the charade when we stop the asthmatic assault on the most vulnerable segments the most vulnerable communities in our nation this motion to instruct contains an Italy and dangerous provision that will only allow more imposing more disease and more death from one of our nation's biggest waste products the knitting cancerous coal ash of that wood that's under discussion today whole dash i want to remind you is a waste left on one after thousands of tons of coal burned and coal-fired power plants and is Layton from top to bottom with toxins such as mercury arsenic cadmium chromium and led leaves all the pollutants then causes cancer that causes audion disease breathing problems neurological damage developmental problems and even the final problem which is death mr. speaker title 5 of the HR 4348 yields companies and unprecedented ability to pollute the resource since conservation and and residues covering the unprecedented ability to pollute under the resources conservation and Recovery Act even though the EPA Environmental Protection Agency found some coal ash ponds that they pose a 150 risk of cancer related to residence drinking arsenic contaminated water oh is that a to thousand times the EPA's regulatory gold dangerous coal ash disposal affects thousands of us communities but research informs us that income and race remains strong predictors of the amount of pollutions that these Americans face the majority of coal ash is disposed and grossly inadequate dump sites which are primarily located in low-income communities just four more proportionally impacting those who are at least equipped to respond to water contamination and the onslaught of nothing tough tough tough industrial in the air miss especially low-income citizens are more likely to allow want groundwater supplies and less likely to have access to medical insurance and healthcare today at one more minute yields the gentleman additional minute gentleman is recognized for one more minute mr. speaker title 5 23 HR 4348 fails to protect communities and their drinking water from Johnson coal ash or from another massive spill like the disaster that occurred in Kingston Tennessee in 08 2008 mr. speaker let me conclude by saying that my state alone produces 4.4 million tons of coal ash annually and at least 19 coal ash dump sites have contaminated local water supplies additionally each and every day a steam fired steam ship the SS SS badger numbs 4 tons of coal ash into Lake Michigan uh my beloved city of Chicago's primary water supply system orange all of my colleagues to vote against this motion to me to motion to instruct and I yield back the math gentleman from West Virginia is recognized Mr Speaker I yield two minutes to my colleague from Pennsylvania mr. Holden gentlemen pencil

Mr President I want to begin this morning by congratulating the South Dakota State University football team on an incredible win Saturday in Brookings South Dakota I happen to be on hand for for this a great event thanks to their great performance in Saturn's game which included five scores in their first five possessions the jackrabbits are headed to the FCS national championship for the second time in three seasons Saturday's win is the latest in a banner season for the Jacks who have gone 13-1 and won the Missouri's Valley Conference to become the number one seed in the FCS playoffs of course Saturday's game would not have been possible without the men and women who were to clear the roads around Brookings and the volunteers and staff who cleared the field and the seats after a major snowstorm last week when the game got underway temperatures were in the single digits not including the wind chill when you add in the wind chill it was well below zero I'm grateful for the hard work of all the staff who made it possible which Allowed by the way literally thousands of people thousands of Jax fans like me to be there to cheer on our team and remarkably in spite of the conditions it was a great crowd on hand to see this historic win Mr President I'm looking forward to rooting for the Jacks next month when they take on the North Dakota State University bison in the championship game in Frisco Texas where hopefully it will be a little warmer than nine degrees Mr President December 22nd will Mark the fifth anniversary of the signing of the tax cuts and jobs Act it's been five years since Republicans reformed the tax code to allow Americans to keep more of their hard-earned money five years since we modernized the tax code to encourage businesses to invest in America and create good paying jobs here after five years since our economy started to rebound after years of stagnant wages and growth Mr President Republicans know that government doesn't create jobs and that Washington can't legislate Prosperity but government can certainly get in the way of prosperity and before tax reform too often our tax code was getting in the way it was taking too much money from Americans paychecks it was making it difficult for businesses large and small to create jobs increase wages and grow and it contained perverse incentives for companies to park profits abroad and avoid manufacturing things here in the United States Mr President Republicans knew things needed to change and so we set to work to reform our tax code to put more money in American families pockets and to help grow our economy we lowered tax rates across the board and simplify the tax code that so that hard-working Americans would pay less in taxes and spend less time filling them out their forms out every April we lowered tax rates for owners of small and medium-sized businesses farms and ranches and made it easier for them to recover the cost of investing in their businesses which in turn freed up cash for them to invest in their operations and their workers we lowered our nation's sky-high corporate tax rate which prior to the tax cuts and jobs Act was the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world to make American businesses more competitive in the global economy and Empower them to invest in wages and benefits for the workers and we modernized our International tax systems so that American businesses would no longer be operating at a disadvantage next to their foreign counterparts and Mr President it worked it worked in the wake of the tax cuts and job act at jobs act wages and incomes for American workers grew unemployment fell to a 50-year low the poverty rate fell to the lowest level ever recorded African-Americans and Hispanic Americans saw record low rates of poverty and unemployment the income gap narrowed business investment increased companies created new jobs and they invested in their employees and they opened new opportunities for American workers by moving production and capital into the United States tax reform also spelled an end to the wave of companies moving their headquarters out of the United States prior to tax reform there was a growing trend of corporate inversions which is tax speak for companies picking up and moving their legal headquarters offshore and that was due to our dysfunctional tax code since tax reform there hasn't been a single U.S corporate inversion let me repeat that Mr President since tax reform there hasn't been a single U.S corporate inversion which means more jobs and opportunities for workers here at home and Mr President contrary to claims that tax reform mostly benefited the wealthy it was actually lower and middle income Americans who saw the greatest benefits in fact the top one percent of taxpayers are paying a greater share of taxes today than they were before tax reform and I haven't even mentioned the fact that tax reform has helped result in record high revenues for the federal government as president fortunately we were not able to make all the tax reform the tax cuts and jobs act permanent and some Provisions have already begun to expire one important pro-growth provision on its way to phase out is bonus depreciation manufacturers farmers and ranchers and several other Industries have relied on the tax cuts and jobs act acts bonus depreciation provision which allows them to immediately deduct the full cost of investment in short-term assets such as machinery and equipment but bonus depreciation will soon begin to phase down make a new investment in productive equipment a more expensive proposition for businesses of all sizes extending the bonus depreciation provision or better yet making it permanent would not only provide certainty to American businesses it would create tens of thousands of new jobs increase wages and grow our economy by making it easier for businesses to invest and expand and it would have even more of an impact in today's high inflation environment where investment dollars are going a lot less far than they used to in addition under the tax cuts and jobs act this year businesses lost their ability to fully expense research and development costs in the year they incur them full r d expensing is is beneficial to many businesses but it's especially important for manufacturers and for High-Tech Industries where Cutting Edge research and development is critical for Innovation and continued leadership in these fields and for the sake of American workers in American industry we should restore full r d expensing Mr President at the end of 2025 many of the lower tax rates for working families and small businesses will expire middle-income families who received a tax cut the year following tax reform will see a tax hike in 2026 if middle income tax cuts are not extended or made permanent also at the end of 2025 The increased death tax exemption level is set to expire leaving more Family Farms and small businesses subject to this punitive tax I've seen the consequences of the death tax when a family has to sell their Farm Ranch or small business because they don't have enough cash to pay this massive tax on their loved ones life's work and I hope that we will not only extend The increased death tax exemption level but will permanently eliminate this unfair tax Mr President tax reform worked it worked for American families it worked for farmers and Ranchers and it worked for American businesses allowing key elements of tax reform to expire would reduce opportunity and raise taxes for hard-working Americans at a time when their pocketbooks are already strained thanks to the historic inflation crisis that Democrats have helped to create and I hope that my colleagues across the aisle will recognize this and work with Republicans to permanently extend the expiring provisions of the tax cuts and jobs act and continue efforts to make the tax code simpler fairer and more competitive the president likes to talk about giving families quote a little breathing room end quote there's no better way to give families breathing room than by allowing them to keep more of their hard-earned money and I hope the president will take an honest look at the success of the tax cuts and jobs act and come out in support of making these pro-growth policies permanent I'm disappointed that my Democrat colleagues recently chose to forego the chance to extend full r d expensing and 100 percent bonus depreciation in the year-end funding bill extending these should be a no-brainer and democrats should not be holding these essential business credits hostage to a partisan agenda Mr President tax reform helped create an economic environment that encouraged growth and set the American people up for New Opportunities higher wages and a more secure future it's time to build on these successes and extend the benefits of the tax cuts and jobs Act for the long term Mr President I yield floor

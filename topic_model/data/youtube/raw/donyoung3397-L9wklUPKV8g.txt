well I'd like to see the government be more responsive and less aggressive as far as it being punitive to Alaskan people what's occurring in Alaska across this nation is wrong the idea in agency can come in and enforce regulatory law upon an individual or a municipality is not to what I believe this nation really needs or in fact is is constitutional and that's happening in Fairbanks is having an anchorage this happen to catch can this happen in Juneau it's happening around in state everywhere we turn around we have either the EPA the Corps of Engineers the Park Service or the fish and wildlife or some agency individual going in and say I'm the government you better do as I tell you to do what we're going to take and punish you that's not the government I know and I'd like to see that change and Congress is the only one who can change it that's from the very frankly changing the regulatory lost principle and actually cutting back the money and I'm going to try to do that and every time I'm there I'm trying to do and I've been somewhat successful but I'm going to need the support of the people i want to need the support of the state i want to need the support of all the other congressmen and that's what I'm working on

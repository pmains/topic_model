Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition
to the Republican’s ongoing plans to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Senate leadership unveiled their plan this
morning, and plans a vote as soon as next week. This bill was drafted in secrecy and will have
massive consequences for the health care of every American and affect more than 1/6 of
our economy. Yet it was written behind closed doors with
absolutely zero bipartisan input. I’ve heard from more constituents on this
issue than any other – more than 5,000 letters, emails, and telephone calls. People like the cancer survivor in Lake Bluff
who is worried whether she would be unable to find affordable insurance without the ACA’s
pre-existing condition protections. Or my constituent in Grayslake who says he
could only start his business because of the individual coverage he bought on the exchange. I urge my colleagues to listen to the great
majority of the American people. It’s time to end this ill-considered charade
to repeal Obamacare and work together in a bipartisan way to improve our health care
system for every American.

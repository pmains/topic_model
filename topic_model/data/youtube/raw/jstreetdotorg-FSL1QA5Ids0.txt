thank you Alex I'm humbled by your kind words of introduction maybe I should retire now in the pic of the career of my life but there is work to do as I look around the room I am pleased to see how many of j street's leaders and stuff i have actually met before I suppose I shouldn't be surprised as I know I'm in a room of full lovers of Israel champions of peace and justice so thank you jeremy and thank you j street I'm delighted to be here with you tonight for your conference about making history I hope that I can offer some insight from my own story and experience my family narrative is a typical for our own town of Johann my mother and my father emigrated from Morocco mom cleaned houses in morning schools in afternoon dad worked at the local tech steel planet I'm the youngest of nine children that passed away when I was in my early twenties to an outsider my life may seem a life of hardship maybe even poverty but I never felt poor indeed I was fortunate to be the son of masuda and le ow they don't make parents like this anymore today and I was fortunate to be born into the Israeli society that existed in the nineteen seventy back then Israel may have been poorer in resources but it was richer in solidarity and in social cohesion one of the most important things my life had taught me is that no matter what happens we must never let obstacles however large prevent us from pursuing a better future this lesson is true at the boat the personal and the national levels but made my community so rich what made us so strong were the values of which we were raised the strong sense that we were all in it together and that if we help each other out we will come out ahead our values and our tradition taught us that when we saw problem we needed to choose action over ambivalence and hope over despair in your ham we have battled corruption and official neglect often scenes in Israeli periphery and I'm proud to say that we have recently succeeded in living behind our status as a development town and are on our way towards official recognition as a full-fledged City such lessons of overcoming challenges must also apply at the national level Israel today faces many challenges reaching an agreement with the Palestinians and narrowing the social gaps in Israeli society should be our top two priorities as they have mutual impact on each other and recognizing these challenges reflects not simple not simply our values but also an understanding of the realities that face Israel we need to focus our limited energy and resources on the land that will be part of Israel in communities like mine and in towns and neighborhoods all across israel where we have not done a good enough job to this we need to bring an end to the conflict with the Palestinians people we need two states we need borders within which we can continue to build an Israel of which we can all be proud I know that Israel cannot be modern democracy society it cannot be truly moral Jewish society while controlling the lives of millions of Palestinians we cannot we cannot be a startup nation when we are perceived by the world as an armed bunker and one of our greatest obstacle is that the majority which supported piece has been silent the conversation has been overtaken by extremists and skeptics today unfortunately significant groups including Safari and miss rocky Jews of my community who were once supported of historic compromise have been drifting towards extremism it is not popular to be a supporter of peace today in Israel the Oslo accord the Gaza pull out and the Arab Spring they are all being used to so skeptic ISM marginalize and attacked seekers of the peace but i am not discouraged we should not be discouraged those who opposed peace lack answers to the most burning questions there is a big hole in their story and we determination we can write and different history let me tell you a little more about my city irukkum population 9500 your home is located in the Negev 18 miles south of beer sheva and ten miles north of ben-gurion final resting place we are a community of immigrants from Morocco India Iran ration and the melting pot of secular traditional national religious and Haredi Orthodox it sounds like New York almost but it's just 10,000 people our closest neighbor hoods are the Bedouin community in many ways we are the microcosm of Israeli society and as such we have had our share of social and political turbulence eurocom is a community that quickly taught me that a central ingredient for making history he's speaking across ideological and cultural divides rather than the complain about what we lacked we worked tirelessly to bridge the gaps in our society with creativity and compassion nowhere is this more evident that at a yahoo com community center yahoo com social hurt which I directed before running for the mayor the principles we try to implement in your oakham should be applied to the Israeli society as a whole the key is to engage to learn and to acknowledge the changing face of the Israeli society we need to think differently about the coalition we are building those who are interested in achieving the political coalition that can support peace cannot do it rebuilding the left alone we have to build a movement that stretches far behind the the usual suspects we need to reach my community in your home and to reach them we need to stop pouring resources into Judea Samaria we need to stop neglecting the Galil and the Negev and start delivering a new and fair social contract to cities that will be in the Israel for the role for the long haul without doing so we cannot deliver peace when you wonder why the left and center where and are marginalized I say look at the periphery look at the weakest links of our society we are only going to build the coalition for peace if we can broaden the people we look to engage and specifically that means speaking to the people who live in the merging of Israel society in a similar way we need to impress the settler while settlements are obstacle to peace settle settlers are not our enemies observing and settling tens of thousands maybe hundreds of thousands of Israelis inside Israel's borders is a huge challenge we can see it with the Gaza Withrow we need to guarantee their safe return and I hope your hukum can help provide a home to some of them just as an Israeli need to reach across our own internal divides if we want to make history Jews around the world must work together as partners in addressing our common challenges while I have my parents to thank for instilling in me the values that I have today I also must think the American Jewish community from you I learned about pluralism and tikkun olam as a child my parents could not afford new clothes or dental care and it was the generosity of the American Jewish community that made sure we had what we needed this is a lesson I have decided myself to bringing to your calm and it is one of the reason i co-founded and chair the nonprofit organization called te R in b'ham which aim to shape a new generation of leaders I developed a local model focusing on renewing and renovating Zionism our news honest pioneers committed to social justice creating opportunities and forming a sustainable society I truly believe that people who practice justice at home will advocate justice for their neighbors we have so much to learn from each other it isn't enough to advocate here in Washington I invite you to spend more time with us in Israel and in your hukum find more partners and connect with them even if they seem to come from the other side of the tracks together let's work with new and different communities and turn things around you know the best kept secret surrounding j street is that most israelis actually agree with your ideas and goals my advice to you is to be clear and to unequivocal on matters of Israel's security and show empathy this is the path towards entering the most important conversation we can have between us on how to ensure Israel's futures as a Jewish democratic states and UJ street are the only ones brave enough and capable enough to have this difficult conversation with us I grew up in your home I never finished high school I became a soldier in the Golani Brigade and later commander and officer in Golani and official schools I spent five of my years my best years serving in the territories in my regular army and in reserve over the last 20 years I five kids avia only staff re and never and I don't want them to spend five years of a difficult moral service in the territories when they gonna grow up that's why that's why I committed myself and my love my life to your welcome my love to social justice and to peace you are making history we are making history our challenges are the same challenges and I'm proud to be your partners thank you you

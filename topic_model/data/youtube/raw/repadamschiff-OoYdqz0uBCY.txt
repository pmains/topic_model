THANK YOU FOR  JOINING US. CONGRESSMAN.  >> GOOD TO BE WITH YOU.  >> TODAY WE HEARD TESTIMONY  FROM FORMER OATH KEEPERS DO  BELIEVE THAT TESTIMONY HAS THE  POWER TO CHANGE MINDS OF  FERVENT TRUMP SUPPORTERS.  >> I CERTAINLY HOPE IT WAS  VERY INTERESTING TO HEAR  TESTIMONY FROM SOMEONE WHO IS  A MORE OR LESS AN ORDINARY  CITIZEN DRAWN TO THE CAPITOL  BY THE PRESIDENT'S YOU KNOW,  TO ASSEMBLE ON THE BUT YOU ONE  OF THE LEADERSHIP IN ONE OF  THESE WHITE NATIONALIST IS NOW  ANNOUNCING THEIR AFFILIATION  WITH THAT GROUP AND TALKED  ABOUT THE DANGER THAT THAT  GROUP POSES TO THE COUNTRY.  >> WE'RE ALSO LEARNING MORE  ABOUT CORD UNAIDED,  COMMUNICATION AMONG TRUMP  ALLIES PRIOR TO THE 6TH. HOW  DOES THIS PLAY A ROLE IN  CONNECTING THE DOTS? BACK TO  THE FORMER PRESIDENT?  >> I THINK THIS WAS A PART OF  VERY IMPORTANT TESTIMONY  TODAY. THAT IS YOU HAVE THESE  MILITANT GROUP SAYS WHITE  NATIONALIST GROUPS IS  CONSPIRACY, DRIVEN GROUPS WHO  PRIOR TO THIS REALLY DIDN'T  WORK WITH EACH OTHER. THEY'RE  QUITE INSULATED FROM EACH  OTHER. BUT IN THE RUN-UP TO  JANUARY 6 TO SEE THEM MAKING  COMMON CAUSE AND WE HAD AN  INTELLIGENCE AND THEIR  TESTIMONY TODAY ABOUT HOW  UNUSUAL THAT WAS AND HOW  ESSENTIALLY IT WERE SHOULD  HAVE SET UP A THAT THESE  GROUPS ARE GETTING TOGETHER  AND THERE WAS A HEIGHTENED  RISK ON JANUARY 6. AND COURSE,  WE SAW THAT MATERIALIZE AS  VIOLENT AND WHITE NATIONALIST  BATTLED. POLICE BROKE INTO THE  BUILDING CAUSE MAYHEM.  >> ALSO SPOKEN ABOUT TODAY,  THE RESULT OF THESE HEARINGS.  WE HAVE A GREAT IMPACT ON OUR  FUTURE IN THE FREEDOM THAT  REPRESENTS. HOW WILL YOU  ENSURE CONSTITUTIONAL  DEMOCRACY GOING FORWARD?  >> WELL, THAT'S REALLY A  CENTRAL WE DON'T HAVE THE  PROSECUTORIAL MISSION THAT  WILL BE THE JUSTICE  DEPARTMENT'S. BUT OUR MISSION  IS EXPOSE WHAT HAPPENED TO  EXPOSE THE MALEFACTORS AND  PROPOSE REMEDIES TO TRY TO  PROTECT US GOING FORWARD AND  AND WE WILL IN THE FALL. I  THINK ALONG WITH OUR REPORTING  MAKING A SERIES OF  RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT THINGS  LIKE REFORMING THE ELECTORAL  COUNT ACT. SO THIS VERY IN THE  EVENT OF A CHALLENGE TO AN  ELECTION, HOW THE ELECTORAL  COUNT, THE VOTES ARE SUPPOSED  TO BE TABULATED. BUT BUT OTHER  RECOMMENDATIONS ALSO TO DEAL  WITH THE GROWING THREAT, FOR  EXAMPLE, OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM  OF WHITE NATIONALISM. SO  EXPECT A BROAD RANGE OF  RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT  PROTECTING OUR CONSTITUTIONAL  DEMOCRACY.  >> IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY FOR  YOU. CONGRESSMAN ADAM SCHIFF  STILL IN WASHINGTON TONIGHT.

hi congressman tracy mann welcome to my washington dc office for those of you that are on uh facebook live or are joining us uh from your screen we also have a lot of people that are joining us from their phone as well thank you for joining us tonight so we are having a special event tonight a teletown hall that we've never anything quite like this before we're really excited about it we're broadcasting a live video of tonight's meeting if you'd like to watch the teletown hall go to my facebook page or visit my website man.house.gov live and you can join that way as your representative i sit on the veterans affairs committee and really delighted to get to do that i believe strongly that we've got to do a great job as a country caring for our veterans and i've invited two veterans who are also classmates of mine and republican members of the house that join me we have congressman fluger and congresswoman marinette miller meeks joining us tonight they're both veterans delighted to have them harnessman fluger represents west texas midland odessa san angelo a lot of oil a lot of agriculture do they still play football down there i think they do on friday nights once in a while and uh and he was a raptor pilot served in the air force for what went to air force academy through the air force for 20 years uh him and his wife camille and their three daughters lived in san angelo and it's on a lot of communities uh including the homeland security committee and also we have with us congresswoman marionette miller meeks from southeast iowa uh the part you know kansans we kind of wish that it rained uh in our state right too long yet so we actually need crop insurance uh in in the big first but uh marina was in the army for 24 years is that right her husband kurt was in the army for 30 years they've raised two daughters uh her district is southeast iowa that includes the university of iowa yes it does go hogs and believe it or not so marinette won her race it was a democrat seat she flipped a seat by a whopping six votes out of how many total cast almost four hundred thousand four hundred thousand votes six votes so if you ever wonder if your vote matters uh it certainly does uh did in your race matters to you a whole lot so we'll just dive into a few questions we're going to respect their time um we'll start with you august uh if you would you know basically how would you say your two decades of service uh flying the raptor all over the world how does that affect your first year in congress well tracy if i can start by saying thanks for having me and to everyone that's on the line you have a phenomenal representative representative mann is just the utmost uh character integrity it takes this job very seriously and i've learned a lot by serving with them and especially when it comes to agriculture when it comes to the issues that we both share like you mentioned you know i have a district that has a tremendous amount of agriculture and i appreciate your service not only to your district but to the country and being a leading voice for what what we need in order to get this country back on track i would say that serving in the air force and being a part of the greatest team in the world which is our us military it really sharpened i think my skills to be able to come to congress to work with people like dr miller migs yourself and so many others that care about this country deeply this isn't about any of us individually as you have demonstrated in your service before you got here and now it's about the country it's about serving the flag it's the greatest country in the world and being a veteran it's such a joy to be here and to take that service a little bit further here it's fun for me to see you know two veterans that obviously served their country uh on the battlefield in the army in the air force now serving it in congress how many how many veterans do we have in the congress today something you know it's a great question we we were at a low point just just a little over two years ago and now we're starting to to gain momentum and we have a lot of veterans a lot of women a lot of minority folks that are joining congress and serving in such a great way which is a great which is a great thing so i know you have an unusual background because you have a medical background as well so so it's actually dr uh marionette miller meets um so she was a nurse and then was a doctor in the army and then you also were in charge of the iowa medical society right and also was in charge of the iowa department of health so i'm interesting so what is your take on the vaccine mandate um as you see you know as a veteran but then your role in public policy and mandates i mean any thoughts on that well first i'm going to echo august and so i serve on veterans affair with with your congressman representative tracy mann and let me just tell you on veterans affair he's always on target he's always prepared he always has great questions and you can tell that he is looking out to serve our veterans and also our active duty military who then become veterans so it is a pleasure and an honor to serve with your congressman he's diligent he is highest character highest integrity and he really embodies those things which august and i think embodied the military and are our great armed forces and he also has a background which one of the reasons i ran for congress was to preserve the american dream and um tracy if i can call him tracy tracy does that so we're here fighting for you every day i'm just going to tell you you have a stellar congressman that you have put into office and it's really humbling to serve with them so i think having a background in in both medicine so i was in nursing and then i was a physician as i worked myself through school to become a doctor and then i served as the director of the iowa department of public health and i'm going to be very candid i'm fully vaccinated i did vaccine clinics in all 24 of my counties i have talked with people young and old different ethnic groups different social classes about the vaccines the risks and the benefits and i have long said that i'm not for a vaccine mandate i don't you know i think this shaming of people this pitting people between vaccinated and unvaccinated denigrating people whether they're vaccinated or not i think that creates so much more division and one of the things that's been very frustrating as a physician and a public health official is that there's not this recognition of infection acquired immunity or natural immunity as there is for almost every single other disease that we have and i've questioned dr fauci on this dr wilinski on this we just had another coronavirus uh select subcommittee task force meeting today i asked the same question and last week i asked the same question and it's extremely frustrating and when you as a medical professional can't get an honest answer from other medical professionals or the cdc about natural immunity or infection-acquired immunity then that just leads people to believe in conspiracy theories and something else going on and are they supporting big pharma and so i think we have created this dynamic where we have created more distrust in our institutions and really when it comes to the cdc in public health we need to have trust in those institutions because they're to protect us and keep us safe so we need more transparency from the cdc we should not have a vaccine mandate but i'm more than happy with tracy to talk with any anybody about the vaccines if they have questions you should be having those conversations with your doctor and your health care provider one thing i appreciate you know being a doctor and with your background with medical you know with public health public policy you have a unique ability to speak into this issue with authority and really glad that you take the position you do and speak as loudly as you do if you'd like to ask me a question press star 3 now to get in the queue also if you'd like to watch live video of tonight's meeting visit our facebook page or my website man.house.gov slash live quick question for august i know august has to go to do a another town hall teletunnel for your district tonight i believe but august what do you think are some misconceptions about the veteran community that you see that people display and what kind of role do you think we as members of congress um as well as veterans watching or listening can play in kind of dispelling some of this well i think the the work that president trump started a few years ago to really focus on veterans their health their mental health um reshaping and reforming the veterans affair bureau really something that i saw you uh tracy meeting with um the new va secretary mcdonough and you know getting to know him and i think one of the misconceptions is that veterans are 100 taken care of right now and uh and we know that that's not true and we really need to focus as a country to make sure that every veteran is taken care of that their families are supported and that we do the right thing and i would just say as we just came off of veterans day you know it's very important that we continue to honor the legacy of what veterans do in our districts to make sure that especially vietnam veterans um that we as a country that we give them the respect and the dignity and that we award them the appropriate decorations that they need because their service it mattered what they fought for mattered i know that i appreciate that you and audrey and your family have done a wonderful job of demonstrating that love and that respect for our veterans thanks for leading on this subject because it's personal with my family and i and we appreciate your leadership on it and it's a huge issue and if you're a veteran out there by the way that you're at a tough spot or if you have a family member who's a veteran um you know or a loved one that might be struggling please know that you're not alone the veterans crisis hotline is open 24 7 on the va committee we've been looking at making sure that's properly funded also to make sure that people receiving those calls are properly trained i'm call 1-800-273-8255 or you can text at any time eight three eight two five five or just google you know veterans crisis line uh and so make sure that if you're at a bad spot or need help that you're reaching out and getting the help that you need so i think you've got to head to your town hall i think august so thank you for joining us thanks for having me really appreciate your service next time dress up when you come to a job thank you uh to the folks in kansas for the support that you show um man family you've got a great representative uh we're lucky to serve with them and dr mix thank you yeah thanks brother yeah thanks have a great rest tonight appreciate it so you know a quick question uh for you um dr your veterans um justice outreach improvement act i've explained to veterans against kind of what that's about where it's at right now and what you're excited about so you know people in kansas may be familiar with drug courts or family courts you know there are mechanisms by which to help people through the court system and to stay out of jail so we know that they're veterans that experience homelessness there are veterans that are in tough circumstances they may get involved in the criminal justice system and so the veterans justice outreach program is a way to get them assistance and help to guide them and help prevent them from getting into circumstances which end up leading to them being incarcerated we know veterans suffer with mental health conditions we discussed that just a minute ago with representative fluger and you've discussed it as well so ptsd mental health conditions suicide prevention you know actions and activities that can get them involved in the criminal justice system and this is a way to you know help circumvent that by getting the outrage getting them you know into a hospital system if they're suffering or to a mental health a counselor or psychiatrist or to the veterans crisis line as you just mentioned and then there are some veterans who are um you know very concerned about the va system and so getting as the mission act allows them to receive care in the uh community getting them to community-based care um if that's available or um you know through telehealth or telemedicine so uh it's a good bill uh it passed through um our committee and uh and you were part of that it's sailed through committee so we're hoping that it'll be it'll pass all the way through you know there's a lot of differences in congress but you know the veterans affairs committee is still one of the more bipartisan committees and especially when there's a good idea um that somebody comes forward with republican or democrat typically it seems like both sides get on board and push it forward and that's important and i think that should you know you'll make veterans uh pleased so time for a quick question so um we have derek who's reaching out from syracuse so syracuse is in southwest kansas it's about 15 miles from colorado and about 60 miles from oklahoma so you're far south south west kansas um the question is and the question came through our website what is congress doing to curb veteran homelessness um and i can i can maybe start and then you can jump in so i actually introduced in and dr miller rince was helpful in this as well the veterans homeless act basically and so there's multiple things for happening in this arena but basically streamlining the process and getting rid of a lot of regulations so the program would work this way if there's a veteran who has a va loan home loan and they default on it we were able to lift a lot of the regulations around that to make it easier for the va to then get that home placed with a homeless veteran as they try to get on their feet you know kind of a common sense thing uh passed early on uh the first piece of legislation i really worked on and it has passed where we're pleased about that we also i'm just last week i sponsored legislation along with congressman papas from new jersey democrat and then on the senate side senator manchin from west virginia and our senator jerry moran to really help to make sure that kansas well that all states including kansas have a veterans homelessness program which is something i'm very passionate about and you look at it some states have this some states don't this bill would direct the va to make sure that that appropriate programs are in place and what are the programs in place in every state because they do vary uh from state to state so anything from your perspective on veterans homes you know outside of bills and and tracy your congressman has been very active uh in this endeavor and he's very smart to work with members on the other side of the aisle especially when you're in a minority in order to get very important legislation passed but he's also very active in making sure that veterans get their proper pensions or disabilities so these things occur within the district within kansas to make sure that you know they have proper compensation proper disability benefits proper health care and we mentioned mental health and so part of homelessness may be substance use disorder or maybe ptsd or maybe a mental health condition and so treating those conditions and make sure there's access to services and also help prevent homelessness and then we've both been very active on job creation for veterans so we have several bills on both educational benefits extending uh the gi bill benefits uh that were you know some veterans had um they have a time expiration for their gi bill benefits they were in school their university paused their benefits expired and so this is a way that their benefits could be continued so you were helpful in those bills uh ones for uh disabled and then the vet tech program which is a a computer technology program six months which has led to over 2 000 jobs at above 57 000 and tracy was very helpful in all all of those bills so job creation which helps uh with homelessness and then also treatment of mental health and substance use disorder which is which is huge for our veterans all over all over the country so again if you'd like to ask a question to get in the cube press star free now to watch the live video of tonight's meeting visit my facebook page or our website man.house.gov slash live i'll ask you one more question i'll let you go i know i know you're very busy but you know as a veteran as a doctor now as a member of congress how do you think we're doing with veterans health care overall do you think we've made improvements the last few years what are the big areas of need or concerns you see yeah i think that and you probably saw this and it may have been one of the impetuses for you running for congress and that was several years ago we saw long waiting lines at the va hospitals we saw patients that were triaged from care we saw patients you know veterans who were dying while they were waiting for care and there was specific va hospitals where this was true i toured rba hospital in iowa city and i think that you've done the same things and you know president trump under his administration really looked at not just how care was received but the regulations on to getting into care how rapidly claims were processed but even more than that having the ability to hold leaders of va hospitals and the va administration accountable for behavior for how they ran a hospital and i think that was very important so prior to that people weren't held accountable if there were egregious actions if there was a treating or you know untimely uh weights for care and then the other thing they instituted was veterans choice and then the mission act and so veterans choice allowed a veteran to receive care at a community facility if uh there was uh number one if there was a long waiting list or number two if they were greater than 40 miles from their residence this is very important and when you think about it our military force is now comprised of active duty then national guard and reservist and this happened as the peace dividend of the cold war ending so instead of having a large active duty footprint we have temporary service members if you will and those service members when they're deployed think about the global war on terror for 20 years many of these service members have been deployed numerous times and when they exit and transition out of active duty back to their um to their home they go to a home they don't go to a military base so having access to care via you know mental health uh treatment uh via physical treatment having access to care in your community can be very important for them to maintain a job maintain their families uh you know have less undue travel there are some things that the va hospitals do just tremendously well and that's especially in the role of prosthetics um but then there are other things that can uh you can have access to in your community and if you're a person that was national guard or reservist that can be very important to you yeah great wonderful thank you for joining us thank you so much thank you for your support again you all have a great congressman so take very good care of them and and uh we're looking forward to continue to work with him on veterans affairs yeah well thank you very much doctor really appreciate you have a great rest of the evening so yeah wonderful yeah well we have a poll coming up here and uh the polls is which of the following programs would you like to see congress improve for veterans um so there's four options here and i'll read back through them so which of the following programs would you like to see congress improve for our veterans number one health healthcare and physical health programs number two mental health resources number three homelessness assistance and number four assimilation back into civilian life initiative so again what should we improve on number one healthcare and physical health programs two press two for mental health resources press three for homelessness assistance press forward for a simulation back into civilian life initiatives initiatives um if you're just now joining us uh this is a concentration man from the big first district uh kansas i'm in my washington dc office tonight taking your questions now so press star three to uh to to get in the queue and ask any question you know we have a question came in on our website from christy up in norton um i hope you're doing well tonight christy question is any update on our withdrawal of our u.s troops from afghanistan um and uh i really appreciate the question what we saw happen in august was infuriating to me and i'm not for endless wars but the way that we left the lack of planning the american troops that lost their life the americas that we left behind this was absolutely unacceptable still makes me angry to think about talk about and the administration um said things that simply weren't true like there we've gotten everybody out that wants to get out we know when they left there were at least a couple hundred americans uh that were stranded in afghanistan and that's just not something we as a country do we don't leave people behind very bad for the morale of our troops very bad for the morale of our country very bad for our standing in the world i don't think we ever should have left the bagram air force base so it's infuriating to me um for every day or practically every day we send out social media or a a post saying the number of days since we've left americans behind and uh you know that started on september the first so we're approaching you know 75 days 300 we continue to ask the vitaministration questions frankly many times they dodge the answers they don't give us an answer they still can't account for the equipment that we've left behind uh and and in many ways worst of all the real winner in all of this is not only the taliban but china who is sharia actually shares a border a small border with afghanistan they now are swooping in and are increasing their influence in the world so a complete debacle rest um at the feet of president biden for this horrible decision i hope the republicans will win back the house here next year and we can have hearings and really call people to account as we should for what's happened so i appreciate the question i'm christy if you want to ask me a question again about anything veterans related or just what's going on in washington dc press star three now also if you'd like to receive our updates uh you know from our office we send regular updates on what's happening on the floor of the house what's happening with various pieces of legislation um large policies uh at any time press star six and we can get your information and then you can join back into the call so start three to get in the queue to ask a question or star six to sign up for our for our newsletter you know a lot's happening legislatively uh even this week so uh the the buildback better congratulations or the bbb i think that stands for bad bad bad it's horrible public policy it could be voted on as early as um the next day or two it's 1.75 trillion dollars at least i think when the truth comes out about this bill and all the programs it starts and all the spending it'll be could easily be closer to four trillion dollars than 1.75 trillion dollars strongly opposed it spoke out on the house floor about it uh here yesterday and uh you know a lot a lot going on um you know we have a phone call so we're going to go to call do a phone call or calvin in manhattan um calvin how are you doing this evening are you there calvin yes i'm here oh good evening how are you doing i'm doing fine good how can i help you tonight so i was in manhattan last week veterans day i went to manhattan you know you have that parade down point so it's really great to be part of the parade and there's the community veteran celebration uh around noon that i spoke at it was really great to get to be part of that and recognize some of our manhattan veterans and then later that day toured katie's way which is doing a lot to help mental health issues for veterans in manhattan but um but how can i help you here tonight calvin yes uh my question for the audience tonight is uh what is being done for veterans who have a trade skill but haven't been given a certification for it yep yep great question that's something actually that i am um working on and leading into and i think kevin we have a lot of work that we need to do to help transition um you know soldiers from um you know the certification or the skills that that our soldiers have to the private sector to to workforce i worked on actually with the state legislature i encourage them and prompted them to pass a state licensure bill that makes some of those things easier it somewhat depends on the industry um that that someone was in and how easy that is i think that that's an area that we have a lot of work that we could do need to do to make that licensure better and easier for for our veterans so in fact i was just um we had some experts excuse me in my office here last week i'm talking about that very issue so more work to do i'd say it depends on the pacific industry uh and then that specific skill but it's something we most definitely aren't working on and focused on so again ask a question hit star three to get in the queue or start six to join our our newsletter we have another caller we have billy from emporia um how are you this evening billy is billy on the line all right brother how are you i'm doing well so you know for one thing real quick before before your question billy you know it's important for people the big first to realize we have a legacy of recognizing our veterans so veterans day actually started in emporia and the congressman from orea back in the 1950s congressman reece went to washington dc after that and he submitted the legislation to make veterans day a national holiday and that was signed into law by none other than the big first owned dwight d eisenhower so a strong legacy in the big first of recognizing veterans that i think is important um what's your question here this evening billy well uh bear mr man i'm in agriculture i uh i served in the reserve had deployed overseas i've come home and and buying land is not an easy task i've got a lot of my brothers and sisters come up on active duty and attempt to get into farming but they can't afford the 30 down payment they go to the usda their credit's too good to get a usda locally and get a conventional loan the dell payments just too big it's something i've talked with a lot of people about over the years why can't we have a a uh va type system for those soldiers and sailors and airmen and marines wanting to get into agriculture when they are done finish their time it's a field we need people in i mean everything from beekeeping to growing you know uh oranges in florida i boy that's a great question first off thanks for your service uh billy and this is some also that you know so i'm on the house ad committee and i'm on the veterans affairs committee so in your question you're kind of merging two passions of mine there are some farm loan programs that are out there that offer loans to help veteran farmers and ranchers to get financing i'm not sure and i can find out what the down payments there are we have your number billy if you don't mind we'll give you a call someone or obviously give you a call tomorrow and really talk through the programs that are out there and make sure that we don't leave any stone unturned and happy to really look at if there are other ways that we can help veterans that want to get started in agriculture there's a program in manhattan near manhattan called the safe farm which is training veterans um to to join agriculture you know production agriculture beekeeping and other things as well so very much appreciate the question billy and and we'll make sure that you get a call tomorrow to make sure that you know of everything that's out there that potentially helped so really appreciate it um hey we have the results of our poll uh the poll we asked earlier you know we asked which of the following programs would you like to see congress improve for veterans uh the uh number they're actually pretty uh they were off four fairly close but the winner was the number four a simulation back into civilian life initiatives kind of what you're talking about billy uh that's 30 percent um coming in number second is mental health resources at 26 and then at 22 health care and physical health programs and also at 22 is homelessness assistance so uh you know definitely some good good initiatives there and and some great feedback so next up we have a caller we have justin calling from garden to city um how are you this evening justin are you uh you patched into the line justin um if not we you know we have your number just and we can make sure that we're able to uh to reach out to you uh here here tomorrow and answer any questions by the way if you're a veteran or if you're not a veteran on this call uh if you one thing our offices do is we do what's called case work which means if you're having issues with your va benefits or with the irs or social security or medicare or whatever we can't always move mountains but we often have numbers and some resources that we can bring to bear to prompt responses and to move the process along and a lot of that we do out of our local offices so we have an office in dodge city and we also have an office in manhattan and of course our washington dc office i live in salina as well so never hesitate to reach out to our offices if we can help you with case work or anything like that you also can email us at any time as well so um on the website we got a question from sarah from goodland um and sarah's concerned with the supply chain and i really appreciate the the question sarah i share your concern and you know there's some things that we can do there's also a lot of things we shouldn't be doing i'll tell you the first two things is we can improve the supply chain situation right away um by lifting these vaccine mandates that's that will do nothing but further weaken our supply chains number one and then number two uh when we are paying people more to stay at home than return to their job uh that only further exacerbates or makes our supply chain problems worse so those are two things we shouldn't be doing a lot of things we should be doing so i actually introduced last week it's called the transport act and basically what it does you know part of the pro there's a lot of problems here our other problem is is we are getting goods into our ports many times we have issues offloading them but once those containers are offloaded then we don't have the trucks to get them away from the port inland into kansas to go to our manufacturers our act producers of the people that need them the transport act what it does is it decreases regulation so part of the problem is because of frankly the california trucking regulations you can't drive a kansas truck that's older than 2011 so if it's older than 10 years into california and so what the transport act would do is it would force california and other high regulation states to loosen those regulations in times of extreme congestion like what we have now so that you know kansas truckers could go into these states grab the containers bring them back home it's common sense uh makes us we've got a lot of sponsors a lot of mometa right there so i think there's there's a lot of common sense approaches some things we could do to decrease regulations as an example um share the concerns and unfortunately with the body administration's current policies i don't see that changing anytime soon so we've got to take positive actions if we're ever going to get these supply chains loosened up you're moving forward so appreciate it appreciate the question again if you want to ask me a question about what's going on here in dc uh press start three now um also again if you'd like to get our updates for our newsletter hit star six we can get your information and then you can rejoin the call next up we have a phone call we have randy calling from celina how are you this evening randy i'm fine thank you good good how can i help you tonight um i just got a question i i have been diagnosed with ptsd and depression and i don't know nine other things that i don't understand um i'm just wondering what they're doing to help with that aspect of the this the veterans because i know i'm not the only veteran that has been diagnosed with it but have no i get no benefits for having it i guess all right yeah no payments yeah yeah no i appreciate the question something i think about a lot you know the mental health of our veterans um and thank you for your service to our country i live in salina as well and uh um so thank you to your service for our country i think frankly we need to be doing more as a nation to care for the mental health aspect for our veterans i was in manhattan last week and went to this place called katie's way where they're doing a lot of specific brainwave treatments and are seeing a lot of positive results helping veterans with mental health with ptsd i was encouraged by that we have your number one somebody give you a call tomorrow and make sure that um that there's no uh programs or opportunities for you to get some um some care that's that's not being left undone so we'll look for a call from someone in our office tomorrow uh on that and again appreciate your your service to the country from a legislative standpoint frankly i feel like we need to be doing more and uh and appreciate the phone call so next up we have grace um ask a question from russell um i'll be our website and uh grace is concerned with the southern border crisis and uh so i appreciate the question great i share your concerns so we just the nation just released uh the last couple of days the number of illegal apprehensions for the month of october um all-time record i think it's 170 000. so i i wanted frankly uh to see firsthand what's going on so i went to mcallen texas a few months ago which is sort of the epicenter of what's happening and i'll tell you i was both um outraged and heartbroken um outraged for this horrible policy that changed when president biden came in and issued executive orders um that fundamentally changed our immigration policy outraged for these horrible policies um and also heartbroken for these kids so we have all of these children uh unaccompanied minors that are coming across the border many of them are coming all the way up from guatemala nicaragua through mexico understand that to cross the border from the mexican side no one crosses the border without paying off the cartel and that cost is anywhere from 3 500 uh to 4 000 per crossing so you do the math we have 170 000 crossings a month the mexican cartels are literally making hundreds of millions of dollars at the expense of these innocent kids meanwhile um while the border patrol is distracted and overrun um other parts of the border they're getting fentanyl through not to mention we know we have no terrorists from yemen other countries that are getting through um and it's a complete debacle and the vite administration refuses to consider the problem refuses to go there and really do anything about it and it's infuriating and criminal in my mind so appreciate the question not nearly enough being done we've introduced legislation we've been on television talking about this um spoken out on the house floor multiple times and uh and it's very very frustrating to me um again if you want to ask me a question about what's going on in dc press start three now uh to get our new receiver our newsletter update hit star six and uh next up we have a phone call we have richard calling in from uh from dodge city how are you tonight richard i'm doing great congressman and i appreciate it good good here good for us in washington dc and your care and concern for all the constituents in kansas my concern and my question is uh we recently held two gubernatorial races one in virginia and one in new jersey and it looks like there may be a shift in political climate in congress perhaps where the gavel may be turned over from the democrats to the republicans and i would like to get your opinion on the 2022 midterms to find out just what your thoughts and perspectives knowing that you participate in statewide elections uh as lieutenant governor as well as united states congressman uh knowing you probably a little bit more politically savvy than your colleagues based on your political background give me your thoughts on where you see the 2022 elections going yeah richard great great question and uh so i appreciate the question you know it's nothing's guaranteed the 2022 election you know is a little less than a year away every indication is that the country is very frustrated with the democrat-controlled congress and and that it will flip to republican control so just give you a sense going into the last election so a year ago everyone thought republicans would lose 10 15 seats we actually gained 25 seats so the congress actually shifted to the right which means out of 435 members it's a seven vote five to seven vote margin and so going a year from now given the mood of the country given a lot of these big government socialist policies that are unpopular and given redistricting um given that typically you have a new president the other party picks up on average 20 to 30 seats all signs would say that the the house would flip to republican control next year now nothing's guaranteed it's hard to tell um so so that's the climate i think for republicans um that's a good thing um in the house in the senate you know good climate but not as good a map because in the senate you have 100 senators six year term so only a third of them come up every year um certainly the senate could also flip but i think high likelihood the house flips um as well but we will see so question and that's that's how we see it as of right now you would think given the results of the virginia new jersey election two weeks ago that the democrat leadership of the house would moderate a move to the middle uh but it's actually the opposite where since then they are trying to uh jam through some of the largest most um socialist policies in the history of the country um which i think will be to their political detriment at the ballot box here next november so thanks for the question uh we got a um second poll question um the question is this what do you think's the biggest obstacle facing military veterans when transitioning into civilian career what's the biggest obstacle that faces our veterans transitioning into civilian career number one lifestyle changes things like relocation take home pay health care options et cetera that's number one number two workplace cultural differences number three education and training and number four emotional and mental health so again the biggest obstacle you think facing military veterans when transitioning a civilian career one lifestyle changes to workplace and cultural differences three education and training uh for emotional and mental health um so uh so press uh one two three or four and we'll have the results of the poll here a little bit so again if you wanna ask me a question at any time about what's what's happening in dc or how we can be of service hit star three um if you want to sign up for our newsletter hit star six we need your information and uh and your email address and then you'll rejoin the call so next up we have clark who is uh joining or actually had a question on our website clark is from phillipsburg up in phillips county uh wasn't able to listen to the um clark was not able to listen to the house ag livestock hearing um can he get an update so i appreciate the question um yeah we had a um uh livestock hearing here um we've had we've had several of them so i'm on the livestock and foreign market subcommittee actually had hearing about that today we also had a full um committee hearing talking about livestock markets here uh a month or so ago you know a lot's happening in in cattle markets um certainly there's efforts to add transparency to the market a lot of concerns uh with the lack of you know to make sure that we have adequate price discovery that's occurring there's a handful of bills that are out there um some of them are uh are certainly uh better than others i think we've got to be careful that the government doesn't over intervene in the free market and that we don't punish producers you know who have made a positive progress on improving the the product you know i would submit you know and by we're the number one beef producing district in the country so we uh we make great beef in the big first the product that americans all over the country love to eat and we got to make sure that we continue uh to have a system where producers are rewarded for their excellent product the same time we got to make sure that that markets are working a bigger turn i have clark and that no one's talking about enough yet is with these vaccine mandates for usda employees remember that our packing plants all have to have usda inspectors to operate and if we have significant number of retirements or people that leave those line inspection services because of these forced vaccine mandates i'm very concerned with how it's going to decrease our packing capacity and will further mess up our our supply chain so appreciate the question clark and and that's and that's the latest so uh again uh trace me in from the big first i hit star three now to ask any question we have about 15 minutes left uh and if you want to get in the queue i'm happy to answer your question here by hitting star three next up we have bruce who reached out via facebook um bruce asks what's the update on the uh kova vaccine mandates appreciate the question uh bruce and i actually was on the floor of the house about 30 minutes ago well about 15 minutes before this call speaking out against these backseat bandits i strongly oppose covet vaccine mandates i just think that it's the role of the government they provided a vaccine the government's provide information about the vaccine and now it's time for free americans to decide if getting the vaccines right for them and their family um but the federal government has no business mandating vaccines it's absolutely wrong and is encroachment on our basic freedoms so there's actually a lot of different mandates you have the the federal government the federal employee mandates you have mandates that hit health care workers uh long-term care facilities um and so that's a series of mandates you have mandates that impact private employers that have federal contracts you also have mandates um you know the most recent one that's very popular is these mandates that require employers that have a hundred employees or greater to force their employees to get vaccinated which is just absolutely flat wrong so i strongly oppose these i've spoken out on the house floor about them we have a committee about them introduced legislation co-sponsored legislation i've been very outspoken about about these um letters to the administration how wrong they are if there's some positive news the mandatory employer mandate so if you're a private employer that have 100 employees or more that mandate the specifics of it rolled out week before last it was immediately objected to in court and the fifth district court of appeals issued a stay which means the court has not said yet it's unconstitutional but they have a lot of concerns about it so they press pause and today osha announced that they are are also not enforcing that mandate what will end up happening um is that will end up going to um be heard in front of the court of appeals or or a circuit court not sure which one yet probably will go all the way to the supreme court hopefully they deem it unconstitutional a lot of these other mandates we are trying to fight in courts um and hopefully they'll get overturned we will see um strongly disagree with these vaccine mandates and appreciate the question um we have the results of our poll so again what do you think is the business biggest obstacle facing military veterans when transitioning to civilian career the number one 42 percent is almost half number one was emotional and mental health um so that's that's great feedback so emotional mental health is number one two at 26 was workplace cultural differences uh 21 was lifestyle changes and uh in fourth place uh 11 was education and training so thank you for responding uh to the poll that's great feedback um for us and and appreciate you next up we have noah i'm reached out on the website from scott city down to scott city uh the beavers traditionally have fantastic football teams and uh so i hope you're doing well noah the question is are you concerned with the debt uh and the answer is um absolutely we are i think when i look at america um three my three biggest concerns with how we're gonna fare this century is debt china and the drift we have made from our basic fundamental values of faith and freedom those three things with the debt being one of them you know we are 30 trillion dollars in debt if all of the spending goes through the president biden's proposed at the start of the year we would add another six trillion dollars to the debt so we have 36 trillion dollars bottom line that is just not sustainable and we are kidding ourselves if we think that we can continue to rack up debt like this and thus not have negative consequences to the economy uh to inflation and we're seeing rampant inflation a large part of that it's all just government spending that's not even counting the debt and so very very concerned about the debt and uh like i said in my view one of the three biggest things facing the country and will limit our ability to fund the military will limit our ability to meet our promises to seniors and uh very very concerned about it all the reason more reason that i'm strongly opposed to the buildback better the bbb bill that will come up here uh probably later this week so uh next up um you know just a lot of information on veteran casework so one of the things our office does is we help veterans so if you have any issue concern reach out to any of my offices manhattan.city manhattan reach out to us online

jordan from hutch uh reached out questions are you pro-life and the answer jordan i appreciate the question very very much so i think that life begins at conception i think uh if we're not standing up for life as a nation you know what are we doing one of the many many reasons that this build back better bill reconciliation whatever you call it is so bad is for um decades we've always had what's called the hyde amendment which means um you know whether you know you're for abortion against abortion i'm strongly against abortion for any reason at any time but for decades it's been a policy of the country that we would not have taxpayer dollars go towards funding abortions this year when they released the budget and these spending bills they omitted or they did not include the height amendment and that is absolutely appalling to me we have spoken out on the house floor signed legislation been very very outspoken about this horrible change in direction um that frankly is out of step with the majority of americans i'm surely opposed to so very very pro-life and appreciate the question next up um we have jimmy reaching out for mcpherson question about the stepped up basis so i reached out via the website appreciate the question you know so in this these spending bills um one of the questions how are going to pay for them and the answer is we're not fully paying for any of them that's why we're adding to the debt one of the ways offered up to potentially get some more federal tax dollars is to do it with a stepped-up basis which absolutely devastating for agriculture devastating for our small businesses currently the ability to pass land from one generation to the next um most of the time tax-free or at least what they stepped up and basis is a big big big deal i've introduced legislation and at the ag committee to make sure we would keep stepped up basis um we've been very very active on this issue it's very important the good news is as it sits right now today the current framework preserves the stepped up basis so what the house is now considering um the the parts of that that would do away with the setup basis have been taken out of the bill so the current framework includes changes to the stepped-up basis which is a good thing now we are watching that very closely we've even drafted an amendment already prepared to amend the bill on the floor to preserve the taped up basis if need be if they try to add it in but rise of right now it's pretty precarious frankly but as right now it's good news that there are no changes to the stepped up basis which is really really important for for the big first so appreciate the question um you know we have a lot of calls about casework tonight um so glad that you've been here our office will reach out and be in touch with you this week uh if you've reached out or if you have any questions regarding um benefits or if there's any case work or or things that we can do from that regard so next up

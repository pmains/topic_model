thankful to the chairman for holding this hearing as the effects of coven 19 pandemic continue to disrupt our nation's supply chain leading to bottlenecks and of course delays and uncertainty as consumer habits have shifted in response to the pandemic we've seen a drastic increase of imports into the united states which has been overwhelming our supply chain and exacerbating infrastructure issues i strongly urge my colleagues to support the infrastructure investment and jobs act because it's a bipartisan legislation to help us provide significant and long overdue investments in our crumbling infrastructure and as many of our witnesses have testified this legislation will address years of underinvestment and allow us to meet the needs of the future so i appreciate the president's leadership in developing the build back better agenda to help grow our economy and create good paying jobs our witnesses have also pointed to specific legislation before this congress that will address specific issues within the supply chain and i look forward to hearing more about that so mr durkin my question as my state of iowa is our nation's second largest exporter of ag products i'm concerned about how some foreign-owned shipping companies are essentially dictating trade they're bringing in imports into our ports but yet they're leaving with empty ships without our products being exported on them this is very contrary to standard uh import export trade uh can you elaborate on your testimony on how the ocean shipping reform act can address this problem and other solutions that we might act on here in congress yeah two of the key key components of that shipping reform bill one is that it would put a limit on terms of the empty containers that are going back there was always a portion of that that did go back given the import export imbalance but that number was at around 10 uh prior to cobit and now we're at 70 so there clearly is uh an issue that's been that has kind of escalated to a point where where i called this obviously as a crisis so and then the second point of that is when those orders get rolled and we lose those bookings as i mentioned there's a fees from a demurrage fees and other excess charges that us as well as other companies have to have to handle and i know this that's a big component a second component of the shipping reform act that would help and again i can't emphasize enough how quickly uh if we can get this thing we get to kind of i know it has bipartisan support how quickly we can get this bill passed and approved and i think that would be a big help thank you for that and um really appreciate that now one second question mr sampson you noticed in your testimony that trucking industry needs about 80 000 more drivers to meet demand i'll tell you i always have iowans in my office on this issue we know these are tough jobs but they're critical to our nation so can you expand uh to us here what the industry is able to do to recruit workers so that we can better support those efforts we're understanding that there is an aging workforce we're understanding that uh covet had a a strain on the industry and industry that really uh showed up and and kind of provided that they were they were heroes during the covet pandemic what we're trying to do is go out and recruit younger drivers we're trying to diversify the workforce we're trying to bring in those from the military women in trucking has been a big piece as well that percentage continues to grow incentivized through monetary or benefits or flexibility and so there's multiple things that we're trying to focus on to make sure that we get these drivers into the industry but then we also keep them as well we retain those employees as well

i'm chair um you know i often find myself trying to imagine a situation where every american woke up every morning and got hit in the head with a hammer and we would if that happened we would probably think you know we should probably stop hitting people in the head with hammers alternatively we could i don't know spend a lot of money to invest in helmet technology and president jewell you are dealing with the consequences of climate change in the helmets from levees to to flood insurance and all the things you have to grapple with and i have a lot of sympathy with my my friend mr graves because he represents a district that where the economy depends on hammer manufacturing um that's really hard and we've got to grapple with that but i want to focus on i want to focus on the helmet because that was the subject of your testimony the ipcc report that recently came out described climate changes um i think they said the rate of climate change is outpacing our ability to adapt noaa report that just came out said that we've got two feet of sea level rise on the gulf coast by 2050. i'm just curious you sitting there as the president of your parish how many of the homes in your parish are within two feet of sea level i don't have that number on the top of my head but uh we do have a fair number of homes that are are close to sea level or um or just above okay so if so if i was to move to st charles parish tomorrow and try to get a 30-year mortgage because by 2050 um you know by 2050 that mortgage isn't going to be fully paid off could i get a 30-year mortgage if i was to move to st charles parish you you absolutely would be able to get a 30-year mortgage and uh but you probably wouldn't be able to afford your flood insurance okay and who's who's taken the risk of that mortgage because if you know it's going to be underwater in 30 years who's holding that paper the banks are uh the fannie and freddie or the commercial banks commercial banks i mean there there's still active lending going on uh in in saint charles parish in coastal louisiana because we've made such investments like in levies and flood protection to protect us but where we're seeing a lot of the inaction are on some of the big coastal restoration projects because of the uh hurdles that we have to jump through do you do you carry much debt in your parish do i carry much debt yeah no if you wanted to go out and get long-term paper if you know if you've got a you got a road you need to build where the the cost of recovering that bond is going to get beyond 30 years can you get that debt absolutely what's happening there no absolutely we we just we just did a bond against our go mesa revenues um which is a i think a 30-year payment as well so but again that money is going into things like uh coastal restoration flood protection and things like that okay well there was a cftc report that came out under the trump administration last year that looked at how financial risk was rippling through our financial sector and they found that the they echoed your point the commercial banks are still writing those mortgages but they are increasingly putting those on to fannie and freddie when i asked chairman powell last week if if fannie and freddie were changing their risk profiles in response that he said no but they should i followed up by saying okay everything i know about finance i spent 20 years in the energy industry i've built a lot of projects raised a lot of money everything i know about finances it depends on informational asymmetry um you know the old joke that if you sit at a poker table and you look around and you can't spot the fish you better leave the poker table because you're the fish and what that cftc report found was that the more likely you are to be in a flood prone region the more likely the banks are to offload that risk onto fannie and freddie so our failure to remove the hammer is causing the taxpayers to invest more and more in helmets right and that and the fear i have and i think it goes to what all our witnesses are talking about is that if we don't think about taking away the hammers right if we only focus on the helmets we simply don't have enough money right and at some point we're going to have horrible conversations and the people who are going to lose are going to be the fish right the financial sector is going to move and and we've got to focus on getting rid of those hammers and i understand that pain from a political perspective with the time we have left help us understand what happens to you if you don't get the money to invest in those helmets if you if you have if you have no choice but to tell people all i can do is abandon the provision of this road i can't rebuild that school we can't we simply can't protect that home what happens to you politically well i think it's important to know that louisiana has a plan and that's very important we have a coastal master plan um that is a 50-year plan that is rooted in science to rebuild our coast what we need what we need is a investment in uh in coastal restoration projects which right now comes from the fed the funding uh of go mesa there's those outer continental shelf uh revenues that is the only consistent funding source for our coastal plan so an investment in that and things like the rise act will uh will increase that that domestic revenue share and they'll also um give us a portion of offshore wind lease sales when that becomes viable in the gulf of mexico um so having that funding sources is what we need uh we need to increase that funding source but we also need to eliminate those regulatory hurdles so so that we can start doing these projects now because we're losing over a football field land every year i think that i'm out of time but i just when i look at the sea level rise that we know is coming most of louisiana south of i-10 is underwater and i want to make sure that our next redistricting cycle my friend mr graves is still here and is not sitting there saying that my district is now under water i yield back and i've also been in

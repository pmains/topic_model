hey let's bring in for his reaction Republican Patrick McHenry so with a muddler hearing whether to help or hurt the 2020 Democrats you think Americans 18 months from now we'll think about it what do you think well I think today was a defeat for the forces of impeachment it was a victory for the rule of law as a victory for elections having consequences is a victory for Donald Trump and that's what came out of today's hearing and the reaction you hear from the presidential candidates is because they're trying to get their own traction they can't run on the economy because the economy is strong they can't run on insecurity because of national security decisions of this administration so they've got to run as far to the left and try to create whatever controversy passports for whatever soundbite or tweet they can get in order to get some sort of traction so it's a theater of the absurd these days with the presidential sign on the Democrat fight okay a lot of time spent on mother not the same no we're near the same amount of time spent on the debt the border you know you know health care Democrats may be pushing impeachment now sir but Trump has the economy the latest Fox News poll shows a majority approve of his work and the economy and they say the economy isn't either excellent or good condition ABC News Washington Post NBC news/wall Street Journal poll show the majority of Americans don't think that Democrats have enough for impeachment time to move on I agree it's time to move on but you get back to that economic question the the very things that have made this economy strong and successful the tax cuts the regulatory relief are a direct result of this president's action and so you have the Democrats running to undo all those policies all the stuff that's brought us prosperity and what they're trying to do is activate their activists around impeaching the president because that's all they've got because they don't otherwise have serious policy that they can talk about congressman McHenry thank you so much for joining us appreciate it thank you

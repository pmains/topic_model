ms shucks it's hard for me to call you that rather than dexy one of the reasons that I'm so pleased that you could join us today is you have the frontline experience of actually meeting the needs of our seniors in rural Maine you've talked about the impact of high heating bills you've talked about the difficulties with transportation can you tell us some of the barriers that you faced as you've tried to meet the food needs of our poor seniors yes some of the barriers are obviously the distance that's involved to get to that's why we serve 25 food pantries and we want to get into 25 communities so we can be as close to people as possible there's great distances involved to get to some of the the major towns so the the transportation again is an issue and the distance that we're trying to cover and also the the lack of resources in a rural area that we have and we in Aroostook County work closely with other agencies to try to provide as much of a safety net as we can I said we work with rustic County Action Program arista Carrie ages on Aging and we reach out and grab hands and try to lock fingers to try to make as much you know to do as much good as we can to catch as many things as we can what do you think is the greatest unmet need of low-income elderly that you serve I'm talking from a food bank king perspective but the greatest need the CSF peeth packs and you know what i mean by the CSF chief why don't you explain because i'm not sure everyone here did this the CSF p the CSF p food packs are approximately fifty dollars worth of food items that that are distributed each month and they are part of USDA and actually we don't have the contract it's with arista area agents on aging and right now we have like 480 of those food packs that come into a rustic County each month for seniors who qualify over 62 and I have seen firsthand distributing those two people and what it means to them some of them I mean they line up in our parking lot at nine o'clock in the morning clear back up the street they come in taxicabs they come with neighbors they come together some have people designated pick them up so the CSF p food packs are vital and we just found out it's been up and down we just found out first we found out we're getting a reduction in those packs for next year but we just just before I left I was informed by jason hall is of the emergency assistance food program in augusta that those have been increased and our county is going to get five more packs and that's a big deal so and they have nutritious food in them and things so the other thing is farm shares another opportunity that the seniors like but one of the challenges to fresh vegetables is prepping it you know oftentimes it's difficult we have a farm that we're now we're now growing our own locally grown vegetables we're working with a little microprocessor in van buren that's able to slice and dice them which is perfect because they then go to the seniors in a little pre-packed package that they don't have a great big giant rutabaga they have to try to chop up well having visited your food pantry your stored where you sell used furniture and other things to buy food for the pantry I know that you do more with less than anyone I've ever seen in my life and your enormously creative

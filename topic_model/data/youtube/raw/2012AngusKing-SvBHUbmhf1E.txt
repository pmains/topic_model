the first question is really much talk a little bit about rural broadband why you think that's important why you've made that such a centerpiece so far well it I guess the best way to answer that is to come back with a question would you buy a house where you walked in and they said I'm sorry but you can never have any electricity in this house you wouldn't do it and broadband to me is the electricity of the 21st century really the issue is economics a business can't locate a place where they can't operate broadband it's just it's an it's an economic death sentence for rural America many people won't buy a house I've talked to Realtors who said you know I tour around the house and say oh by the way you can't get broadband here and the buyer says well no thanks I'm going to live somewhere else and that's a recipe for out-migration which is not something main needs I don't think the government should be choosing winners and losers and I don't think they should even be choosing which technology is the right technology I think what chase they should do is look for results Angus or just to follow up on that and and just I wrote it down so I could make sure I got covered all the points and to bring this make this just a more local why is broadband access and adoption so important to rural areas of the country especially for main one of the most rural of states and how it improved broadband access and adoption benefit the lives of Mainers well it it gives us a fighting chance to have an economic future I mean if if we don't if you don't have broadband access in my view within the next five to eight years in all areas those areas are written off they're not going to have an economic future and it's I don't think it's an I don't think this is a nice to have deal I think this is a must-have deal

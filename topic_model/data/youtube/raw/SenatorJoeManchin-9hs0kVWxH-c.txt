good morning and thank you for joining i'm mara bogg senator manchin state director and a fellow combat veteran today we are here to discuss the va asset and inventory review or air commission although this bipartisan bill was signed into law four years ago we are just now seeing the effects which are worse than if than expected under this bill the va hospitals in clarksburg beckley and huntington will be greatly diminished that is why yesterday senator manchin along with senator capito reintroduced the eliminate the air act which will save our va hospitals in west virginia and countless other rural va hospitals across the nation today senator manchin along with senator capito wants to hear from veterans all across the state so that they can take your concerns to the va and stop these drastic and harmful cuts we have hundreds of veterans watching this at six different locations and virtually in the state all viewers have been muted but questions are welcome in the question and answer box in webex you are also welcome to email your questions or concerns to town hall at mansion.senate.gov that's townhall mansion.senate.gov and we will share your questions and concerns with the va now i'd like to turn it over to senator manchin a friend to all veterans who has the most special of guests to recognize first of all thank you all for joining us impressive to see how many veterans that we have on the call from across the state first let me say this um to my staff that have worked so hard putting this together to senator capito staff my dear friend who's on here with us and her staff who has worked hard to put all this together i want to thank all of you but before we begin i want to mention an extremely special guest who is joining us from huntington woody williams he's a world war ii medal of honor recipient and he is here today and would like to say a few words now so my dear friend woody it's yours well thank you very much and appreciate it very much and we are so thankful for what you guys are doing to cut this thing off and get rid of it uh as you well know uh i was in the va for 15 days just recently i couldn't have received more perfect care if i've been able to afford it and they took such good care of me and the doctors were very considerate very concerned and very imp passionate about what they were doing so we have got to kill this thing somehow because i had i had to go to the hospital and the va wasn't here they didn't have any inpatient i'd have to go to campbell or visit or saint mary's and both of those are full sometimes you have to wait hours just to get the exam so we'd like to stop this thing somehow and we appreciate all of your effort and it's under capital's effort and i believe all of us were unions within one wild yeah i'll say let's stop it we can't have this so thank you so much senator it's always great to be with you and we just appreciate you more than you know let me say before we get started that i want to take a moment of silence here i can't see the senator are we not on do you not have us on marcus let me just hear you senator let me just say before before we get started i want to say that we need to take a moment of silence this horrific tragedy to these 19 young children and what we've seen happen in texas it's not who we are as a country it's not who we are as as a society and i the sadness i have in the grief i have for all those people just unimaginable i know senator capiton and all of us feel the same way that this this is a horrific tragedy that i can't even i can't even fathom how families can deal with this to lose a child but lose it in this horrible horrific violent way is unbelievable and unacceptable so let's take it as the moment of silence to remember those who are suffering so much for the loss of their children and the families that are going through this horrific horrific time thank you all i like to go around the horn so everyone can

thank you joe and it's great to see all of you from all areas of the state so i want to thank senator mench and his office for putting this together and for joining uh uh our bipartisan delegation of uh members who want to fight this uh this these recommendations i mean i think woody williams thank you for weighing in you know how precious our veterans health is to all of us uh we know that the four medical centers that we're very proud of in west virginia that our veterans are by and large very happy with not just their access but with the quality of care and the different services that are offered uh to me and i know that joe has talked to secretary mcdonough at the um at the va to say that this is uh the recommendations as a as it looks to west virginians are very wrong going in the wrong direction very eliminating emergency services eliminating surgeries uh and and so we are fighting to get together uh to just eliminate this whole process it wasn't well thought out they didn't talk to the stakeholders in my opinion they didn't talk to our medical facilities outside of the va either which is another source of concern so these proposed cuts we are going to fight our hardest and i think we have a lot of good folks on our side to fight our hardest to make sure these proposed cuts do not go through so i wanted to let you know that i'm in the middle of committee and i'm sure joe is too but i have baxter carr on the on the line uh with us so he can report back what everybody's saying and feeling i want to thank secretary diaz he's been in my office i see him there with joe he's doing a great job on the state level with governor so we're a united front here as we always are for veterans for you all and we thank you for your service and joe again thank you for including me today uh we're up for a fight but uh i think uh we we feel all of the energy and passion of everybody who's watching and and we're on your side thank you thank you shelley again thank you so much for always being that great partner and i just enjoy working with you so much fighting for all of our good people in west virginia your dad being a veteran my dad being a veteran and all the sacrifices the greatest generations ever given for all of us to have the quality of life we have but it's good to have you and thank you and your staff for being involved and finally that we are joined by our friend ted diaz he is our cabinet secretary for veterans affairs for our great state of west virginia and ted it's all yours senator manchin thank you so much for asking me to be here today several weeks ago i was i was briefed on the air recommendations at that time i recognized what what the air recommendations were what they what they meant for west virginia it's a reduction in services it's a reduction in health care access it's a reduction in mental health mental health care access for our veterans in the state since then i've been working with governor justice the legislature senator manchin senator capito and our congressional delegation in dc and we are all united in making making sure that the public is aware what these recommendations mean and we are also united in eliminating this secretary diaz thank you so much and i just appreciate you making the effort to come here personally to dc and how important this is to you and all of our veterans that you represent and we're very proud to have you in this position i want to thank all of you for being with us today we last got together to discuss the air commission in april after talking with you all i knew shelley knew we all had to stop this thing quickly back in 2019 we introduced the elimination of the va asset and infrastructure review which we call the air commission act i had only one co-sponsor at that time when we started out senator rounds from south dakota and shelley has been there fighting with us too so we were both deeply concerned that the air commission was just a bracklight commission that would target rural states and basically the rural states get hit the hardest now that we finally have the va recommendations to the air commission turns out that we were right hearing from west virginians and my god for what to get done here in dc the insight and information that you gave me the last town hall was ammunition to fight against the air commission so i decided it was time to reintroduce the elimination of the air act the feedback from all of you uh that we got uh and my colleagues here to join me in this fight and now and we're proud to say that we're leading the charge of a strong bipartisan group of senators and that's not easy to come by in the most toxic atmosphere we have but shelley and i have been able to show them if you work together for the purpose that we're here to represent the people of your great state then it shouldn't matter what the politics are and to me we have joined together to eliminate the air act so we are working very hard on that and we have more and more coming on all the time to help us with this fight i took the bill down to the four yesterday i know we're going to get it done and eliminate the air commission because i know when we're committed to get something done that means so much to all of us we make it happen now i'd like to hear from you so we're going to take in all of your questions and concerns and be sure to share with them with the va so whatever questions you may have please present them to us now senator our first question is from bud casto who is an army vietnam veteran from martinsburg hey bud how are you i'm fine sir and you fine it's so good to have you and i think we're the same vintage because you're in a vietnam veteran from martinsburg and that's the same time that we were all uh called upon but please bud uh give me your question all right my question as veterans we are hearing how these recommendations are impacting the va medical centers giving and hiring employees how could the medical centers fill their vacancies when people don't want to apply and work in a facility that is shutting down yeah but that makes so much common sense but you understand common sense is not common in washington and with all the challenges we have in rural america today in rural west virginia not having basically the people that can take care of the needs of our veterans we don't have enough to take care of the general population i don't know how they think by closing any of our any of our facilities uh that the that the hospitals and clinics are going to be able to take care of our veterans and they don't have that experience so it's it's a great question and it's a topic that we keep bringing up regularly at the senate veterans affairs committee which i'm on just the other week i asked the va assistant under secretary for health discovery education and affiliate networks about the balance of speeding up the va hiring and properly vetting applicants and often when i go to hearings i check on the number of vacancies that we have in west virginia and it usually ranges between 90 and 100. i worry that number will only go up during the air commission process especially when the va is already losing medical professionals to higher paying private sector jobs so it's a great example of the unintended consequences of the air commission veterans in every state deserve equal care and that isn't going to happen if our smaller states like west virginia lose out on the infrastructure and staffing through this process because they think that we don't need it so i just want to thank you bud for the common sense question and also the common sense that the va should have and understand you can't eliminate your way to better health care you can only basically serve the people who have earned it and deserve it and sacrifice for our country so thank you so we're going to take our next question right now senator the next question is from jeremy harrison an army combat veteran from glendale jeremy please go ahead with your question is jeremy are y'all mute jeremy sometimes this tech technology is a little bit tough to navigate well let me just read jeremy are you there let me read let me read i think i have a copy of jeremy's question the emergency rooms at the va medical centers are often an entry point for help for veterans experiencing a mental health crisis his question is how is the va going to continue this service so jeremy you're absolutely correct i had the same exact question as you had when i led a large group of bipartisan centers in a letter to president biden asking and i what i did when i sent the letter we said because after our last town hall one of the message that i took away was that veterans seek care at the va because they are understood and respected i've asked veterans across the state of west virginia would you rather go to the private facilities or the private sector or the hospitals or come to the va hospitals or see boxing clinics to a t 100 percent i want to go somewhere where they know who i am and what i've done and they understand me better i can guarantee i'm just another face and a number if i go to a hospital or really to just a private clinic so we've built a support system that our va's and uh have been depending on and who's better than the veterans to get the care from their professionals and they're passionate about that the people that take jobs at the va it's not just a paycheck or a job it's a commitment to serve those who have sacrificed for us and i can't thank them enough so we're going to fight and continue to fight to protect protect the jobs that we have but most importantly to give you the service you deserve okay thank you senator the next question is from todd morris who is an army veteran from montgomery todd how are you go ahead and give me your question great thank you i know that your team has been hard at work researching this and and my question is how will this affect west virginia veterans well given all you've heard a lot from me on this question secretary diaz would like to talk a minute or two probably on about your thoughts on this so secretary diaz if you have some remarks on this that you'd like to to give todd your input on thank you well these recommendations they are so they they impact our veteran population in the state so much uh i can't even begin to go through number by number the and line by line how how it affects the health care access to health care for veterans with the va we have the va has a has the best reputation as far as health care for our veterans i myself i've had i've had care in the outside community you know since my retirement from the military and i can tell you from personal standpoint i am i'm a better healthier human being both physically and mentally because of the va care that has been provided now as far as impact for the veterans should these recommendations come to fruition which we're all fighting that they don't should they come to fruition though the west virginia health care system is not as it's it's not ready to have 72 000 veterans that are receiving va health care in the state right now they are not ready to take in that number currently i have the greatest respect for our health care system in the state my father was a surgeon in west virginia for 40 plus years i have the greatest respect for my friends that serve in the healthcare field however just to cite an example of what they will be facing what our veterans are going to be facing my my mother-in-law was a few weeks ago had a hypertensive crisis where her blood pressure had had skyrocketed and it required her to go to the emergency room right away she sat in the emergency room for 18 hours before they could get her up on the floor now she's a civilian and not a veteran but this is what we're looking at this is what we're facing thank you secretary appreciate it so much todd thanks for the question thank you the next question is from john alloy an army combat veteran from fairmont hey john good to see you again how are you doing good honey what you got first first i'd like to thank you for all the work you're doing on behalf of veterans especially the west virginia veterans here and uh my question is one of the community services provided through the veterans hospitals is the homeless veterans resource center the proposed changes include stopping this critically important service to our homeless and nearly homeless veteran population a population that's already severely disadvantaged well john thanks that's that's one of the i think one of the most critical things we have to face veterans homelessness there shouldn't be a homeless veteran in the united states of america let alone anybody in west virginia it's absolutely unacceptable and completely avoidable because this congress introduced to reaching every homeless veteran act the bill expands the department of labor homeless veterans reintegration program to all 50 states and u.s territories this program offers job training services to veterans experiencing or at risk of experiencing homelessness you can prevent it if you identify it and if you identify it there's not a person or a company or or corporation in america that won't put and prioritize veterans having opportunity for a job it's so important because it aims to prevent it and that's all we're trying to do currently no organization in west virginia is receiving these funds and in the past four years only one organization has applied for this program the reaching every homeless veterans act of 2021 would require the department of labor to examine why several rural states are not receiving funding and provide community outreach to to increase awareness and encourage applications most of the time people just don't know most of our centers around the state don't know so pro programs like this john and the homeless veterans resource center could be put in jeopardy if we don't have the facilities to base them out that's where we base out of so if we don't have them and they go ahead with this type of elimination it would it would create more homelessness and we're not going to do that so reducing facilities homeless veterans accessibility to finding resources they might they don't even know about a program and it's going to take that away from them and that's walking into a va facility speaking with an employee if there's no va facility to walk into there's no one to speak to it'll be a life-changing moment for each and every one of them so the va is looking at infrastructure when they made their recommendations to the air commission i don't think so and a huge factor for them was population they looked at basically the demographics of our country the democratic state by state they didn't look at basically the terrain that we have to cover the ruralness when i explained to people in washington dc and across the country that we don't have one city or town in west virginia that has population more than 50 000 they think i'm kidding him because most states have a population senator at one large town or city in their state than is sparsely populated ours is a state of towns and it's a complete different demographics than any place they see in the country so these are the things i'm fighting for to understand they need to know who we and west virginia are they need to know that we have more veterans per capita than most any state we fought in every war and conflict we've shed more blood and lost more lives for the cause of freedom than most any state and i'll be darned if we're going to set back and now you take the services that our veterans need we're not going to do that and it's not going to be done in a quiet way we're going to make sure you understand and when we're done with these types of recommendations they'll never find life again and they shouldn't we're not taking the services we're going to make sure that we have those to offer in every possible facility that we have so you put your lives on the line to protect the country you deserve the opportunity to succeed after you've given your service thank you senator our final question is from roni wheeler who is an army and air force combat veteran from point pleasant hey ronnie go ahead buddy how you doing doing good senator thank you for being with us um my question is veterans in rural communities have to travel for medical appointments if va medical centers are not available to veterans how will travel expenses for medical care in the private sector of economy well ronnie thanks again for a great question back in 2018 when congress passed the mission act which included the air commission i was concerned that the commission would be bureaucrats in washington cutting vital health care access to veterans in rural areas of west virginia and rural areas across the country that's why i introduced the elimination of the va asset infrastructure review the air commission of 2019 act no one paid attention to it now that the va has published its recommendations to the air commission people are throw the va recommendations are a mile wide and an inch deep they do not include guidance on how services like travel expenses are going to be dealt with i also worry that they're overly reliant on population demographics and not enough on the geography we're a mountainous and rural state i need to tell you all that we all were raised and grew up here did the va consider the snow areas or snow belts or the access to road or a lack of access to good roads and the amount of drive times it might look on the map it might be only 30 miles that 30 miles can take as long as it would take you to drive maybe 50 or 60 miles in another state i cannot get a clear answer about all those factors and there's many more i'm asking about we're not the only state with these concerns uh so the eliminate the air act which i introduced this week is bipartisan it states has states from across the country in south dakota and the rural states across the plains and rural states such as west virginia we may be a small state but we're leading the charge on the topic here in congress i know we are going to to be successful and i know that we're going to get this done senator that concludes our questions for today thank you for all the questions that we've received in the chat box we'll get you answers and forward them to the va so with that senator if you'd like to make concluding remarks yeah mark let me take another another moment to thank everybody because i know that everyone made an effort to be where they are today to participate in this town hall and i think it's so important this is what the va should be doing and what they should have done before they put out a report that they put out which scares the bejesus out of everybody so i just want to thank you again uh today has been about getting rid of the air commission because it fundamentally hurts rural veterans across the country and and especially in our home state of west virginia as your senator from west virginia and i speak for myself and shelly moore capitol my friend our two of us are very proud to represent the great state of west virginia i can tell you we cannot nor will we let this happen i want to be clear though i'm against the air commission but i'm 100 for improving our va infrastructure it must be improved if the air commission was a fair and holistic look at the nation's va infrastructure it would be open to its recommendations they should be open to our recommendation unfortunately in practice the recommendations have been based on faulty data taking during a pandemic anything that came out of that pandemic people were not in the right frame of mind and that's not giving our veterans a fair shake when you're doing it in the most trying times and saying what do you think about this this or this so once we get rid of the air commission i'm going to work with my colleagues and every one of you to improve and build upon the va infrastructure we have currently in place i know that we're going to get it done i really believe in my heart and i want to thank you again and i never want you all to hesitate to contact my office as we can be of help i'm happy to have a tremendous staff of veterans that understand your needs and we're going to make sure that we're there to help you any way possible thank each and every one of you may god bless you and may god continue to bless the great state of west virginia and the united states of america thank you

joining me now we welcome back to the show distinguished center john barrasso a ranking member on the energy committee chairman of the senate republican conference john barasso senator welcome back um let me read you i mean you know this but i just want to read you what joe biden said he threw a temper tantrum while he was in riyadh at joe manchin he says quote if the senate will not move to tackle this climate crisis and strengthen our domestic clean energy industry i will take strong executive action to meet this moment end quote whatever that means meet this moment um senator barrett so he's going to make some kind of announcement tomorrow which will probably violate the supreme court's recent decision but what what do you know about it you're an energy guy and um here's biden back on the war path what do you think is going on here senator barrasso well first you started with the president in riyadh and the problem is the president had a completely failed trip there when the president of the united states falls flat on his face it's the american people that get a bloody nose so he came back empty-handed and now he's talking about declaring a climate emergency larry we have a lot of crises in this country we have an inflation crisis we have an energy crisis we have a crime crisis a crisis at the border i was just at the border last weekend but joe biden who is known for not focusing on the things the american people care about which is the cost of things in inflation he wants to focus now on the climate declare it in emergency so he can take further executive actions it's going to be a long and expensive summer with more expensive energy coming thanks to joe biden does he i mean do you think he understands that if he takes major economy-wide decisions which these fossil fuel things are the supreme court just said you can't do that without congressional legislation but the senate just said we're not going to do that so i don't know what he's doing i mean it seems like he's all twisted up kind of like a pretzel well he is and it's because of the radical extreme climate alarmists who are calling the shots for the entire democrat party which is why so many democrats line up and why we need to defeat all of them come the november elections but they don't seem to care if the cost of energy goes up one of the white house spokesman said well that was the cost of the the liberal world order this great transition of different energies that the president is talking about i don't know if he grasps the fact that there is still a huge gap in this country between renewable energy and reliable energy and americans want affordable energy available energy and it looks like we're not just having to worry about high prices we're also having to worry about blackouts that are coming to possibly two-thirds of the country larry this summer i'm sure you saw it was interesting uh regrettable but texas may have blackouts itself or maybe starting to have brownouts leading the blackouts too much reliance on unreliable renewables in particular uh the wind turbines i mean i think the texas went too far a bunch of years ago but that's a danger sign i mean isn't that what this is all about and this what the bidens are missing well yeah you can't rely alone on the sun the wind and wishful thinking we need all of the energy and we need to make all of the energy as clean as we can as fast as we can larry and do it in ways that don't raise costs for american people the energy is called the master resource for a reason it powers our economy it powers our country people get it apparently joe biden doesn't get it and with regard to texas you may have seen the notices that are coming out since they're so reliable since they're so dependent on the renewable energy what they're saying is if you have an electric vehicle don't plug it in between three and eight pm if you have different appliances unplug them turn up your air conditioner to a higher temperature even though they're facing 108 degrees that's what we're getting with the joe biden energy extremism because he's so dependent upon those climate elitists and extremists that call the tune for this administration sam brasso let me switch gears slightly the the senate's going to take up this issue of the computer chip subsidies you probably saw the wall street journal editorial on it industrial policy corporate welfare tax breaks up to 75 billion dollars um i must say sir i rather agree with what the journal is is talking about here what's your thinking on this uh computer chip subsidy we really need this stuff well it's under the guise of uh competing with china and for china i say never again never again can america be dependent upon you for materials for minerals for medicines all of those sorts of things with regard to this specific piece of legislation i'm a no vote we're talking about over 50 billion dollars possibly up to 75 billion dollars it is subsidy to industry you look at some of the companies they'll take the subsidy but i don't believe they need the subsidy there was a significant shortage of these computer chips during the pandemic they're catching up with that now the government is much too late if they were going to do this they should have done some things a lot earlier i'm going to vote against that today when it's on the floor of the senate i mean the joint tax committee no that's not true the uh republican side of the house ways and means committee beg your pardon they're saying for the same money roughly 75 billion dollars congress could have doubled the r d tax credit for all companies you know not just winners picking winners and losers and it could have thrown in 100 expensing for companies and it could allow immediate r d deductions at least through 2025. i mean you know senator i i sort of like tax cuts for everybody i hate picking winners and losers it's a problem i've always had and i i don't want us to out china china you know regarding government spending subsidies i mean i think those are important issues if we're going to compete with china the last thing we need to do larry at this point is add another 75 billion dollars to the debt yeah boy you're so right how about that you could really r d tax credits 100 expensing would be fabulous you could submit that tax cuts let's go on the offensive tax cuts the issue that impacts most americans today is inflation people cannot afford joe biden or his policies or the democrats as you say the cavalry is coming we need to get rid of every one of these democrats that's on the ballot this november top to bottom from the the senate the house governors all across the country they are all leading a charge to the far left and it's been hurting american families who are just trying to put food on the table fill the car with gas and have a little left over at the end of the month so they can pay their bills all right amen to that thank you senator john barrasso we appreciate it sir thanks for coming back home thanks larry you bet

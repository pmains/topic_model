give us some straight answers right from the president's mouth joining me now to discuss Florida Republican congressman and retired U.S Army Airborne infantry officer Greg stuby is back welcome back sir hey thanks for having me so do you share the vice president's Rosy view that this will not strange a strain rather Chinese American relations at all well it won't strain relations for this administration because this Administration is completely compromised they've given billions of dollars to Joe Biden's son and you know the big guy has taken his 10 percent so for this Administration they don't care they let this this this Chinese surveillance drone this big huge balloon for nine days Traverse across our entire country they knew about it from nine days we had a briefing for all members of Congress they found out about it on the 27th on the 28th they confirmed that it was actually radar from China this is what it is it's 90 feet long was the payload that's like the a small house or a barn is how big this thing was and they let it Traverse the entire country the president was advised on January 31st The Joint Chief staff was advised on the 28th and they did nothing about it so what do you think the president President should say now to Americans who are still very concerned because we've had three more objects uh spotted and shot down in our skies well what's fascinating is even Justin Trudeau in Canada of all places is going on TV and telling his citizens what was going on and what their response was and how they're going to react to this and Joe Biden is sitting silent because either he doesn't know how to respond to this because they haven't told him what to say or they're just hey let's just let this blow over the mainstream media won't talk about it only the conservative stations will talk about it and we won't have to address it meanwhile we have f-16s and f-22s and F-35 scrambling shooting down now unknown objects which are I'm sure made in China and without no without any information from the president giving to the American people what if they are not made in China where else could they be from so one of the interesting things in the briefing was a question that was asked was could these be some weather balloons or other type of uh educational assets and apparently the people that typically put those up in our country all said that it wasn't theirs so if everybody in our country and all the people that do these type of weather balloons say ain't ours then you can point the finger at China Russia North Korea some type of Rogue country that wishes to surveil in the United States that makes Alaska even more vulnerable because they're all over there they're all west of Alaska and they're like come on man you're just letting this thing or these things plural float into our airspace and no one seems to care I'd be a little freaked out right now hopefully you'll get more briefings and you can brief us on the briefings which so far Congressmen have been unsatisfactory agreed absolutely from this Administration we don't get any information we don't get anything we just get the downplayer until it's an even big thank you very much Congressman stubey yep thank you good to see you too thank you the Biden Ministry

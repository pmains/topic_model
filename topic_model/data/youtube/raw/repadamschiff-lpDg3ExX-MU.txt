congressman adam schiff is a democrat of california he sits on the january 6 committee he was the lead impeachment manager during the first impeachment of donald trump um and congressman let me let me start just on that like what are we to believe what are we to understand from the evidence your committees introduced about what donald trump's plan was to do when he led the armed mob into the halls of the u.s capitol well it was to succeed where he had failed through every other means and that was to stop the transfer of power to overturn the election to to cling to his office and chris i think you put your finger on what was most uh important uh in my view and the testimony yesterday and that is that when the president was told this crowd was armed they wouldn't go through the magnetometers because if they did they would have their weapons taken away the president's response wasn't good we don't want them to have weapons the president's response was take the magnetometers down he wanted them to be able to march with him to the capital armed and and so his knowledge uh his intent uh i think we got the uh the most direct uh view of that in the testimony yesterday um the fact that when that attack was going on having been frustrated in his efforts to accompany the this armed mob he's sitting in the safety of the white house he's asked over and over to do something about it but he won't do anything about it because he thinks that pence deserves this um that's that's a pretty telling uh compelling um narrative provided by this witness of a president who when all else failed uh was prepared uh to use this violent mob to achieve his ends um we got some news about pat cipolloni uh which i'm going to ask you about in a second but just one more follow-up on that which is whether you have updated your understanding whether your mental model of what happened that day has changed or evolved as this as you have you and the committee have learned more and more yes and you know i certainly suspected that trump was aware of the fact that the crowd was armed and dangerous uh and you know there was evidence to indicate that but uh but her testimony was the first that he was he was directly told about this and his response was take away the method of disarming these people take away the magnetometers and you know to me that tells the whole story of where he was coming from on that day and what he was prepared to do so yes i think our understanding continues to improve and it's an astounding thing chris we're a year and a half from these events and up until yesterday that you know the public wasn't aware that the president knew that the crowd the mob was armed and he wanted them to be able to march on the capitol armed you imagine how the capitol police who were injured over 140 of them during that attack knowing that the commander-in-chief who is supposed to be protecting them and our institutions was wanted that mob to be able to go to the capitol armed it it really is astounding um i mentioned uh former white house counsel pat sipalone uh the the committee has made direct appeals to him on screen before the mics to come talk to them i understand he had an off the record i think conversation uh with the committee and his his deputy there's a subpoena out for him today why why now why is pat hippolone being subpoenaed well as we've learned more and more we've learned of his role in the run-up to january 6 on january 6. his fear that there was going to be blood on the hands of the white house chief of staff if he didn't do something that if the president accompanied this mob to the capitol they would be charged with every crime on the books uh or something along those lines so his knowledge of the propensity for violence that day uh his knowledge that uh the president and others may be breaking the law that day i think is very important and he ought to show just a small portion of the courage that cassidy hutchinson displayed you know here she is at the ripe old age of 26 years old showing such a poise and character and courage uh and here he is in a much more senior position and and able to uh to testify as to what he knows and to do so observing whatever legitimate claim uh he might make a privilege and plainly there are lots of conversations and evidence he can provide that have no claim of privilege here he is and and he needs to come out of hiding uh he needs to do his patriotic duty um final final question for you um it's been a very weird aftermath to cassidy hutchins testimony in so far as various people have attempted to dispute details of her testimony often either anonymously or through spokespeople issuing statements some of these people have testified before your community committee some have not um there's obviously a profound asymmetry between an individual who testifies under penalty of perjury and sworn testimony and someone anonymously saying something to someone what do you make of those efforts do you have concerns about the veracity of what we heard yesterday uh no i i have great confidence in cassidy hutchinson as a very very credible reliable witness she told us what she knew she told us the extent of what she knew she told us when she didn't know things uh you know i i spent almost six years as a prosecutor i dealt with a lot of witnesses and and sometimes you could tell the most about the credibility by what they tell you they can't tell you that is that they don't know and and you know all you can ask from them is to to tell you the truth to tell you you know when they were a firsthand observer and when they got something second hand and she did all that uh and these some of these attacks on her some anonymous you know sleazy rumor campaigns all the rest of that uh is uh by people that don't have the same courage that she does that don't have the same respect for their oath of office you know the idea that mark meadows for example would dispute anything she has to say um in hiding uh from the committee unwilling to come forward uh willing to write about these things in a book when he's not of course under oath uh is is just appalling uh so i have nothing but respect for her uh and nothing but uh confidence in what she had to say i'm surprised that meadow's able to tear himself away from scrolling through his phone to even hear her testimony to be on us congressman adam schiff thank you for your time appreciate it

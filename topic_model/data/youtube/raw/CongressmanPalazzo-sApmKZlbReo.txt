Thank You mr. chairman and Madam Secretary thank you for being here today last week when President Trump announced the good news that he's going to deploy the National Guard to the border as a National Guardsman myself I was elated and since I've been in Congress I've been calling for the similar actions take the National Guard use them as a multiplying force and help secure our border because border security is absolutely correlation with national security is extremely important if you could could you take a few moments and expand on what you see the administration's role utilizing the National Guard on the border yes I'd be happy to so first and foremost it's to work in conjunction with the governors and the tags within the different states so at the moment we have National Guard deployed from Texas Arizona New Mexico California already had some National Guard deployed we continue to work with the governor there to see what else might be needed are available to supplement but what we're looking to do is to supplement what the Border Patrol does so that the border control can be on the border and do what they do best so we're looking at everything for support for aviation for vehicle maintenance for surveillance monitoring Intel sharing things that the National Guard is particularly trained to do that we'd like to utilize their expertise to help get more of our men and women back on the frontlines to protect the border does the status of the guardsmen make a difference in their mission say for example if the guard was activated under title 10 versus title 32 does that limit what roles they could have on the border it does title 10 obviously does limit it there's other things that come into play there such as common you know Posse Comitatus but what I would say about title 32 is that it's very important from a homeland security perspective to do this in conjunction with the governor's governors are there they know what they need they know what works they know what their constituents need so we're really approaching this at this time as a partnership and every way possible is there gonna be an opportunity for other states to allow their Guardsmen to basically be called up and work with the the border state Guardsmen and their governors or is it are you just limiting the Guard personnel to the the states on the border we have had some which I appreciate we have had some offers and calls from other governors that are not on the southwest border that are willing to deploy guard there's a couple different things in play here as you know unfortunately we're heading into hurricane season so for some of these states particularly Texas were very aware that if we get into a national national disaster natural disaster where the guardsmen would otherwise be needed we would look to supplement them through other governors who are willing to supply guard and I guess we've seen that Hurricane Katrina we had Guardsmen from all across the United States and including the territories come and participate in that massive mission and I know if Mississippi's governor hasn't already volunteered them he would but a majority of our National Guardsmen are currently training for an overseas deployment so but but I'm sure you know there's a lot of people back home that didn't deploy I would love to be a part of that mission

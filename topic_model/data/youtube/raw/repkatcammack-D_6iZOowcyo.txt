to help the situation that we're seeing what what is his plan he goes down there and he does a political stunt like many Republicans do that we have seen them do but he actually is not putting forth a plan well there was a plan in place it was President Trump's plan maybe Joe Biden should do a political stunt at the border McCarthy memo is calling on DHS secretary Alejandro mayorcas to either resign immediately or face a potential impeachment inquiry joining me right now is Florida congresswoman house Homeland Security Committee Member and house agriculture Committee Member Kat camek congresswoman it's great to see you this morning thanks very much for being here I know that you were at the border with Kevin McCarthy yesterday what could you tell us about that trip well I can tell you first and foremost our agents need our support more than ever you know this is Thanksgiving week and I am so grateful personally for the work that those men and women do but what I saw boots on the ground here in El Paso was 12 miles of border that had not a single agent on the line every single aging was processing illegals I saw hordes of tent cities and illegals from Venezuela and Nicaragua they were waiting to cross over in groups this is happening every single day and not a single agent is on the line it's getting worse by the day and now with title 42 going away we're looking at potentially 18 000 a day coming across compared to what we're seeing now every day an average of seven to eight thousand encounters a day we cannot sustain this we have lost operational control of the Border well once title 42 officially goes away uh as you said even by Administration officials are expecting the number to be 18 000 people a day coming through if you look at that on a yearly basis that's six and a half million people coming through in the year on top of five million people who have crossed into America on Joe Biden's watch what is the plan you're an elected official what is the plan to deal with this 11 and a half million people in the next three years well unlike the White House we actually do have a plan and I might need to use crayons and write it down and send it over so they can understand it but we'll make sure that they understand despite the fact we've been talking about it for months it was laid out in the commitment to America and even before then president Trump had laid out an excellent plan that had actually stopped much of the issues that we're seeing here today so first and foremost we got to get the agents back on the line we need to reinstate policies like remain in Mexico we've got to get the technology and the financial resources down to the border so there are physical structures in place that can help these agents as Force multipliers one of the crazy things is along our Southwest border along those sectors we have Gates that are wide open and that the Administration has refused to close what is what other message do we have to send to these cartels and then hey the gates are open send people over it's absolutely ridiculous that that's happening and then we need to really get busy on in agreements with the these foreign countries like Nicaragua we don't have any agreements in place where we can send people back so instead we have to parole people into the country where they have a piece of paper that says in five years you need to show up for a court date to get deported you think anybody's actually going to show up we have millions in the country that are here legally now and that is absolutely unacceptable yeah no I know I've been to the Border many times you've got migrants keeping the flow through the southern border Republicans visiting to see this crisis firsthand let's look at what our so-called borders are vice president Kamala Harris was doing yesterday while you were at the border she was in the Philippines watch hello thank you hello hello hello thank you uh there she is she's in the Philippines with fishermen uh congresswoman our border star is greeting fishermen in the Philippines when there's a crisis at the southern border what do you want Kamala Harris to do now you know honestly I I have no words for her every time she opens her mouth it becomes a crisis that the white house needs to clean up uh I know there's one thing that if you care about an issue if you care about something you actually show up so it's clear that her priorities are fishermen in the Philippines and not our men and women who are on uh the line here at the Southwest border nor are our First Responders or our military so I'm glad that on the the week of Thanksgiving she's out giving thanks to fishermen in the Philippines it really shows where the priorities of this White House is and it's absolutely unacceptable and it will a couple years for sure we want to know what you're going to be able to do you have a Slimmer majority Than People expected so what are you going to be able to do to stop this climate change agenda and uh stop the funding that Joe Biden once sent to the IRS he wants if if he hires that 87 000 IRS agents we're going to have 100 166 000 IRS agents compared to what would you say it's 15 or 20 000 border agents right now I know at one point there was twenty thousand but I heard from my sources a lot of people were retiring and resigning and it's down to 15 000 border agents versus 166 IRS agents I mean that in and of itself tells you the priority of this Administration that's what's crazy is that this Administration wants to hire 87 000 IRS agents day one our team the Republican team we're firing 87 000 IRS agents many of whom would have had to have been foreign contractors because the IRS couldn't find the manpower to actually fill those positions we're going to use that money and put that towards our border patrol agents we're about a little over fifteen thousand agents we need upwards of 22. but think about this we have record retirements no one is coming in uh to sign up and go to the the training the academy because they know they're just going to be glorified paper pushers processing illegals into the country so retention is down recruitment is down and of course the the horrific suicides that we've seen agents taking their own lives we've lost three in the last week alone we need to actually do what is right and put America First and the vice president needs to get her tail back here and actually show up at the border and talk to these men and women and hear their stories not a single one of them believes that the border is secure not a single one of them likes what's going on and this is so far beyond Party politics this is about our national security and our sovereignty we need someone in the White House who is going to put America First well I guess it was what 98 people were apprehended at the border who are actually on the terrorist watch list so it's there's that congresswoman thanks for going to the Border uh we know how tough that trip is and we know uh some of the things that you've encountered we've taken the show there five times and uh it's it's pretty discouraging thanks very much have a Happy Thanksgiving to you thank you so much thank you Maria thanks for staying on this issue

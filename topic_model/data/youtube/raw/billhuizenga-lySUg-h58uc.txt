hi everybody this is congressman bill huizinga and I'm honored to be with you I just wish it was in person and I know you do too obviously as this has been kind of a crazy time something that we've never quite seen in this fashion here in the country or frankly around the world we're all dealing with it all having to do some things that we weren't expecting to do from home but I just want to say congratulations tonight this is about you and I know that humbleness is oftentimes something that has talked about in Scouting but tonight's a night not only for you to be proud but I know your parents and and your loved ones your grandmas and grandpas and all those folks that are with you at least in spirit tonight we're all very very proud of you so you know there's a couple of housekeeping things that we can talk about and I'm sure others have probably mentioned too about how a hundred and eighty-eight of you scouts became Eagle Scouts and that is that's quite an accomplishment because as you well know only five percent of the scouts will actually become Eagle Scouts there's another very important connection here to West Michigan which is part of I think the heritage that you are trying to follow which is a man named Gerald our Ford and Gerald Ford has really been a hero of mine he he was a contemporary of my father who was also involved in local politics and some of my earliest political memories are sitting around the dinner table having shall we say robust conversations about politics with with an older brother who was a scout I might add and an older sister and myself and I was quite young and trying to figure out someplace called Vietnam some guy who my dad knew who had just become president of the United States and something called a Watergate and in my young mind I couldn't think of anything other than maybe some sort of Sluis out in a field holding back Watergate water and and that it was some sort of gate and I saw I pounded on the table I said what is a Watergate and that was really my first connection in with with Gerald Ford and he is a man that you should try to emulate I know it's someone that I do but well let's talk a little bit about what is so important about scouting you know first and foremost there's the personal fitness side of that right yeah I mean you're taught to be robust you're taught to be active you're outdoors that is that's part of who you become and it's certainly part of what Gerald Ford became another thing is the citizenship training you know really leadership and citizenship those are skills that get developed yes some people have them in in in some abundance more than others there's that natural leader that we all know that we all maybe have followed whether it's on a football field like Gerald Ford who was captain of the U of M football team or whether it's someone in the classroom it's someone that you get a you know sort of that attracted to because you know that they've kind of got it together and they're they want to be a leader oftentimes but even if they don't want to be and they want to be that quiet leader they still somehow rise to the top so you know that citizenship training was certainly something that was very important to drill for it as well he took that very very seriously and and many in that generation did and I really really hope that your generation doesn't lose that it's a noble and honorable thing to serve your community to serve whether it's in your church or whether it's in a school or whether it's in politics that is something that that we should all look to be involved in and whether you actually run for office or not we want to make sure that you're a good citizen and as Ben Franklin said a good government can only come about with good citizenship and good citizens participating and so it doesn't mean you have to know everything about what's going on but you need to be informed as best you possibly can well here's here's a story though that kind of the third thing the character development that I think so important with with scouting and certainly becoming an Eagle Scout and there's a couple of stories that you're probably familiar I'm sure you're familiar with at least one of them about Gerald Ford and Willis Ward Gerald Ford went to the University of Michigan and was literally working his way through on a job he had a scholarship but he still had to pay for his room and board and and he he worked well the one of the people that he worked with it was a guy named Willis Ward and Willis Ward became his roommate now Willis Ward was kind of an unusual person in the in the 1930s back at the University of Michigan because he was an african-american and he was playing football and he was running track and and the fact that he was roommates with with a white athlete like Gerald Ford was was kind of unusual but Gerald Ford knew that and he wanted to make that statement and there's a there's a great story and if you go to today to the Gerald Ford Museum in Grand Rapids you can still see the football that was the game ball from when University of Michigan beat Georgia Tech and I think the score was someone believable number like three to five it's hard to hard to picture exactly how they scored those those points but it was a tough fought battle and at the end of the day Willis Ward was not allowed to play in that game and Gerald Ford went to the coach and said if he's not playing I'm not playing and as captain of the team no one else is gonna play and it was it was really one of those moments where could have been easy quite quite easy and there's a lot of pressure on on Jerry Ford to to not do the right thing and that that leads me to something that I I think most of us are familiar with there's a saying that's called a character is doing the right thing while nobody is watching have you heard that you probably have maybe your parents have as well you know carrot is doing the right thing when nobody is watching and I think that's true I think that is a very true sentiment but I've amended that actually after watching and reading about drilled for sometimes character is doing the right thing when everybody is watching and frankly oftentimes they're telling you to not do what you think is the right thing in your gut and in your heart and in your mind and here's that second story about Gerald Ford and the character that he had you know there's Watergate that I referenced earlier it's one of my earliest political memories was it was a really a dark moment in in the US political history the the President had lied he had sent a number of folks to do some illegal activities and Richard Nixon was just just really focused on trying to win this reelection and ironically he would have probably won it very easily but he ended up getting caught in this live and his whole administration got caught in this lie and it led to impeachment hearings and rather than being impeached the president resigned and Gerald Ford who had been appointed as the vice president suddenly becomes president of the United States and he's gotten an election in the not-too-distant future so he had all kinds of advisors telling him you know Jerry the thing to do is just let it move forward let President Nixon stand trial let let him go to jail if he has to do that let him pay those fines and Jerry Ford said you know that might be the easy thing to do because frankly all of these advisers were saying you should do this because if you don't it's going to harm your ability to get elected president in 1976 and for just didn't feel right about it and if you read any of his books or books about him he certainly wrestled with that a lot but in his mind he decided to do what he thought was the right thing which was to heal the nation to try to get it beyond that and most presidential scholars believe that that action did cost him the 1976 election to a man named Jimmy Carter so as I said you know doing the right thing charactered is doing the right thing when nobody is watching but sometimes character is doing the right thing when everybody is watching and you were under so much scrutiny and kind of maybe one last one last thing here one of my colleagues and in Washington talks about whether you're going to be a thermometer or a thermostat now think about that what is a thermometer do well a thermometer either in your home or outside measures the temperature what's what's happening right it'll just reflects what's happening in in in the atmosphere around you a thermostat on the other hand well either heat or cool your house right and you think about that if if you're trying if you're a little warm in the house what are you gonna do you're gonna turn that air-conditioning on you're gonna turn it down or if you're cold in the middle of the wintertime and you're gonna move that thermostat to try to adjust that heat I think real leaders and this is his point real leaders are those thermostats they're not just a thermometer they're not just reflecting what's going on around them but they're actually trying to move society they're trying to move the dialogue in a direction that is actually beneficial so I want you to kind of think about that go and do a little reading and research on Willis Ward and the relationship with Gerald Ford go back and look at what Gerald Ford did and said about pardoning Richard Nixon and why he felt he needed to do that and then think about that think about being a thermostat not a thermometer because you know you are the young men of character that this country is you know really frankly and for me is giving me hope and I think the country will see that you are going to be those leaders whether it's in your church or whether it's in your company that you might be working at or frankly that you might own or whether you get involved in politics the the character that you are developing now is is vitally important and I want to encourage you to keep that up and think about ways that you can continue to serve your community and I'm gonna leave you with a quote from Gerald Ford this is something that he said about his Eagle Scout badge and I'm gonna read it here so I'm gonna kind of look off a little bit but Gerald Ford said this one of the proudest moments of my life came in the court of honor when I was awarded the Eagle Scout badge I still have that badge it is a treasured possession well it should be and and you should be proud and can be proud and just remember so many of us in that are in your in your family so many of us that are in your in your sphere whether it's at school or in the troop we're very very proud of you and congratulations on this great great accomplishment so all the best and we'll talk to you again soon

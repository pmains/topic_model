MR. MCGOVERN: I YIELD TO THE   GENTLEMAN FROM CALIFORNIA, MR.   SHERMAN. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE   GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED FOR  THREE MINUTES. MR. SHERMAN: AFTER DECADES OF  STRUGGLE THIS HOUSE WILL   RECOGNIZE THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE  JUST IN TIME FOR THE LAST FEW  SURVIVORS TO SEE IT. WE SHOULD HAVE RECOGNIZED THE  GENOCIDE BUT WE DIDN'T BECAUSE   WE WERE TOLD WE HAD A GREAT  ALLIANCE WITH TURKEY.  EARLIER THIS MONTH, TURKISH  FORCES SHELLED NEAR AND  DELIBERATELY BRACKETTED AMERICAN BASES. AMERICANS FLED IN UNSEEMLY   HASTE. GREAT ALLY.  IT HAS BEEN A GREAT ALLIANCE FOR TURKEY.  WE DEFENDED IT FROM COMMUNISM IN THE 1940'S, DEFENDED THEM FROM   THE SOVIET UNION FOR DECADES AND PROVIDED THEM WITH $23 BILLION   IN AID.  IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE   COUNTERACT TURKEY'S GENOCIDE   DENIAL BECAUSE GENOCIDE DENIAL   IS THE LAST ACT OF A GENOCIDE. FIRST YOU OBLITERATE A PEOPLE. THEN YOU SEEK TO OBLITERATE  THEIR MEMORY.  FINALLY YOU SEEK TO OBLITERATE   THE MEMORY OF THE OBLITERATION.  BECAUSE GENOCIDE DENIAL IS ALSO  THE FIRST STEP IN THE NEXT   GENOCIDE.  WHEN HITLER'S CADRES WONDERED IF THEY COULD GET AWAY WITH THE   HOLOCAUST, HE WAS ABLE TO ASSURE THEM, WHO TODAY SPEAKS OF THE  ANILINGS OF THE ARMENIANS? AND WE MUST RECOGNIZE THIS   GENOCIDE TO REMOVE THE STAIN ON  AMERICA'S HONOR BECAUSE UP UNTIL NOW WE HAVE REFUSED TO   ACKNOWLEDGE TRUTH AND WE HAVE  BEEN SILENT ALL IN AN EFFORT AT  APPEASEMENT. THE FACT IS, MANY OTHER  COUNTRIES HAVE RECOGNIZE THAT  GENOCIDE, INCLUDING BELGIUM,   CANADA, GREECE, ITALY, ARGENTINA AND GERMANY. AND WHEN FRANCE HAD THE COURAGE  TO PASS A GENOCIDE RECOGNITION   RESOLUTION, THEY WERE THREATENED WITH A BOYCOTT OF ALL THEIR  EXPORTS. IN FACT, WHAT HAPPENED WAS A   FOUR-FOLD INCREASE IN FRENCH   EXPORTS TO TURKEY. THE ONLY THING WORSE THAN  UNNECESSARY APPEASEMENT IS   APPEASING A POWER THAT WILL NOT  ACTUALLY RESPOND.  TODAY, GERMANY IS A GREAT AND  PROSPEROUS DEMOCRACY, A GREAT  ALLY OF THE UNITED STATES. WHERE WOULD GERMANY BE IF TO   THIS DAY THEY DENIED THE   HOLOCAUST? TURKEY WILL BE A GREAT ALLY OF   THE UNITED STATES AND A  PROSPEROUS AND MODERN NATION   ONLY WHEN TURKEY RECOGNIZES THE  FIRST GENOCIDE OF THE 20TH   CENTURY. I COMMEND THE GENTLEMAN FOR  BRINGING UP THIS RULE AND FOR  ANSWERING THE QUESTION, WHY THIS IS SO IMPORTANT TO DO THIS   TODAY. AND I YIELD BACK

and now it's my honor to introduce the gentleman from Florida representative Greg stupid Democrats lose they try to change the rules so had single power in the house in the Senate and in the White House there were calls to change the makeup of the U.S Supreme Court because it was the only backstop to their horrible unconstitutional policies in this country so what did it what's their solution to that problem let's pack the court you heard calls after calls Jerry Nadler and others stood in front of the U.S Supreme Court and calls to expand and pack the quarter because their unconstitutional things that they tried to do in this country were being thwarted by a constitutional Court we stand up here to get today together to keep the nine and that's what the Republican conference is going to sit together and fight for because we believe in the history of this country we believe that you shouldn't use political weaponization to try to change the outcome of the court for political purposes they need us to remain separate and we should keep the nine and I stand with my colleagues to do that

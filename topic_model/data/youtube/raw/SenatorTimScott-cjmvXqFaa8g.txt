thank you Mr chairman strong competitive and perhaps most importantly accessible Capital markets are essential to fostering a healthy entrepreneurial ecosystem and the US economy that's why the passage of the jobs act Mr quarterman as you said 10 years ago was a game changer a game changer lawmakers recognized that there was nothing partisan about making it easier for our country's companies to Spur Innovation hire new workers invest in their communities and power U.S economic growth and work together on a bipartisan basis to pass Common Sense legislation aimed at doing just that and now as our economy looks to complete its rebound from the impacts of the pandemic this body is presented with an opportunity to build the on the enormous success of the jobs act and once again to jump start Capital formation and the creation of good jobs by companies that serve as the lifeblood of the American economy the jobs acts creation of emerging Growth Company or EGC status to provide a flexible regulatory regime for small companies that are still working to scale their businesses has been a resounding success case in point and since 2014 roughly 90 percent of companies have gone public using the EGC status Mr quadman EGC designation has made IPOs more attractive for low Revenue high growth companies by smoothing the transition to the public markets without compromising investor protection however some companies like biotech firms have long product development timelines reached the end of their five-year exemption limit and still aren't generating enough Revenue to support the much steeper compliance costs that come with a loss of EGC status how would my legislation extending the EGC scaled regulatory regime to 10 years benefit companies and the broader economy it does two very important things Senator Scott number one it allows uh regulations to be tailored to that company right so if you take a biotech firm as an example right they have they have very heavy Capital needs but they're not necessarily selling anything yet right so if you take a look at let's say all the controls around Revenue they just they just create costs with no meaning um and in fact what those what those extra dollars do for Regulatory Compliance which is meaningless actually takes money away from research as well as job creation number two what it does it allows those companies actually to grow into the appropriate levels of controls and process that are needed to have the certainty that they do need when they do reach their full full bloom public company status so it allows for a greater ramp up because quite frankly with those Innovative firms five years isn't long enough in 10 years is a better time frame thank you sir I look forward to working with my colleagues to build bipartisan support for this common since legislation U.S capital markets are the gold standard globally and help make the American economy the Envy of the world they provide a system where the average American working family can invest their savings into projects and earn a tangible economic reward enabling their dreams of buying a house sending their children to college and retiring with Economic Security a little over a year ago I sat right here and had a conversation with SEC chair Gary ginsler about the significant ways the retail investment landscape has evolved over the last couple decades and discovered that we both strongly agree on one point in particular increased retail investor Market participation is a good thing for America now it's not that often that Gary ginsler and I find common ground and that point would be supported by chairman Brown if he were here so it was encouraging that we both seemed to see eye to eye about the benefits of more people finally beginning to gain access to this powerful wealth building engine do you agree with that statement and is more Main Street investors getting involved in the market a positive thing it's a very positive thing so allowing mainstream investors to enter into the marketplace creates wealth of Main Street right so the problem that we have seen over the last 20 years or so many of the many of the capital raising measures that are happening are only happening in 20 counties in the United States so we've actually seen a calcification to some degree of our Marketplace what the jobs act did and one of the reasons why we think it is important to do additional amendments to it so let's say with crowdfunding the credit investor rules expanding those it will actually allow for retail investors to have more opportunities to create wealth and it can be done in a particular way that will actually strengthen investor protections and frankly if the SEC is on the job that should not be a problem thank you sir

244 years ago on july 4th 1776 13 colonies declared their independence from england and the oldest and greatest experiment in democracy began it was founded on the belief that all people should enjoy life liberty and the pursuit of happiness this fourth of july looks a lot different doesn't it but we still pause today to thank those in uniform who risk their lives to defend our freedoms every day and this year we also pause to thank the heroes and heroines who've emerged during this pandemic are essential workers and first responders who are continuing to put their own health at risk to care for others we know that their sacrifices are great and we would not be celebrating today at all if not for their tireless and selfless efforts to protect us we also know that it's impossible to have life liberty and the pursuit of happiness without access to quality healthcare without clean water to drink and air to breathe or without the true justice for all americans their preamble of our constitution begins with these words we the people of the united states in order to form a more perfect union our country has made great progress over the last 244 years but there's still plenty of work to do for all of us so on this birthday of our nation let us each each of us who is able to renew our vow to do our parts let's aim high let's work hard let's embrace the golden rule and treat each other the way we want to be treated and let's never never give up happy fourth of july

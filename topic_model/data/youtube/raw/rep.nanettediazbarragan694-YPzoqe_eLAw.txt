dr. Robinson we've talked a lot today about how trap laws are medically unnecessary requirements imposed on abortion providers and women's health care centers can you maybe elaborate a little bit on the hardships that low-income women must face in states that have the trap laws forcing women to continue a pregnancy that is just kind of a basic violation of a woman's basic humanity her rights and her freedoms we know that when women can't access the health care that they need be it an abortion or contraception that it can further push them into poverty and there's good studies that that support that it's not just our opinion that's an absolute fact it's just really important for patients to be able to access the care that they need in a timely fashion and that women should be able to access the care they need in their community and these laws is making it difficult for them to do that thank you the gentleman's time is expired

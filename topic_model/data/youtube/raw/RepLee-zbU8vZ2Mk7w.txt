with me now to talk about this is us congresswoman barbara Lee good morning good morning so ash Carter went on to say the fight is far from over he said that the United States and its allies will defeat Isis do you believe him well first let me just say that my thoughts and prayers go out to the Keating family this tragic loss and this is an example of why I have been calling for Congress to do our job we're missing in action and it's very important that the American public understand the costs and the consequences of this war yeah rightfully so the president has not sent combat truth into the region however we see as a result of this tragedy what can happen and and so I think the American public needs to demand that their members of Congress call for a debate to talk about and understand really what this new war footing means and was it running in tails in terms of a long term commitment to what it appears to be now a perpetual war so Congress on is it likely that any debate will occur since you know it's an election year President Obama's in his last term can this go forward can such a debate happen we're here to do our job and it should happen I mean the president put forward an authorization over a year ago this past January the speaker and the leader of the Senate Mitch McConnell they kind of thought they talked about it but nothing has happened yet and whether we're in an election year or not we have our constitutional responsibilities to the people of our country and that means we have to exercise our job and do our work and bring forth an authorization we have to stop politicizing issues of war and peace we see what is happening most military experts have said that there's no military solution we have to come up with a strategy one that's led by the region and we have to make sure that the public buys into this our young men women who are doing everything they asked us to do our troops they're doing what we set them to do and you know we have a duty and responsibility to protect them to let them know that the Congress supports these efforts and so it's up to the speaker and the Senate Majority Leader to bring forth a resolution and authorization that we can debate it well the public will then know what is taking place and then we'll have a you know a real standing in terms of what is sure it's not what we need to do the president just said 250 more advisors you know which is in essence boots on the ground right in that region do you think that the president should have done that or would you prefer to see him not send any US troops or advisors to that war zone until there's a debate in Congress I'm very worried about mission creep of course additional forces were sent into Iraq several months ago now we have another 250 quote advisors which we see unfortunately we're putting our advisors in harm's way and so what the president is doing in terms of his responsibilities of commander-in-chief he is exercising without congressional oversight and without congressional authority the Congress has a really important and serious role in this the president and the administration they're using an authorization fact it was passed I think back in 2001 2002 one that I voted against in the 2002 Iraq resolution the president in terms of the use of force needs that authorization needs that from Congress we need to debate it some members may support it some members may not but the public deserves that and we need to insist that the speaker and the Senate Majority Leader bring forth a resolution this is a country now that's in warm it's we've been on war footing for many many years now at least since 2001 it's a serious serious moment for us we have very serious national security threats why in the world is Congress missing in action with the people's house the people deserve us to rep sent them properly and appropriately all right congresswoman barbara Lee thanks so much for

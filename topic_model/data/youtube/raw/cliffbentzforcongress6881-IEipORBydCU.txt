[Applause] do you have a hunting license I don't have 104 years and the reason of course when I went into the legislature 12 years ago I they don't pay you very much and so in your in your your spare time when you're not doing all this work in the legislation you have to have a real job and you have to be making money so I would return and I would go back to my law practice and do my very very best to do contracts and leases and other things and then would then I turned back to go back to say and so my time for vacations has been extremely limited for the past ten years and particularly for hunting and so I have I I don't know how many guns that I have that I used to hunt with before before I didn't have time but I enjoyed hunting the the I did have one time another guy and I had a bet about who hunted the most and he's Mia at me I think five dollars that he hunted more than I and I was just two words I I had won the argument the two words were ground squirrels because I don't know how many thousands of ground squirrels have met their demise by virtue of my shooting them but that those days those days are gone because of I haven't at the time by the way I support hunting it and every every type of hunting the fact that I don't have time to do it is kind of sad but there's the matter of paid one's bills [Applause]

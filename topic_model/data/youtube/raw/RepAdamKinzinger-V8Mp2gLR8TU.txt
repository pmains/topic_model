CONFERENCE BUT FOR OUR COUNTRY. I LIKE WHAT HE HAS PLANNED  AHEAD. JOINING US NOW, REPUBLICAN  CONGRESSMAN ADAM KINZINGER, A  MEMBER OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE  INVESTIGATING THE JANUARY 6TH  ATTACK ON THE CAPITOL. VERY GOOD TO HAVE YOU ON THE  SHOW. IF YOU COULD EXPLAIN THIS HOLD  THAT THE EXTREMISTS HAVE ON KEV? >> YEAH. I MEAN, IT BLOWS ME AWAY EVERY  DAY. BUT I GUESS IMKIND OF NOT REALLY SURPRISED ANYMORE. LOOK, I THINK IT COMES TO THIS. THERE'S THE MITCH McCONNELL WAY  WHICH IS THIS TRUMP GUY YOU TALK ABOUT. I'VE NEVER HEARD OF HIM. AND THEN THERE'S THE KEVIN  McCARTHY WAY. KEVIN, THE ONLY PLACE HE HAS TO  GO IS TO THE SPEAKERSHIP. HE'S NOT GOING TO BE GOVERNOR OR PRESIDENT. THAT IS WHAT HE DESPERATELY  NEEDS. I THINK HE MADE THE DECISION A  WEEK OR TWO AFTER JANUARY 6TH. HE WAS THE GUY THAT LITERALLY  BROUGHT DONALD TRUMP BACK TO  POLITICAL LIFE. DONALD TRUMP WAS DOWN IN  MAR-A-LAGO RAGE PRESS RELEASING. NOBODY WAS PAYING ATTENTION TO  HIM AND McCARTHY SHOWS UP, TAKES THE PADDLES AND BRINGS HIM BACK  TO LIFE WITH THAT PICTURE. I THINK HE MADE THE DECISION I'M GOING TO EMBRACE DONALD TRUMP SO I CAN BECOME SPEAKER OVER THE  NEXT TWO YEARS AND THERE IS NO  DOUBT THAT PEOPLE LIKE MARJORIE  TAYLOR GREENE WITH CRAZY TWEETS  AND CRAZY THINGS SHE SAYS HAS A  HOLD ON THE BASE AND CAN  THREATEN HIS POWER. SO HE'S HUGGING IT, AS I SAID IN THE SWEET. HE'S HUGGING THE SKUNK. YOU'RE GOING TO GET SPRAYED, BUT THAT'S HIS DECISION. >> BUT WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND,  ADAM, OBVIOUSLY, IS THAT THERE  ARE PEOPLE MORE CONSERVATIVE,  LESS RADICAL IN YOUR CAUCUS WHO  WILL ALSO BE DECIDING WHETHER  KEVIN McCARTHY IS SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OR NOT, AND I USUALLY  FOUND AT LEAST WHEN I WAS THERE  THAT IF SPEAKER LURCHED ONE WAY  TOO FAR, HE WAS ALWAYS PULLED  BACK TO THE MORE OR LESS THE  CENTER. CENTER RIGHT. BY PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE. I'M CURIOUS ARE THERE MEMBERS IN THE GOP CAUCUS THAT DON'T WANT  KEVIN McCARTHY TO BALANCE -- BOW TO THE CONSPIRACY CAUCUS? >> YEAH. YOU MAKE A GREAT POINT. BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT THE LOUD  ONES. THESE AREN'T THE ONES THAT TWEET ALL THE TIME. THEY'RE NOT THE ONES THAT ARE  GOING TO TALK ABOUT JEWISH SPACE LASERS AND MAKE CRAZY RACIST  JOKES JUST TO GET TWITTER  FOLLOWERS. THESE ARE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS  THAT TAKE GOVERNING SERIOUSLY. I HAVE TAUGHT THE PEOPLE THAT  WOULD SURPRISE KEVIN McCARTHY TO KNOW THEY'RE UPSET WITH HIM, AND THEY HAVE NO INTENTION OF VOTING FOR HIM IN A YEAR. NOW, THAT CAN CHANGE. AS YOU KNOW, ALL THE PRESSURE  AND WE'VE GOT TO GET TO 2018 AND HAVE TO BE A UNITED PARTY  PARTICULARLY AFTER WE TAKE THE  MAJORITY. BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE UPSET WITH  HIM, AND HE'S ONLY RESPONDING TO THE NOISIEST PEOPLE. AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT. I MEAN, KEVIN McCARTHY IS SMART. KEVIN McCARTHY KNOWS IF HE  HAPPENS TO WIN BY CATERING TO  THIS WHAT USED TO BE THE EXOTIC  PART OF OUR PARTY, THAT THEY'RE  GOING TO NOT NECESSARILY SUPPORT HIM OR HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO  CONTINUE TO BEG THEM FOR THEIR  SUPPORT. I GUESS IT IS SO IMPORTANT FOR  HIM TO WIN THAT VOTE IN A YEAR  THAT HE'LL PAY ANY PRICE. >> CONGRESSMAN KINZINGER, GOOD  MORNING. I WANT TO SWITCH GEARS TO YOUR  WORK ON THE JANUARY 6TH SELECT  COMMITTEE. ONE OF YOUR FELLOW MEMBERS,  CONGRESSMAN SCHIFF SAID  YESTERDAY THAT HE ANTICIPATES  THAT WILL BE A DECISION THIS  WEEK ON A CONTEMPT REFERRAL FOR  MARK MEADOWS WHO, OF COURSE, WAS FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S CHIEF  OF STAFF AND WHO TO THIS POINT  HAS NOT COOPERATED WITH THE  PROCEEDINGS THERE. GIVE US AN UPDATE AS TO WHERE  THAT STANDS. DO YOU THINK THAT IS  APPROPRIATE, AND COULD OTHERS  BEYOND MEADOWS ALSO SEE A  REFERRAL? >> YEAH, LOOK, WE ARE GOING TO  PURSUE THIS DOGGEDLY TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH. AND I THINK IF PEOPLE DENY  SUBPOENAS, WE WILL GO AFTER  THEM. I EXPECT THAT THERE IS GOING TO  BE MOVEMENT PARTICULARLY ON MARK MEADOWS THAT WE'LL KNOW ABOUT  SHORTLY. IN THE NEXT DAY, NEXT TWO DAYS  OR SO. AND I THINK THE PEOPLE WILL BE  PLEASED WITH THAT. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS  COMMITTEE IS GOING TO GET TO  ANSWERS. WE'RE GOING TO DO WHAT WE NEED  TO DO. WE'RE NOT GOING TO RUSH  ANYTHING. BUT WE'RE ALSO GOING TO MAKE  SURE WE'RE NOT ALLOWING TRUMP  AND HIS FOLKS TO DRAG THIS OUT  TO GET TO THE END OF THIS  CONGRESS. WE ARE GOING TO GET THIS DONE. SO I EXPECT SOME UPDATES THIS  WEEK FOR SURE. AND I THINK WE'LL GET TO A  SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION WITH MARK  MEADOWS. >> AND WE HAVE THIS UPDATE ON  STEVE BANNON. THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS  ACCUSING HIM OR HIS DEFENSE TEAM OF LODGING, QUOTE, PRIF LOUSE  LEGAL COMPLAINTS IN ORDER TO  CAUSE A PUBLIC BATTLE WITH  PROSECUTORS AS THE ONE-TIME  SENIOR ADVISER TO FORMER  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP FACES  CHARGES FOR CRIMINAL CONTEMPT OF THE HOUSE JANUARY 6TH SELECT  COMMITTEE. POLITICO REPORTING PROSECUTORS  SAID IN A FILING LAST NIGHT AN  ATTORNEY FOR BANNON HAD  REPEATEDLY REBUFFED THEIR  EFFORTS TO NEGOTIATE AN  EVIDENCE-SHARING AGREEMENT. A STANDARD PART OF THE PROCESS  IN CRIMINAL TRIALS. INSTEAD, THE PROSECUTION SAID  BANNON'S DEFENSE USED A PUBLIC  COURT FILING ON WEDNESDAY IN A  STATEMENT TO THE WASHINGTON POST TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE CASE. A PROSECUTOR WRITES IN COURT  DOCUMENTS, QUOTE, THE DEFENSE IS MISLEADING CLAIMS, FAILURE TO  CONFER, UNEXPLAINED WHOLESALE  OPPOSITION, AND EXTRAJUDICIAL  STATEMENTS MAKE CLEAR THE  DEFENSE'S REAL PURPOSE TO ABUSE  CRIMINAL DISCOVERY TO TRY THIS  CASE IN THE MEDIA RATHER THAN IN THE COURT. BANNON HAS SAID PUBLICLY HE  INTENDS TO USE HIS COURT  PROCEEDINGS AS A FORUM TO DO  BATTLE WITH DEMOCRATIC LEADERS  AND THE DOJ. THE NEXT HEARING IS SET FOR  DECEMBER 7TH. >> ADAM, THIS ISN'T REALLY A  SURPRISE. PEOPLE WHO WORKED WITH BANNON IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND OUTSIDE OF  THE WHITE HOUSE TOLD ME AFTER  ALL THIS WENT DOWN THAT HE  COULDN'T BE HAPPIER. ALL HE WANTS IS ATTENTION. THEY CALL HIM A GADFLY. SO YEAH, IF ATTENTION -- IF HE  GETS ATTENTION GOING TO JAIL,  THAT'S FINE WITH HIM. >> YEAH. IT'S PROBABLY TRUE. LOOK, I MEAN, TRUMP CALLED HIM  SLOPPY STEVE AND WITHIN SIX  MONTHS HE'S BACK TRYING TO DO  TRUMP'S BIDDING. BY THE WAY, THAT IS SOMETHING  THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND ABOUT  ANY OF THIS DYNAMIC. HOW HE CAN UNLEASH ON PEOPLE AND YET, THEY STILL KIND OF COME  CRAWLING BACK. BUT WITH STEVE BANNON YEAH, HE  WANTS THE ATTENTION. IT'S THE DEATH OF SHAME. THERE'S NO SHAME IN IT. HE DOESN'T CARE IF HE HAS A  CRIMINAL RECORD. HE CARES IF PEOPLE LISTEN TO HIS PODCAST. THAT'S WHAT MATTERS TO HIM. PODCASTS AND DO I GET FOLLOWERS  ON WHATEVER HE IS USING. SO LOOK, BUT IT SENT A VERY  SERIOUS MESSAGE, I THINK, TO  ANYBODY ELSE THAT IS JEFFREY  CLARK, ET CETERA, THINKING OF  DENYING THE JANUARY 6TH  COMMITTEE'S LEGITIMATE ABILITY  TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE TO KNOW. AND I THINK REGARDLESS, STEVE  MAY WANT TO GO OUT AND BE A  CELEBRITY WITH HIS LITTLE  WHATEVER HE'S GOT GOING ON, HIS  PODCAST, BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE  THAT DON'T WANT TO GO TO JAIL  THAT DON'T WANT A CRIMINAL  RECORD. AND I THINK THIS IS A REALLY  SOLID MESSAGE TO HIM EVEN IF WE  MAKE AN INADVERTENT HERO OUT OF  MR. PODCASTING McGEE OVE

Mr Speaker I rise today in strong opposition to repeal and replace bill offered by my Republican colleagues I've never believed Obamacare was perfect but it was a step in the right direction we will only move our health care policy forward by working together to build on very real successes of ACA and fix the actual problems with the law but this legislation as proposed as none of that and in fact takes us in the opposite direction under the proposed legislation ten million Americans would lose their health insurance according to an analysis from Standard & Poor's seniors would be charged much more than what others pay for health care and the 3.2 million Illinoisans who depend on Medicaid will face cuts to their coverage mr. speaker this house is recklessly and unnecessarily rushing to a vote before we have basic answers certainly we need to know from the Congressional Budget Office how many people just bill will and will not cover and how much it will cost we need to set aside the politics and work in a bipartisan way to give all Americans quality affordable health care I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose the bill and I yield back so

Samri white the Office of Environmental Management mission includes managing radioactive waste therefore I want to ask you about the nearly 150 shipments of high-level liquid nuclear race waste from Canada that is being trucked through Buffalo and Syracuse New York to Savannah River Site in South Carolina the agency you hope to lead approved these shipments based on data showing that trucking solid nuclear waste can be done safely however this waste is in liquid form if God forbid there is an accident with just one truck and a single drop gets in a city's water supply it could completely destroy it whereas if powder spilled it could be retrieved with limited contamination I am seriously concerned that the Office of Environmental Management approved these transports and I'm concerned that the communities through which might this waste may transit are not fully informed and won't know how to handle this bill don't you think that before do-e transports liket liquid nuclear waste for the first time we and the surrounding communities should be fully prepared and ready to handle any potential spills I have not been fully briefed on that particular issue but I can share with you that in my experience stakeholder engagement stakeholder outreach all of these things are fundamentally important to our ability to complete our mission safely and cost-effectively and I can commit to you that I will work closely with your staff this committee and all the interested stakeholder parties because communication on these issues is thank you very very important do you agree that the properties of solid substances are different than those of liquid substances and if you do do you think that these shipments should be halted until do-e completes a new environmental impact statement that takes into account the properties of liquid nuclear waste so there is a difference between liquid and solid I agree with that absolutely and what I can commit to you is that if confirmed I will look into this issue get a better understanding of the pathway so far and the path forward and keep you informed thank you dr.

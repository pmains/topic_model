thank you madam speaker i yield myself such time as i may consume the gentlewoman from indiana i rise today in support of h.r 2477 the beneficiary enrollment notification eligibility simplification act or the benny's act this important bipartisan legislation will improve education and outreach to americans approaching medicare age while simplifying the part b enrollment process which hasn't been updated in over 50 years currently medicare enrollment is often too far too complicated confusing and in the event of a mistake very costly the consequences of making a simple mistake in the enrollment process can be significant with a lifetime late enrollment penalty of 10 percent for every year a beneficiary hasn't enrolled in part b according to a congressional research service report last year approximately 764 000 part b enrollees paid an average penalty of nearly 30 percent higher medicare premiums this that is a super heavy financial burden these medicare beneficiaries will carry throughout their retirement that's what the bennies act aims to help seniors avoid this vital bill will help prevent late enrollment penalties by sending an advance notice about the enrollment medicare enrollment process to americans approaching medicare eligibility it will also prevent gaps in coverage by requiring that part b coverage begin during the first month after an individual enrolls through either the initial enrollment period or general enrollment period these long overdue reforms will significantly improve the health and well-being of medicare beneficiaries and protect america's seniors from unnecessary penalties and unexpected health care bills with that i reserve the balance of my time the gentlewoman from indiana reserves

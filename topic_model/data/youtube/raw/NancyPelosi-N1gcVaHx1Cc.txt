soul of Tibet his holiness Dalai Lama we believe is the manifestation of Buddha of compassion jealousy jealousy and Tibet are inseparable the lamas and Tibetan people are forever connected as long as there is the best as long as there is dividing people His Holiness Dalai Lama will return to this world to elevate the suffering of the Tibetan people forever as you just saw the prayer led by five Mishima's they are the nuns who got a PhD or doctorate degree for the first time in the history of Tibet as for the vision of His Holiness dialog [Applause] this year we also held the first-ever Tibetan national woman conference we also adopted the revised Tibetan woman empowerment policy we also have Tibetan woman national day and during the National woman conference his holiness Dalai Lama kindly graced the meeting and blessed the occasion his holiness is a big-time advocate of women rights so in 1960s after we came to India in 1963 we had women representation in the Tibetan Parliament since then his holidays has been a biggest advocate of women rights and some people do call him the feminist the Lama and soon you are going to listen to a song of women empowerment policy also I know madam Leader Nancy Pelosi and the Congress delegation wanted to know about the state of the woman in the Tibetan society but under the leadership of His Holiness Dalai Lama Tibetan leader are doing well and will do better as we move forward I would also like to acknowledge my colleagues chief justice Commissioner Goodell LA and also honorable speaker of departments Kimbo of sonatine bella for being part of these felicitations today here we are here to deeply appreciate the US delegation led by Leader Nancy Pelosi and senior Republican Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner and I also like to acknowledge representative allude angle representative Jim McGovern represented Betty McCollum represented Judy Chu represented Joyce Betty the personal privilege I of health for coming to Dharamsala to be with us your delegation sends a message of hope to Tibetans inside Tibet your delegation sends a message of justice to China your delegation sends a message of freedom to the world as you can see smiles with the Tibetan people and children they reflect the smiles of six million Tibetans inside Tibet as well I would like to have special mention of charge DFS Merrick KL Coulson here and also they were prize for being the main coordinator of this and USAID India mission director Marquis white and from the US Embassy and our friend Graham mayor and one who's missing was not here is Richard Gere his father is celebrating his 95th birthday so he could not be here but he walked on behalf of ICT to make this delegation rich Dharamsala as madam leader said yesterday it was three years ago when I was in DC madam leader representative McGovern we discussed and came out eight points among those eight points seven points were all implemented which means you all are unlike other politicians who just talk the talk but you walk the walk as well and among those eight coins one was to visit Tibet and leader nancy pelosi led the delegation visited Tibet and she said we don't want to see the golden gold painted roof of monastery but we want to see the real practice of Buddhism among man a nun to put it politely she and the delegation were quite frank with the Chinese leaders when they said His Holiness is revered and respected by millions of people around the world including us right in the face of Chinese leaders is the very courageous on your path and leader nancy pelosi is not only has been with us the Tibetan cause and being a friend with solidness for so long but also is grooming and inviting other young Congress men and women Jim Betty Judy Joyce and Pramila who will be with us for decades to come like Nancy Pelosi and lead the march of freedom towards Tibet I would also like to congratulate Leader Nancy Pelosi for being ordered by the Freedom House because you represent an advocate of freedom around the world particularly for the Tibetan people madam you deserve it but as you know freedom house has come up with and Freedom Index of around the world a China is in the bottom two years ago freedom of index showed Tibet right at the bottom just above Syria we all have read about what's going on in Syria in the headlines of newspapers but you barely read about what is going on inside Tibet and the reporters without borders said that it is more difficult to get into Tibet than North Korea again we read about North Korea in the headlines of news media but not so much about Tibet as we gather here 147 Tibetans have burned themselves committed sin simulation just this year three Tibetans burn themselves just last week on May 2nd on the eve of your visit here one more teenager committed self-immolation even though we discourage cell simulation but the self-immolation continues in tibet that reflects the desperate and determination of the Tibetan people what they are saying is occupation of Tibet is unacceptable repression of Tibetans is unbearable that they will give up their life for the cause of Tibet even teenagers are pushed to burn themselves and as we celebrate this day of your visit here longer monastery the largest in Tibet is being demolished it's a 12-month project from 12,000 monks and nuns it is reduced to 5,000 monks and nuns and these five seven thousand monks and nuns are expelled from longer which includes Chinese Buddhist as well so this is the situation in Tibet but Chinese government is trying to convert make the bet into China or Chinese town and Tibetan into Chinese people they are using severe measures and what I call 3s1 subjugation or suppression of the Tibetan people number two providing subsidies to Chinese migrants to move to Tibet and all of them the situation hurts they are taking advantage of the summer in Tibet because in winter Tibet is still debating majority for we Tibetans took 3,500 years ago we moved from 3,000 meters high to 4000 meters high in the Tibetan altitude because read grows at 3,000 meters high money can grow on for 4000 meters high when we discovered Bali we moved from 3,000 to 4,000 meters high hence no matter how many Chinese migrants moved to Tibet it will take 500 to 1,000 years of genetic adaptation for Chinese to move and settle on the Tibetan Plateau the hands Tibet is severe in majority in winter one the suppression is removed subsidies is remove and global warming does not advertise Tibet will remain majority Tibetan people but we do believe [Applause] we do believe that the Chinese project will not succeed for three A's Institute attitude and aptitude and I already told you as its rotavator 4,000 meters high it will take generations of Chinese to settle on the Tibetan attitude number two its attitude Tibetan attitude is based on rugged and resilience of the mountain people we've been there for thousands of years we will be there for thousands of years the Tibetan spirit will not die dependent people will not give up all those Tibetans were committing self immolation all the three nuns who committed suicide as the lion guard monasteries being demolished their spirit the aspiration is they want to see the turn of His Holiness Dalai Lama Tibet and freedom be restored to Tibetan people and our aptitude is based on Buddhism or null and a tradition of His Holiness delemus teaching Buddhism is 2500 years old communism is 100 years old there is no competition between the two after communism is gone Tibetan Buddhism will be there for another two thousand years Tibet will be there Tibetan people will be there Tibetan spirit will be there in the last fifty eight years we have been standing tall under the leadership of His Holiness the Lama because we have friends like you did an NC policy and the US delegation we have come all the way to them Salah because of our leader his holiness Dalai Lama and you do support the just cause of Tibet and in Salinas has the unique style or quality that attracts people from the right and the left from the Republican Party and the Democratic Party you know there's only one person Washington DC who could bring Senator Edward Kennedy and Jesse Helms in the same room or that happens only when he's all enlisted a llama goes to DC and us when US Congressional Medal was given to his holiness is a llama Leader Nancy Pelosi and President George Bush and Laura Bush was there to facilitate the occasion and President George Bush then told his holliness normally I don't get along with her but for you I make it exceptional I'm here to support the cause and since Franklin Roosevelt days America has supported Tibet and Tibetan people Franklin Roosevelt wrote a letter to his holiness and gave him a watch as well and as his holliness says he liked the watch so much he kept it for so long he lost the letter still in prison o Muhammad give him a copy of the letter and also US government and the people have it with us bypassing the US Tibetan Policy Act in 2002 which mandates that the special coordinator for Tibetan issue be appointed and we hope the new administration will appoint this special coordinator on Tibetan issue soon we also hope continuing the tradition as you can see from the photographs here the presidents of US government have met with His Holiness Dalai Lama from Bush Senior to Clinton to Bush jr. and President Barack Obama we hope the new administration under President Donald Trump will continue the tradition and meet with His Holiness the Dalai Lama soon we are also very grateful for US Congress for granting aids and fun to different administration for our project through USAID and PRM in the State Department all the funding are used very frugally efficiently and impactful where that's why all the schools that you see the hospitals that use the settlements that you see I'll run partly through the funding of the US government for which we are very grateful and Leader Nancy Pelosi also went to Nepal and met with the Prime Minister and the foreign minister and the Speaker of Government of Nepal with Republican congressman Sensenbrenner and all the congressmen they again even though they are from the US they are the US Congress representative but they represented Tibetan people and spoke for the Tibetan people in a pause given their difficult situation for which we are very grateful and few days the delegation will go to Delhi and again meet with leaders of Indian government again tank Indian government for supporting the cause of Tibet because India has done the most for Tibetan people because his holiness Dalai Lama His Holiness Dalai Lama himself says is the longest guest of India the largest number of Tibetans are in India CTA is based in India so we are profoundly grateful to this great nation and great people of India and we also hope that the new administration of the US government will continue to support the middle way approach when President Barack Obama met with his holiness Dalai Lama three times White House issued a statement saying they applaud and strongly support the middle way approach US government supports one China policy and also supposed middle way policy so there is no contradiction between one China policy and middle way policy and we hope these new governments or new administration in Washington DC will continue to support the middle way approach and encourage dialogue between the N voice of the dial AMA and Chinese representative very soon [Applause] often we ask this question do you think there is any chance for Tibetan issue don't you think your job is very difficult given the power and might of China but we do believe that our day will come sooner than later because we have friends like you and also someone said the arc of history is long but it bends towards justice we have waited long enough and we hope the justice will prevail in Tibet very soon when we ask is there any hope we say yes there is hope because same thing was asked to Nelson Mandela when he spent 28 years in prison but in the end Nelson Mandela restored democracy in South Africa restored freedom to people of South Africa same thing was said about Martin Luther King at one time when he gave the speech I have a dream many people thought is not possible but then soon situation and civil rights situation in America improve on Cellucci who would have thought this four years ago she will be free and walking the streets of Burma or Rangoon even northern Island when there was a conflict and bloodshed many people ruled out the conflict be ever be solved but it did happen Good Friday Agreement was signed similarly in East Timor and our chain at Berlin wall also came down all these are examples of recent years we witnessed it right in front of us these things happening and changing history we just think it is our turn as I said Nobel laureates Nelson Mandela walked the streets of South Africa Nobel laureate Aung San su Chi walk the streets of Burma Nobel laureates Ramos Horta of East Timor walked the streets Vista more and also Nobel laureates in Northern Ireland walk the streets of Northern Ireland our prayer and our hope and our dream of all the Tibetans who burn themselves and six military inside Tibet our prayer and our dream is that our own novel Oryx is only as the great $14 of Tibet will soon walk the streets of Tibet I do believe that day is sooner than later we asked you we appeal to you to be with us for little longer when his holliness walked the streets of Gaza and his holliness will give Kalachakra teaching from the potala palace and millions and millions and millions the Tibetan not just Tibetan Chinese will be there in Lhasa to receive the teaching from his holliness diorama when that happy day happens again we will invite US congressional delegation led by Nancy Pelosi at that time it won't be a guided tour it will be a free tour you can travel anywhere you can meet any Tibetan you want and we will organize a big dance party we always dance that you saw yesterday deeper we will dance like them and celebrate to the wee hours of night and I know His Holiness prophet prohibits drinking but on that day he'll make an exception allow us to drink beer but beer won't be Budweiser it will be activating vehicle channel and His Holiness will like during his childhood he looked down through his telescope at us and with smile he will say happy day [Applause] now time has come there is urgency also that it is time to fulfill the aspirations and dreams of the Tibetan people the dream is let's consolidate the dial Amma returns Tibet let the freedom Bell in Philadelphia ring in Tibet su that's the dream when that celebration happens it will be another day in world history a chapter will be rewritten that justice prevail in Tibet freedom prevalent Tibet peace prevail in Tibet the co-author of the chapter will be this great country India and the great country America led by our friends in the US Congress and the US government there is all march forward and fulfill the wishes of his holliness will fulfill the wishes of Tibetans in Tibet that his holiness Dalai Lama returns to bed very soon long live His Holiness the Lama thank you very much [Applause] cmeg Adela's arete rhizotomy Cuccia jim sensenbrenner china sunshine thank you I request representative Jim Sensenbrenner to address the gathering thank you very much your holiness mr. president and friends gathered from all around the world to this public felicitations I'm Jim Sensenbrenner from Wisconsin I have been in Congress for over 38 years I need one Republican on this bipartisan delegation and I'm here with honor and with gratitude because I wish to assure your holiness as well as everyone else present here and everyone who may be listening that there is no disagreement between the political parties in the United States Congress our love and respect for His Holiness the Dalai Lama as well as our solidarity with the cause of the Tibetan people to be free from the repression that has been put upon them for a very very long time from Beijing if one looks at the history of the United States many of the people who emigrated from Europe to the US before we received our independence we're doing because they were fleeing religious repression back home in Europe and they wanted to be able to practice their religion freely and without interference from government authority and if you look at the First Amendment to the United States Constitution one of the things that it very expressly states is that the government or the Congress shall make no law restricting the free exercise of religion and that has been in our Constitution for over 220 years it is something that we practice and people who are repressed in their religious beliefs are able to get justice in the courts of the United States and one of the things that I believe in since I spent much of my career dealing with issues of justice is that without justice there is no freedom today there is no justice in Tibet for Tibetans for their religion for their culture for their language and for His Holiness the Dalai Lama and only when there is justice in all of these areas will there be freedom and Tibet and that is something that we in the United States Congress are firmly committed to doing you have seen the United States government step up and help fund keeping Tibetan culture language and religion alive here in Dharamsala and elsewhere where there are Tibetans in the world that is an irrevocable stand behind until Tibet is free and until there is justice for Tibetans this is a civil rights issue it is an issue where Tibet is oppressed by China it is an issue that affects the people and affecting the people's aspirations and by empowering people to be able to fulfill their aspirations which is something that His Holiness the Dalai Lama has preached throughout his life then the entire society will be uplifted your holiness I am honored and I am proud to be here and proud to be able to speak these words in your presence you all have been an inspiration not only to Tibet but the nationalities all around the world and I think it is very hard to find any public figure in the world and I'm not saying political figure I'm saying public figure around the world who has universally loved a universally respected as as Holiness the Dalai Lama I wish to conclude by saying that in the Congress we are with you your holiness but we are with all of you so that you can reach your aspirations so that you can go home to Tibet so that you will be able to freely practice your religion keep the culture alive educate the kids and remember receive justice because with justice comes freedom thank you [Applause] Teej Eliezer amigo Videla pegida Ottawa never give him a key telugu - Edina delicioso Vegas a virtue mínimo de

Holiness the Dalai Lama thank you for being born you challenge us to be better people and we are grateful for your commitment to peace and justice and we appreciate your leadership calling on the world community to protect this place precious planet from the ravages of climate change and we have come we have come to Dom Salah because we believe in you and we stand with you and we stand with President Loeb song Sanjay and we stand with all the Tibetan people and we pledge to work for the day that His Holiness and all Tibetans can go back to Tibet and freely practice their religion celebrate their culture traditions and language and yes have genuine autonomous status according to the middle way approach China China needs to understand that years of repression have not dulled the excitement that Tibetans and millions of people around the world half of his holiness and his vision love peace and justice combined are more powerful than any amount of repression or violence so we call upon the Chinese government to respect the human rights of all Tibetans to release all Tibetan prisoners of conscience including the 11th Panchen Lama who is one of the world's longest-serving political prisoners and by the way for the record the Chinese government does not have the authority or the right to name the reincarnated religious leaders of Tibet we just returned from a visit to Nepal and we urge that governments leaders to register all eligible Tibetans who have pledged repression in China so that they can get the appropriate document document ation to legally seek employment and travel freely and as the united states congressman i call upon my own government to make Tibet a bigger priority meet regularly and at the highest levels with this Holiness the Dalai Lama and with president Loeb son Sanjay insists that China restart the Chinese Tibetan dialogue so that we can move forward on a whole range of issues work with other governments around the world to create a group of friends that we that will meet regularly in a coordinated way to support the Tibetan people and we need to do so much more I used to have an old history professor who used to say the world will not get better on its own and he was right when like-minded people all over all across this globe what we need to do is stand together and work together and work deliberately for peace and for justice we need to be the wind at the back of his Holiness the Dalai Lama we need to be the wind at the back of president lobe sign Sanjay we need to be the wind at the back of all Tibetan people all over the world but especially into bed and as I conclude I just want to make one thing clear despite all that the Tibetan people have gone through I am hopeful about the future I believe that goodness will prevail I believe that what's right and what's just will prevail I believe the future is bright and I am proud to stand with you thank you very much Denham to you Adalia Pandey premium

is deteriorating day by day the self-immolation of the typical and the demolition of monastic institutions the continent in Tibet there is no improvement in the overall human rights situation and the hotline policies of the Chinese leadership the Chinese government is sitting violating religious freedom in Tibet the restriction on the practice of Buddhist is likened to the restriction on Tibetan culture such restrictions were also imposed on Tibetan language which is the ultimate identity of division as a nationality the relentless promotion of mandolin under the People's Republic of China has seized the space of minority languages we appeared at such institutions along with cultural assimilation would lead dividend to become alienated from our own language along with terrorist atrocities Tibetan inside Tibet or present numerous social discrimination travel restrictions and many more Tibet rigid and delicate environment which is the global asana seconds also nervous and volatility in the hands of China's preventative code is the global influence and the economic growth alternately the measurement of Tibet due to water resources the environment will have a long-term impact on the Asian countries His Holiness the Dalai Lama has relentlessly pursued a mutually beneficial middle way policy which is a permit course to resolve the issue of Tibet peacefully this approach meet the water need of the Tibetan people while ensuring the unity and stability of the People's Republic of China we need your kind support to encourage the Chinese authorities to resume dialogue between the representatives of His Holiness the Dalai Lama and the Chinese government u.s. dividend policy edge of 2002 was indeed a great political and historical accomplishment of the

took a picture with him when he came to Washington and just about six months ago we took another picture he looks the same I look twenty years older and I bring you greetings from the American people we believe in democracy and freedom for all people and especially for the Tibetan people I come from New York City and in my Harbor in New York City you have the beautiful Statue of Liberty which talks about freedom and all opportunity and things that we have pride in America as American Americans and we know that the people of Quebec have that same yearning for freedom and I want to leave you with a wonderful thought and that is we will never stop until Tibet is pray I have a message for the leadership in Beijing it's very simple get out of Tibet let the people of Tibet determine their own faith let the people of Tibet decide what their future would be self-determination for all people is very important when you talk about democracy no one group should impose its will on another group I know that when I look at China I see oppression when I look at the Tibetan people I see freedom and opportunity so so I want to say to all of you and certainly to His Holiness who I have the greatest honour to to be with him he's truly a man of great what wonder I want to just say to all of you the American people will never forget you the American people will be fighting with you and we're going

also received we have received the gifts of Tibetan culture and language and arts and beliefs from all of you and so I'm grateful to you for that I went to the United States by myself when I was 16

for human rights and that we will raise our voice and use our power as a country that has that power in the world to fight for the Tibetan people to return to Tibet and to practice your religion and your culture in peace and so on this auspicious day of buddha purnima the day of Lord Buddha's enlightenment I give my deepest thanks to all of you for your courage your generosity your perseverance

Sensenbrenner is from Wisconsin eliot Engel is from New York Jim McGovern is from Massachusetts that in a column is from Minnesota Judy Chu is from California chronology appalled is from the state of Washington you heard from her and I were to say how proud we are to be here with our charged ADA Fair Mary Kay Carlson from the American Embassy in New Delhi okay so I understand that this beautiful song about the his holiness his 80th birthday is a wish that he lives to be 113 years old I am sure that we all associate ourselves with that remark and I know it's good news to the government of Beijing we're all here to pay tribute is our witness a visionary a man of compassion a man of hope we are seeing on our visits we came to see you you have inspired us with your hope I am more hopeful than ever that we will meet the challenge that faces us my hope Springs from His Holiness his message of compassion hope exist people say where is hope hope exists right where His Holiness tells us right between faith deep faith and religion and compassion faith and belief that people are good our faith in the goodness of others and their compassion gives us hope anyone who visits the Tibetan people whether in Tibet here or anywhere in the world as we did in Nepal as mr. mcgovern mentioned earlier see the determination that you have to preserve the authenticity of being Tibetan when we see the sparkle in the eyes of the children yesterday the children's vision we saw a village we saw hope that they will one day return home to Tibet when we when we saw the Tibetan Institute of Performing Arts last night and today we saw the hope that they would bring the authenticity of the Tibetan art home to Tibet thank you to all of you when we heard the leadership of dr. Sanjay president Sangha the speaker your leadership of the court here we saw hope for the progress of freedom it were to bet we were that in the problem Joyce Bank oMG I come near Justin Joyce Bailey is here from Ohio and she was with us from Ohio identity too early Joyce baby came with us last year cute Tibet as did Betty McCollum Jim McGovern and we went to the Potala Palace and we saw the room where his holiness lived and we promised each other then and there that we would do everything in our power to make sure he would return to that place most of all were inspired by his message His Holiness's message of hope not only for Tibetans but as my colleagues have said for the dignity of all people wherever they are throughout the world I was honored to be Speaker of the House when his holiness received the Congressional Gold Medal as the president sangai said was a special tribute as president george w bush came and that mrs. Bush came as well with the gold medal we honored the Tibetan people all of you again and his holiness of word we said in the Medal many enduring and outstanding contributions to peace and enduring contributions of peace non-violence human rights and religious understanding you know that when he received the Nobel Peace Prize who was the first person in history to receive the prize for all of those things plus the first person to receive it with mention of his leadership and vision on protecting God's creation the environment thank you your holiness but so many people came the day the day of our giving the medal a gold medal to His Holiness that we had to have an additional outside ceremony such as this thousands of people came from all over America to witness that sir is a award but also to be inspired by his holiness and to congratulate him what we see here today and supported the Tibetan people we have said what we say here we have said to the top leadership in the Chinese government we recognize that China weighs heavily on any country any corporation any person and Richard garrotte can attest to that who speaks out for this bitten people China uses its economic leverage to silence the voices of Friends of Tibet but if we do not speak out against oppression in Tibetan up and in agressive China because of China's economic power we lose all moral authority to talk about human rights anywhere else in the world we will not be silent you will not be silent so the brutal tactics of the Chinese government I won't go into them because his holiness pray for me that I would rid myself of my negative attitude about dwelling on the negative too much but the brutal tactics of the Chinese government to erase religion culture and language on the Tibetan people challenges the conscience of the world we will meet that challenge working together we will meet that challenge when they say to us when we were in Tibet they said to us we support we support religion we gilded the roof of the temple we gilded we painted the roof of the temple we gilded the roof we said back to them we're not interested in what you're gilding the roof were interested that you're guarding the minds of the children and we're interested in freedom of education of culture and religion in Tibet not painting the roof of the temple and so again my colleague mr. Sensenbrenner began as a co-leader of this delegation and I will close by saying to some in China you know they they have a we hope they will see the light and what this holiness is prayer and vision and all of your prayers and vision that dream will come true that that they recognize that something is missing there that they will see the light to some in China the authentic autonomous Tibet is inconceivable to us it is inevitable it is inevitable and so we must shorten the distance between the inconceivable to them and the inevitable to us working together we will do that we will make sure they will see the light I'm certain that with your devotion your determination your commitment to Tibetan values culture language religion and under the leadership of its Holiness the Dalai Lama who will live to be at least 113 years old I am certain that we will succeed thank you all very much -

hagerty thank you madam chair i'd like to call up haggarty amendment number 29 hagarty amendment number 29 this amendment strikes the provisions in this bill that would call for redistricting they would likely lead these redistricting provisions would likely lead to a federal court in washington d.c or a consultant that that court hires redrawing all of the district lines across the united states the bill sets up a complex process that removes from the elected representatives of the states again it removes from states whose elected representatives have drawn congressional districts in their states since time began here in america my amendment would strike the redistricting provisions of the bill which are likely to lead to a federal court in washington d.c redrawing every congressional district in the united states my amendment would instead keep democratically elected state representatives in charge of our election rules which has been the case for over 230 years i'm concerned that democrat members of the unelected redistricting commissions that are embedded in this bill who were charged with drawing congressional districts under the bill would simply object to a map that isn't gerrymandered in the most favorable way to democrats that would then deadlock the commission process and punt it to the court system specifically it would punt it to a court in washington d.c that's specifically charged with drawing all of these maps so the result then would be an unelected judge in washington dc or a d.c consultant that the judge is specifically allowed to appoint to draw the maps under this bill they'd be the ones in charge of drawing congressional districts in every state in the country instead of using a democratic state-specific process that has been in existence for the entirety of american history why is that why do democrats want this because they think this will lead to a gerrymandered map again in their favor again underscoring the fact that this is a massive power grab embedded in this bill i urge everyone to support this amendment senator thank you madam chairman americans across the political parties support ending the gerrymandering that attacks equal representation it is a well understood gimmick to basically cheat americans of their fair representation at the federal level and remember we're only talking the federal level here states can continue to do what they want for local elections because the constitution article 1 section 4 only gives us power over congressional elections so i object to this amendment because it's designed to continue this corrupt practice of gerrymandering that which we should end okay should we call for a vote quick we'll call the roll einstein no by proxy senator schumer no by proxy senator warner no by proxy senator leahy no by proxy senator king senator merkley senator padilla no by proxy senator ossoff senator blunt senator mcconnell senator shelby senator cruz senator capito aye senator wicker senator fisher aye senator hyde smith aye senator hagerty aye chairwoman klobuchar no nine eyes nine nose the amendment is not adopted

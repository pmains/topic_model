question is designed to be a little bit of a look deep into your souls if you will and we've heard the the principal the very famous leadership quote people do not care on what you know until they know how much you care so thinking about that that line what I'd like you to do is to reflect on a personal experience that you've had your lifetime that would demonstrate in the audience here today that you have the capacity in the empathy and the notion of caring about the business community and that you can go in Washington and truly be an advocate for this nation's business community and when we're talking about business we're talking about small business we're talking about talking about startup entrepreneur companies we're talking about midsize businesses and even larger established businesses what can you tell us from can experience in your personal life time that would show us that upp that the people in this room today the risk takers and are the employers of this nation's workers so in planning to start with function system so a personal experience yeah it's actually a company that I have been working with which I think symbolizes kind of struggles of Rhode Island manufacturers and this is I think in many ways I feel very passionately about my it's an opportunity for us to really grow that sector browns economy really important to the future of our country's economy and there's a manufacturing woonsocket who brought operations back from overseas is really fighting to stay alive and has a big customer who's also a socket but can't get the capital to have him toward Emily Hauser customers here's a guy who's really trying to hold on to it business and grow it but is having difficult because he's competing with companies overseas that have better tactic many reigns his opportunity when she did you did the right thing he's having difficulty getting capital to grow that business and this is like these are conversations we have on a very regular basis because he's trying to hold on his business and grow it he's bugging against policies which undermine growing up my profession ergonomic in socket and he's got this moment where he has his customer it was going to be a huge customer and really helped him grow his business but he can't get the capital from the bank check tavien return SI to meet those demands I think it's a example of many of the things that are wrong with our manufacturing policy in this country and you know when you see that sweat blood that he put into building this business and to buy it and radar forces back I think you know it's it's something you can fix by you know changing our tax policy so we don't it's sent by his bringing jobs overseas making sure he has access to capital so he can grow his business making sure it's easy the regulatory challenge but it's an example I think of why I feel so passive dr you already talked about to experience it you had demonstrate that you have the apathy of people in this room that hunting arrow brought my my visit to businesses in the first District by the way we have 93,000 small businesses here in Rhode Island and you wouldn't want to grow those business has kind of been I was visiting for the last over a year because they were physicists to listen to their challenges and understand you know beyond payroll over the challenges out you know the fighting movie over to Patrick for Vinny consistency and confidence in tax key and in regulatory licensure but beyond that the manufacturing companies that visited have told me that they could hire bar none everyone I've gone to see has donated that could hire five people tomorrow ten people tomorrow morning if they could match the job description with the skill sets we know we have a skill sets yeah and we know we for our leaders of talk about it for quite some time but we haven't had any action so I've been talking about plan to for a one-year program for a kids graduating high school so that you get a manufacturing degree with the engine areas like a digital program but when I was telling the story to a group of young folks sitting on in the inner city one of one of the fellows it was there was actually a little bit older and he is innocent and he said that I lack those skills and trying to get a job every day and I can't find out because I lack the skills so we know the problems we've identified the problem we just haven't enabled again I had the opportunity to go to the Hulk occurrences format college that always ago but all the leadership our Island promise journal I commend the food for that and it continued to educate the Rhode Island the workforces took that very important piece to fill the skills yet but we haven't been into it so that's something I'm going to work under this fellow that had tears in his eyes I promised him that what I didn't do to Congress I will set up to not one but two different programs and well I know one of them will be free the people who care for it because he can't afford it but he can't put it to paper cost is tingling good morning to thank you all for being here my auntie for small business comes from the fact that my entire life I've been in small business I'm not just talking my adult life I grew up the manufacturing family at my family's been manufacturing thinking well over a hundred years and I can tell you the problems we have today are the problems that he had yesterday those problems are larger the government when you build things a new manufacture things here in New England in America I have news for all of your room based on my personal experience the government's not friendly not a friend at all when you grow up a family business at the dinner table usually the conversation goes what's happening in the family business and very often in our conversations at home sure we talked about the people showing up to buy boats from articles that we build the boats it that 120 families would someone purchased them but more importantly we talked about the government and its impact on our family business and the government will show up in various forms sometimes it was the IRS sometimes with EPA sometimes it was OSHA sometimes it was the Department of Labor and many other organizations and you know they never had good news for us they never showed up and said Mr Hinckley how can we help you build more boats and you think the government would get it because every single hour that is worked the government makes money you think they see how can we hope this business grow so they hi more people so we make more money so eventually after the government delta a really brutal blow to our family business and the form of the luxury-tax some short many people in this room remember is it devastated rhode island it's estimated about 35,000 people lost their jobs with marine industry because of that she's some legislative genius from washington DC i started over and i started a computer company and in that business today just like the businesses that I've talked to in the last year and a half but I've been campaigning here in Rhode Island uncertainty about how the government is going to treat them is the number one priority how much more is Obamacare going to cost I'm talking to companies and their insurance premiums have gone between 18 and 25 percent and this piece of two thousand plus change legislation hasn't been implemented yet what are the tax consequence is going to be for my business next year with all this fiscal cliff know that the uncertainty over seventy percent of americans say they don't like our tax code they want something new and the failure of leadership in Washington DC in a bitter Parsons I feel somewhat at odds with everyone else on this panel here because I'm not a part of government yet will be soon I'm owned and operated and financed about 20 businesses in my life I currently run a small business and narragansett rhode island I know exactly what it is that a businessman who feels every day of my life I don't have to go out and tour to figure it out but I did I want to out a nice poster businessman all across the state and it's the same problems that you might expect it's the same that these people backed out but only here once or twice a year when they make their visit but the problem is that Barry said we have a government that's a little bit too involved in what we want to do and every time a business starts up and looks at what it has to overcome to actually open the doors and begin operating their drink something that they probably do thinking about for years and years they have to go through a permitting process they have a license process they have to go to get loans at a bank and usually it's one or two people that have the street and they have to hire all kinds of people just to get the doors open in the very beginning so they need this capital at the startup and where is this startup capital for the street it's not it's not from the government it's my dad even me from this room it might not be freely the documents that i had to receive it actually comes from real risk takers you know looking at one i took risks with dreams i took people are taking a person right now in south county she wants to operate a thing called becoming italian today she and her family make great sausages they sell them in belmont market in wakefield rhode island and she wants to take this business to become contain rhode island business she talks about importing and exporting out of the port of Quonset which we really not have done a good job of developing she talks about taking this business and taking it international she talks about all those things but guess what she couldn't open the doors she needed the very beginning financing and so what did she do she came to someone like me an entrepreneur a recitation so what did I look at what do I look at when I invest in a small business I look at the chance that she'll be stifled along the way by government regulations I took her to EDC I said maybe they can give you a while they couldn't give her alone she wasn't far enough along the way I took her to a bank the bank said well we kind of need to see a little bit more about how this business is operating and we're going to need a couple of business plans she didn't have the time to do that she was making sausage now I've invested in companies like this I've invested in high-tech companies I currently own a portfolio of 20 companies I've served as an advisor a venture capital firm I've served as an advisor at a bank I know what's going on in the real world I know what's going on business and I passionately care about small businesses the best thing we can do is get out of their way and when they ask for advice give it to them quickly cognizant agent and advocate the business take on that all right thank you very much for my happy to see what they could probably chamber for hosting this event so I have grown up with a small businessman both my environment like my dad was alive they had several small businesses of the course of course of my life and just recently my cloud 72 years old just about a year and half ago Scott another of the small business to mention that I up but you know I hear the stories even now about the struggle of the doors opening payroll and having access to capital and the challenges of being a business owner so the more recently also i had a a year ago adding women in business war brought together some people in government today to find out we get here than perfect challenges that there isn't one story that that stands out there community from how the metal wilson and josten much the same story that my parents have had struggled with over the course of their eyes as well did the same thing try and buy a ski cap a skilled late both both attract to retain the skill bravery so these are the stories are automatically businesses that that I across the second professional district all the time so when I have opportunities to support things like sba loans trying to get the loan guarantee required to get that back up to ninety percent 75% loan guarantee right now is the things that I I want to support jobs act we passed the make it easier to get access to capital for small businesses these are the things that we need to do because of the things that are better basic businesses every day so trying to be sensitive to their needs and finding ways to make business to operate through some produce at the air they're facing now presumably each of you is given the next topic a lot of thought in as as has folks in the cerulean we've seen so many forms in the last several months whether it be the day before right in this room about the private sector cleaning economic development we've had them make it happen we have the right back report as you indicated the public occurs it's a leadership role island and there have been many many groups that have really expressed great deal of frustration and outrage about our business climate rankings somebody so my question to you is very specifically about rev island what is it that's holding us back and what could you do to turn around and really accelerate our progress and I'll just throw it out there anybody that wants to jump in you know please feel free to me to do that lively exchange it's the overall attitude business climate we came into this new outfit because states for business how does that make you feel professional delegation how did the candidates feel about representing a state where our business climate is is really sorry Stan it's embarrassing so when it's finished my god so we have a second highest unemployment rate in the United States and Parkinson is a beautiful state beautiful say we should be a policy we can do better than sweet mustard redness but we need to look at tax reform we need to look at the business community and listen to them the b2g the business the government communication and listen to it to be able to roll the red capital for our business to talk about tax reform locally or nationally both both and I think it was my probably mentioned in the licensure its regulations and licensure in state and federal so you know we just need to be able to embrace our business community is that we have 93,000 smoke it wouldn't it be nice but we could grow another seven or ten thousand businesses to bring our friends and our folks that are on the egg rolls off the employment rolls it back to work but the answer your question directly is is tax reform regular the overall environment they differ environment business and we have to tackle that skill sets games glory I get this question a lot but not because we're Islanders want to know when glad you can do for them and of course this is a federally left position and you know you can't directly influence Smith hill with the legislative act because you're not but you can influence it without it and the colonel nailed it it's the attitude we have in Rhode Island towards businesses Smith he'll seize businesses as a place to harvest capital funk they don't see them as places to create jobs which is why we have incredibly high tax rate and as the colonel said the worst environment in America to run a business me essentially when you're in last place you know starting a business and around is like trying to grow corn on asphalt it just doesn't happen you know and I talked to business owners all the time and when you're in a relationship and some meaning what you do you leave and that's what business hasn't got around and unfortunately with them we've lost about 100,000 residents in the last decade those people used to be here a taxes so the colonel male it's the attitude we take towards business realizing that businesses are who we work for small businesses especially but furthermore realizing that when you're on a last-place team and you're playing in a competitive league doesn't it make sense to adopt the strategies of the teams that are winning that's what they do in the NHL that's what they do in the NFL that's what they do in Major League Baseball when you're in your butt whooped which we are getting our butt whooped by other states you adopt the best strategies of the winning teams we completely ignore the strategies of the winning team in fact we double down on the losing strategies here in Rhode Island so what can I do as a federal elected official something that we don't have today our delegation is all in with the Democratic Party fine I like balance how about a little balance in our delegation so we can actually influence in the village right now they don't say a word so when we go through pressing problems like the pension reform not a word was said when you have someone from the other party it's not ruling smithville the Republican Party saying why are you doing them so is this due in part to that I to work I want addressed first of all like many of us I'm frustrated that Rhode Island has seen more robust job room and we will get you know the weary or and where we are I think one of the problem areas we identified Ziggy laughter when they argued replaced when I we looked at manufacturing jewelry was the naming back of the deception from never replaced it with that get biggums anchor industry to the brilliant job creators for our state so as a state one of the things we have to decide is what business do we want to be first and put resources behind it to to attract those in it also hanker industries and we're also located a college football team that were trying to attract investors various and yet we have the scholarships to offer room for help with energy costs or how is it when people come here or the food costs inserting the idea of putting resources behind a jobs plan is going to be important that does happen two major ways at the state level and I'm glad to see the differing organization that PVC is going through right now the state's going through a right this is an opportunity for but at the also at think in particular at the federal level you know we can be a part of a solution of providing access to to capital I talked about that some just a minute ago with SBA loan said the the job jack that we just did we just ask but also the idea we need to address the problem of our skills gap in our statement as a co-chair of the career technical education caucus in a bipartisan effort even trying to address that at both the state and national level because how do you grow businesses here or how do you attract businesses to arrive if you don't have skilled workers to do the jobs that did already and that's what the country's many businesses are encountering right now that I even businesses right now I asked when you can be hired for the job prospects for the future and to almost to a company that talk about we have job organs right now and was struggling to find what skills to do those jobs already get a ton of addressing is the skilled problem okay so let's feel back then again about the lack of a trained workforce as we're fully engulfed in the knowledge economy what is it that what is it that can be done within the next 12 months to two really retool our workforce because you know time Rome is burning well of course I want to say thank you to the chamber moves you've been such an important part of this moment the knowledge economy but I want to just quickly respond to the question that gets the more frustrating you know I think the reality is there's not a single initially the prop that weird island can engage you to fix our economy I think it's a whole range that we have to do so it has to do it leadership in terms of promoting our state as a great place to business of good old-fashioned salesmanship bring businesses to around into the market what do you think is is the most potent weapon that we have in terms of promoting the environment for businesses well I mean I the way is our best asset our best asset is our people and they asked our great university health care institutions are small businesses but promoting and marketing our state's one part second part of it is work for sure making sure that we have a workforce with the skills necessary for the job with 21st century making sure we have a regulatory process that people can navigate an expediter who can help people get together to the local or state level who can guess who permitted prop you know so that we become a state known for that solution go to start a business and it's easy to navigate third is we have gotten really recognize that we have incredible assets here we have great universities great healthcare institutions the knowledge economy is a great example where we're trying to grow technology and innovation companies and sort of market both the knowledge district but that sector of our state's economy so building on assets that we have orchestrating these are very very important part of this you know there was a proposal i'm jim is at a huge leader in in the Congress on this issue but there was a proposal that the Republican House leadership offered to almost eliminate workforce investment act I mean what we have to do is fight to invest in developing a workforce so that we workforce neska that can compete with the jobs that are available in 21st century and so having effective or coerced Wren ones that work listening to businesses what kinds of skills do you need in this new employee having real conversations between the employer and the workforce training folks so you're actually creating skills that are meet the needs of the employer is key but but there's a federal role in this workforce investment act resources aren't important and fighting to protect those that we can be successful in creating a workforce with the skills necessary for the jobs that are available to 21st century what is your view on the workforce investment act well the first of all that was a great speech but I also any action we talked about this for a few years now and I wouldn't just need to do it though get word so we're not just kidding winners losers as a result of political favoritism so but we need to create that opportunity so businesses want to move in here and let the congressman said this panel said the skill sets gap is so important something I talk about a lot but we need to also if we can bring companies in here we have a brain drain that matter of fact my own son graduated from brown university with a master's degree in neural engineering and there were not jobs here for him he had to move on stay he'd love to live here over an hour they can't because they're not job opportunities point so we need to continue to grow in here your point about the workforce investment act and the fight that David described in Washington I think in vice president Ryan's budget the so-called Ryan budget that Speaker Boehner ran through the house they actually get rid of the workforce investment act they replace it with something with a new name about you know specific career training but nobody knows what that means and it's in a pot it is budgets it gets in the next two years by twenty four percent so it's nice to be able to talk about how we can improve workforce invisible and we clearly need to because we have an accelerating economy technologically and so in order to compete jobs that used to be working in a factory taking a piece of equipment and you work on these equipment now there's a computer that runs that he's a quick you better how to run the computer different no it's a good thing but it means that the skill sets are accelerating and we need workforce investment to allow people to keep on people who are trained in another generation we can't just throw them out we've got to have the training there so when the fight in Washington is we get rid of the workforce investment act as we cut it by twenty four percent that's a frustrating fight we should be thinking how do we do more and the best example I think of doing more and doing it smarter is focusing more on the train to order aspect i was at CCRI the other day when they graduated maybe eight young folks who were trained in electrical engineering and they've been working with national grid so on the day that they graduated to them they were going straight into their top the national national grid knew about their work ethic they knew how they performed real life circumstance was terrific the pace program works very well when i joined david in saluting a gentle and run because he's really really worked hard on this with CCRI for this focused training I think that has been the biggest gap it's been basically what you do the training and then you go out and do it and on the other side of the gap their businesses who are saying we need both we haven't closed that gap the pace program and some of the work that Jimmy's let out at CCRI I think our that key length because that will really i mean there is nothing more reassuring when you're taking like that on your own advancement and investing in your own future then see how that path actually leads to a not just a job in general to specific job is pacific company that is waiting for you fast than the ramp I think we've missed but with the folks in Washington the Republicans particularly trying to cut the Workforce Investment but hard to grow those elements of the program yesterday i'm trying to say this in the nicest way possible to this for I've grown very wary of the government talked that I here and the battle was i think is going on government doesn't create jobs your guys all your programs for what you're producing doesn't create anything what you do is you spend money rhode islanders take their dollars they take it to Washington and then we try to get back as much as we set we don't actually in a head in this field and what you guys are trying to tell us is that you're going to set up programs that are going to create jobs they're going to take this out of 50th place this sounds an awful lot like what you've been saying for a long time are there new programs that I don't know about are there and what will take us out of 50th place deep I'm dated answer the flesh without a 50th place I'm personally embarrassed I'm not in Congress I'm not in the Senate I'm a resident of Rhode Island and a businessman and I don't like to talk to people at other states where I have businesses I don't like to talk to people in businesses that I own here in Rhode Island and explain why we're 50th on almost every single category and then if they heard me saying this stuff back to them I probably get hit I mean seriously is anybody buying any of this I've never hired anyone in my years of higher 35 years of business from an orc force development program not one what are you guys talking about I want to start a business I want an educated person that shows in London at my door and sits for an interview and I can talk to them about basic finance and math some of the failures that we have here in education in Rhode Island I want a basically sound person to look me in the eye and say I want to work on your business and I want you to train me I trained everybody in all of our businesses I didn't go to a school for training I didn't go to a government program for training I trained them and I went out and got the best people possible you guys make analogies the football teams and baseball teams let us fill Bella checked it he hires the best athlete possible he puts him into his system he gets football players and he puts him into his system and he figures out how to let them through the best within his system that's what we ought to be thinking it's a mindset we have exactly the right wrong line set here in our congressional delegation they think the government is going to all figure this out you guys haven't created jobs i have so i would be embarrassed absolutely embarrassed as far as workforce development program there isn't a proposal out there that i believe the Chamber of Commerce the US Chamber of Commerce endorses that updates the Workforce Development Act and it talks about having businesses be two-thirds of the representation in terms of deciding what workforce development training actually gets done over the years workforce development programs have been a mystery the GAO can't even tell whether they're operating properly or not we don't even know if they're effective here after year after year this particular act hasn't been reauthorized since 2003 why is that you had two thousand nine and ten when you are working on your health care act you have both Congress's you know it's certainly interesting that mr. Reilly has not himself hired someone from the workforce program and I hope people don't make judgments about public policy based on personal experience a moment the reality is I've had the opportunity to speak to many many businesses who present one of the greatest challenge they have is finding individuals for positions that have the skills necessary and the cost of training those new employees to do the work and that is an obstacle to hiring folks there are many examples that Senator Whitehouse suspension of programs with the job training is leading to employment stepping up building futures other programs where people are developing skills necessary to go into work so this notion of that that job training is not useful it may not have been useful in your own experiences Australia but I can tell you from the constituents I've spoken to at a variety of different Isaac businesses have said that having access to training resources to train new employees would mean they could hire people and of course these programs should be effective they should be cost-effective you should direct linkage between skills development and the jobs that are available and a really robust interaction between the two and but the notion that job training is not helpful to small businesses it's just not true so I don't want to change the subject or continue on this day but have it directed more towards the impending fiscal cliff and do you think the uncertainty that surrounds and love this nation around happen before the end of the year is in fact putting a damper on the recovery where you where'd you see it what are their particular incentive think we need to solve it we put on the Democratic side and put a trillion dollars in cuts already in the Budget Control Act the sequester has another 1.2 trillion that's two trillion dollars in cuts are on the table you need to reorient the sequester I reduce it fairly considerably but that's what's on the table on the other side in revenues the country has that I think the Providence Journal had their editorial in a bit we're at a 60-year low younger than you spin and we need to add revenue and the other side of the aisle won't put on the table do you think us to order late this nation can it can absorb attack site on the oil companies absolutely on the hedge fund billionaire through paying lower tax rates and the guy who drives the package delivery truck to their door absolutely getting rid of the Bush tax cuts over 250,000 saves eight hundred billion dollars and the budget period should go towards deficit reduction we can do this we do 1.2 trillion dollars a year in tax spending over ten years that means you only have to get rid of a tenth of it the Republicans haven't put one on the table not a nickel and so if you're going to take four trillion in cuts and have that either way you go the problem is take a look at the news about Portugal if you're going to go austerity route and just try to cut your way to health look at what happens we've seen it pull over Europe this is a demonstration in place GD down unemployment up recession worsening it's not a good path and when you've got revenues essentially a multi-decade low then haven't there be a revenue element in this only makes sense we did find under President Clinton when we last balanced the budget and the tax rates were not over sand didn't make the economy because guess what the economy exploded at that time it was our last successful budget effort until look President Bush came in and blew the doors off the deficit we're still trying to fix that on a couple of things first of all a lot of our problems go away when people get back to work the reason we're at historically 60-year low of tax receipts around fifteen percent of GDP is because not enough people are working and they are shackled and harnessed by a broken four million word tax code that hammers businesses & hammers fault small families the way we get out of these problems the way we become less reliant on the West code it's already broken that no one likes is one once again your leadership and that will bear out with fiscal quest we have again failure of leadership and it boils down to the partisan fighting when you have people that vote a hundred percent along their party leadership mines instead of starting with something like simpson-bowles which President Obama through his commission asked for it was completely ignored we need common ground starting point to solve this national crisis that is burying our nation right now we're going to miss adoro we know we need a balanced approach to revenues and cuts but let's not be hypocritical we're talking to the business community here and talking about taxing people over 250 we know that many many small businesses make over 250 those are job growth so we need to be very careful and how we do that I said earlier we have 93,000 small businesses in Rhode Island we're in tough times right now let's not kill some of those job droves I would ask about that yeah I think there's any you're not really really important let's talk about that as a pelagic it is very important to recognize it every who has looked at the fiscal cliff in a serious way says you have to do choosing you have to cut spending and you have to generate revenues Sheldon is absolutely right we've already cut trillion dollars what has been tipping on the house side what the House Republicans have refused to do is one single dollar driven by ending subsidies to Big Oil by ending subsidies to big agricultural corporations my letting tax cuts expire at the top 2% by ending the favorite treatment of carried interest you can't middle class is my other sectors of business that are good and then some sectors that are not that are not good no I'm not suggesting there's good and bad sex is what I'm just suggesting is strengthening the middle class that provides the demand for small business and protecting ninety-seven percent of small business from a tax increase we have got to generate we managed to pay down our debt you can you know Paul Ryan proposes a budget which adds a trillion dollar tax cut for the people at the very top and that is the nerve to say is deficit hawk it's a joke he endorsed all the bush buzzes to create it does it and I guess another big tax cut for millionaires and disinvested things that we need to grow our company's workforce training education past week as a small business grows in it and become successful and hopefully to enter it to the bottom to them to the ownership of the business we get up to the 250 mark and then all of a sudden don't go right right obviously no I'm good and but the question was originally I believe about the fiscal clip again a lot of government speak to end up somewhere in some other discussion we're talking about a fiscal clef that is tantamount to a failure by the three people who are represent our congressional delegation on this on this panel that is a failure that we're in this situation and guess what on November 6th or 7th regardless of who wins up here we're going to cut that's what's going to happen these three guys are going to punch you to our members the minority you have nothing to say and there's going to be a congressional Republican House so if it doesn't even really matter what you guys are saying about this its regard to the fiscal cliff if this is a is the result of failures of previous negotiations of course businesses are upset about it but on a businessman I know what's going to happen you're going to go to the old playbook and you're going to cut so I figure there's a twenty percent chance you put it to march 15 and there's an eighty percent chance you putt to July and there's no chance that we have the problem the fiscal cliff so worrying about all these things that are going to happen on James versus it's just not going to happen okay we have about five minutes left so I just want to ask about the Fed's monetary policy QE quantitative easing hasn't been successful in terms of long-term interest rates and an ability in an ability to to really grow the environment well I think whoever owns the paper contract to supply pay for the fit for putting money is doing very very well as this unfortunately seniors and round that live on fixed incomes that have watched gas prices double food prices skyrocket understand firsthand cost of printing money we are trying to print our money out of my depression based on horrible big government policies and I think that is definitely going to come home to roost as it always does in every other country's history historically speaking when you print money it doesn't end well and I know they have a fancy word for it called quantitative easing but again today it's a money money printing and it's not good for long-term health of America for Americans anyone else on the Fed policy no joke oh I'll sickness that we're unfortunately Congress has to be able to come together in a bipartisan way which we should be able to do to fix our van into a problem that at least the Fed is try to act within the two it's toolboxes capabilities to act and they've done that one too and if we get at least kept long term interest rates very low and it's allowed some people to remain YouTube to refinance a war especially those people that are working to to buy a home right now it's an opportunity but obviously the interest rates are not just a little forever and a hopeful that within that time frame on the air future we are going to be able to get our fiscal house in order I do believe personally that with the Congress comes back into session and I knew believe President Obama is going to be reelected that the Dakota budget negotiations between Speaker Boehner and the president will be almost had a board a half trillion dollar balanced approach to getting up his gosselin will be resurrected weather panels for a venir the owner that President the Speaker mascara but no one wants to see sequestration go to back this is the worst way to budget your trading your to talk very armies as a measure your lowest priority so it's a stupid way on hold pending but the bottom line is it's going to come down to a balanced approach with with revenues on the table and yes strategic budget-cutting here would actually funny would say you're cutting it were actually kind of probes i'm working but we're spending we are we going to get yes whether it's job training or at the infrastructure these are the things that we need to invest but at least the Fed has tried to act to do something within its capabilities and I believe that it was for a time the short-term interest rates are fallible business in pins and we have just a couple of minutes left so i'm going to give each of you an opportunity to offer your final words of wisdom and parting shots take on anything they heard this morning that you'd like to take issue with so well i will start with thank you again to the channel for doing this I've served it for the last two years in small business to leave the house and we focused on both regulatory reforms so I personally feel of 1099 those conditions of the SBIR access to capital I recognize it if you are working as a small business at the engine of rhode island economy and we have to be able to all the things we discussed today in terms of regulatory reform permitting process reform workforce training at the bottom but i think part of our economic strategy has to also recognize that we have got to be filled in the past this country and the policies that the president has put forth that we've been fighting for Jim and I about strengthening the middle class investing in innovation education small business the things that are in destructions things that are really necessary to throw and strengthen female rebuild the middle class of this country that's a strategy for helping grow small business because master its demand for the products that small business produces but you go to a small business and you say what do you need to grow jobs the answer I get over and over again honey customers and even though go buy the stuff I make and sell that's what the middle basileus country does and so if we focus on looking at this for the lens of middle-class families what do we do to strengthen them to protect them to grow the real fast rule are scary thank you thank you for having me here Lori and I won't thank the folks in fidelity and Chamber of Commerce you know I'm proud of being bite and we support from the US chamber commerce because that they understand that I get it's about jobs in the we need to grow jobs in America we need to grow job right here around as a shape when we have a second highest unemployment rate in the United States of America we can do better this we must inventiveness for the next generation we have a responsibility to correctness so it comes down to leadership leadership is not about rights and privileges and touch leadership is about taking responsibility for what happens on your watch in doing whatever you can to drive jobs back to around and to America you know I heard some statistics up here in France we would all say that the figures don't lie Elias figure let me throw statistic out for you seventy percent of manufacturers pay taxes at an individual rate i'm here to support with businesses with the state of Rhode Island thank you for having me you know times are tough and unfortunately our federal government has spent about five trillion dollars that they had to borrow from China and our children over the last four years foot that isn't perspective we spent 350 billion dollars when ability it actually meant something remember that when it was a lot of money they throw these trillions around like a chump change we spent 350 billion dollars to fight World War two no one can believe how much money that was at the time we Barton within that money 1922 dollars adjusted for inflation equals about four twenty twenty dollars about the same these folks these career politicians in Washington DC have borrowed from our children I ask you to look around outside you see World War two type progress the United money they leverage against our children's future and love to put this into perspective for you 1,000,000,000,000 settings just one is almost thirty two thousand years that's what they are doing to our children and I'm a father I'm a businessman that is the sum of my life in my adult years I'm not a Dior are I'm a father a businessman and we're Islander that cares about a state it cares about his country and let me tell you the definition of insanity is elected the same people over and over again and expecting a different result we need new faces to solve the problems that the last generation of career politicians have left well not gonna do about doing the same things we need to get the government out of the way and put the entrepreneur and small businessmen and women back in the driver sees morning I join everybody in thanking you and thanking the Chamber of Commerce for hosting all of this I spent a lot of time listening to businesses and Island folks who come to my community dinners folks who I see on my summer business tours folks so it does it when i go to factory floors and it is absolutely clear that jobs and economic development remains a vital issue it is also be clear to me that for many businesses there are in fact government programs that really do help they help stem the counter site with a wash of boom and bust and they help focus where their gaps on the private market Michael black would not have national marker in this state if it worked for that this is administration because there was a period when you simply couldn't get alone in the private sector so being smart about this and supporting those programs that are really creating jobs and helping us get out of the meltdown from that economic recession is vitally important it's also vitally important that we not allow this discussion to hold a gun to our head for other purposes so for instance folks who want to cut and voucherize Medicare are using this occasion to try to generate liberation to do that kind of damage to Medicare I think that's dead wrong that's for me a red line I think folks want to push their folks who want to push social security in the discussion it's got a 2.7 trillion dollar surplus they want to push it in this discussion I think another place where we need to stand and fight there are a lot of there is no private program that is going to support a kid who needs a Pell Grant a kid who needs a pell grant comes from a family that doesn't have a lot of resources and it's a piece and paying for college education I think Pell grants are absolutely vital to fight for so we have to have this discussion it has to be solved in a balance in a reasonable way and cannot posterity cliff our way out of the sequester and we also have to make sure that we don't take the core pillars of the American middle class kick them out from under the middle class because there's a group in Washington that wants to hold this issue hostage to get those things done things that the American public doesn't want so I intend to be a very strong advocate for allowing in those sites and I look forward to continuing to serve them continue to represent an island for those critical purposes jobs and protecting the core pillars of middle class thank you for having me as well and thank all of you for attending I know that you're probably hearing my words by the end of this discussion but i have to say touches on a number of things here first of all when you talk about southern europe and austerity let's remember there's two parts to that what they've been forced to do because they spent so much money more much money than they had is to cut spinning and raise taxes that's what upstair he is in southern Europe that's why you see writing okay so it's obviously not the right idea to cut spending and raise taxes so that shouldn't be part of the discussion I don't have raising taxes as part of my program my idea is to simplify the tax code take seventy seven thousand pages of the tax code down to one hundred and lower the overall tax rates to maybe even a flat tax or may simple two or three brackets take everything including subsidies to oil companies completely out so don't hold that over me to pledge to Grover Norquist I refused to sign that pledge why because I want to be flexible I want to go down and be able to negotiate at my fullest that's what I've done on my life that's what I intend to do in Washington all this talk about this people are holding you back from what you want to do is unsatisfactory to me I have a great idea about what to do I want to grow the economy and one of the points that we're looking at is the Federal Reserve policy we have a federal reserve that is completely out of control why because our fiscal policy stinks and our government isn't working and we haven't passed a budget in four years all things that have to do with you gentlemen up here if I go down to Congress one of the first things that I'll say is if we don't pass a budget we don't get paid you guys all agree with that one I'm a co-sponsor detail excellent none of us will get paid none of us will get paid let's pass a budget immediately now with regard to federal reserve policy one thing that you didn't mention in 2008 tarp had a thing called interest on reserves it was yet another tool we handed to the Federal Reserve my discussion regarding interest on reserves was picked up by the washington post as one of being one of the thirteenth most innovative ideas of the united states I'm thinking in different ways in these people are thinking I'm thinking about growth I'm thinking about taking the national economy and supporting to do that we need to have a stable dollar have a stable dollar we need to have a Federal Reserve that is not out of control that is rules-based that is within the power of Congress to set the mandates of the Federal Reserve once we have a a simplified tax code and a stable dollar and we cut into this regulatory mare that we have them Congress we are going to be in a position when the United States economy will grow and that will create jobs and that will lift throw down because Rhode Island isn't going to have a miracle on its own rhode island is a canary in the coal mine we're lasting everything because our policies that have largely been the part of some of these people who have been government their entire lives both here in Rhode Island and the national government have failed and they have failed miserably I want to try something new let me grow the federal economy let me help with Rhode Island still in Japan you have the confirmation we have the last two minutes and then we thank our panel Laurie want to thank you in the chamber for hosting us here today give you sum up to talk about things that we're passionate about certainly the things that I do focused on the night we've been passionate about is make sure they require you to create a strong middle class we all know that America always succeeds when the middle class is doing well and in what major things that we can do I was going to get our fiscal house back in order to agree with others who have Senate is that put people back to work and people working to peg taxes and this bed balance to our to our gyorko government country and obviously getting our fiscal house in order is going to require a balanced approach strategic we were spending and programs that will come with those things not working but making sure that we are spending will receive you need return on investment whether it's an education or an infrastructure those are the things that matter the most along with making sure that we create a climate in the state in the country where my businesses can thrive and and they can work and whether it's a certainly a bounce attached to a little certainty to our to our tax code or it's make sure that we have a skilled workforce that are able to fill the jobs are available now and then will be well into the 21st century I still believe that both were idols days and America's days are better days are ahead of us and I'm fighting to make sure that that we can get us there but we are clearly we do best when we are all in this together those who think that I believe in vallejo equation well I'd like to thank each of you for spending time with us this morning and demonstrating an ill straight into how much you know and also would be here so on behalf of the very Baba just favorite over stuff good luck to all of you and thank you

you know there's an old saying that there's no such thing as a free lunch but what about other things what about free spanish-language driver's ed classes for free backpacks notebooks pencils and school supplies in the month before school starts free financial wellness workshops free turkeys on the week before Thanksgiving these things are all given away at events hosted by the Libre initiative a self-described grassroots organization dedicated to a free and open society the events were held in Latino communities throughout the country including Las Vegas Miami and Orlando people attending these events were asked to fill out a questionnaire questions included are you more likely to vote for a Republican or a Democrat in the 2016 election do you feel the government should increase or decrease federal spending in order to improve the economy and what is your name email address and telephone number people actually had to hand over their personal data in exchange for the free stuff so the stuff wasn't really free after all but close enough right well in a career spent as a prosecutor I've learned one thing always follow the money if you follow the money just one step back you learn that Libre is a shell organization funded by Charles and David Cote two of the most powerful men in American politics Charles and David Koch are the owners of Koch Industries a massive energy company that manufactures distributes and refines petroleum Koch Industries is one of the largest privately held companies in the nation with estimated annual revenues of over 100 billion dollars what does all this mean it means that the Koch brothers are two very very rich men and there's nothing wrong with that but what is wrong is the way the Koch brothers use their money to hijack our democracy for their own benefit the Koch brothers are self-described radicals who believe that the government should play no role in Americans lives the Koch brothers believe in a world no Medicare no Social Security no federal minimum wage no public programs that support families when they fall on hard times and no rules preventing Koch Industries from polluting our air drinking water or our public lands the Koch brothers hate environmental regulations because Koch Industries is one of the top ten worst polluters in the United States fewer environmental regulations means the Koch brothers can obtain bigger financial gains to keep their empire afloat the Koch brothers are not just polluting our environment they're polluting our political system and they're polluting our airwaves with false advertising the cokes want Americans to believe that climate change is a conspiracy despite the global scientific consensus that climate change is caused by burning fossil fuels why would they want to cast doubt on scientific fact because the Koch brothers sell and burn fossil fuels for a living and they believe protecting our environment is bad for their bottom line to protect their bottom line the cokes funnel money through a network of nonprofit organizations foundations and shell companies these companies lobby the government produce fake research reports and run ad campaigns to manipulate and deceive the American people buying a democracy does not come cheap but the Koch brothers are not stingy in 2010 the Year Citizens United open the floodgates for big money in politics the Koch spent one hundred and twenty five million dollars to support Republican candidates who pledged to roll back environmental and consumer protections since the 2010 elections their influence has grown they've spent hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars supporting candidates who spread lies that climate change is a conspiracy that immigrants cause crime that more money in the Koch brothers pockets means more money in yours and now the Koch brothers have big plans for the upcoming 2018 election they have announced that they will spend four hundred million dollars in the upcoming election cycle their largest term election investment yet much of that money will be spent directly targeting Latinos through advertisements events and workshops the Koch brothers think they can buy the Latino vote just like they've bought the votes of the house freedom caucus and so many Republican caught politicians but despite what their ads say the Koch brothers are not advocates for the Latino community they are advocates for more money in their own pockets nothing more the Koch brothers have supported some of the most anti-immigrant politicians in America including Louie Gohmert Mike Pompeo Steve King Russell Pierce and Chris Kovac these are their men responsible for policies like Trump's Muslim ban and Arizona's anti-immigrant law sb1070 the Koch brothers support politicians who want to end government funding for Planned Parenthood if they get their way Latinos would be hurt the most more than 23% of Planned Parenthood patients are Latinas Latinas are more likely to be diagnosed with cervical cancer than women in any other racial or ethnic group Planned Parenthood gives them access to annual screenings so they can stay healthy and cancer-free and the Koch brothers support school choice which they say gives Latino families more freedom and how they educate their kids but school choice vouchers take money out of the public school system causing many Latino kids whose parents can't afford private schools to fall behind and the Koch brothers are close allies of Betsy DeVos our current education secretary her claim to fame is her role in dragging michigan's public education system to the bottom of national rankings and leaving thousands of students without access to a quality education to make matters worse the cokes are working to undermine access to health insurance for working people Latinos are less likely to have health insurance than any other racial or ethnic without health insurance a trip to the ER can result in a bill so expensive that a family can't pay their rent for months organizations like Libre will tell you that their agenda is designed to promote freedom and self-sufficiency they put out propaganda implying that Democrats don't believe in freedom because we believe that government has a role in protecting access to affordable health care clean water air and quality schools the Koch brothers love freedom but their freedom is to pollute our rivers streams and our air Democrats believe in a different kind of freedom the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water the freedom to walk away from a trip to the ER without a medical bill that costs more than what you make in a year the freedom to walk into Planned Parenthood and walk out with information you need to make your own reproductive choices we don't believe in the kind of freedom that allows Charles and David Cook Koch to pull the strings of our democracy how can anyone call that freedom at all but the Koch brothers and their web of dark money organizations like Libre are really doing is deceiving Latinos and supporting the very same politicians who are working against Latino families so this year as the Koch brothers are pulling out their checkbooks to fund their disinformation campaign follow the money follow the money to find out who's paying for that glossy ad you see on TV follow the money that flows through Libre and other coke back organizations to politicians who vote against immigrants dreamers and refugees the Koch brothers have spent millions of dollars funding Tea Party candidates in Congress the main obstacles to immigration reform what good are school supplies and Driver education classes and free health check-ups if parents of American citizens are getting deported if schools and our communities are being gutted and if community health clinics are closing their doors the Latino community in Nevada and communities of color across America are strong resilient and diverse we will not be fooled by false advertising so many of our family members came to this country because they knew what it was like to live under the rule of oligarchs and elites they came here because they wanted to have the freedom to pursue to pursue their dreams Charles and David Koch what to buy Latino votes by our voices to buy our democracy which folks like my dad Manny Cortez worked all their lives to protect but I believe in the wisdom of the American people mr. president I believe in the wisdom of our voters who will fight the lies just like they did in Nevada two years ago I've seen the cokes power and influence firsthand they spent ten million dollars trying to defeat me in 2016 they threw millions into libre to buy off Latino voters in Nevada but they failed because Democrats in Congress continued to beat the drum and make voters aware of the lies and I'll keep fighting to do the same in the Senate

if i could yeah it is not and i don't know how you come up with this it's not just the amount of money you're spending in court it's the amount of money you're also spending trying to make a decision bulletproof so that it's not taken to court and stuff and i've asked a former chief of the forest service i said how much money do you when you make a decision to do say a timber cut how much of the money is spent actually making what is you consider a good sound scientific decision and how much trying to make it bulletproof in court because you know you're going to end up in court and he said depending on the decision it's probably somewhere between 25 and 50 percent is making what we believe to be a good sound scientific decision between 50 and 75 percent trying to make it bulletproof how much money are we spending that we should be spending on managing our public lands that end up in in court and trying to prevent it from going court but ultimately you're not going to end you're not going to prevent that so it is uh it's a difficult issue uh and if somebody has the answer to it i'd be a happy camper and retire happy

. RIGHT NOW - SENATE MINORITY LEADER MITCH MCCONNELL SAYS HE WON'T COMMIT TO GIVING SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM'S 15 WEEK ABORTION BAN BILL A VOTE... IF THE REPUBLICANS RETAKE THE SENATE IN THE MIDTERMS. HOWEVER -- HE WOULD NOT RULE OUT SCHEDULING A VOTE. MCCONNELL SAID REPUBLICAN SENATORS HAVE THEIR OWN OPINIONS ON THE ISSUE... AND THEY MAY BE DIFFERENT IN DIFFERENT STATES. THE ACT... WOULD BAN ABORTIONS NATIONWIDE AFTER 15 WEEKS OF PREGNANCY. THE PROPOSAL COMES THREE MONTHS AFTER THE SUPREME COURT OVERTURNED ROE V. WADE. AND NEVADA SENATOR JACKY ROSEN RELEASING A STATEMENT OPPOSING THE PROPOSED BAN. SHE SAYS, QUOTE THIS DANGEROUS NATIONWIDE GOVERNMENT MANDATE WOULD TAKE AWAY WOMEN'S FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOM TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR OWN BODIES, AND PUT THEM AND THEIR DOCTORS AT RISK OF BEING THROWN IN JAIL. I WILL DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO FIGHT THIS LEGISLATION THREATENING OUR REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS IN NEVADA, AND I WILL WORK WITH MY COLLEAGUES TO ENSURE IT NEVER BECOMES LAW." MEANTIME

but there's some significant work to do at the federal level to make sure we are addressing pfas contamination head on i think one of the um important distinctions about this issue is that it is a bipartisan issue um and it is a real concern for people in each and every state across the country there are little literally tens of thousands of sites all across our country where there is pfas contamination millions of americans are drinking water that is contaminated um and so um i think it's important to bring to light the way that this impacts people and local communities in new hampshire but we also have to understand that this is an issue of national concern where we need action from the federal government so it's really long past the time for congress to pass comprehensive legislation that would protect the health and well-being of the american people from alarming levels of these so-called forever chemicals we know that they're found uh in our water and in our environment we know that they persist in the human body uh and uh it's really important at this moment uh that we seize the opportunity to make some progress i think there's a growing level of awareness in congress about this issue because of the activism and awareness that has come from the local level and i really want to commend all those individuals across new hampshire and community leaders who have brought our attention to the issue of pfas contamination

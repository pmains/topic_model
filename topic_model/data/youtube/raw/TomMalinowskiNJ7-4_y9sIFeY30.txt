well meantime the biden administration facing blowback for its decision not to single out saudi arabia's crown prince for sanctions mohammed bin salman's name was conspicuously missing from the list of dozens of saudis now banned from entering the u.s as punishment for the 2018 killing of journalist jamal khashoggi this even though a u.s intelligence report says bin salman personally approved the history operation here's what the white house had to say uh historically the united states through democratic and republican presidents has not typically sanctioned government leaders of countries where we have diplomatic relations well officials also say going after systemic issues in the kingdom is the best way to prevent more killings like hash oxies well not everybody agrees democratic congressman tom malinowski vice chair of the house foreign affairs committee tweeted quote i applaud president biden for declassifying the finding that saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman ordered the murder of jamal khashoggi but naming mbs without holding him accountable undercuts our message to the saudis today representative andy kim and i introduced a bill to correct this well tom malinowski joins me now by skype from washington your bill um as i understand it um will uh will effectively um uh affirms that certainly affirms that the crown prince will be denied entry into the u.s and requires the administration to certify the saudis are no longer engaging in a pattern of intimidating their critics in the us as a condition for further arms sales sir have you received a response or reaction to this yet i i uh i've been speaking to the the biden administration and and you know i really do applaud what they did it's a big deal for the president of the united states to say that that mbs the putative leader of saudi arabia is a killer and that he was responsible for this particular murder that's going to follow mbs for the rest of his life but uh it is important that there be some consequence attached to that otherwise we're going to continue to signal to the saudis that somehow mbs is in a special protected category but he can continue to get away with this kind of stuff in in the future and that somehow the united states is more afraid of losing favor in riyadh than riyadh is afraid of losing favor in washington it should be the other way around 76 saudis are now banned from entering the us as part of america's efforts uh it seems to punish saudi arabia over the murder of jamal khashoggi washington though sir with respect has made its position very clear saudi arabia is a u.s ally and there are other ways to teach them a lesson than punishing the crown prince i just want our viewers to have a listen to what middle east commentator ali shahabi told the bbc about this at the end of the day they realize and they understand that the crown prince is playing a very important role in restructuring the country in fighting reactionary islamic ideas and movements in in the region and in saudi arabia and in implementing very important change a lot of that is true um well supported around this region and a lot of saudis inside the country do like the crown prince for the changes uh the difficult changes that he is undertaking so that does indeed beg the question is the good you are getting better than the bad um i guess the point is the white house drawing a line under this and there will be those who um suggest that you do the same to to which you say what or to whom you say what well i think it's interesting that people are now uh arguing that this is an important relationship and and that we need the united states needs to take it upon ourselves to protect this relationship but what are we protecting it from we're protecting it from the absolutely reckless actions of mohammed bin salman this is this is a saudi leader who unlike any previous saudi leader reached beyond saudi arabia into the united states to murder a an american resident a washington post journalist somebody who does the same job that you do in effect and that you don't do that that's not a human rights issue that is an affront and an attack on the united states you don't claim to be a united states ally and do that and and mbs was not the only person in the united states that i'm sorry that jamal khashoggi was not the only person in the united states that mbs tried to kill apparently so it is absolutely vital for the preservation of a healthy relationship between the united states and saudi arabia to draw a line and to say you do not do this and if you do this or any other leader around the world does this they will be held accountable i mean the biden argument is that keeping good relations with its one it's key ally in in the gulf is is in in america's interests um and we've heard that argument and it's been laid out now a number of times by by the white house um since the uh release of the uh or the declassification of that report so i do want to just um get your thoughts on yemen which of course both saudi arabia and the us have a stake in yesterday was the pledging donor conference for yemen the u.n secretary general calling it disappointing and that was the least of what he said um funds uh fell far short of the uh three and three-quarter um billion aid target um jan eglin the head of the nrc who was visiting yemen on the ground told me this i can be very clear the shortfall will be measured in lives lost in children's lives lost the children and the youth the women the most vulnerable whom we all must agree have nothing to do with this senseless conflict among grown men that on both sides are willing to quarrel and fight each other to the last child the u.s pledging 191 million dollars sir um as vice chair of the foreign affairs uh committee i just want to pick your brain on what you believe or what more you believe the u.s should be doing in yemen to avoid a famine in 2021 well in just three weeks the baid administration has uh has turned our policy towards yemen around as you know the trump administration was backing the saudis providing military assistance vital to saudi arabia keeping this war going that has now ended we've that that puts a lot of pressure on the saudis to come to the table uh biden has appointed a u.s envoy to promote a diplomatic solution to to this horrible conflict uh and at the same time yeah we absolutely do need to do more and i would support spending more to uh to deal with the humanitarian situation um but you know i can't help bringing it back to our previous conversation the reason why we are spending billions of dollars to try to keep people in yemen alive is because saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman started a war that everybody urged him not to because he recklessly believed that he could get away with it and now we have to clean up the mess that saudi arabia helped to create we have to clean it up because we have an obligation a humanitarian obligation to do so but let's not forget um who bears ultimate responsibility i'd like to see the saudis and the emiratis pay for this by the way they can afford to do it that created the problem they should not be turning only to the united states and the norwegians and the brits and the french to again pay for cleaning up their mess 430 million let's be transparent about this 430 million dollars pledged by saudi arabia 230 million uh pledged by uh the emiratis and six billion spent by them i am told over the past six years in aid not through the un track necessarily and the argument in this region was certainly from the saudi arabia uh from the uh kingdom is that this um uh the threat posed by these uh by the houthis is an existential threat to saudi arabia but so you've made your points and we appreciate your time on this show thank you very much indeed for joining us

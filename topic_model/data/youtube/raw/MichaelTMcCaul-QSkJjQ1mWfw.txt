recognized for two minutes I think the gentleman mr. speaker as a former federal prosecutor at the Department of Justice I do not take these proceedings lightly above all those at the department cherish their integrity the mr. speaker that integrity has now been impugned this is not about politics it's about pursuit of the truth and justice the definition of contempt is the willful disobedience to or open disrespect for the rules of orders of a court or legislative body this definition falls squarely within the facts here when insiders revealed the government's role and operations fast and furious the Department of Justice falsely told Congress the whistleblowers weren't telling the truth and as Congress fulfilled its oversight obligations and tried to get to the bottom of how guns were illegally put in the hands of Mexican drug cartels ultimately killing more Patrol Agent Brian Terry this administration refused to turn over crucial documents that would shed light on this instead they asserted the executive privilege at the eleventh hour really calling into question the validity of the privilege itself and at the same time demonstrating that communications were held at the highest levels in the government in fact the wire touts we all know who wore to the department are approved at main justice mr. speaker this attorney general needs to be held accountable the Terry family the families of the Mexican people who have been slain and killed and the American people deserve no less thank you

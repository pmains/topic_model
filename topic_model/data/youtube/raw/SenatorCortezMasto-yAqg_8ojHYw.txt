three-two-one hello everyone it's captain Cortez Masto US senator from Nevada and this week is transgender Awareness Week why is that so important because just last month the Trump administration announced that they were going to change the definition of gender and narrowly define it which will if successful roll back all protections that we have fought for for transgender Americans it is something that we all need to stop and stand up against and so I want everybody to know I stand with our transgender Nevadans and Americans you are part of our community you should be proud I am proud to stand with you and as this week as we move forward let's all recognize transgender Americans I am so proud to represent them in the state of Nevada and across this country so thank you

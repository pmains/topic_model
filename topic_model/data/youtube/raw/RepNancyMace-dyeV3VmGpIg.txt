even more spending president biden preparing to unveil his one trillion dollar family's plan later this month focusing on government-funded child care among other things south carolina congresswoman nancy mace joins us live with her thoughts on the latest spending proposal good to see you this morning congressman thanks for being here good morning okay so let's go ahead and pull up here some of the things that this includes 225 billion for paid family and medical leave about 225 billion for child care support 200 billion for universal pre-k schooling hundreds of billions in education funding other sums for nutritional assistance i was down in dc uh this story you were involved in it last week and we were talking about how you're a single mom of two kids um so with that background what do you think about this well it seems like every day there's another trillion dollar package that the biden administration is proposing and we had a two trillion dollar covert relief bill that had literally very little to do with coveted relief we're seeing proposals for two trillion dollar infrastructure package that has very little to do with infrastructure there's another two trillion out there that they want to spend that would you know provide for for the pre-k and community colleges pay for it and i don't know i don't know how we pay for this without raising taxes on hard-working americans and you know i kind of go back to jfk's comments many many decades ago ask not what your country can do for you but you can do for your country people want to earn their success here in the united states is there a better way to support american families well certainly i think during cobit 19 we've had tremendous challenges i'm a single mom i talk to single moms and single parents every day with kids being out of school that is the greatest challenge that we have right now and it's one of the worst things we could be doing because our children are safe in school but many many parents had to pause work or stop working to help take care of their kids because they were being educated at home i think that's the first thing that we could do the second thing that we could do right now to help the american people is to stop incentivizing unemployment we have folks that want to get to back to work we the businesses want to be open but the federal government with the additional unemployment checks are coming out and stimulus payments there are many folks that simply just won't go back to work and so these are things that that we should we should be doing to help the american people it's the best way forward okay so the president accepted house speaker nancy pelosi's invitation to deliver his first joint session of congress uh that would be on wednesday april 28th you take issue with the timing of this right yes essentially he's going to be playing to an empty room i know with covet 19 things are different but to have this joint session the state of the union address when when congress isn't even going to be there not scheduled to be there is a great disservice to the american people we had an opportunity at the beginning of the year coming out of a crisis to lead our country during this crisis to bring people together to unify and so far it's just been a talking point and yet this is another example of how we are divided i would love to be able to to sit there and hear the president of the united states in great tradition to give that speech but i'll be back at home working in the district since we're not up here that week and if you did if you guys were working i should say how much longer can kovid be used in excuse especially when most of you guys are vaccinated if not all well right i i mean we're essentially the first place in america if you're going to have herd immunity that likely has hurt immunity with the percentage of members of congress who've been vaccinated and those who haven't many of them have had covid19 we we could be a great example for the american people on how to get it right for once and we're just fumbling the ball in every every way that we can right now and i can tell you as a freshman member it is incredibly frustrating

Thank You mr. speaker my name is Pete Stauber and I was a law enforcement officer for 23 years in the great state of Minnesota the city of Duluth in December of 1995 at 10:32 p.m. at the intersection of 6th Avenue east and 4th Street in Duluth Minnesota a criminal who should not have had a firearm tried to take my life I was shot in the head and by the grace of God I survived a few years after that while on duty in a hostage situation another criminal pulled a gun on me face to face I was staring down a barrel of a handgun the suspect pulled the trigger the gun malfunctioned and I was in a fight for my life when it was all over by the grace of God I was alive the individuals handcuffed both those individuals were career criminals back to what I was shot in the head Mr Speaker I begged the US Attorney along with our Police Department to charge the individual with the felony with the possession of a handgun by a felon they didn't do it that individual was allowed to circumvent our community for another eight years before he was finally put in prison where he belonged no more harming other people representative Collins mass violence prevention Act gets the County Attorney's and our federal attorneys present to prosecute these individuals that have no respect for life I carried a handgun for 23 years mr. speaker as a tool to defend my life or somebody else's life from great bodily harm I support the individual right of law-abiding citizens the right to keep and bear arms both my wife and I live in rural Minnesota when we need to protect ourselves when it takes a while for law enforcement to get there we have the ability there is nobody I know that wants somebody that going through a mental health issue or a career criminal or a drug dealer to have these we need to start respecting life life is precious from conception to natural death I am a very proud husband of an Iraq war veteran who understands the value of life here I rise against this there are better ways to get mothers and fathers county attorneys federal prosecutors local police departments sheriff's departments to work together to have a fusion center so when a young individual types into the computer I want to be a mass school shooter there's an instant response to identify the individual and work through it I heal the rest of my time Thank You mr. speaker

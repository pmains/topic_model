murkowski thank you Mr chairman to just follow on uh a couple of the questions that the chairman had asked and this is to you Mr Javed uh the the 2.5 gigahertz span is that's just one ban there are we hearing from tribes or or tribal entities that are interested in uh assessing other bands we are we have seen interest from some tribal entities in in licensed Spectrum in the 3.5 gigahertz range and there's one tribe in Oklahoma that has uh won about 19 of those Priority Access licenses through the FCC spectrum auction we also understand that tribes are taking advantage of uh the uh unlicensed portion of that band as well as they're designing their systems and so we are seeing interest in other license Spectrum opportunities and then Ms moino um you know even though we're talking about about tribal access to Spectrum you also issued another report on tribal tribal broadband and and as I mentioned in my opening comments we've we've seen some some really unprecedented levels of funding that are available to support Broadband deployment use and adoption and digital Equity Spectrum uh Wireless is just one of the technologies that can help expand Broadband services to to tribal lands and I'm just going to note for the committee here we have behind you mismo you know we have some folks from Alaska that are are following these Broadband issues very carefully Christine O'Connor from the ATA uh Bryce Edgeman who is a a representative long-term representative from State of the house State House of Representatives who passed the legislation establishing the Broadband and office there in the state of Alaska and so lots of interest of course in this as as we look to the funding that is available all that is happening this conversation about Spectrum how well are these agencies that um all have a piece of this how well are we coordinating efforts whether it's from ntia USDA FCC DOI historically when you've got a bunch of agencies alphabet agencies in this it's uh it's sloppy at best how are we doing excellent question you know I think when we did review all the programs I think we were surprised to see how many that there actually were and then all the overlapping we had a report that showed you know these are for deployment these are for adoption this is for you know all the disparate um things that go into Broadband deployment you know we were really recommending to have a national strategy um I think if you go all the way back to 2010 we had the national Broadband plan that had awesome recommendations um and now it's time I think for a refresh and definitely getting Spectrum in there as well I mean it's it's a big part of the of the solution especially in Rural and remote areas fixed Wireless and and other Wireless Technologies so we still don't have that National strategy is what you're saying no no no I'm gonna ask a question to to Mr cropley um and and and to thank you Chris for for being here um we we know in Alaska that there really is no one-size-fits-all solution for broad pan and and again spectrum is just one component of clink at haida's plans to improve Broadband Services there in in southeast so how um Chris how are you piecing together the different funding Federal funding opportunities to improve high-speed internet in southeast and and can you speak to some of what you would consider to be the uh the the obstacles it's one thing to be able to get funding because there are federal resources that are out there but think for instance things like permitting if you can speak to that thank you very much thank you everyone and I will keep it keep the thank yous down but uh I know I miss miss somebody if I do um we are leveraging the 2.5 gigahertz um Spectrum in Southeast Alaska and uh to have a successful outcome as you mentioned we do require funding and we have been seeking funding through different agencies and the um as you know there's the Alaska plan uh that that looks at 20 24 billion dollars to provide Broadband to all of Alaska so we could consume a significant uh portion of of the funding that is available Nationwide and and uh to provide Broadband just to all of us here in Alaska the 2.5 is is one very important piece as you mentioned um each location is bespoke and requires a tailored solution what works in um pains or Sitka maybe doesn't fit for uniplate or another location so each Community needs to be looked at separately for back hall and that sort of thing the 2.5 is uniquely suited um to be very friendly in Southeast Alaska where we do have a lot of foliage and water it has some technical capabilities that help it overcome some of those challenges we are able to use the 2.5 to bring Broadband to temporary settlements like moose camps Fish Camps they had our part-time we have a lot of residents living on boats we're able to bring Broadband there and I believe the future of 2.5 is bright with 5G hybrid uh Technologies leveraging 3.5 and and other pieces of spectrum on tribal land that [Music] um that we have access to um using Leo as Bionicle fiber where we already have it is is an important part the um we are able to set up mobile towers and move Broadband where we need it when we need it some of the funding opportunities exclude mobile Towers I think that one of the biggest challenges I faced besides the permitting that I'm looking at now which I will bring up in a second is how some of the funding nofo the complexities and the nofos maybe don't address Uh current industry standard practices when it comes to operational versus Capital expenses on subscriptions back in the good old days you would buy a piece of equipment and it would work until it didn't and now everything requires a subscription so the operational costs are almost one-to-one on Capital and a lot of these opportunities are capital only I think the 2.5 is the first step in providing stewardship uh all Spectrum over tribal lands which we are required to get consent and and I think that that's a something we should consider um if we were to do timber or any other resource on tribal land there would be some sort of compensation or agreement I think it's uh an interesting new problem that that we can look at the permitting is the next issue I we have some 2.5 and it's been challenging with the um with all the different entities trying to work together and what is a tribal entity and who has um as hopefully everyone knows or gets to know you know Alaska is is unique when it comes to how tribes are handled we are we are not in a reservation system except for our friend staff and Matt lakawa um and so it creates some confusion I think when people are writing legislation or nofos when it comes to who is um responsible for the land and who is not a tribal entity um the some of the pieces that we're using um ACP um is is a a great program to help us bootstrap and that we can um again help with that operational cost um and get those who need it most uh financial support or um for our program the ntia the specific tribal funding has been exceptional um it's it's you know um USDA their reconnect is great but it is um like having a coupon to the helicopter store um we not are not necessarily um in the operational position to to take advantage of that and so looking um bringing that back to permitting if you look at the forest service they are um do not look at tribal isps like what uh Clinton height is doing as uh as as part of that uh streamline permitting process because we are not at Etc I think that that could use some attention and um the buildback uh I'm sorry if I butchered that but buyback better America um is a bit of a challenge when you're asking the least served um and we're trying to do everything quickly and get everything working I think I think um good fast and cheap pick two the tomorrow phrase um so that's uh I think that's what I have to say about that and I hope I get an opportunity to talk some more thank you very much

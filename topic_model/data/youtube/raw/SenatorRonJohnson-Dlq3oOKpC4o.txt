[Music] the outstanding class of 2020. 2020. don your branch insignia [Applause] class of 2020 i propose a toast i propose a toast i propose a toast to the united states military academy welcome everyone i am second lieutenant ramel spike thank you for coming to united states air force academy admissions brief i was a graduate of class of 2020 while my time at the academy i was a military history major i was involved in club frisbee and after graduation and after this assignment as the mission advisor i will be going to pilot training along with me we have second lieutenant dominique gording here with us yeah like lieutenant spike said my name is second lieutenant dominique gordon i'm a proud graduate of the air force academy class of 2019 i majored in behavioral sciences with the minor in french and i participated in club rugby all four years and took up four took home four national championships while i was there i'm excited to talk to all of you uh let's dive right into what we have to offer at the air force academy so we're going to start with our academics so this is our academics and a list of our majors and minors at the air force academy even though i was a behavioral science major i still took aeronautical engineering astronautical engineering and pretty much classes in every single one of these disciplines one because we want well-rounded uh cadets who turn into well-rounded officers by having a knowledge of different things across these boards and then two no matter what you're in at the air force academy you are going to receive your bachelor's degree of science and i know some of that sounds intimidating but i promise you that we have dedicated staff and faculty to help you through these classes we have about a seven to one student-to-teacher ratio so that allows a lot of in-depth study and we have teachers who are really willing and readily available to help you through some of these classes so next we'll talk about the academy experience this is what we say separates us from a normal college or even the other service academies so our honor code our military training our airmanship programs and our location in colorado springs colorado is what separates us from these other schools and we're really going to dive into the airmanship piece because you're going to find a lot of similarities militarily and honor code wise across service academies but air bishop is what really sets us apart nowhere else are you going to find uh your first jump off the airplane is completely solo and that's called our jump program and the top slide we have our gliding program so this little plane has no engine in it it's towed into a sky by a different plane and after that you let go and you can glide around the sky for a good good amount of time and here you have the options to solo if you're able to get through the program at a good enough pace and when you feel confident enough and instructors feel confident in you to allow you to solo it's a pretty cool experience and the bottom picture is also flying but this is power flight there's the actual engine in this plane and i personally took this program senior at the academy and it was a great experience for someone who i wanted to be a pilot but i'd never actually flown before so this is my first time flying an actual plane so it's just nice to forget the controls see what you like see how it is an actual plane to see if it's something you could see yourself doing in the future it's a great experience and i highly recommend it another thing i like to highlight on the slide is the leadership opportunities that we have here not just an airmanship but throughout the air force academy we like to call the air force academy a leadership laboratory so the person teaching me how to jump out of a plane and teach me to find those gliders was another 20 21 year old there are other cadets so you go from participating as a student are as in these programs such as airmanship or basic cadet training or our escape survival training having the opportunity to actively lead the programs that you were just a participant in and it really does teach you what kind of leadership style you want um and what kind of litter you want to be and use as you graduate and become an officer in the united states air force united states space forces so after you survive jump you survive basic cadet training uh you throw your hat up in the air and become a proud graduate of the air force academy you enter into one of our 35 different career fields so like lieutenant gordon said we have 35 different career fields while some you can have any major such as pilot and there are other career fields such as physicists chemistries chemists and engineers that you have to have a specific degree at the academy to do but also a pilot training that comes at a 10-year commitment because the air force puts more time and money into you they want more years out of you so that's 10 years while other jobs like engineers only five and then going down to the last statistic you see that ten percent of graduate school so we have about ten percent that go on to get their master's right away uh go to law school public policy or medical school but that opportunity is not just available straight out of the academy you can continue to have those opportunities even post when you're on active duty you'll get the opportunity to go at least get your masters at some point in your career if that's something that you want to do so next is probably the most important slide in the entire deck how to actually apply so you first go to academyadmissions.com this is the one stop shop for all your questions you may have about applying you can start the application in march of your junior year of high school and the first step of the application is the pre-candidate question there and after that you will be put into candidate status and so on and so forth good points to know is when you start the academy they're rolling deadlines so let's say you and your friend apply but at different times they may have different deadlines than you do so it's important to stand up on your actual application and stay informed on those dates and for those a little bit younger i mean you have summer seminar this opens in december of your high school year you can come here to the academy for a summer and see what life is kind of like and just see the environment and see if this is something you're actually interested in on all that is located on our website academydestinations.com if we don't answer any questions in this briefing that you might have accommodations is a great one-stop shop for all your questions feel free to contact us via email our social media uh call us even and we'll get your questions answered so to summarize these are the the five points of why you know the air force academy is a great place and and really five like selling points would like to say it has no tuition costs no room board in fact we pay you to go to school so that's the monthly stipend medical and dental coverage and the guaranteed career um in either air force or space force so great opportunities there i wouldn't trade my air force academy experience for the life of me um and i know lieutenant spite would have the similar comments too yeah i would agree by far those four years they were tough but i made the best friends i could possibly meet so now i have no people in almost every state in the country was just amazing to me and just the gates and doors the academy opened for me are awesome i've become a leader i've gained confidence in myself and my abilities to lead at such a young age i feel like i already have a stage in my life where i'm going straight and i have goals and not many people can say that at my age so it's amazing feeling we would like to thank you guys all for listening to our brief and if any of your questions

many of you watching this you're in the process of counting your series of last events such as your last football game your last prom your last day of high school the entire senior year seems to be revolved around these last events that for most of us were a mixture of euphoria and sadness i remember that intense feeling of wanting to break free from my youth and dive head first into a new life far away from where i had spent most of my life cultivating my skills and personality where i built all of my relationships but i knew that once i left it would never be quite the same whenever i came back home to visit the day before our day i met some of my classmates everyone was decked out in their unique style of civilian clothes representing who they had been throughout high school my hair was down to my eyes and over my ears my sneakers were multi-colored and the butterflies nestled in my stomach region were beginning to flap their wings at some point during the day the yelling began and i suppose yelling scared the butterflies off for a bit because adrenaline took over my system for most of the rest of the summer i knew the yelling was going to come i had watched all the swab summer videos on youtube but actually experiencing it myself was much different than watching someone else experiencing it eventually you learn to kind of tune it out so it does not get in the way of your own thoughts but it took some time my civilian summer was over and my swab summer had begun it was everything i expected and everything i did not yelling i t sessions in doc stress stress stress every day was different and the same i learned how to shine my shoes make a hospital corner square an actual corner iron my shirts and hold a piece i learned how to work with a group of people and succeed through times of failure eventually those long days became weeks and the summer had ended i remember writing in my thoughts of the day journal that the summer had felt like it took nine months when it was only seven weeks but even though summer was long and grueling that feeling of accomplishment was great and well worth it to all of you current high school seniors enjoy the rest of your high school year of course make sure you're in prime shape when you arrive make sure you also enjoy your last moments of high school your best friends and family do not stress or worry about how the summer will be [Music] welcome to the united states merchant marine academy at kings point new york here you'll find outstanding academics regiment competitive athletics and a hands-on experiential c

transport that across the ocean to the other branches to serve and defend our countries you can either work in the maritime industry or you can work in active duty the military this school gives me a proving ground i've always aspired for something more you also get the opportunity to serve something bigger than yourself i like how every day when you wake up you're waking up with a purpose i've seen a lot of growth in myself since the first day my senior experience really helped me transition into working on a tugboat where i'm working now here at the academy you not only have to be a leader you have to be a follower and i think that being a follower teaches you how to be an even better leader every day you're improving yourself i decided to come to the merch marine academy because of the millions of opportunities that they give you after graduation any young women out there in young women of color i would tell them just to be strong minded have tough skin because it's not going to be easy we have i think the best sailing program in the country tried to find ways i could become an officer because that was also what my godfather encouraged me to do your officer material you need to

transformation at an extraordinary institution [Music] to lead and to serve it is the experience of the united states naval academy the setting is historic annapolis maryland annapolis where a sense of the past confronts the challenge of the future the transformation begins hundred future officers achievers successful in the schools from which they've come but hardly knowing how it could feel a plebe are there any questions about the hand salute about your menus what's for morning meal what's our fridge toasting breakfast [Applause] why don't you do it for every plebe the six weeks of plebe

perspectives put you into a tactical scenario this morning that's going to challenge you both from a leadership perspective their full and demanding class work is integral to the demands and expectations of their military and professional learning experience yourself at this time with very minimal reaction time available all right there are many settings and ways in which academy centered professional development takes place military training is a major focus of the academy's academic year but midshipman summers are fully devoted to professional training in active duty operational settings every midshipman is given direct hands-on experience it's called summer cruise mid-shipment summers are designed to expose each of them to a full range of mission experience from fleet duty at sea and naval air operations to marine corps amphibious and aviation action to submarine duty and a wide spectrum of other important combat and support missions [Music] but the excitement of summer cruise is all too soon a memory and the rigors of being an academy student reassert their necessary emphasis although academic and leadership development are primary there is another aspect in the development of every midshipman that is crucial physical development physical excellence pick it up [Applause] of course between the highs there are the lows the grinding work the exams what they call the dark ages but there is a bright ending and beginning each year [Music] commissioning week whether this is the final parade of year one or year four there is glory for all in what these young men

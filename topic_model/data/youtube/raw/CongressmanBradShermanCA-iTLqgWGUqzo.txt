congressman brad Sherman of California member the House Foreign Relations Committee and congressman are you on Trump's side on this I don't think so I think his appointment of David Friedman to be the next ambassador to Israel is really a step backwards in our effort to achieve a two-state solution I think that Obama has been a very pro-israel president this resolution is not much different than resolutions that passed under and with the acquiescence of Reagan and Carter and others and of course as you mentioned you've got the largest military aid package by far that Israel has ever received negotiated by the Obama administration you approve of the administration's decision to abstain in that vote I think that was a mistake I think though you just said that it essentially reiterated what was long-standing US policy so if that's the case why isn't abstention a mistake well for many years mostly Obama years we have prevented the UN from passing unbalanced resolutions and this resolution focuses on these on settlements as if that's the major obstacle to peace the major obstacle to peace is not only the Terrorism coming from the Palestinian side but their position sometimes disguised under the slogan two-state solution right of return rather as their phrase right their use of the term right of return to put forward a position which you really look at it calls for the expulsion of all Jews or virtually all Jews from the Middle East so it is the extreme position that the Palestinians take this seems to being conflated today there's two separate issues there is a question of do settlement expansion is that the obstacle to a two-state solution of the obstacle to police peace that's one question and the other is is settlement expansion justified forget whether it's an obstacle peace or not maybe you're correct that the real obstacle lies in Palestinian extremism but on the question of whether it's justified or not you agree with the President of the United States Secretary of State long-standing US policy that it is not justified right I don't agree with every settlement I don't agree with everything that anyone else does and you can argue that this settlement is in the wrong place the Israeli Supreme Court has called for the abolition and destruction of certain outposts but that isn't the major issue the major issue is the Terrorism the incitement the teaching of terrorism let me ask you then what is your position on the charge by the Israeli government is a very serious charge Benjamin Netanyahu has made this Ron Dermer the ambassador has made this that not only the US government sort of conspired with folks on the UN Security Council to bring about this resolution steer it through but that John Kerry in the administration are now lying about having done so do you agree with them that John Kerry is lying and the administration is lying the Secretary's speech certainly didn't deny that there were discussions with the proponents of this resolution and had there not been the resolution would have been much worse though whoever crafted the resolution whether there was an American diplomat sitting next not knew what the Obama administration's positions were knew how to draft it so that it wouldn't get vetoed in this lame-duck situation and if it and if the authors of the resolution had not taken Obama's considere beliefs into account it would have been a much much worse resolution it might have been so bad that it would have been vetoed and then perhaps that would have been a better outcome but the it's clear that the authors of this resolution were aware of Obama's thinking so are you hopeful now I mean you basically do you think it is appropriate for the Israeli cultural minister to basically say goodbye President Obama we have Trump now for for the Prime Minister of Israel to be interacting with the president-elect lobbying him to come out in opposition to this the president-elect coming out is that is that an appropriate thing for a president-elect to do during the transition well we do have a First Amendment and even presidents elect are allowed to express their opinion it doesn't touch appropriateness right and I think that this country has gotten more and more partisan and the rules of appropriateness have eroded and continued to erode so I I think it would be more appropriate if President Trump focused only on putting together his new team rather than trying to affect public policy during this transition period that would be more consistent with the traditions of this country and yet at the same time I see all the traditions for fraying as the country becomes more partisan all right congressman brad sherman thanks for joining happy holidays and Happy Hanukkah good to be with you

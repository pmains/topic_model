recognized thank you mr speaker and i thank the gentleman from alabama for his important work on this issue and also the gentleman from ohio and i rise today in support of h.r 4550 the brick act this legislation delays an unnecessary epa rule that imposes overly strict emission standards on american brick kilns manufacturers shouldn't have to deal with the hassles of an overzealous regulator in the first place but they should at least get to have their day in court fighting this unreasonable regulation before incurring millions of dollars of expense to comply since 2003 brick manufacturers have reduced emissions from kilns by 95 percent however epa decided to impose another washington mandate on small businesses which they may not even be able to meet shuttering us brick factories will lead to higher costs for american consumers making it even more expensive to open a business or raise a family additionally manufacturers will shed good-paying jobs in places like malvern arkansas and once again our manufacturing needs will move offshore to a place that pollutes much worse than we do here not only is the epa out of touch with reality on this issue they exhibit no common sense when they regulate jobs away from america and send them to countries that pay subpar wages and have subpar pollution control technology they have a lose-lose proposition mr speaker this is the same epa that negligible negligently released millions of gallons of toxic mine water into the animas river tried to cover up and minimize their actions refuse to take responsibility and resist being held accountable if anyone needs more regulation it's this out of control federal agency not hard-working americans mr speaker for the sake of our environment and economy i urge the house to pass the brick brick act to keep the air cleaner and to save good-paying jobs here at home i yield back the balance of my time

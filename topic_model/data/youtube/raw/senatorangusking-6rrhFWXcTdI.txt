mr. van wheelie very much enjoy seeing you I remember meeting with you in 2013 about this very issue and first madam chair I love this panel we should take them with us everywhere you all have done a really good job of illustrating a lot of issues important issues in a brief time I do want to promote something for the audience and anybody interested in these issues and it is an app called ISO to go produced by ISO and it gives you a moment-to-moment prices all over New England where the the the the demand curve by the way mr. van Willy the the demand is exceeding the forecast at this moment by about half a megawatt you may want to call your office when we finished here but it also gives the where all the resources are renewable oil gas coal nuclear very very useful thank you for for this it's it's incredibly helpful now I want to put up some visual is some visuals I learned visually to what we've been talking about here today the bottom red line on this chart is the Marcellus Shale cost in the region in around in Pennsylvania going back to the beginning of December the blue line is the cost in New England so what this tells us is it's not an it's not a gas it's not a natural gas price problem it's a delivery problem and that's what we've been talking about today it's the infrastructure problem that we've been talking about the problem with the infrastructure is does anybody want to build a two or three billion dollar pipeline to deal with this if it's not going to be necessary the rest of the year and that's where we get into the trade-offs between storage and LNG as a as an option and building the infrastructure and in this I just want to indicate how these things all interrelate the other piece is the relationship between what we just saw which is natural gas prices and electricity an absolute almost entire straightforward correlation as you see and this goes back goes back 15 years hurricanes hit the Gulf gas goes up electricity in New England goes up same thing over the winter of 2014 the polar vortex and we're up in this area I thought $32 megawatt-hour recently so these things are all interrelated one of my favorite comments was from a friend of mine in Maine who said there is rarely a silver bullet there is often silver buckshot and that's what we're talking about here is a multiplicity of resources and the miss Clemens you talked about efficiency the cheapest kilowatt-hour is the one you never use so we've got efficiency opportunities we've got renewables we've got demand response we've got storage we've got infrastructure we've got rate structure mr. MacIntyre we've got rate structure which which will influence how we use power in terms of efficiency during the day I realize I'm making a speech area if you can find a question in here you're welcome to it mr. Van Willy talked to me about this how we deal with this let's make it specific do we build a pipeline or we do more storage so I think it's going to come down to what policymakers decide to do I think there's two parallel tracks in terms of this conversation in New England the one track that we're going to be in the lead on is how do we make sure that the constraint is appropriately priced in the market because two Chairman McIntyre's point and this reprice that constraint we're not going to get the reliability that we seek and I think we learned some things over the past few weeks that make us think that we've still got work to do I think the separate and parallel discussion is hard to relieve these constraints so to miss Clemens is point and I agree with you energy efficiency is one tool in the toolbox miss payments you may have missed it in our analysis but we take into account and project forward all the energy efficiency efforts that the states are making and the New England states have made significant difference I think they lead the nation now in terms of energy efficiency but I think the evolution is occurring faster than what the states are doing with regard to these efficiency investments and my fear really is that the retirements will happen more quickly then these investments will be made and the other thing I look out and one of the problems one of the problems I see here is that gas is the cheapest capital cost and and yet you're taking the price risk and that's one of the trade-offs but the way our system is working now everyone's looking for low rates next year in the next year after and we don't have long-term 15 your Power Purchase Agreements that will support the capital investment necessary for some of the other options yes I think the peak enos of the demand for this field is the issue and I think the we're going to be stuck with this problem for a long time because if you think about where the region is going in the long run we want to take carbon out of transportation and heating which means we're going to drive the demand for wholesale electricity up in the region and so you over time we're gonna have less utilization of the pipeline but when you need it you're going to really need it in a big way and you can offset some of that through electric storage but our issue really is seasonal storage so I think this the region needs to work through the various possibilities and understand what the cost-benefit Radle and again you're talking about grid grid a grid level storage but it's hard to justify the cost of grid level storage if you only need at two weeks of the year correct exactly and grid level storage in terms of today's technologies are not very useful in a multi-day multi week event thank you thank you

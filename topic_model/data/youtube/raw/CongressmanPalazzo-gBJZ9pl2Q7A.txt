for what purpose does the gentleman from Mississippi rise to claim the time in opposition the gentleman is recognized for five minutes I yield myself as much time as I may consume the gentleman is recognized madam Speaker I rise in opposition to the gentleman from Minnesota's amendment put simply the gentleman's amendment would further delay the funding of a ship that our Navy and Marine Corps wants and needs LHH seven is a part of the next generation a large deck and fibia seeeeee assault ships just similar to the USS kearsarge which just returned from an eight and a half month long deployment to where they participated in strikes in Libya and humanitarian assistance and other missions this America class amphibia so sowwie serving our country and providing a vital mission capability for years to come the president's very own fiscal year 2012 budget requests included two billion for the second year of incremental funding for LH a seven previous congresses have supported the ship in her procurement and further delays to this funding or opposed by this administration the Navy the Marine Corps and the House Armed Services Committee my colleague introduced he mentioned by the way the you know the GAO report the Navy strongly disagrees with the GAO report the gentleman has pointed to the Navy has the shipbuilders proposal in hand and at this point are working to complete negotiations to get this ship under contract this year which may happen as soon as August the Secretary of the Navy the Chief of Naval Operations the common ah the marine cores have all endorsed the minimum naval fleet of 313 ships which 33 of those ships are going to be amphibious in nature if the gentleman's amendment were to become law the contract for this amphibious ship could be delayed the ship's delivery to the fleet would be delayed the overall cost of the ship would go up it seems to me as a member of Congress that we need to support programs and policies that enable our men and women in uniform to get the best possible equipment at the lowest cost to the taxpayer the gentleman's amendment does just the opposite this amendment also jeopardizes American jobs nearly 3,500 shipbuilders depend on the ship for work it's cuts to the ship's funding delays in contracting the political gamesmanship put these jobs at risk furthermore the gentleman's amendment provides absolutely no cost savings it's just forces the Navy to budget more for the ship next year and overall it increases the cost to the taxpayer this amendment does not just delay LH a7 the amendment potentially delays our next aircraft carry our submarine and our next destroyer finally the gentleman's amendment is not good for the taxpayer and it's not good for the Navy or the Marine Corps previous congresses have endorsed the procurement of this ship the administration and the Navy have endorsed the procurement of the ship and American jobs depend on the procurement of this show I urge my colleagues in the house to vote no on this amendment and reserve the balance of my time the gentleman reserves the balance of his time that all all times are you a year madam chairman I yield two minutes to the gentleman from Missouri mr. Aiken the chairman of sea power and projection forces the gentleman from Missouri is recognized for two minutes thank you madam chair as the chairman of the sea power or subcommittee we've taken a good look at laha seven and this is an absolutely essential ship nobody is arguing that point it's a large deck and fib assault what's happened though is is that the Marine Corps decided that they wanted to put a well deck in the original design which has caused some additional negotiations and slowed things down a little bit but the point of this amendment is is to strip 150 million dollars away from this project that is a very big problem it's a big problem because next year we've got an aircraft carrier to build a nuclear powered submarine and a destroyer and this money needs to come from the budget this year in order to keep the LH a seven on track as we have talked about earlier this evening we're in a bad position in terms of number of ships in the Navy LH a seven is critical it's important and stripping 150 million does tend to threaten the project or at least push it off and then you have to try and fund it in a year where we don't have the funds because we're building a bunch of other ships so what this does is it guarantees that LH a7 is going to proceed both allow enough time Madame for the negotiator yield for a question god I don't know I don't yield the gentleman from Missouri controls the time the the point of the matter is is that LH a7 has to go forward and and what we have to make sure is that we've got the funding and we're as soon as the negotiations are finished between the Navy and the contractor then we can move ahead on this project so 150 million is important the the exact timing of what it's going to be spent is in question but the necessity to have the money is not in doubt that's why we oppose this amendment and the gentleman yield now with a gentleman yield yield yield now for a question the gentleman from Missouri time has expired the gentleman from Mississippi has 30 seconds remaining madam chairman I'd like to yield the 30 seconds gentleman from Virginia mr. Whitman the gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 30 seconds thank you madam chairman I just want to emphasize the need for our amphibious ships the requirement the national requirements 38 ships the Marine Corps says that they can live with 33 we have 28 today with the Joe's that no will not yield with leave the requirement is 33 we have 28 the bathroom very very simple it is a it is a specific new year through let's make sure that we men from Virginia controls the time we have to make sure we meet that need our Marine Corps travels around the world needing this ship capability it is critical to this nation critical to our defense this must be funded today it's time has expired the question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Mississippi excuse me from Minnesota those in favor say aye those opposed say no in the opinion of the chair the noes have it the amendment is not agreed to request a recorded vote please the gentleman from Minnesota requests a recorded vote pursuant to Clause 6 of rule 18 further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Minnesota will be postponed

14 Republican Senators have signed a letter calling on Secretary of State Anthony blinken and treasury secretary Janet Yellen to hold China accountable for multiple violations when they visit Beijing soon one of the Senators who signed that letter is Louisiana Republican senator Bill Cassidy joins me good evening sir and when you say you're a signatory this letters i hold them accountable for human rights violations unfair Trade Practices increase in aggression I mean it's just getting worse so what is it that you expect them to do to hold them accountable there's things which can be done in the right now and things which have to develop in the future we already have laws that if goods are thought to have been produced using slave labor there's a way to sanction and to isolate that we need to vigorously rigorously enforce those by the way good evening credit um the second the second thing is we need to have a set of policies which recognize that one way that China is able to better compete is they ignore environmental regulations totally ignore so whereas we have a certain cost how do we keep pollutants from going up in the air they don't enforce those regulations making it cheaper to produce Goods there I'm advocating policies that would make them pay a penalty we call it the foreign pollution fee a penalty if they're going to produce Goods there not using appropriate environmental standards and then shipping those goods around the world are back to us in order to compete with our workers with our manufacturers so let's come up with that kind of policy make them pay that foreign pollution fee all right what about the fact I'm just curious how high is this sort of factor system is that President XI of China is headed to Moscow to meet with President Putin on the anniversary of the Russians in Russia's invasion of Ukraine Meanwhile we're seeking to try to hold China accountable I don't think president XI cares what we say uh you know right now it's clear they seem to be doubling down on what they are doing with Russia and they're buying a heck of a lot of cheap energy that the rest of the world won't buy now they are keeping just below the radar of us putting sanctions upon them but I will say the Administration has done some good things and Congress has requested and has passed a law that would that would um start bringing chip manufacturing back to the United States China wants to make the really high-end chips the countries that have that technology now Taiwan the U.S the Netherlands Japan we are collaborating so that China does not get that chip making technology so we need to keep on looking for those areas where China is attempting to produce the goods they need either for their high-end military operation or to otherwise compete with the west and deny them access to that we need to have a coordinated strategy as to how we address them and by the way when I say the Chinese I mean the Chinese communist party Chinese people they're wonderful people it's the CeCe that is the problem and I appreciate you correcting me because I said Chinese people and I made the you know the Communist Chinese party as well Senator Bill Cassidy thank you sir thank you

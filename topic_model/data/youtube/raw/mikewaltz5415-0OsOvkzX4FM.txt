now my next guests are vowing to investigate china's u.s land grab hold them accountable if they are able to take back the majority in the house here with more is florida congressman mike waltz along with congressman texas congressman chip roy mike let me start with you um this is a real clear present danger um if i had if i was making policy i would make them sell that land back to the u.s considering as the governor pointed out it's illegal in the first place in oklahoma yes yes sean let me tell you what's going on in these air force bases uh number one the one in north dakota has some of our most sensitive drone and space technology that connects our space assets to our drones so to intercept that from a few miles away isn't that hard and down in texas where they're buying up hundreds of thousands of acres where we train our pilots the bigger piece shawn is that the chinese communist party is part of their national strategy to replace us as a global power is seeking to dominate our supply chains they already dominate our pharmaceuticals they dominate solar panels and wind turbines that the left are trying to push us towards the lithium supply and in this case now it's our food supply in addition to this land that they're buying up they've also bought the nation's largest pork processing plant they're buying up grain mills because they know that if they can win this economically if they can choke us off with these key supply chains add computer chips and all kinds of others on top of it then they don't even have to worry about a military con conflict and you add our debt on top of that as these stimulus checks keep flowing out to deal with a virus that they unleashed uh on us that are flowing through amazon and walmart right to their manufacturing uh it's checkmate so my message is when you see made in china put it down it's not just a jobs issue it's a national security issue and we've got to wake up as a country congressman chip roy i've always been a a piece through strength uh person you see you know because of the weakness of the president an unholy alliance has emerged you've got the hostile regimes of russia iran and china a new axis of evil if you will i would immediately if i were president i'm not order that china has to sell that property or we will confiscate that property uh i don't think americans are allowed to buy uh land in china are they not that they'd rather yeah sean thanks for that and great to be on here with michael look we uh introduced a year ago h.r 3847 that's curing america's land from foreign interference act to specifically try to force that right to stop the chinese communist party our our enemy our adversary from being able to pick up and buy american land can you imagine sean i mean you and i grew up in the 80s can you imagine if we woke up one day and it was like oh khrushchev is buying up a bunch of dirt across country can you imagine what we would do the reaction would have been just off the charts but yet we're kind of asleep at the switch right now by the chinese communist parties taking specific steps like michael just outlined to attack our country we've got and by the way it's not just china we've got 37 million acres in this country they're foreign owned that's that's essentially the size of iowa we got to wake up and not just governors we got to wake up here in washington we got to prohibit this stop it not allowed to have our agriculture products have the 140 000 acres next to laughlin air force base in in texas and south texas and valverde texas which is extremely concerning from a national security standpoint so i agree with you completely you know my mother used to say we'll rue the day uh one of the mistakes in afghanistan on top of abandoning americans people with green cards are afghan allies and billions of military equipment uh president trump had planned on keeping uh control of bagram air base which would have been pivotal especially from a geopolitical standpoint uh this needs to be dealt with and and i hope general milly was successful i know he was meeting with his counterparts in the region uh creating partnerships to stand up against china let's see what comes of that uh but this has to end this practice needs to stop that property needs to get back in american hands and they need to go buy property in their own country thank you both

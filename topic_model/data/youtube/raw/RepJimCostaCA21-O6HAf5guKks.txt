thank you very much mr. chairman I strike to move to strike the last word this proposal that we've been talking and discussing I think it really hits at the heart of America's safety net the changes to the Supplemental assistant Nutrition Food Program I think could devastate parts that are working well and I want to start by saying that I think we all believe that people who can work should be working work is good all of us have that same goal and turrent in terms of people being self-sufficient that's why I and many of us in this room support the SNAP education and training programs snap education training programs are designed specifically to help these people who are on our recipients develop skills that will ultimately allow them to be self-sufficient and so let me offer an alternative to the proposed language here in the 2014 farm bill those of you that were here for that we we talked about this very subject and we said why don't we come up with some pilot projects and guess what we did in the 2014 bill not only in California and I'm going to describe that project but in Delaware Georgia Illinois Kansas Kentucky Mississippi Virginia and Washington State we have pilot projects that are taking place now and they're going to report back to the Congress next year in 2019 about what works and what doesn't work in in in California in the bridge Academy in my district we have a program that's fostering results more than 80% of the Fresno Bridge Academy clients are placed in stable employment think about that 83% are employed by the same company one year after placement 30% of the bridge Bridge Academy clients have achieved full self-reliance even before they graduate from the 18-month snap education and training program that my friend Pete Weber and a lot of other good folks are been working on the voluntary and I underlined voluntary Fresno Bridge Academy demonstrate success is possible through snap E&T but not all programs yield similar result and it's different regionally throughout the country that's why we have these ten pilot projects in ten different states we are still in the early stages but these are not easy clients to get jobs let me tell you in the bridge Academy 75% of the heads of the household have no employment or enrollment that we're dealing with 24% have no high schools GED 18% have a prior criminal record so but it's also important to note that our clients are not chronic snap beneficiaries but access snap when they are in between low-wage jobs are in between jobs if we want to help people to become self-reliant I don't think anyone disputes that then let's give them a program that does that the mandatory and Perlman and Burgess burgeoning staff and ent programs that are not funded under this measure and I think that's been demonstrated are going to create a large influx it's very likely to cause these programs I think to collapse this will end up costing billions of dollars to create a new federal bureaucracy and we'll never have a chance of success in addition this measure that we are looking at here today could I think could systematically prevent people from getting the food assistance through snap that they badly need again it's our safety net that we're talking about our children are disabled our seniors and our veterans make up two-thirds two-thirds of the snap recipients that's the client base in my district people may not realize it maybe why you want to am so passionate 25 percent of my constituents are on snap and that's why this bridge Academy with a partnership that's been established some four years ago has been and originated and why we're having results because everybody believes we've got to try to do something about this no one debates that so this program is vital to the health of our community both in rural and in urban areas and I have both and across the nation let's get back to the basics this is America's farm bill it's America's food bill it's America's national security we we need to come together we traditionally it should not serve some very well and abandon others because it's our safety not so I would suggest that we what we're considering today is to look at the whole purpose in 2014 to create these 10 pilot projects let's scroll about our business appropriately and then let's look at making the changes when those 10 states report back to us in 2019 next year about what really works and what doesn't work based upon all of these examples around the country that's the proper way to legislate after all states are the laboratories of democracy right I yield back the balance of my time Shimon Jones back I would point out that the bridge Academy would be one of those opportunities for a state like California to take advantage of with money that's being provided under this bill so yes that would be a part of their solutions if the state wanted to miss Bustos five minutes

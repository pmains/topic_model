good evening and welcome to Jays roots 2018 national conference a voice for today and a vision for tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow April 15th marks 10 years to the day since the official launch of J Street on the one hand I can't believe how quickly the years have flown by and on the other I'm amazed by all that we've achieved in so short a time first and foremost we have established that without a doubt there is more than one way to be pro-israel we have established we have established a voice for those who believe that loving and supporting Israel doesn't mean you have to always agree with whatever the government of Israel says and does it's a voice that says we can be pro-israel and Pro Palestinians and we are tired and we have had enough of being told it's an either/or choice it's a voice for the majority of our community that supports two states and diplomacy and opposes occupation and demolitions and creeping annexation it is a voice for 200,000 people 200,000 people in chapters all over the country including thousands of students and over 850 rabbis and Cantor's it is a voice that speaks through the largest pro-israel PAC in this country that this year will support 150 candidates for the House and Senate and raise over 4 million dollars it's a voice it's a voice that is earned respect and garnered power my friends after only ten years we should be very proud that today our voice is being heard and at this incredible milestone for us I want to recognize those who made what we have achieved possible so I'd like to open the conference with a huge thank you to the incredible Jay Street staff who not only not only have they worked so hard to put this conference together but they have built this organization from scratch so I'd like to ask all those who work for J Street and everybody who's ever worked for J Street to please stand up let's go and I like the rest of you to join me in a round of applause of appreciation [Applause] next I want to thank the board of directors of J Street and the incredible leaders from all over the country who volunteered their time their energy and their wisdom and who donate their resources to make J streets work possible I also want to thank in particular the 1200 students who are with us here today J Street you j3u pushes us every day to focus on what's right to focus on what's best for the State of Israel for the Jewish and Palestinian peoples and for the American Jewish community Thank You our tenth anniversary coincides with the 70th birthday of the State of Israel Yamato will be celebrated this week and may 15th will mark 70 years since Israel's Declaration of Independence we're really really proud to celebrate the miracle of Israel's rebirth the realization of a 2,000 year dream of the Jewish people to again be a free people in our own land what our parents and our grandparents built and fought for we honor and we celebrate and we pledge not just to help preserve it but to help strengthen and improve it milestones like J Street's tenth and Israel 70th our points of time for celebration but there are also times to take stock of the challenges that lie ahead and my friends the dangers of this present moment are deadly serious when it comes to Israel the starkest challenge is that the one-state reality is fast becoming a true one state nightmare we may be marking 70 years of Independence this year but let's not forget that last year we marked 50 years of occupation Israel is without a doubt at a fork in the road where it either must take the two-state path and remain both Jewish and democratic or head down the one-state path where it has to choose to be one or the other this status quo isn't simply unsustainable it is cruel as the suffering and violence in Gaza of the past few weeks demonstrate [Music] a solution that meets the needs of both peoples is urgently needed and it is the only way out of the cycle of violence that plagues not only the people of Gaza but those in Israel who live on its borders what's needed are not provocations like next month's moves of the US Embassy to Jerusalem or more demolitions and land confiscations on the West Bank the challenges to Israel they go beyond the conflict to the very nature of the state itself whether or not it's going to respect all forms of practice of Judaism will it allow in refugees and asylum-seekers will it protect key institutions of democracy like a free media and independent judiciary or our good friends at NGOs like the new Israel fund and here in the United States I don't think that any of us in this room needs to be reminded of the threats we face under this president to the very heart of our democracy the demagoguery the racism the fear-mongering the assault on the media on key institutions of our democracy this is a moment of real challenge and let me add a word about last night's military attack in Syria we are horrified by the crimes against humanity that had been committed by the Assad regime in Syria the world cannot stand idly by as a leader uses chemical weapons against his own people and killed hundreds of thousands of people with his own hands last night's strike it was limited in scope and it was targeted on sites that were directly tied to the gas attack outside Damascus and it did have the support of a number of our allies but a limited tactical strike does not form the basis of a strategy nor does the legitimacy of the targets alone establish the legality of action the Constitution of the United States vests war-making Authority in the Congress of the United States and Congress needs to assert its authority Congress needs to act we will be calling on them on Tuesday to act to restrain this president in the coming weeks so that this president must get the necessary legal authority for any further military action he must place such action in the context of a larger political and diplomatic strategy and he must build broader international support for that strategy we would be wrong to think that the dangers that we face at this moment in history are limited to Israel and the United States all across the globe liberal democracy is in retreat J Street proudly opposes these trends and we couldn't be clearer in warning of the dangers that President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu posed to their respective countries but ours is not and should not be a movement built simply on opposition we must offer a vision for tomorrow for Israel for Israel our vision is of a thriving secure state that hasn't had to choose between being Jewish and democratic precisely because it has ended occupation and realized the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination in a state of their own it's a vision of a future in which the children and grandchildren of Israelis and Palestinians alike avoid the violence bloodshed and tears that have plagued their parents and grandparents for generations it is a vision of an Israel that lives out the values of the prophets outlined in the Declaration of Independence most notably a commitment to freedom and justice and peace we have a vision as well for the United States that vision is grounded in an unyielding belief in the amazing democratic system that was established by our founders and in the importance of the individual rights that they guaranteed it's of the United States that is a strong and respected world leader that plays a vital role in resolving conflicts through diplomacy and negotiations not causing conflicts it's a vision of the United States that sees the agreement preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon as a good deal and a model for addressing global conflicts through international cooperation and it's a vision firmly rooted in the values that are the bedrock of J Street of this country and of our people as a people who have been refugees and strangers in the lands of others we understand in our bones the importance of offering safety to those in danger and of guaranteeing equality to all regardless of race religion gender or sexual orientation that's why that's why we fight for immigrants and against racism and we battle Islamophobia as we battle anti-semitism it is these values it is these values and that vision on which we have built J Street over the past ten years our challenge now is to bring that vision to life and for that we need to take political power because it is not enough to lead the opposition we have to lead the way J streets number one task for the next seven months is to elect members of the House and Senate who share our values and share our vision and you can block that's how we're gonna block in the irrational and incompetent president from leading this country to disaster and it's up to each of you it's up to each of us to contribute the time the energy and the money that you can to ensure that they win our partners in Israel in Palestine they too must work to bring in new leaders who will show the courage of those who have ended conflicts like Sadat and beggin like Mandela and de Klerk and like the signatories of the Good Friday Accords in Ireland that are marking their 20th anniversary this weekend only when there are leaders ready to take the tough steps necessary to end their conflict will there be an end to occupation an end to the siege of Gaza and an end to the threat of terror and violence [Music] the road ahead is not easy and I know that many here despair in the face of the challenges that we face but complaining and hopelessness gets us nowhere throwing up our hands and walking away only means that our opponents win if we want things to change it is on us to bring that change it is on us to organize and mobilize every challenge and every obstacle can be overcome by good people fighting together for a better future tonight we're gonna meet some of those people Israeli Palestinian and American Jewish Christian and Muslim all of them working on the ground in Israel in Palestine right here at home to shape that better future we draw strength from their example and their determination and as important they draw strength from us knowing that there are Americans working alongside them to change the course of history it may not be 2020 yet but tonight we have 20/20 vision we can see you like that we can see a clear path ahead we know what we must do in our second decade we must do our part in this country to get American policy back on track to support Israelis and Palestinians who seek to end their conflict we must do our part in this country to get American politics back on track and elect those who share our values and vision and we must do our part in this country to get our American Jewish communal institutions and leaders to speak out and act on the values we hold dear United United by our values inspired by our vision J Street is ready to help lift the darkness that is perfect creating our politics today and build a better tomorrow for the generations to come so let's roll up our sleeves let's raise our voices it is time to get to work thank you for all that you do and I'm looking forward to a great conference thank you

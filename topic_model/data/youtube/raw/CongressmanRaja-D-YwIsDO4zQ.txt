a gentleman from Illinois Mr krishnamorthy is recognized for five minutes thank you madam chair Dr Kumar would you like to answer the question thank you yes so um I was going to say that I find it bewildering and naturally I'm flabbergasted at the fact that we have 17 states with abortion bans I'm here to talk about what's going on in Texas and I was very surprised to hear a question about Margaret Sanger I also want to say that a Planned Parenthood we do not stand for racism we're happy to serve our clients that are black and brown we're actually proud to do that thank you Dr Kumar I just want to turn your attention to this 15-week Nationwide abortion band which Senator Lindsey Graham first talked about but it turns out on June 24th of this year uh Mr McCarthy the House minority leader actually said he supported that so this is not some kind of a an abstract concept it's very clear that if Mr McCarthy were to somehow become speaker of the house he would put the 15-week abortion ban on the floor and it would likely pass if it had a majority of Republicans supporting it which it currently does here's my question which is this Nationwide abortion ban 15-week Nationwide abortion Bank Dr Kumar a 2021 study predicted a 21 increase in pregnancy related deaths if a abortion ban were imposed with black women facing a predicted increase of 33 percent can you explain to us why there would be an increase in pregnancy related deaths as well as more black women a 33 percent increase in black women dying as well sure thank you for that question um what I would point to First is a recent CDC report that low temperature maternal mortality in our country and actually found that four out of five of those deaths are preventable some of the top conditions that they talked about were mental health conditions such as suicidality or depression excessive bleeding referred to as Hemorrhage cardiac conditions which are highest among black women and also hypertension related conditions all of these things are preventable when we look at today's landscape of abortion access when we talk about a 15-week ban we can look at Florida for example what's happening today with a natural disaster hurricane Union as that state has a 15-week ban and we think about what's happening to families what's happening to their homes folks that may be 13 weeks pregnant or even 10 weeks pregnant as they deal with the things that they're having to deal with in their life they're being pushed further and further into pregnancy when we look at the landscape around accessing abortion and The Limited number of clinics that are still available in Haven States and how long people are waiting sometimes several weeks that's also pushing them further into pregnancy so these impacts are always felt disproportionately by people of color especially low income folks and also black folks and that's what we'll continue to see but it will only worsen from here so basically what I'm hearing you say is that if you have this 15-week abortion ban and you have all these people who already are lacking maternal health care and of course access to reproductive health care that they were they're likely going to go past that 15-week Mark and then they get pushed into pregnancy whether whether or not they like it now tell me walk us through why that relates results in death yep that's a great question and I think we can look to the turn away study where what we find and the turnaway study looked at folks that were able to access an abortion and compare them to folks that weren't able to access that abortion which is exactly what you're looking at and these folks had less access to prenatal care we found that they had worse outcomes including things like eclampsia and in the study also two women died in the group that were denied access to abortion we also saw worse outcomes for the children that they were forced to have as well as the children that they had at home so these impacts are faced by the people that are denied abortion care that are not able to get the care as well as the children that they're being forced to have and it causes generational harm tell us about the children that are born in those situations tell us about their health as they kind of emerge into the world yep um so again from this study they showed that the folks that were denied abortion access had lower birth weight uh children and that there was poor maternal bonding and it's understandable as people are making decisions about their pregnancies and what to do in their lives know that they can't be pregnant and when they're denied that care it's difficult for them to come up Suddenly with a means to stay pregnant to parent children appropriately and have the resources the other thing I'll mention is that states that are most restrictive with abortion access also tend to be the states that lack appropriate maternal care Dr Verma I want to ask you a question um sometimes my colleagues like to create this exception for life of the mother not health of the mother and you've probably heard of this particular exception I guess tell us a little bit about what that practically means for a physician who is then forced to decide whether the life of the mother is in Jeopardy as opposed to trying to save the person's health and whether this person escalates to a point where their their life becomes endangered and they die your time has expired but she may answer the question when we can actually intervene and take care of the person in front of us how sick is sick enough how much bleeding is too much bleeding and it's completely counter-intuitive to us and our training as doctors to have to wait for someone to get sicker before we can actually take care of them I do just want to point out as a doctor we we practice in these really complex environments medicine people's lives Health are complex and we do a disservice to our patients by trying to put things into neat little boxes or narrow definitions as we've heard politicians try to do today that's just not how medicine your time has expired

going beyond roads and bridges democrats weighing a 6 trillion with a t infrastructure plan that could also fund medicare expansion and immigration reform here with her take south carolina congresswoman nancy mates good to see you this morning thank you for being here good morning and thanks for having me on again of course okay so let's go ahead and pull up here what they are considering in this six trillion dollar spending package as you see that includes expanding medicare eligibility legal status to some illegal immigrants lowering the cost of prescription drugs addressing climate change threat addressing the housing crisis again it goes back to the argument of what are they considering is infrastructure do you see this going anywhere i don't well in the house it'll go somewhere we spent all hours of the night debating it and democrats wouldn't let republicans pass any non-partisan and bipartisan infrastructure amendments but when people are sitting their cars to go to work or they're taking their kids to school they're not thinking about art sculptures landscaping or high-speed rail in nancy pelosi's backyard when they think of infrastructure and that's the problem here and and the democrats have had to rename this package multiple times over to try to sell it to the american people i don't care if you're a republican or a democrat you don't want the government to waste your money in this way speaking of money when asked about the cost bernie sanders said don't overthink it please overthink it first congresswoman what will this do to our future if somehow this gets passed all six trillion of it well the way we're going with inflation right now we're going to see the worst inflation that we've seen since world war ii and inflation is taxation we've already seen groceries go up over 21 gas prices are up for me i know almost a dollar a gallon since the first of the year lumber we know is up 381 percent making the cost of all houses within the last year go up by 30 percent and so as this starts to hurt the american people in their wallets it's going to be troublesome for the administration and especially for democrats in the house when they try to get reelected in two years all right let's talk about this now the house voted to repeal the 2002 authorization for the use of military force in iraq this is almost two decades by the way after the resolution was first passed by congress there were 49 republicans you were one of them to vote yes on this uh tell me why you decided to vote on this and also why you think that there's a difference in the amount of republicans because only 10 had supported it during last year's house vote well it's really time it's been two decades since the 2002 aumf i come from a family of veterans and soldiers and support our military and so it's not really about that it's really more about giving congress the power to go to war and that's explicitly stated in article one of the constitution and congress has lost sight of that over the last two decades and we've seen the 2002 aumf be abused by republican and democrat presidents alike so this is a non-partisan issue if we're going to go to war then congress ought to have a say we ought to give the parents of kids who are going to war they ought to have a say through the representatives it's not only a bipartisan issue it is a very very difficult issue that does create some strange bedfellows but is a very personal decision as well quickly in the 15 seconds we have remaining are you worried that this will hurt american readiness in the region i don't i think we have the opportunity to strengthen american readiness if we can put and devote some resources additional resources to training our troops before they go overseas we saw general ming and china threaten the united states and japan earlier this week we've got to be ready for any conflict that comes our way or elsewhere in the world okay congresswoman nancy mays thank you for getting up early with us appreciate it have a good day

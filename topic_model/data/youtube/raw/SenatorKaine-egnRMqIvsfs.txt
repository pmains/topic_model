question you about counter countering violent extremism here in this country so we've already had a Virginian convicted high school kid convicted in federal court for trying to encourage people and facility take people going to be foreign fighters in Syria we've had other people arrested at the richmond airport on their way you know circuitous leta Syria what are some strategies that we ought to use as we look to the success of cve activities around the world or even anti-gang strategies here in this country what are some strategies we should be focusing on to be effective on CVE activities here at home I can start and pass it on to my colleagues here in you know this the strategy in dr. Leavitt mentioned this that for the first time we now have a dedicated office this is bureaucratic answer in part but an important one which is at an office in the Department of Homeland Security co-led by DHS and the Department of Justice with staffed by the FBI and the National Counterterrorism Center for the first time an interagency group that's formalized devoted to this question so that's a that's an important step certainly not you know not the fulfillment of the program but in terms of strategies it is to as others have said it is to empower others to understand the message that Isis and other groups put out that al-qaeda puts out to understand that message and to give those groups the capacity to withstand that message so it's it's training it's building trust with in Muslim American communities as I talked about so that they feel comfortable coming forward the law enforcement the reality is that that Muslim American communities families are and neighborhoods are on the front lines of this effort and they are going to be the first individuals to see the signs of a friend or a neighbor or a loved one becoming radicalized and they're gonna be in the first person first position to be able to take steps to stop it so that's to me that's a critical part of the strategy

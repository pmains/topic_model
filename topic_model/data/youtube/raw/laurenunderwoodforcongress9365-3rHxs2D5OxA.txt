[Music] i'm john bartman i live in moringo and i raise grain as well as vegetables i'm chris mckee i live in woodstock illinois we raise grain hay swine and beef my name is bruce meyer my farm is up in hebron illinois i grow corn soybeans winter wheat we raise some processing sweet corn and also peas i'm dan ziller i'm a dairy and grain farmer here in huntley illinois well good morning good morning thanks for having me well thanks for coming out to visit us so how are things going i want to thank you for your support on trade issues because 90 of what we grow is export our prices are that we're receiving for our grain is around ten dollars for soybeans and we're about 390 for corn okay right now okay and our break evens are still somewhat below that but we're hopeful that in the future it will be better yeah and can you tell us about you know what's been going on with covet and how you know it's impacted your business and your operations what have you seen personally i think we're taking you know more precautions you know not taking as many meetings with seed dealers and wearing the masks and everything else well i'm i'm a dairy farmer along with a drain farmer and we also raised some beef too and dairy in my opinion was in fact the worst because you can't tell a cow to stop producing right right and we just we learned a lot about our supply mechanisms in the in the dairy industry what needs improvement and we're struggling to come back from what we lost there but it's gradually happening if you had to identify any remaining needs what would you say we'd rather be making our living off of our markets like then we what receiving money from the government i do think it's important for the people who are watching this to know that these payments are literally a few cents a bushel for what we're receiving you know it's not like any of us are getting rich off of these payments these are basically enough to pay our interest on our operating loans is what they end up paying yeah we raise vegetables but we also have plenty of friends who raise beef and lamb and pork and those local small processors are very very important yes and we need to have more of them yeah bring that up that's something that clove had really showed us i think that the farm to table movement is pretty big in though with millennials especially and we don't have the ability to get it there no it's really fragile a really really really fragile supply chain and i know right now right because if i wanted to buy a steer from you would be the 2022 wow now everybody kind of has this working knowledge of like who are critical essential workers in their community and what do they do to me write the work that you all do your businesses your farms i mean that is crucial not only to our region's economy but like to our country we need you all to stay in business we need your businesses to be robust and growing and thriving people actually learn through this that that their food really doesn't come from the store it comes from a farm it does come from a farm [Music] [Music]

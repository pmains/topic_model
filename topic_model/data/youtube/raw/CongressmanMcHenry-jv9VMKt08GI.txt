THE SENATE WE'RE OPT MYTHSIC. WE'RE HOPEFUL. THIS I THINK -- THIS IS ONE I  KEPT TRYING TO GET THEM TO SAY DISTRUST OF THE SENATE GROWS WITHIN THE GOP, AND WHAT THEY'RE BASICALLY SAYING IS THEY'RE -- IN THE HOUSE THERE'S A REAL  CONCERN THAT SOME OF THESE SENATORS ARE ACTING ON THEIR OWN BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT UP FOR RE-ELECTION IN IT 2018 THE ONES THAT ARE CUT AND  RUNNING BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT  SOME -- LISTEN TO THIS CLOSE TO THE HOUSE GOP SAID  THEY'RE FRUSTRATED WITH A  HANDFUL OF SENATORS OVERRULING THE WILL OF THE ENTIRE HOUSE,  AND THEY HAVE A PICTURE HERE IT'S McCAIN TALKING TO SUSAN COLLINS. THAT'S A REAL CONCERN, IS IT NOT? >> IT'S NOT NEW. >> I KNOW. NOTHING HAS GOTTEN DONE, AND WHY DO WE THINK THIS WILL BE ANY DIFFERENT THIS TIME? >> THE RUNNING JOKE IN WASHINGTON IS THAT THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE HAVE ONE THING IN COMMON WE'VE GOT ABOUT 98 USELESS MEMBERS. BUT IT'S NOT NEW THIS IS TRADITIONAL. THE SENATE'S PROCESS IS SO JACKED UP. >> YOU ARE TRYING TO SUCK UP TO  THE SENATE NOW BY SAYING THAT'S -- THAT WAS A NICE  COMMENT. >> THAT'S NOT GOING TO ENDEAR  THEM THEY'RE GOING TO SAY McHENRY WAS JUST ON. >> IT'S FINE IT'S FINE. LOOK, THE DEAL IS THEIR MARGINS  ARE SO TIGHT OVER THERE. McCAIN SOUTH TAKES HIM IN AND  OUT OF BEING THERE YOU'RE WORKING WITH 52 ON A GOOD DAY. REPUBLICANS. YOU DON'T HAVE MODERATE  DEMOCRATS LIKE YOU DID AT THE  BEGINNING OF THE BUSH  ADMINISTRATION OUR TRACK RECORD ON THIS IS NOT  RECENT WE JUST WENT THROUGH THREE TWO-TERM PRESIDENTS. THE LAST TIME THAT HAPPENED WAS  JEFFERSON, MADISON, MONROE WE HAVE THREE TWO-TERM PRESIDENTS YOU CAN CHECK. YOU'RE GOOGLING NOW. >> I'M READING THIS ARTICLE. THE WORST CHAFRM OF IF THIS WAS  2001 WITH THE BUSH TAX CUTS. THE SENATE IS ALWAYS REALLY P PROCUREUS AND GENERAL. THEY CAN'T GET 50 TO DO STUFF. >> THAT'S THE PROBLEM. >> YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO RIGHT REPUBLICANS GOT A REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT. YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO WRITE  BILLS THAT GET PASSED BECAUSE  YOU HAVE THE MAJORITY IN THE SENATE, AND YOU GOT THE MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE YOU MAY NOT ALWAYS HAVE THAT >> THE HOUSE HAS NOT BEEN EASY TO PASS LEGISLATION. >> THEY DID IT, THOUGH THEY FINALLY DID IT. >> LOOK, WE DON'T GET STYLE  POINTS FOR HEALTH CARE WE DON'T BECAUSE WE FELL ON OUR FACES PUBLICLY WE DID GET IT DONE WE DID GET HEALTH CARE DONE, AND THAT WAS IN JUNE LOOK, WE DID OUR JOB IN THE  HOUSE. WE ACTUALLY HAVE A GREAT PRODUCTION OUT OF THE HOUSE. MORE THAN THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE OF BILLS THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED TO THE SENATE, AND ACTUALLY SO FAR TO DATE THIS PRESIDENT SIGNED MORE BILLS INTO LAW THAN  OBAMA DID. >> I CAN UNDERSTAND YOUR POINT MY GUESS WOULD BE THAT IN THE  HOUSE, YOU ARE MUCH SAFER IN YOUR DISTRICT. THE DISTRICTS TEND TO BE EITHER  VERY RIGHT OR VERY LEFT. THEY'VE BEEN DRAWN THAT WAY. IN THE SENATE YOU ARE  RESPONSIBLE FOR AN ENTIRE STATE. IT'S HARDER TO GO TO ONE EXTREME OR THE OTHER THE ARGUMENT MIGHT BE THAT THE PARTIES HAVE GOTTEN MORE EXTREME, AND IT'S HARDER TO FIND MIDDLE GROUND, WHEREAS THE SNATD IS KIND OF SET UP TO FIND MIDDLE GROUND >> THAT WOULD BE ME AS A PUBLIC  POLICY MAKER AND GETTING AN  EXCUSE RIGHT? THINGS ARE HARD. >> YOU WANTED -- YOU JUST WANT A SIMPLE MAJORITY. >> IF I WANTED TO ACCUATE MY OPINION, I WOULD RUN FOR SENATE. I'M NOT RUNNING FOR SENATE I HAVE ENOUGH TO DEAL WITH BEFORE I RUN FOR THE SENATE. LET ME GET BACK TO THIS.

WHAT WAS THE ISSUE STATE AND LOCAL TAXES. WHY? IT'S A WHALE OF A DEDUCTION. IT'S $1.2 TRILLION IT IS EQUIVALENT TO THE BORDER ADJUSTMENT TAX IN TERMS OF REVENUE. >> PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT'S  GOING TO LOOK GOODS AGAIN. >> IT'S ALL TRACES WHAT PEOPLE ARE JUDGING AND, YOU KNOW, I HEARD ED RENDELL ON THIS INTERVIEW, WHICH LET ME JUST TELL YOU, ED IS READING FROM THE 1986 TAX REFORM TALKING POINTS THAT HE DUSTED OFF OR THE 2001 TAX CUT DISCUSSION HE JUST DUSTED THEM OFF. IT'S NOT NEW IT'S REALLY NOT NEW. ACTUALLY, 86 -- THE SAME ISSUES  WE'RE WRESTLING WITH ARE THE SAME ISSUES. >> WHAT DO YOU THINK SHOULD  HAPPEN >> ON TAX REFORM, STATE AND  LOCAL? >> ON THE STATE AND LOCAL. >> STATE AND LOCAL LET'S LOOK AT THE MODELLING. ARE YOU BETTER OFF OR WORSE OFF  UNDER OUR PLAN THAT'S THE NET EFFECT. IT'S NOT A DEDUCTION THAT  MATTERS TO YOU IT'S THE NET EFFECT OF WHAT  WE'RE DOING. >> WE DON'T KNOW YET BECAUSE WE  DON'T HAVE ENOUGH DETAILS. LITERALLY, WE'VE ALL BEEN  SITTING AROUND >> EVERYBODY IS ASSUMING BECAUSE OF THE -- AS I'M DOING IT IN MY  HEAD STILL SAYS YOU'RE HEAD. I HAVEN'T DONE IT IN DETAIL YET, BUT MAYBE WE SHOULD ASK THE  WOMAN WHEN SHE WAS HERE EARLIER. >> SOME OF THE MATH THAT'S BEEN  PUT OUT THERE THUS FAR SUGGESTS  THAT IF YOU WERE IN NEW YORK,  MIDDLE CLASS FAMILY IN NEW YORK, YOU'RE DOING WORSE, NOT DOING  ANY BETTER >> RIGHT AND THAT IS WITHOUT LOOKING AT THE DETAILS OF THE PLAN.

THEY DON'T HAVE TO >> THEY'RE NOT UP ENDING THAT  ENTIRE --  >> WE KEEP MORTGAGE INTEREST DEDUCTION AND WE KEEP  CHARITABLE, AND WE DO AWAY WITH  STATE AND LOCAL JUST TO BE CLEAR. >> PEOPLE ARGUE IT IS THE GREAT  GIVE-AWAY TO THE WEALTHY IN THIS INSTANCE BECAUSE 8% OF SMALL BUSINESSES ARE MAKING $100,000 SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS MAKING $100,000 OR LESS THEY'RE ALREADY AT 20%, 25%. IT'S THE TOP 2 3ERZ THAT BECOMES THE BISHOP IS BENEFICIARY. ISN'T THERE A WAY TO EITHER  CREATE SORT OF BLOCKS SO THAT  THERE'S SORT OF CAPS ON THAT >> YES >> AND THE WAY WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS AND THE DETAILS OF THE  PASS-THROUGH RATE, THAT IS WHERE YOU'LL ACTUALLY SEE THE REAL MODELLING, WHICH MEANS AN  INDIVIDUAL HAS TO TAKE A CERTAIN AMOUNT AS INCOME AND THE REST  CAN BE THE PASS-THROUGH INCOME >> THE BIG TALKING POINT THAT WE KEEP HEARING WHEN PEOPLE ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT IT, YOU THINK, IS UNFAIR AND WILL GO AWAY ONCE  YOU HAVE --  >> IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS WE CAN JUDGE IT, AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY JUDGE 20% CORPORATE VERSUS 25% PASS-THROUGH AND SEE WHY THAT  MODELLING DOES MAKE SENSE. >> IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN? >> IT IS IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN --  >> THIS YEAR >> THIS YEAR, AND IF I HAD TO  PICK A DATE, DECEMBER 24th >> THE REPUBLICANS IN NEW YORK AND CALIFORNIA AND CONNECTICUT AND NEW JERSEY WILL VOTE WITH  YOU? >> YES, ONCE YOU SEE THE MODELLING, YOU SEE REAL FAMILIES WILL HAVE REAL BENEFIT, AND  THEY'LL HAVE NET BETTER OFF. >> CONGRESSMAN, THANK YOU. >> PATRICK McHENRY >> I JUST LIKE SAYING THAT YOU KNOW GIVE ME TAX REFORM, OR GIVE ME DEATH. >> PRESIDENT TRUMP TOLD ME HE  WOULD HAVE GOTTEN ELECTED EIGHT  YEARS BEFORE IF HE HAD MY NAME IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A SLAM  BECAUSE I'M JUST IN THE HOUSE. >> EXACTLY FOR NOW. >> WHEN WE COME BACK, TRAINING SELLS TO FIGHT CANCER.

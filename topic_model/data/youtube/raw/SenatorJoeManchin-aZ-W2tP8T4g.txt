THE PRESIDING OFFICER: THE SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA. MR. MANCHIN: THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. MR. PRESIDENT, I RISE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT HOW THE CURRENT PROCESS THAT WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW WITH THE ENERGY CHALLENGES WE HAVE, NOT JUST IN OUR COUNTRY BUT AROUND THE WORLD AND HOW PERMITTING -- THE PERMITTING PROCESS THAT WE'RE WORKING ON, HOW THAT CAN HELP RELIEVE THE CHALLENGES THAT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC HAVE RIGHT NOW WITH HIGH PRICES AT THE GAS PUMP, HIGH PRICES AT HOME FOR HEATING AND ALL THE NECESSITIES THEY HAVE. WHAT'S AT RISK RIGHT NOW AND I WANT PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S AT RISK IS THE ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND ENERGY SECURITY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. IF WE'RE GOING TO REMAIN THE SUPERPOWER OF THE WORLD, IF WE ARE THE ONE COUNTRY THAT HAS IT ALL, YOU BETTER HAVE ENERGY INDEPENDENCE. IF YOU CAN'T PRODUCE YOUR OWN ENERGY AND ASK OTHER COUNTRIES TO DO WHAT YOU WON'T AND YOU HAVE THE ABILITY AND RESOURCES TO DO IT, GOD HELP US ALL. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH. I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW CONGRESS CAN PROVIDE SOME RELIEF HERE. THE 2022 ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND SECURITY ACT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON, IT'S GOING TO BE PARAMOUNT TO MAINTAINING WHAT WE HAVE. THAT MEANS WE HAVE TO QUIT BLAMING EACH OTHER. THIS HAS BECOME A PERSONAL THING BACK AND FORTH, BACK AND FORTH. SOME OF THE EXTREME LEFT LIBERALS DON'T LIKE IT AND WE HAVE SOME PEOPLE IN THE CAUCUS OVER HERE, MY REPUBLICAN FRIENDS WHO HAVE ALWAYS BEEN FOR IT BUT NOW THE LEADERSHIP HAS MADE IT PERSONAL TO BE AGAINST IT. LET ME TELL YOU WHO SUFFERS, IT'S THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, ALL THE AMERICAN CITIZENS WILL SUFFER IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING. WE'RE ALL CITIZENS OF THIS GREAT COUNTRY AND WE'RE ALL SO GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITIES WE HAVE LIVING HERE AND WE HAVE AN ABUNDANT AMOUNT OF ENERGY THAT WE CAN PRODUCE CLEANER THAN ANYONE ELSE. CARBONIZATION, WE SHOULD HELP TO DECARBONIZATION AND THA IS EXPEED IN A DEVELOPED NATION. DECARBONIZING MEANS TWO THINGS. SOME PEOPLE WANT TO CARBONIZE -- DECARBONIZE BY ANYTHING THAT HAS FOSSIL. OUR EUROPEAN FRIENDS TRIED THAT. LOOK WHERE THEY ARE. THERE ARE THOSE WHO SAY WE CAN DECARBONIZE BY PRODUCING MORE OIL IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND DISBURSING THE DIRTY FOSSILS AROUND THE WORLD. WHEN YOU HAVE OIL AND GAS COMING FROM VENEZUELA, WHICH IS PRODUCED WITH NO OVERSIGHT WHATSOEVER, DIRTIER THAN ANY PLACE IN THE WORLD, WE WERE GOING TO THEM FOR SANCTIONS TO HELP US, WE'RE GOING TO ASK IRAN, WHO IS A PROLIFERATING TERRORIST, IT MAKES NO SENSE. WHEN WE ASKED SAUDI ARABIA, NO SUPPORT, MAKES NO SENSE AT ALL. THIS IS WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. I HAVE BESIDE ME HERE THAT KIND OF SPELLS OUT WHAT WE'RE CONFRONTING. HERE'S THE COMMON PERMITTING TIME LINES FOR ENERGY AND MINLS PROJECTS -- MINERALS PROJECTS. THE UNITED STATES, A MINIMUM OF FIVE-TO-TEN YEARS. CANADA, ONE TO THREE YEARS. AUSTRALIA, ONE TO THREE YEARS. THEY HAVEN'T DELETED ANY OF THEIR OVERSIGHT FOR REVIEW. THEY HAVEN'T DELETED ANY OF THAT. LET ME TELL YOU THE EXTREMISTS GOING ON IN THE WORLD TODAY. THE EUROPEAN UNION WHICH HAS HAD PRETTY STRINGENT OVERSIGHT ON ENVIRONMENT, THEY ARE CONSIDERING EMERGENCY BYPASSING ALL ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS BECAUSE IT'S CRITICAL TO THEM. ENERGY HAS BEEN WEAPONIZED BY PUTIN. WE IN AMERICA CAN OFFSET THAT. WE CAN. NO MATTER WHAT YOU WANT TO BUILD, WHETHER TRANSMISSION, PIPELINES, HYDROPOWER DAMS, MORE OFTEN THAN NOT IT TAKES TOO LONG, DRIVES UP COSTS. YOU CAN DOUBLE YOUR COSTS WITHIN A FIVE, SIX, SEVEN-YEAR PERIOD. DOUBLE FROM THE ORIGINAL COST, AND PROJECTED COSTS. TODAY'S ENERGY AND MINERAL PROJECTS TAKE TOO LONG. THEN YOU COME OVER HERE. LOOK BASICALLY WHAT THE UPS CITIZENS, ALL THE CONSTITUENTS, 330 MILLION PEOPLE ARE SUBJECTED TO. NATURAL GAS, UP 200%. THE COST OF NATURAL GAS, 200%. THE COST OF NATURAL GAS IN EUROPE, 1,100% INCREASE. PREDICTED BY NEXT YEAR SOME UTILITY, HOMES WILL BE PAYING $7,000 A MONTH. THEY'LL BE SUBSIDIZED BY THE. THEY CAN'T DO THAT FOREVER. CAN YOU IMAGINE THOSE TYPE OF OUTRHAMOUS COSTS -- OUTRAGEOUS COSTS? GASOLINE, UP 67%, UNDER BOTH THIS ADMINISTRATION, PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION. 67%. ELECTRICITY IS UP 15% AND CLIMBING. CLIMBING. WHEN YOU HAVE COUNTRIES, SUCH AS AUSTRALIA AND CANADA, DOING IT AND DOING IT IN A CLEAN FASHION, BUT ALSO DOING ACCELERATED FASHION, THAT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT. THAT'S HOW. WE'VE TALKED ABOUT PERMITTING FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS. IF YOU'RE ON THE RENEWABLE SIDE AND YOU WANT ALL RENEWABLE, NO FOSSIL WHATSOEVER, YOU CAN'T GET A TRANSMISSION LINE BUILT. IF YOU'RE GOING TO BUILD A WIND FARM OR SOLAR FARM IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DESERT WHERE THERE'S NO PEOPLE, YOU GOT TO TAKE THAT ELECT RONES, ELECTRICITY BACK INTO THE MARKETPLACE, YOU GOT TO CROSS A MULTITUDE OF STATE LINES. YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE PERMITTING REFORM TO GET IT DONE. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER THE ENERGY THAT PEOPLE NEED. LOOK AT OUR FRIENDS IN, WHETHER IT BE IN CALIFORNIA, LOOK WHAT'S HAPPENED IN TEXAS. ALL OF THIS. THIS VERY, VERY FRAGILE WHAT'S GOING ON. THE GOOD NEWS IS NEXT WEEK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HELP ACCELERATE THESE ENERGY PROJECTS CLEAR ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND THE NEEDS WE ALL HAVE, IF WE DON'T LET POLITICS GET IN THE WAY. IF WE BASICALLY LOOK AT WHAT THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA NEEDS, WHAT THE PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY NEED, AND WHAT THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE ENERGY INDEPENDENCE TO DO IT OURSELF AND NOT RELY ON FOREIGN SUPPLY CHAINS. THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. I'VE ALWAYS SAID, IF I CAN GO HOME AND EXPLAIN IT, IF I CAN TALK TO ALL OF YOU AND EXPLAIN IT, I CAN VOTE FOR IT. I CAN EXPLAIN WHAT WE'RE DOING. I TRULY CAN. IT WHETHER IT BE FROM THE IRA, A BILL THAT BASICALLY GIVES US A PATHWAY TO WALK AND CHEW GUM, PROVIDE THE ENERGY WE NEED TODAY, BUT ALSO INVEST IN THE ENERGY WE NEED IN THE FUTURE. WE'RE DOING BOTH, BUT YOU CAN'T DO THEM UNLESS YOU HAVE PERMITTING REFORM. EVERYONE THINKS THIS IS A SIDE DEAL. THERE IS NO SIDE DEAL. WE PUT THIS PROJECT TOGETHER UNDER ONE US A PISS OF ENERGY INDEPENDENCE -- UNDER ONE AUSPICE OF ENERGY INDEPENDENCE. ALSO, THE SUPPORT WE NEED FOR ALLIES IN EUROPE, WHO ARE HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME. IT LET ME EXPLAIN WHY VOTING FOR ENERGY PERMITTING REFORM IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD MAKE SENSE TO EACH AND EVERY ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES ON BOTH MY REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRAT SIDE. PUT PLAINLY, WITH THE SAME STATE OF ENERGY PRICES OUR CONSTITUENTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY, THEY CAN'T AFFORD FOR THE POLITICS TO STAND IN THE WAY OF A LONG OVERDUE, BIPARTISAN ACTION ON ENERGY PERMITTING REFORM. DOMESTICALLY, AMERICAN FAMILIES AND BUSINESSES ARE FEELING THE PAIN. THIS IS PUTIN'S ENERGY WAR. I WON'T ACKNOWLEDGE THIS IS A RUSSIAN WAR. THIS IS ONE DEMAGOGUE WHO BASICALLY HAS BROUGHT THE HAVOC AND UNREST WE HAVE IN THE WORLD TODAY, ONE MAN, PUTIN, AND HE HAS BASICALLY WEAPONIZED ENERGY LIKE WE'VE NEVER SEEN AND NEVER THOUGHT WOULD BE DONE. THIS MUST BE ANSWERED. WE HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND WE HAVE THE RESOURCES. I'VE SAID THAT BEFORE. AMERICAN NATURAL GAS PRICES AVERAGE AROUND $9 MILLION PER MILLION OF BTU. $9 PER MILLION. THE SAME PRICE, MOST OF THIS ENERGY COMES FROM MY STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA, A LOT OF THE GAS, BECAUSE WE HAVE THE SHELL, WHICH IS THE RICHEST DEPOSITS OF NATURAL GAS WE'VE EVER SEEN IN THIS COUNTRY, LET ALONE IN THE WORLD. BUT WITH THAT, THOSE PRICES WERE IN THE $2.50, $3 RANGE. THAT BALANCES OUT PRETTY WELL AT $5. AT $9 IT DOES NOT. BUT THAT'S NOT -- LOOK WHAT THE EUROPEANS ARE PAYING. THE EUROPEANS ARE PAYING ASTRONOMICAL, $60 AND $70 EQUIPMENT TO THE SAME MCF. THAT VERSUS OUR $9, WHICH WE THINK IS OUTRAGEOUS. THIS IS THE CRUNCH WE'RE IN. EVEN THE COST SAVINGS WE HAVE ACHIEVED BY ENERGY EFFICIENCY, ELECTRICITY, HOME ENERGY ARE UP. EVERYBODY IS WATCHING THINGS TAKING A HECK OF A HIT RIGHT NOW. THE CHANGING ENERGY MIX DOES NOT YIELD AFFORDABILITY FOR AMERICAN FAMILIES EVENLY. IN PART BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO KNIT TOGETHER THE WIDESPREAD RESOURCES OF TRANSMISSION AND DELIVERY OF THIS ENERGY. YOU CAN ONLY DO THAT BY BUILDING MORE INFRASTRUCTURE. YOU CAN'T DO IT BY HOPING ONE SKIPS OVER ANOTHER TO GET YOU WHAT YOU NEED. YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE INFRASTRUCTURE. WHETHER IT'S TRANSMISSION OR PIPELINES, TO GET YOU THE ENERGY YOU NEED. THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX TELLS THE STORY. CONSUMERS PAID 16% MORE FOR ELECTRICITY SERVICE AND 33% MORE FOR GAS SERVICES, AND IT'S ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE, NOT BETTER. ABSOLUTELY. I'M GRATEFUL WE'VE MADE PROGRESS ADDRESSING PRICES AT THE PUMP. A GALLON OF GASOLINE REMAINS 67% HIGHER THAN FIVE YEARS AGO. THESE ARE THE TYPE OF POCKETBOOK ISSUES, THEY TRULY ARE, IMPACTING DAY-TO-DAY DECISIONS AMERICANS MAKE. PEOPLE ARE MAKING DECISIONS NOW ABOUT HOW THEY'RE GOING TO GET FROM ONE DAY TO THE NEXT, ONE MONTH BE TO THE NEXT, WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT YEAR. THEY'RE MAKING THOSE DECISIONS. THEY'RE MAKING IT WHEN THE GAS PRICES ARE STILL TOO HIGH, WHEN THE ENERGY PRICES ARE ABSOLUTELY TOO HIGH, AND THE UNREST FROM SUPPLY CHAINS MAKING IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO DO THE THINGS OR HAVE THE THINGS YOU NEED OR THAT YOU WANT. FOR MY COLLEAGUES ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE PROPOSE A VARIETY OF SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS THE RISING COSTS OF ENERGY FOR AMERICAN CONSUMERS, WHETHER THROUGH MORE OIL, GAS, OR SWITCH TO ELECTRIC VEHICLES. LET ME ASK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. , WHERE DO THEY THINK THE ELECTRICITY COMES FROM IF THEY BUY AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE? IT'S GOT TO BE PRODUCED. YOU'VE GOT CALIFORNIA SAYING THEY WANT ALL ELECTRICITY VEHICLES BY A CERTAIN DATE. YET, THEY'RE TELLING PEOPLE YOU CAN'T CHARGE YOUR CAR CERTAIN TIMES OF THE DAY. SOMETHING DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. WE HAVE TO BE REALISTIC, BE PRACTICAL ABOUT THIS, PRAGMATIC. ALL THOSE THINGS ARE GOING TO TAKE FEDERAL PERMITS FOR US TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE THE ENERGY THEY NEED. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FACE THIS SOONER OR LATER. IT'S ONLY POSSIBLE IF YOU CAN BUILD IT. IF YOU CAN BUILD IT, THEN YOU CAN MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE CHANGES THAT THE CONSUMERS ARE GOING TO DEMAND IN AMERICA, IF WE CAN MAKE OF THOSE, THEN FINE, WE CAN SUPPLY IT. IF WE CAN'T, I GUARANTEE YOU THE CHAOS WILL BE UNBELIEVABLE FOR ALL OF US WHO REPRESENT THESE GREAT PEOPLE. OUR PRODUCER ARE HANDCUFFED BY AN ARDUOUS PERMITTING PROCESS THAT DOESN'T ALLOW TO MIGHT THE SUPPLY PROBLEMS THAT WE'RE FACING, AND IT'S NOT GETTING ANY BETTER. LET ME KIND OF THROW THE POLITICAL PROCESS THAT WE HAVE OUT. MY REPUBLICAN FRIENDS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE, ALWAYS, AND I HAVE A LOT OF MY DEMOCRAT FRIENDS THAT UNDERSTAND WE NEED PERMITTING REFORM. BUT WE'VE NEVER GOTTEN IT DONE, WHETHER ALL DEMOCRATS IN CHARGE, WHETHER THE PRESIDENT BEING A DEMOCRAT, HOUSE AND SENATE DEMOCRAT CONTROLLED, OR FOUR YEARS AGO YOU HAD THE REPUBLICANS WHO BASICALLY HAD A PRESIDENT WHO WAS REPUBLICAN, AND SENATE AND HOUSE. THEY COULDN'T GET IT DONE. YOU CAN ONLY GET IT DONE IF YOU WORK TOGETHER. WE CAN ONLY GET THIS DONE IF OUR REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES, AND OUR DEMOCRAT COLLEAGUES, WORK TOGETHER. IT WON'T HAPPEN. IF WE DON'T DO IT NOW, IN MY LIFETIME AND A LOT OF MY COLLEAGUES' LIFE TIME, -- LIFETIME, IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. IT'S NOT. IF WE CONTINUE TO STRAP THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WITH THE HIGHEST COST OF DELIVERY OF PRODUCTS THEY NEED BECAUSE OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE COST OF INFRASTRUCTURE, WE DOUBLE AND TRIPLE THE PRICE BECAUSE OF THE ONEROUS POSITION TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS OF PERMITTING, AND THEY KNOW THAT GOING UP FRONT, THAT COST IS PASSEDN OF THE THEY DON'T ABSORB THAT COST. IF A PIPELINE COSTS 3 BILLION, WHICH YOU ANTICIPATE TO DELIVER THE ENERGY YOU HAVE, WHETHER HYDROGEN OR NATURAL GAS, AND THAT COSTS YOU $6 BILLION OR $7 BILLION, YOU AND I PAY THAT PRICE. EVERY CONSTITUENT IN OUR STATES PAY THAT PRICE. WE'RE SUFFERING FROM SELF-INFLICTED SHORTAGES. WE'RE ANTICIPATING SHORTAGES RIGHT NOW. THE NEXT FIVE YEARS, BASICALLY OUR GAS SUPPLIES, GAS DEPOSITS ARE DOWN, NATURAL GAS. NATURAL GAS IS DOWN. WE CAN CHANGE THAT. WE CAN CHANGE THAT BECAUSE THE ENERGY WE HAVE UNDER OUR FEET RIGHT NOW, IF WE JUST GET IT TO THE MARKET, IT WILL NOT ONLY FULFILL THE SURPLUSES WE HAVE, IT WILL BASICALLY BE ABLE TO HELP OUR ALLIES ACROSS THE GLOBE THAT NEED IT MOST. BECAUSE THE WORST THING IN THE SCENARIO IS IF THE UKRAINE WAR AND THE PRESSURE THAT THAT WAR IS PUTTING ON ENERGY THAT GOES INTO EUROPE, AND THE EUROPEANS ARE FACING ABSOLUTELY ASTRONOMICAL HARDSHIPS, THOSE REFLECT WHERE THEY'RE PUTTING PRESSURE ON UKRAINE TO MAKE A DEAL WITH PUTIN, GOD HELP THE WORLD. GOD HELP US ALL IF PUTIN WALKS WAWAY AND SAYS WE HAVE A VICTOR. HE HAS A PROPAGANDA MACHINE THAT HE CAN SAY ANYTHING HE WANTS, NO MATTER THE DEVASTATING LOSSES HE HAS TAKEN WITH HIS TROOPS AND THE ECONOMIC CHALLENGES IN HIS COUNTRY, BUTHE UNBELIEVABLE CARNAGE AND PAIN HE'S PUT ON UKRAINE AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE FORCED, BECAUSE OF ENERGY, TO MAKE A DECISION, AND WE CAN HELP THAT AND PREVENT THAT FROM EVER HAPPENING. THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING. THAT'S BASICALLY THE CHALLENGE WE HAVE. YOU EITHER RISE TO THE CHALLENGE OR YOU DON'T. YOU EITHER PUT YOUR POLITICS ASIDE AND FORGET ABOUT YOUR PERSONAL VENDETTAS AND ARGUMENTS, WHATEVER. LOOK AT THE CONTENTS OF THE BILL. LOOK WHAT WE'LL HAVE IN FRONT OF US THAT YOU CAN VOTE ON AND MAKE A DIFFERENCE. I'VE OFTEN SAID IF YOU CAN GO HOME AND EXPLAIN IT, YOU CAN VOTE FOR IT. I TRULY BELIEVE THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION WILL DO THAT. WE'RE PUTTING PEOPLE TO MAKE HARD CHOICES THEY SHOULDN'T BE PUT IN THAT POSITION. I TELL AMERICANS EVERY DAY, DON'T LET WASHINGTON MAKE YOUR BELIEF YOU'RE DIVIDED. YOU'RE NOT DIVIDED. WE'RE DIVIDED HERE. WE ARE FORCING THE CONSTITUENTS OF OUR STATES TO PICK A SIDE. WHAT SIDE ARE YOU ON? THERE'S ONLY ONE SIDE. THAT'S THE AMERICAN SIDE. THERE'S NOT ANOTHER SIDE. WE HAVE REPUBLICAN FRIENDS AND DEMOCRAT FRIENDS, WE MIGHT HAVE DIFFERENT IDEAS, BUT WHEN THE COUNTRY IS CHALLENGED WE HAVE ONE PROBLEM TO SOLVE. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON NOW. CAN YOU ME WITH DIFFERENT IDEAS, GO THROUGH THE WHOLE PROCESS, BUT WE SHOULD COME TOGETHER. YOU SHOULDN'T SAY MY SIDE IS RIGHT, WE'RE AGAINST THAT, MY SIDE IS RIGHT BECAUSE WE'RE FOR IT. WELL, WE BOTH HAVE TO BE. THIS DOESN'T PASS, NOTHING MOVES ON PERMITTING UNLESS WE WORK TOGETHER. IF ALL THE DEMOCRATS VOTE FOR IT, IT'S NOT ENOUGH. IF ALL THE REPUBLICANS VOTED FOR IT, IT'S NOT ENOUGH. THE SENATE IS EU TBHEEK. IT TAKES 60 -- THE SENATE IS UNIQUE. IT TAKES 60. IT TAKES TEN OR MORE FROM ONE SIDE OF THE OTHER. OUR REPUBLICAN FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES HAVE TO LOOK DEEPLY AT SOMETHING THEY'VE ALWAYS WANTED AND HAVE A CHANCE TO GRAB. DON'T LET POLITICS COME BETWEEN US. I HOPE NOT. I DON'T THINK SO. I THINK THE RIGHT THING WILL BE DONE AT THE RIGHT TIME. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE POLITICAL PROCESS WE'RE IN IS HIGHLY CHARGED. I'M HOPING THE AMERICAN PUBLIC SAYS ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. COME ON. IT'S FOR THE COUNTRY, NOT FOR YOU. IT'S NOT TO MAKE YOUR PARTY STRONGER OR TO MAKE THE OTHER ONE LOOK BAD. IT'S NOT TO GIVE ONE AN ADVANTAGE OVER THE OTHER. THIS PROCESS IS A FIXED -- TO FIX THE PROBLEMS TO KEEP THIS ON EARTH, BASICALLY THECOUNTRY SUPERPOWER OF THE WORLD AND WE ONLY HAVE ONE WAY TO DO IT, TO DO EVERYTHING FOR OURSELVES. I GUARANTEE YOU, WHEN YOU'RE ABLE TO DO THAT, DRAW YOUR ALLIES CLOSER TO YOU. THE PEOPLE WANT TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE WINNER. THEY WANT TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH AN ECONOMY THAT YOU CAN'T STOP AND WITH THE QUALITY OF LIFE THAT IS NEXT TO NONE. THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH. THE AMERICAN DREAM CAN BE ALIVE, BUT ONLY IF WE DO EVERYTHING TO KEEP IT VIBRANT. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON. LESS THAN A YEAR AGO, CONGRESS, WE ACTED IN A BIPARTISAN WAY TO ACCELERATE PUBLIC WORKS PERMITTING THE INFRASTRUCTURE BILL. WE DID IT FOR INFRASTRUCTURE. WE FINALLY CAME TOGETHER AND SAID FOR THE LAST 30 YEARS, WE HAVE KNOWN THAT OUR ROADS AND BRIDGES AND PIPELINES AND INTERNET SERVICE, EVERYTHING NEEDED TO BE IMPROVED. WE VOTED IN A BIPARTISAN WAY. YOU KNOW WAS WE DID? WE CHANGED HOW WE DID THE PERMITTING TO GET THOSE TO FRUITION, TO BUILD A ROAD OR BRIDGE. YET WE CAN'T DO IT FOR ENERGY. DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME. WHY WE CAN'T DO IT FOR ENERGY, BUT WE WERE ABLE TO DO IT FOR INFRASTRUCTURE. IN THE COMING DAYS WE'LL HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE THE ACTION THAT WILL MOVE THE NEEDLE ON GETTING TYPES OF ENERGY AND CRITICAL MINERALS. TRY GETTING A PERMIT FOR A MINE, CRITICAL MINERALS. WE JUST PASSED A BILL, THE RAY BILL, THAT SAYS ON THE CAR MANUFACTURING, CAR MANUFACTURING WE WANT TO GET PEOPLE TRANSITIONED, ELECTRIC VEHICLES SHOULD BE DESIRABLE. IF YOU LIKE THE PRODUCT OR YOU DON'T. YOU'LL MAKE THOSE DECISIONS. THE ONLY WAY YOU GET A CREDIT IS IF THE MANUFACTURERS ARE SOURCING THE CRITICAL MINERALS FROM EITHER NORTH AMERICA OR FAVORED NATIONS, SUCH AS AUSTRALIA AND OUR EUROPEAN FRIENDS. NOT THOSE, AND RIGHT NOW ALL OF IT IS FROM CHINA, CHINA HAS A LOCK ON THIS. UNLESS WE GET OFF OUR BUTTS, START DOING WHAT WE SHOULD FOR OURSELVES SO WE DON'T HAVE TO BE CRIPPLED BY A SUPPLY CHAIN. I TOLD EVERYBODY, FIRST TIME IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, THINK ABOUT THIS GREAT COUNTRY, HENRY FORD, THE MASS PRODUCTION LINE, WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PRODUCE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, WITHOUT ANY FOREIGN SUPPLY CHAINS THAT WERE NEEDED, THE COMBUSTIBLE ENGINE, ALL THE DRIVE TRAINS AND EVERYTHING ELSE IT TOOK FOR TRANSPORTATION MODE. WE WERE ABLE TO DO THAT. WHETHER IT BE FOR PLANES, OR AUTOMOBILES. NOW THEY COME OUT AND SAY, WE'RE GOING TO DO ELECTRIC VEHICLES. WE CANNOT PRODUCE WHAT IS NEEDED FOR THAT TO BE A TRANSPORTATION MODE. AND I REFUSE TO GIVE UP AND SAY WE CAN'T DO IT. SO THAT'S WHY IN THE BILL THAT WE PASSED, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SOURCE THE CRITICAL MINERALS THAT'S NEEDED FOR THE BATTERIES THAT ARE GOING TO BE SUPPLYING THE POWER FOR THESE VEHICLES, AND IT'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE PRODUCED IN NORTH AMERICA. WE SHOULDN'T BE WAITING ON FOREIGN SUPPLY CHAINS. OH, I'M SORRY, WE DON'T AGREE WITH YOUR GEOPOLITICAL STANCE ON SO MANY THINGS SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO AGREE TO GIVE WHAT YOU NEED. WE PROCESSED THE ANODES AND CATHODES THAT MAKE THESE BATTERIES BUT THAT'S ON CHINA. THAT'S NOT US. WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET CAUGHT THIS IN A. THAT'S WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO CORRECT. IN THE COMING DAYS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY -- I SAY THAT AGAIN, TRULY AN OPPORTUNITY. WE CAN KEEP THE COSTS DOWN. WE CAN MAKE IT AFFORDABLE. WE CAN RELIEVE THE PAIN AT THE PUMP, WEEK RELIEVE THE PAIN WHEN YOU SUE YOUR ENERGY BILLS MAILED TO YOU EVERY MONTH. WE CAN FIGHT ALL THIS. AND WE CAN UNLOCK THE ENERGY AND CLIMATE BENEFITS OF THE ENERGY ACT OF 2020. THE BIPARTISAN INFRASTRUCTURE LAW AND THE INFLATION REDUCTION, WE CAN DO ALL OF THAT. BUT YOU CAN'T DO IT IN A TIMELY FASHION TO MEET THE CHALLENGES THAT THE WORLD HAS TODAY UNLESS YOU CHANGE PERMITTING, WHICH IS SOMETHING WE'VE ALL WANTED. EXTREME LINES, ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION LINES -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO TELL YOU. RIGHT NOW THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 20 PROJECTS IN VARIOUS STAGES OF PLANNING. 20. THOSE TAKE RIGHT NOW AN AVERAGE OF TEN YEARS AND ON TOP OF THAT, A QUARTER OF THOSE -- 25% OF THOSE -- GO INTO LITIGIOUS EXTENSIONS, WHICH IS EVEN LONGER, IS 15, 17 YEARS SOME OF THEM. THERE'S NOBODY IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD SAYING WE'RE EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT AND WHAT WE'RE DEVELOP SOMETHING THE MOST EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT PRICING WE CAN AND THE MOST RELIABLE ENERGY THAT'S NEEDED. IN THIS PERMITTING BILL, SIR -- MR. PRESIDENT, WE DO NOT BYPASS ANY OF THE OVERSIGHTS FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW. WHATEVER WE HAVE IN PLACE IS STILL THERE. WE'RE JUST GOING TO PUT GUIDELINES AND TIMETABLES. YOU EITHER DO IT IN A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF TIME, OR WE MOVE ON. SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING AND WE'RE SIMULTANEOUSLY GOING TO TWO OR THREE AGENCIES AT THE SAME TIME. ALL WE DID WAS LOOK AT WHAT WAS SUCCESSFUL AROUND THE WORLD. AND WE MADE IT APPLICABLE TO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE SO WE CAN COMPETE ON AN EVEN PLAYING FIELD AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT A THIS BILL ISN'T JUST MY AID. EVERYONE SAYS WELL IT'S A PERSONAL THING. THIS BILL IS NOT MY IDEA. THIS BILL IS A COMBINATION OF EVERYBODY IN THIS BODY AND ALSO THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE RIGHT NOW. THE WAR IN EUROPE HAS ACCELERATED EVERYTHING. THE INFLATION HAS ACCELERATED THE NEED TO DO SOMETHING QUICKLY. AND IF WE DON'T GET OFF OUR PROVERBIAL HIND ENDS AND START ACTING LIKE AMERICANS AND NOT REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS FIGHTING FOR OUR OWN RESPECTIVE SIDE, YOU KNOW, I SEE -- WE HAVE SPECTATORS HERE WATCHING WHAT WE'RE DOING. WE HAVE PEOPLE WATCHING WHAT WE'RE DOING. THEY'VE GOT TO BE SICK AND TIRED OF ALL WE DO IS CALL EACH OTHER NAMES. EVERY REPUBLICAN OVER THERE, I CONSIDER THEM A FRIEND, EVERY ONE OF THE 50. AND EVERY ONE O MY 49 COLLEAGUES I CONSIDER THE SAME. SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN WE CAN FIND AN ANSWER TO THE PROBLEMS. AND I'M GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT. I'M NOT GIVING UP AND I WON'T GIVE UP. AND WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY, LET'S TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT. IF WE DON'T, THEN YOU GOT TO GO HOME AND EXPLAIN WHY NOT. I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I KNOW WHY I AM FOR THIS AND I KNOW WHY I THINK IT'LL HELP EVERY PERSON IN MY STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA AND EVERY ONE OF MY FELLOW AMERICANS IN THIS COUNTRY. I REALLY DO. AND I HOPE THAT WE RISE TO THIS OCCASION. WE ARE GOING TO FIND OUT NEXT WEEK. WE'LL FIND OUT WHERE WE STAND. IF THERE ARE PEOPLE WILLING TO VOTE TO SHUT DOWN THIS GOVERNMENT BECAUSE OF POLITICAL REASONS THEY DON'T LIKE PERMITTING WHEN IT IS SOMETHING THEY FOUGHT FOR ALL THEIR POLITICAL LIFE, THEY HAVE TO ANSWER TO THAT. SO WITH THAT BEING SAID, MR. PRESIDENT, I APPRECIATE VERY MUCH THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK ON THIS SUBJECT BECAUSE I THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT AND IT'S COMING DOWN TO THE POINT WHERE WE HAVE GREAT LEGISLATION. WE'VE DONE A LOT OF BIPARTISAN THINGS, WORKED ON SOME GOOD STUFF THIS PAST TWO YEARS. UNBELIEVABLE. NOW, DO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT AND BRING IT TO THE MARKET QUICKER? YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU GET THE PRICES DOWN, YOU FIGHT INFLATION, SHOW THE REST OF THE WORLD THAT YOU CAN DEPEND ON THE UNITED STATES OF MECHANIC. THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT -- THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT TODAY. WITH

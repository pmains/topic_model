let's talk about your environmental plan mm-hmm you said what you say is based more on science than fear yeah what's in it so my element of our broader GOP plan is the new energy frontier and I'm focusing on carbon capture so I'm focusing on existing technology that we should be investing in it's really that simple and specifically I'm I have a bill called the leading Act which I've rolled into the new energy frontier and that sets aside existing funds of the Department of Energy to invest in pilot programs research and development for carbon captures that relates to natural gas plants again this isn't science fiction just outside of Houston we have a plant that powers 5,000 homes takes a natural gas and recirculates that co2 through the plant zero emissions so the goal is to scale this out the goal is to currently this is this is the key difference between how Republicans looking at this versus how Democrats explain the science to me - well as best you can the the science of carbon capture yeah well somebody else like the exact science of it in in in this case they're they're actually just recirculating the co2 through the power plant itself there's other there's other science out there called direct you know direct air capture where you just have machines out there that just capture co2 from the air that's not very cost-effective right now at all right now you want to be capturing carbon from the source of you know from an energy source from a manufacturing plant something like that and more importantly we have to look at ways okay once you've captured it what are you going to do with it okay and that's another interesting part so the second part of the new energy frontier is a carbon innovation hub at do-e let's actually do the fundamental science to figure out what uses are out there for co2 again this isn't pious guy thinking there's already a lot of uses there's another plant outside of Houston a coal plant that takes that captures carbon and then ships that to the oil industry so they can use that for enhanced oil recovery when you using the co2 for enhanced oil recovery you actually reduce emissions about like 40 percent okay so there's already uses though we ship it to greenhouses we ship it to algae farms we use it in cement mix and use it and a lot of different chemical processes so there's already a market for co2 we need to start looking at it like a commodity and not a waste product we need to build the infrastructure to ship it around and use it and there's more uses - there's there's some really interesting research out there that would use biological processes to create the chemical process of basically stripping the o2 out of the co2 creating carbon out of it what can you do with carbon basically everything I can create energy it's so then they would they would they would use bacteria and algae processes to process this I mean there's a really interesting stuff that that's on the horizon

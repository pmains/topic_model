Madam speaker I rise today to strongly oppose the department of agriculture's poultry line speed waiver rule back in July over 50 chicken plants that currently participate in the U.S department of agriculture's waiver program received a notification from the Department stating that within one month these plants must participate in a third party study in order to retain their line speed waivers in addition to granting a third party group unlimited and unannounced access to poultry plants the study also requires these plants to submit heaps of data and burdensome paperwork failure to participate in this study results in chicken plant slowing production by 25 percent creating supply chain Mayhem in the industry and undeniably posing a serious threat to food availability the Biden administration's line speed waiver rule forces an ultimatum on poultry plants burdening both consumers and workers already battling supply chain disruptions and hyperinflation for the sake of a vague intrusive and unnecessary third-party study on worker safety since I represent and serve the poultry capital of the world Gainesville Georgia I proudly LED 34 of my colleagues in sending a letter to USDA secretary vilsack expressing grave concerns about the third party study and urging a delay in the Mandate given the adverse effects this rule imposes on the industry and poultry production vilsack must immediately provide substantive answers to Congress about why this rule must be put in place

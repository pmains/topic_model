the gentlewoman from California wish to be recognized I would reserve the right to object and I will explain why I in fact do object in the past members of this committee on both sides of the aisle have required the reading of bills and amendments because they were unhappy or mad and that's not the case in this instance I mindful however that this amendment was distributed for the very first time Monday night in fact my staff pulled an all-nighter in order to put together amendments by the 10 a.m. deadline the public doesn't even know in many cases what's in this amendment we had a hearing a month ago we haven't even received the answers to the questions that we were permitted to submit we've had one hearing and at that hearing there was only one witness permitted to testify in opposition to the measure we've had no subcommittee markups and I think just in the in the interest of transparency for the public we ought to have an airing of what is in this manager's amendment I understand that it's not a pleasure since we have read it I have read it but I think for the public's sake it is necessary I'm mindful in the 90s when I was a member of this committee when we for mented the DMCA we spent years I mean hundreds of hours working on this measure this is being jammed through in two months time so I do object to waiving the reading of the gentlelady you I would be happy to thank you well we're happy to learn that you're not mad or unhappy that's that's a relief because we could I remember Phil Burton advice be happy in your work all right now now that we got that much out of the way is the gentlelady suggesting because there were no subcommittee mark that there ought to be a postponement of this hearing today and that we come back and look at it later I think that would be a preferable approach frankly but as I am NOT the chair of the committee that is not it is not my opportunity to set this schedule all I can do is object to waiving the reading of well with the gentlelady you I would be happy to yield to my I thank the gentlelady and I with her in expressing that the managers amendment is in fact so substantially different and I applaud the chairman for making some of the changes that I think in such a short period of time became recognized but only an hour ago keep the web open comm published SOPA for the first time so that the public could begin looking at it in an interactive way there are 60 or more amendments that will be offered here over the next two plus days those amendments should go on the web they should be understood and we should have a hearing on the basis of the now new proposed legislation and many of the amendments that would substantially improve the bill if we did that if we allowed if you will the Christmas season to allow for this kind of airing held a hearing with technical experts including for example Secretary of Napolitano's own brother from sandia lab who made it clear that the current bill would not does not have technology that would effectively provide DNS blocking and oh by the way the new bill only safe haven is still that same DNS blocking that's just one of many examples so I I joined with the gentlelady that I believe we need to slow down and give the not just the public but the technology public the vast technology public that will be impacted by this an opportunity I for one would make sure that every one of my amendments in every amendment I have any control over we're made equally public at keep the keep the web open calm so that we could begin evaluating how to get to the right solution to protect against piracy which is the one thing on both sides of the Ben both rows of the day as we agree on and I think the ability

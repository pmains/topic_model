thank you mr chairman i too want to compliment both chairs for their leadership in this budget process and say what a privilege it is to serve on this conference committee and while we come across the nation and our backgrounds vary and we're here today as an important step toward governing in the way the american people expect today's meeting is a positive step in the right direction and for the first time in a long time there's a real possibility that both chambers of congress will adopt a budget resolution for a balanced budget this budget will set the guard rails for federal spending in the upcoming year as well as the decade ahead families in my home state of michigan understand that they need to tighten their belts and balance their budget when there's a change in household income or expenses and that's something we need to do in washington as well this balanced budget will not raise taxes on the hard-working americans and it will keep the promises that have been made to seniors while slowing the soaring national debt from our nation's founding it took more than 200 years for the government to accumulate five trillion dollars in debt by 2008 the debt had doubled to 10 trillion and in the last seven years it has skyrocketed to 18 trillion divided among 320 million americans has been mentioned already a child born today inherits fifty six thousand two hundred fifty dollars in debt that's two hundred twenty five thousand for a family of four leaving less debt to our children is vital and if we fail to act debt payments will crowd out spending for the bipartisan priorities of the american people including national security medical research programs to protect the great lakes and funding for our roads and bridges our national debt is also costing us jobs because our debt to gdp ratio is over 90 percent hindering economic growth and job creation one way we can boost the slow economic recovery is tax reform which has the potential to add one million new private sector jobs this budget calls for tax reform and many americans just filed their tax returns ending another year that they had to deal with the long and complicated federal tax code as my predecessor chairman dave camp who many of you served with he was fond of saying the tax code is bigger than the bible with none of the good news middle class americans don't have time to read the code 74 000 pages and it's estimated that individuals families and employers spend more than 160 billion dollars trying to comply with it every year the tax codes complexities distort the decisions a couple makes when planning to save for retirement and leave middle class families hoping they filled out their return correctly and that the irs will not audit them for small business owners filing quarterly estimates a better system cannot come soon enough the federal tax code complicates their plans to expand and hire new workers it also buries them under paperwork and pulls their time and talents away from running their businesses the last major overhaul of the tax code was 29 years ago long before the internet and cell phones gained widespread use in this global economy other nations have built their tax systems for the 21st century creators are being left at a competitive disadvantage it's time for a better tax code that is simpler and fairer more americans will move up the economic ladder if the federal government makes it easier for families to pay their taxes and for entrepreneurs to have certainty of their costs again this is the first time in a long time that a budget conference committee will meet to pass a balanced budget this budget will boost the slow growing economy create jobs raise wages and build a more prosperous america this budget addresses our country's fiscal problems in a responsible way and puts our nation on a brighter path for our children and our grandchildren thank you and i yield back

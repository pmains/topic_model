and we have a knowledgeable witness here but he is the as I understand it acting principal deputy assistant secretary we used to have under secretaries and assistant secretaries come here they may not have been more knowledgeable but they were higher ranking in the State Department the administration took over a year to appoint an assistant secretary for the Western Hemisphere and a Republican Senate still has enacted to confirm the administration is hollowing out the State Department and I think we as a practice should be compelling the testimony of those at the national security advisors office and counsel if you're gonna hollow out the State Department then if we're gonna oversee foreign policy we have to have those witnesses I was had a chance to visit the kids who were separated by the United States at the border I want to commend the State Department for its 19 its 2018 trafficking in persons report which identified and condemned foreign governments for separating children from their families and relate the story of one particular family Jose and his son Brian arrived in California from Honduras my state in May Brian's mother had been raped and brutally murdered she was seven months pregnant at the time Jose and Brian thought that they might face a similar outcome Jose was jailed for twenty days and asked to sign papers he couldn't understand because they were in English deported back to Honduras this after Brian the son had been separated from his father there are news reports that say that this whole process at least began it seems to be in it seems now they're walking him back as an effort to deter immigration from Central America has there been any effort of the state apartment to try to tell people in Central America don't come to the United States we will treat you harshly separate families deport you etc ambassador thanks for the question you know our what we do tell people is to not make a journey that is dangerous or illegal we and always encouraged legal orderly migration of people legal and orderly travel of people so that that is what we've okay we've been focusing on I want to move on to one other issue Ecuador Julian Assange is in their embassy in London he is wanted by law enforcement authorities in both Britain and Sweden one thing we know about Julian Assange is that he did collude with Russia to use cyber files stolen from the Democratic National Committee to affect the u.s. election and in 1972 when files were stolen from the Democratic National Committee members of Congress from both parties condemned that action we haven't put any pressure on Ecuador to turn out mr. Asajj and I understood that to be because we had such respect for Ecuador's sovereignty and then I find out in The New York Times that we threatened Ecuador with punishing trade measures and a withdrawal of critical military aid if they wouldn't withdraw their support for a World Health Organization resolution encouraging breastfeeding ambassador can you on the record indicate that you know that these reports in the New York Times were false and that we did not threaten Ecuador on this issue my understanding from our ambassador for my colleagues in in State Department Bureau of Western Hemisphere affairs that work on this issue on a regular basis is that we did not threaten anybody that the u.s. supports breastfeeding we support efforts at breastfeeding beyond what the companies that make billions of dollars on the formula industry by discouraging breastfeeding want us to do we we support only mild resolutions and we forced the World Health Organization to back down and and adopt a milder resolution but you're certain now that Ecuador can introduce the stronger resolution and there will be no diminution of trade or aid can't can't can't ecuador count on you for that i can i can tell you what has happened thus far and my understand what is our policies our policy to threaten ecuador on this issue or allow them to go forward my understanding is that there has been no threatening and i do not believe that we so they're free to go forward you guarantee it I am NOT here to guarantee that going so maybe they will be threatened maybe they won't they either have to believe they are not going to be threatened sir but I will say that this is they're not going to be threatened this is a policy that said we don't actually also the New York Times reports are false as I understand our ambassador from our ambassador and from the folks that work on this in our in our Bureau that nobody was threatened we have not you know threatened to pull trades pull trade sanctions or anything else on next door that is my understanding so well a lot of infant's are going to get worse nutrition as a result of the successful efforts by the United States at the World Health Organization of water down this resolution and I yield back Chris Smith

mr. Schneider representative Brad Snyder they shouldn't be waiting Oh keep piling on the whole step well thank you chairman Serrano and to everyone here I appreciate the opportunity to be before you to testify Zion Illinois my district is one of many communities around the country shouldering the burden of decommissioned nuclear power plants only a few hundred yards from the shores of Lake Michigan since more than two million pounds of spent nuclear fuel that serves as physical testament to the legacy of nuclear power in our community storing the spent nuclear waste without compensation is just one component of the legacy Zion must bear from the nuclear power plant that went to set on its border more pervasive impact is the ongoing stunting of the local economy Zion lost its biggest source of tax revenue in the parapet power plant closed and now has some of the highest if not the highest property taxes in the entire country as a result home ownership is limited and companies are worried of moving into a community with such a significant tax burden that's why I'm working to pass the stranded Act which would help communities like Zion but in the meantime this committee made a significant contribution towards helping nuclear closed closure communities last fiscal year for the first time in fiscal year 2020 funding for the economic development administration included 15 million dollars to boost economic development in nuclear closure communities I know that Zion is working to put forward a competitive application but we also know this funding pales in the comparison to the need these communities actually face and we know that more communities will face decommissioning in the coming decade it's our duty to help communities like Zion who for too long have shouldered the legacy of nuclear power on their own the EDA funding you've included last fiscal year represents a vital resource for these communities to plan the next chapter of economic growth that's why I am strongly urging this subcommittee to once again fund this critical program I hope you'll include 15 million dollars the same as fiscal year 2020 to help the nuclear closure communities throughout our country with that I thank you and yield back thank you thank you for your testimony I really appreciate it thanks for testifying look forward working with you great thanks so much

Thank You mr. chairman in a full committee hearing last week general Alexander who as you know as the former commander of US Cyber Command stated quote the leader in artificial intelligence and quantum will be the next world superpower I'm deeply concerned that we must be able to keep pace with near-peer adversaries like China when it comes to their investment in AI as you stated dr. Schmidt in your opening statement China has publicly stated their goal to be the global leader when it comes to AI by 2030 that's not very far away what specific steps do we need to take within the DoD in addition to research and development to ensure that we're able to keep pace and surpass near-peer adversaries and mr. Griffin if you can specifically talk about what we're currently doing within DoD regarding AI this is in as we discussed earlier for dr. Griffin hypersonics was his first of a number of first for me the AI questions are first among a number of firsts and in order to do AI you need to have data for training and the DoD broadly speaking has a great deal of data which is not stored anywhere or stored in places which you know the programmers are no longer alive kind of thing and getting all that data in a place that's usable and discoverable and useful for the mission at hand is crucial we've already highlighted the importance of having some form of AI Center again from my perspective preferable if it's done in conjunction with some universities to take the work at the state-of-the-art the third is that the majority of the contractors that are used by the DoD are not AI capable at this moment although they're all working on it so again I would encourage the specification and the current process which is essentially a requirements document needs to actually state what problem they want to solve a typical example would be you're worried about a swarming drone problem with economy right that's a good example of an AI problem where's the research whereas the tools where's the where's the drones whereas the counter drones all of those kinds of questions need to be asked but they need to be asked in the context that causes the data to be stored and the algorithms to be invented and funded the defense innovation board has recommended dr. Schmidt has emphasized the need for an AI Center I believe in his hearing recently the secretary affirmed that the DoD will establish an AI Center so that I believe comes under my area and we are looking right now as we speak about things like how do we structure it who should lead it where it should be how we should structure our other departmental research to focus in through that so these are ongoing questions that we're addressing this week currently I I was briefed recently and told I can't verify the number but I was told that we have 592 separate AI related projects across the department we we need to bring some focus to all of that and I think that's what you're getting at to follow up dr. Schmidt some of the technologies we've talked technology companies we've talked with and particularly those that are contributing in the areas of AI have expressed a reluctance to work with DoD and I know you're not here today in your capacity with Google but you are familiar with some of the news articles related to the work forces questioning regard and concerned regarding DoD's project maven how do we overcome this skepticism because I think this private sector work force is critically important to be able to leverage their innovations when it comes to what DoD is doing in AI specifically so because of my role in both organizations I have been deliberately kept out of the particulars here so I honestly can't answer the maven your questions at all I honestly don't know the my sense of the industry to answer your question at the industry level is that the industry is going to come to some set of agreement on AI what is called principles what is appropriate use what is not and that my guess is that there will be some kind of consensus among key industry players on that and then the that process which will take a little while will probably then inform how dr. Griffin and his team's you know leverage work with work against what have you I think it's a matter of speculation but my guess is that's the past thank you my time is about to expire

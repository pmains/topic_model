nearly one year ago Russia launched an unprovoked illegal and brutal war of aggression against Ukraine in doing so Vladimir Putin quite literally sought to wipe a Sovereign Nation off the map but as the world witnessed in the months that followed Mr Putin had vastly underestimated the Ukrainian people and the Ukrainian leadership rather than capitulate ukrainians have resisted and saved their Homeland from full-scale occupation the courage and Ingenuity shown by Ukrainian troops many of whom were civilians before the war continues to be nothing short of heroic this morning we learned of yet another Act of Russian Terror in the form of a barrage of drones and missiles raining down on Kiev this left severe casualties this act of brute intimidation which has become all too common over the past year was clearly meant to break the will of the Ukrainian people as they prepare to receive more military aid from the United States and from other allies thankfully Ukrainian forces successfully shot down the vast majority of those incoming projectiles using Advanced Air Defense technology this is just one more example of what many of us in this chamber have asserted for months if ukrainians get the tools they need they can finish the job and defeat Vladimir Putin the harsh reality is that these kinds of attacks on Ukraine leaving a trail of casualties in their wake have become far too common and if leaders across the Free World had acted sooner we would be better positioned to save the lives in critical infrastructure now the United States Congress has led the world in supporting the Ukraine war effort in fact we have led the Biden Administration this Senate on both sides of the aisle on a bipartisan basis we have provided security assistance humanitarian Aid and direct support to Ukraine's government although this has amounted to tens of billions of taxpayer dollars this is actually a bargain investment let's put it in context according to the Keel institute's Ukraine support Tracker the total U.S contribution to Ukraine through November of last year amounted to only 0.2 percent of our gross domestic product the new Congress must continue this bipartisan support for Ukraine and I look forward to Leading The Charge as ranking member of the armed services committee as the first anniversary of this war approaches we should reflect on the progress made by Ukraine and we should carefully consider how to help them decisively win this conflict so that a lasting peace can take root to do so we first need to State clearly what our American interests are in Ukraine that is something the president and his advisors have repeatedly failed to do choosing instead to make vague references to the rules-based international order or words to that effect the American people are right to demand straight answers with inflation rampant crime On The Rise and open Southern border it is fair to ask why we should care about what happens in Ukraine I offer four reasons first Ukraine matters because the security of Europe is closely tied to our own American Security and our own American prosperity for decades all of our fellow citizens have benefited from peace and stability in Europe purchased by the sacrifices of Americans in World War one and World War II what is at stake today in Ukraine is whether the fruits of those sacrifices will continue to endure allowing Putin to Prevail in Ukraine would Usher in a new age of chaos and instability and would invite Putin to test our resolve to defend our NATO allies make no mistake Putin will push the envelope as far as we let him his goal to remake the old Soviet Empire and regrettably the West has misread and underestimated Putin's intentions for years in 2008 when he invaded Georgia and then in 2014 with a seizure of Crimea and parts of eastern Ukraine and yet again last year in Ukraine with this full-scale invasion his Imperial Ambitions are now undeniable if Vladimir Putin is not stopped in Ukraine the security of the entire European continent will be put at risk second our support and the support of our allies for Ukraine has made a huge difference and has significantly weakened Russia thanks to the U.S military assistance and the courage of Ukrainian troops Russia has lost its ability to carry out near-term conventional invasions of NATO members and we achieved that without having to send a single American soldier in to combat the Russian losses have been massive last week the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark milley estimated that significantly more than 100 000 Russian troops have been killed or wounded in Ukraine during the war not to mention thousands of combat Vehicles tanks artillery pieces and aircraft destroyed for those questioning the cost of our assistance I would simply pose the alternative how much would it cost in American lives and treasure to confront the Russians directly because that is the reality we face if Putin tests are resolved to defend NATO from that perspective we are getting one heck of a deal by helping Ukraine do its own fighting third our support for Ukraine is prompting European countries to take more responsibility for their own security something we have long urged them to do Republican and Democrat presidents alike have long believed that Europeans should take the lead on European security I agree almost every American agrees thanks to our example our NATO allies are now spending tens of billions more on defense much of which will be spent here in the United States in particular our friends in the United Kingdom Poland Romania and the Baltic states are making all the right choices to help Ukraine win and prepare their own militaries to deter Russia for decades to come backing away from Ukraine at this crucial moment would undermine our credibility as we ask the Europeans to shoulder more of the collective defense burden fourth although this war is helping is happening in Europe we should not forget who else is watching some Skeptics of our mission in Ukraine believe it distracts from our principal security threat the Chinese Communist Party but the reality is the exact opposite Xi Jinping is watching us closely he wants to see if we will stick by our commitment as he weighs his opportunities of invading his own neighbor and our friend Taiwan our indo-pacific allies are also watching closely and even helping in Ukraine as Japanese prime minister keshita recently noted Ukraine today could be Asian Asia tomorrow far from distracting us from China stopping Putin in Ukraine is indispensable in deterring China we dare not show weakness at this moment in Ukraine doing so would simply invite other dictators to act just like Vladimir Putin the bottom line is that America's interest in this war is clear we need Ukraine to win and that means giving them the tools to Prevail cutting our support would cost us far more in the long run unfortunately as we know Vladimir Putin understands only Brute Force he will not capitulate or negotiate until he's forced to do so this is something President Biden failed to appreciate when he downplayed Putin's threats a year ago by talking about Minor incursions remember that minor incursions at every step of this Crisis crisis it has been congress not the administration that has taken the lead and it is something that the president still fails to grasp as he and his administration continue to Slow Roll military aid for fear of escalation the Biden Administration has come along grudgingly as Congress has pushed and pulled and taken the lead for example in May of last year Congress provided the administration with roughly 8.5 billion dollars of drawdown Authority to transfer weapons and Munitions from U.S inventories to Ukraine through the end of September but the administration let almost 3 billion dollars of that Authority expire Mr president Ukraine can win this war Ukraine must win this war but we and our allies have to do our part to help them when Russia first launched its Invasion the prospect of Ukrainian Victory indeed seemed unlikely the Russian Blitz Creek forced Ukraine to fight for its very survival it took repeated acts of heroism to push the Russians back from president zielinski's Fearless example of leadership down to the foot soldiers like Vitali below dimirovich who blew up the bridge beneath his feet sacrificing his own life to stop the Russian advance after Russian troops faltered in those initial days they pivoted to a barbaric tactic of heavy bombardment of civilians shelling homes schools and hospitals these were war crimes and as the president as the Russians were finally expelled from Kiev we learned of the horrific atrocities committed against civilians particularly in the city's outer lying areas such as buca and then began to counter offensive the ukrainians retook Snake Island liberated herkiv and eventually expelled the Russians from her son in November their Battlefield success demonstrated the impact of high-end U.S military aides such as high Mars long-range Rockets as well as the ukrainian's own capabilities to plan and execute complex operation in defense of their own Homeland today the situation has stabilized with Russia occupying only about 15 percent of Ukraine Mr President the courage of ukrainians presents us with an opportunity as the war approaches its second year Congress must once again lead the administration to ramp up military aid to Ukraine to drive toward victory we should all want Ukraine to win the war a continuation of the status quo which would drag out the war favors Russia the United States has made a huge difference in this war and we can now tip the balance in favor of Ukraine if we take the right steps I would sum up this policy of the right steps in three words more better and faster more ground vehicles and Munitions better equipment faster deliveries we need faster deliveries right now well I appreciate the White House's recent announcement that we will send a batch of Abrams Tanks to Ukraine it is now our duty to follow through on this commitment and make certain the ukrainians promptly received the battlefield capabilities we plan we plan to provide them including the necessary training in addition we need to give Ukraine attackums long-range missiles and advanced drones like the Gray Eagle and the reaper which should deliver these assets quickly to make an immediate difference on the battlefield in concert with our allies this approach of approach of more better faster would give the ukrainians a real shot at Victory at the same time we must continue our work to expand our own defense industrial capacity here at home the American people have already invested billions of dollars to replenish the weapons we've transferred to Ukraine particularly munitions we are using that money here in America to expand production doubling and even tripling production capacities for weapons like 155 millimeter shells javelins and high Mars and our work on that has just begun lastly we will continue to maintain and expand the rigorous oversight structure we've placed over military aid as of today Congress has imposed more than two dozen detailed oversight requirements on the Biden Administration and we continue to monitor their responses closely of course some of the oversight work we do is classified to protect the people and sources conducting it but Americans should know the scope of our oversight works and so we will hold oversight hearings in this Congress and we'll do so on a bipartisan basis we should also press the Pentagon to make more oversight information public and we should continue tracking the work of the inspectors General in the state department in the Department of Defense and in the U.S agency for International Development and 14 other government organizations that are already tasked with ensuring accountability for all spending related to Ukraine these organizations are hard at work thus far 20 reviews of Ukraine assistance have been completed with another 64 reviews ongoing and planned that is oversight Mr President we have work ahead of us this year and it is critical work if we make the right choices we can ensure a Ukrainian victory over Russia send a message of strength to China and others who wish us ill and restore the United States as the world's Arsenal of democracy

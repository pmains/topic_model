thanks so much chairman davis for holding today's hearing on improving family outcomes through home visiting today we're here to discuss the maternal infant and early childhood home visiting program known as mcv which helps support state and local efforts to provide evidence-based outcomes focused on home visiting services to at-risk parents and children last year alone home visitors helped more than two thousand hoosier families i represent three of those nine counties in indiana eligible for mcv services provided by either nurse family partnerships or healthy families indiana mcphee is a program that gets results this program builds upon decades of research that proves home visits by a nurse social worker or other trained professional during pregnancy and in the first year of a child's life helps prevent child abuse and neglect support positive parenting improve maternal and child health and promote child development and school readiness federal funding for home visiting was introduced in 2008 after congress agreed to fund president george w bush's proposal to test the approach and measure the outcomes ways and means republicans led the effort to fully reauthorize the mcv program in 2018 to continue these efforts and the program is now up for another reauthorization again this year what makes mcv unique is that funding is tied to evidence most federal programs operate in a black box less than one dollar out of every one hundred dollars the government spends is backed up by even the most basic evidence that the money is being spent wisely unlike most federal social welfare programs we know the outcomes taxpayers can expect from our investments in mcv this program serves as a model for how other programs for low-income families should actually be funded for a home visiting model to earn taxpayer support an evaluation must prove the program has demonstrated significant positive outcomes such as preventing child abuse and neglect improving maternal and child health and improving economic independence i've witnessed these positive outcomes firsthand in my district last year i had a chance to visit the family and children's center in south bend i've also had an opportunity to visit with goodwill of michiana's excel center program which has paired nurse family partnerships with education programs and has delivered results mr chairman i ask unanimous consent to enter into the record a collective impact study from the wilson sheehan labor for economic opportunities or the leo lab at notre dame regarding nurse family partnership in the excel center thank you this study shows that by pairing the nurse family partnership with additional educational and workforce training resources we can make great strides to increase the economic independence of families connecting families in need with compassionate human support is proven to uplift families and change lives as we turn to reauthorization republican priorities include providing a full five-year reauthorization to give states and implementing organizations the certainty they need to conduct long-term planning we aim to raise awareness of mcphee's high quality outcomes to promote this time-tested program and we must apply lessons learned during the pandemic specifically from the success of remote visits that grew efficiency while preserving the positive outcomes we expect from this evidence-based model there are very few federal social programs that have been evaluated to determine if they're working and almost none have conditioned funding on evidence of effectiveness when we spend limited taxpayer dollars to help those in need we must ensure we're investing in programs that deliver results i look forward to working with chairman on a bipartisan basis to reauthorize mcphee so we can deliver for our american families with that mr chairman i yield back

fox news getting an exclusive look at the crisis at our southern border going on a ride-along last night with the national border patrol council at this hour house minority whip steve scalise set to lead a delegation of 10 lawmakers touring conditions in mission texas ohio congressman brad wenstrup also leading a delegation at the border just a few hours from now all of this coming as border officials report more than 172 000 migrants were taken into custody last month alone that is a 20 year high that includes nearly 19 000 unaccompanied minors the highest on record and the cost for the american taxpayer is soaring the biden administration now reportedly spending 60 million dollars a week to shelter unaccompanied minors amounting to more than 3 billion a year far surpassing the amount budgeted for small businesses suffering during the pandemic kennedy that's hard for many of those small businesses still struggling some who can't even open their doors right now to here no and they're you know they're it's compounded because they're talking about raising taxes and they're talking about spending so much more money on everything from schools to infrastructure and now everything is infrastructure so everything gets included in the infrastructure bill except for immigration and this is only going to get more expensive you know you saw those numbers in march we are in the middle of april we don't know what the april numbers are going to be but i guarantee you they're going to be higher uh the next two months because all that we're learning from this administration is hey if we don't have room right now we will find room unfortunately the room they're finding uh is filled with people who are not feeding children and apparently sexually assaulting them so this is a horrible crisis on so many levels unfortunately it seems as though we don't care about spending anymore so i don't know if that part of the story even moves the needle i don't know how you can't david notice that number on our screen right now taxpayers spending 60 million dollars a week to house these migrants i don't know how as an average american taxpayer you don't see that and think i've got a bigger tax bill coming yeah well i have a feeling i'm going to have a pretty consistent theme throughout this show which is that the democrats are here to destroy every norm we talked about that in the previous segment at a political level meaning the machinery of our government and separation of powers and that sort of thing and what we're up to now is 172 000 people migrants you just said that 172 000 migrants last month alone coming to this country now i'm pretty sure there's still a pandemic or we i think that's what they're telling us there's still a pandemic right so that's one issue but you know we have so many other problems in the united states on top of the 60 million a month we have so many things going on right now sort of politically economically and with the pandemic everything else that it's like maybe there's a moment where we just have to take care of our house get our house in order and really put a pause to all of this but they don't want to pause let's not forget when it was trump as president aoc was down at the border with her fake photo shoot with her hand on her face buckled over crying that there were kids in cages and this is like the holocaust and concentration camps and the rest of that nonsense now we see pictures where some of the the cages if by her words are at something like a thousand percent capacity we've all seen the pictures of of the kids in those sort of tinfoil looking blankets but nobody seems to care and this is just another extension the democrats want open borders they want more people here they don't care about money i mean to say 60 million dollars a month they just don't care because they believe you can just keep printing it and maybe they can i can't get enough of those images kaylee our fox flight team is amazing these drone images over mission texas right now we continue to get an inside look especially now with more lawmakers visiting the border today steve scalise brad wenstrup scalise is really really hammering on the fact that biden has not paid a visit down there yet listen he could reverse this tomorrow and he won't come down and see it firsthand because he knows what's going on and he said he put kamala harris in charge she won't even come down what is happening that that they think that they can get away with having a crisis at the border and not visiting because they simply don't care about the problem and i know that sounds harsh but when you care about something you go and see it like vice president pence did like president trump did and i saw i believe it was a border patrol agent or someone involved in immigration say earlier on fox today that after vice president pence came changes were made because you're the executive you're the leader you go you see it and changes are made and to dave's point these cages and i won't call them pods that's a gratuitous term only given to democrats they are indeed cages they're caged uh four-sided rooms they're supposed to be 32 individuals in these pods or cages in the donna facility and there are 400 to 500 i mean think about that a 32 person space with 400 to 500 people or kids i should say and you have vice president biden not even willing to come see it as we are experiencing a 20-year surge and apparently this number is so high that it would not even fit on the y-axis of a cbc graph for those who forget from elementary school that's that vertical axis on a graph the number was so high it could not even be tracked on that graph it's extraordinary and it's completely disrespectful and inhumane that vice president or president biden i should say won't even go see it emily the numbers are staggering but when it comes to the numbers of children each one of those children has a story and have clearly gone through very dangerous journeys many of them uh they're now weeping inside of these facilities that are overflowing let alone the fact that there's still a pandemic and covet is still spreading but currently 8 500 children are living in these pop-up sites 4 000 more are waiting to be transferred to other border facilities i mean how much longer can this go on emily i think that question we've been asking all along in astonishment while all we get is silence from the white house and i'd like to make this point about vice president harris fighting on behalf of sexual abuse victims particularly children that has been a central part of her political identity for 30 years she was a prosecutor right out of law school she focused on children on sex abuse and child exploitation and then she touted it in all of her campaigns in television ads and in profiles and in her campaigning and then when she became a da of san francisco she basically did nothing to help for example the catholic church victim so for those seven years one of the quotes of one of those victims was like the prior d.a terence hallinan ran at 100 miles an hour and going moving to her was like moving backwards so i think there's a lot we've been talking constantly about the optics of this white house and for someone who has touted this for 30 years it is mind-boggling and absolutely unacceptable that for her quote dedication to the victims of sexual abuse and to the children of the child victims the fact that we've not heard barely anything that this isn't then her pet cause where is she where is our vice president where is someone in charge addressing this and putting a stop to it and in fact we remember that moment a couple weeks because they want it it's because they want it that's why remember she laughed at a reporter who said you have any plans to visit um that was two weeks ago and still silence all right we'll leave it there

welcome back to our Cove at nineteen congressional Town Hall we have our eighth state representative standing by but first we're gonna go back to Washington DC and our senior senator roy blunt this evening senator we appreciate you joining us on the statewide townhall broadcast today now you're the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee more or less meeting you're in contact with the heads of all these key agencies like CDC HHS and NIH what are they telling you right now that will likely have an impact on us in the future here in Missouri well John these are the committee's that people in the last couple of months of suddenly begin to hear a lot about and I think they're working together in ways that we have always hoped they could in terms of moving forward quickly on on treatment on testing on a vaccine trying to figure out how they can develop new partnerships with pharmaceutical companies and others to try to really have all of those things on a on a two-track process where we're ahead of where we would have been at any other time and all of those things that we need to deal with the virus and then eventually to emerge from the virus with a vaccine yeah I'm curious too because you made news this week when you see the headline shark tank right so you you're you're looking for what the newest and most revolutionary ways to get things done quickly again kind of a shark tank format here explain what you're doing well absolutely we gave a billion dollars it's something Senator Alexander for who's the chairman of the authorizing committee I'm the chairman of the appropriating committee we worked together for two months now to try to come up with a unique way to fast forward the decision-making process and in five days after the bill was signed the National Institute of Health had a shark tank up and running they had 400 responses in the very first day now the job is for the shark tank experts to narrow those responses down what we want to do is say let's get the four things that have at least a 50% chance of being successful and let's go ahead and start toward production with all four of them so by the time they've gone through the final tests let's say it's a vaccine one of those are two of those or however many got through the final test would already be ready to go out and be available rather than be 30 days away or 60 days away from Missourians and people all over the country being able to get that vaccine so we're trying to buy time here with a concept that's a little different than what the federal government's ever done before but I think it's gonna work is that what it's gonna take to get back to normal either well first a treatment and then a vaccine because it's not kind of hard to see everything getting back to the way it was until we have both those things in place the three things we need to be focused on are the vaccine which probably takes the longest but we're trying hard to get that done if we can at all set a record and get that done by the end of this year therapeutics treatment which also looking for the things that work short of the vaccine to get you through the virus better when you get it and then the other thing I think that's going to be critically important isn't easy to take and a quick response on testing and so vaccine therapeutics testing all are part of the Shark Tank concept they're talking about a warp-speed view toward a vaccine that's exactly what we're talking about as part of the whole Shark Tank process senator one last question here for you we keep hearing the calls to make sure that from this point on the manufacturer of drugs vaccines a PPE is done in america along with pharmaceuticals of course how do we ensure that that actually happens this time because we've been debating this for years and now we find out how urgent that actually is well in the Charis bill in that big bill not the one we just did to clean the big bill up and do things that needed to be to fill in the gaps in the the cares bill a Senator Durbin and I actually proposed an idea we work together on some things there are a lot of things we don't agree on but one was to have a crash study by the National Science Foundation of our supply chain supply chain for PPE the protective equipment a supply chain for medical devices a supply chain for pharmaceuticals I think we're going to looking at lots of supply chains as we get out of this and the economy generally but the most critical one to look at is the one that impacts healthcare that's already started it's already funded we hope to have some answers soon on what we need to do to have a supply chain that's more secure for America's health and also to be sure that we have a supply chain where we don't just have a sole source for anything that we need to keep our country safe and healthy senator roy blunt we appreciate your time today great to be with you John [Music]

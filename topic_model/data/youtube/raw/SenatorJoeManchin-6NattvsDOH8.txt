mr delby uh appreciate you being here and appreciate you willing to serve at this capacity um your pre-hearing questions you acknowledge the need to expand broadband to veterans in rural areas i come from west virginia my entire state's rural i don't have one city larger than 50 000. the largest city in west virginia is 49 000 people so i have a state of towns and they're wonderful but basically we are a rural and broadband the veterans in rural areas need the access uh that they have in in urban areas but to be va benefits in healthcare we couldn't even do telehealth we had to do audio only telehealth and then they reimbursed and just was just unbelievable situation so i would say confirmed how you balance expanding uh and expanding initiatives like telehealth while also ensuring that rural veterans have access to broadband that you can interact with fcc things of that sort showing where your real problem areas are thank you for the question and i think you hint on a couple of the areas that i think are really key there for one there's a signal out of that will come out of the va of where the health care is needed to where there are gaps and i think it's important for us and we can use the data that we have in systems uh and elsewhere in the va to to inform hey here's the relative priorities of where we need to improve what i might ask you to do there it's really important the maps the the fcc maps have been horrible they're showing basically coverage where there's no coverage and that's because there's been self-reporting from the uh from the tele from the uh broadband or internet services themselves they're showing larger swaths of america they're covering when they're not that gives them a little bit more areas anyway the maps working in the maps first and identifying and looking at the fcc maps we've been trying to correct those you got you all could be invaluable in helping correct that i think that's right i think we can basically look at where we have gaps in service where we can't go in in telehealth and contrast that with where the map is and identify those places where maybe a change in the priority needs to exist so that we can actually get that coverage the other thing i think you can think about is telehealth at different levels you know a device that is a cuff that connects via cellular to to the va to monitor blood pressure is another solution so you don't have to think of it as all full audio video telehealth there are gradations there we need to think about the how we deliver on multiple levels and expand it overall i'm saying sir you're you're you're going to have the opportunity to bring the va into the uh technology world really and increase that and and we need that desperately i really do i couldn't agree more professional professional areas in the state and all over the country in the va hospitals and sea boxes and everything else they're in high demand of needing quality people personnel so um whether it be cyber security whether it be nurses whether it be doctors whatever it be it's difficult for government agents to keep up with the private sector in competing for the people of those high those high value jobs so i guess i would ask them what's your plans and goals to recruit recruit and retain the talent that's going to be needed to implement and maintain the va's in many i.t sectors i think a lot of it comes down to how do you define the organization and create an organization that is a modern kind of state-of-the-art i.t organization so that somebody looks at it as a pla as an opportunity a college graduate in tech looks at it as a great place to start his or her career how do you take somebody from the private sector and say oh my gosh there's a set of skills that i can learn here that are valuable in the private sector and by the way energize them around the mission that they have today and so we need to create an organization that is very state of the art in terms of you know focused on vision execution agile development and i think that will be an attractor of talent i always thought that the primary the prime spot for you all to recruit from is the military i i think there's a huge opportunity because basically people that have served are going to be very sympathetic in understanding the needs of veterans and there's a lot of people with high skill sets that can be brought in and be taught basically on these areas i don't know what what the va is doing now in recruitment as far as active military that's going to be mustering out if you will if we're really going after that segment i i don't know at this point in time i think i couldn't agree with you more if ever natural if there were skill set that you could you could inculcate in in people leaving the military that would be valuable you'd want to get people sympathetic to the military don't understand that you want to you you want to you know so many people that don't serve you only have one percent of populations basically professional military but people that don't serve might not have the same desire or the same uh sympathy that we have and empathy for people that do serve but people in the military should and i don't know if we just if that's been if that's a good recruitment if we've been using it to the full extent i think there is but i think there's more we can do there might be excited time i hope so sir

craddock senators now announced their support for a nuclear deal with Iran if that helps to put the president a little bit closer to gaining congressional approval but it is far from a done deal indeed joining us now with senator Tim Kaine Democratic Virginia to talk about how he made his decision to endorse the nuclear agreement and good morning to you hey marine hey Steve very controversial but we want to hear from you why did you think this was a good deal well I wrote the bill actually with senator bob Corker that gives Congress this review period because I very much believe that this is the kind of deal that Congress has to weigh in but after extensive briefings and over the past two years I've been in the Middle East five times to talk with the regions there about it I think the deal is dramatically better than the status quo we were sanctioning Iran and punishing their economy but their nuclear program was racing ahead 19,000 centrifuges eleven thousand kilograms of uranium plutonium facility we had very few inspections to know what they were doing under this deal they will disable two-thirds of their centrifuges for 15 years they'll eliminate ninety-eight percent of the stock pile of uranium so what they'll end up with 300 kilograms not even enough to make one weapon and they're going to completely disable the plutonium facility and then give us more inspection so we can know what's going on which will a help us determine if they cheat and be if we were ever to need to take military action to stop a nuclear weapons program it would give us a lot more intelligence about what they're doing and what we would need to do so i think it's just so much better than the status quo at least for the first 15 years we ought to give diplomacy a chance and if Iran cheats we've built into the deal a number of things that we can do to take action either to stop the deal sanction them or god forbid if they break toward a you know nuclear weapon we can take military action a couple things here one you said this is preferable to any other alternative shooting war and the other thing is speaking of that yesterday when the president was speaking at a you just down the road from here it'll keep basically and essentially said the vote in Congress the vote for war or peace is that a little strong language that no I don't think that that's I don't think it's quite so stark but it is it is a vote for disabling their program or letting it race ahead and if it races ahead the chances of war gets more likely we have had a member of the Senate an influential member of the Senate say war with Iran don't worry that would only take two or three days so when you have people in the Senate saying things like that they're acknowledging the war is a possibility i don't think it's do this dealer its war but i do think it's do this deal or the Iranian program will go back to racing ahead and that will increase the likelihood of war you know when this whole argument the one thing that strikes me is everyone is saying who's opposing this I haven't heard anyone to say what an alternative would be and that's the thing that I keep coming back to is then what is the alternative because if we're to say that this move now is not strong enough or leaves room for them to build a bomb before we start expecting then what is the alternative marine the only alternative i heard senator cotton of Arkansas has said a war with Iran would only take two or three days so he's at least put an alternative on the table now I think that that's wrong it would take a lot more than that and so with military leaders the I think what the others believe to be an alternative is turned down this deal walk away and you'll get a better deal but if we go back to the status quo we walk away we start sanctioning Iran they're gonna do exactly what they were can we be alone because the other nations are going there for what he said we're going ahead what they like the deal yeah we would be alone and Iran would likely go right back to doing what they were doing growing centrifuges growing uranium processing plutonium for weapons so I think this it's important to give this diplomacy a chance and the good news is in this deal if Iran cheats the world will know it and the world will know it's them cheating not the United States walking away from diplomacy and yes of time right now we're going to go to a lightning round on yes first of all I do want to mention ISIL right now trying to commit that you've been been pushing this operation of military four year anniversary of war on Saturday and Congress had a debate nor voted to authorize it I took to the Senate floor yesterday and talked about how dangerous it is for a nation and how disrespectful it is for our troops that congress hasn't weighed and we're asking people to risk their lives about 3,500 folks over risking their lives right now seven service members have lost their lives in this operation and Congress has refused to even have a debate about the war is in America's national interest at shocking so much to talk about but very quickly given what's happening on metro right now weighing on this you know Metro has been played problems what's your take on yet this other disruption Metro has fundamental problems at the top it's a its management it is the board and it's the lack of a executive director right now which I think that's partly because of dysfunction on the board I think the board needs some dramatic change and until you make that happen I don't think you're going to see the kinds of improvements that Metro needs can that happen though without them coming back to you in Congress and asking for more money because that's what we tend to always hear from s well look you can change their they're going to have a hard time with more investments are needed this is a big system it's important in the region but they have a harder time making the case because of frankly the management challenges and so I think reform of the board because they're they're searching for a new executive director but it's very difficult I think to get the kind of top quality person who we should have this is one of the premier systems in the country there should be a great CEO of the system and there isn't right now and I think that really is at the feet of the board we got to have a better board all right senator Tim Kaine so much to talk about unfortunately we're out of time but it always appreciate your input and what you're doing maybe with you thanks thanks hundred

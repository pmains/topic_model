that's right now the California congresswoman barbara Lee she joins me she is one of 27 Democrats now at this hour boycotting Trump's inauguration that number has gone up by one in just the past hour congresswoman Lee we're showing the faces of you and your colleagues who have made that decision not to attend Donald Trump today of course met with Martin Luther King Junior's son tweeted today is a day that we should celebrate King and all the things he stood for is this something that would make you reconsider is there anything that would make you reconsider your decision glad to be with you this afternoon and let me just say that first of all I respect the peaceful transfer of power the office of the presidency and Donald Trump will be inaugurated in horn in as as our president but I think what's important and I think congressman Lewis really said this very clearly earlier today is dr. King's birthing we really should be celebrating his life and legacy there's some of those some of us who must speak out and we know that the president-elect as witnessed by his campaign it was a campaign that was very divisive that based on bigotry and hatred and we had hoped that after the campaign perhaps he would have tried to bring the country together that just has not happened facts are when you look at the nominees that he's presented for example Senator Jeff Sessions as our nation's highest law enforcement officer of the land as attorney general senator sessions has a history of opposing civil and human rights for everyone and that is not acceptable when you look at Steve Bannon a white nationalist in the White House how do we come together when we have a cabinet that has been proposed that is antithetical to the human dignity of all Americans how though do you come to terms you're talking about trying to unite this country if you see Trump as a divider how is what you're doing not making it even worse and dividing a warming even Hillary Clinton found it in her to attend this inauguration even though I think we all know it is going to be incredibly painful and hard for her to do she's going to be there should you I am NOT attended because i think this for me is the celebration inauguration celebrates its a happy occasion for me personally i am not celebrating the swearing-in or the inauguration of some campaign based on such a negative campaign and who wants to govern in that way as he has shown i will be working to help organize a resistance to some of this agenda such as trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act and take away health care for millions of Americans so I'm going to continue to work and hopefully find ways where we can work together on issues that are critical but at this moment in time for me to celebrate this and for me to celebrate an agenda that's based on and we know divisive pneus and based on not wanting to allow muslims into the country and deporting our dreamers and denigrating women I'm not celebrating that but I do respect the transfer of power everyone has to come to their own decisions at poly good conscience and for me this is what I am doing alright well congressman Lee thank you very much appreciate your taking the time to explain your thoughts and feelings here my panel is back

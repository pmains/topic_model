  MR. SHERMAN: I RISE TO DISCUSS   THE NEGOTIATIONS WITH NORTH  KOREA. I DO SO IN MY ROLE AS THE  RANKING MEMBER OF THE ASIA   SUBCOMMITTEE.  I POINT OUT THAT JUST A MONTH  AGO I JOINED WITH THE CHAIRMAN   OF THAT SUBCOMMITTEE, MR. YOHO,  IN SENDING A LETTER TO THE   PRESIDENT SAYING WE NOW NEED   TOUGHER SANCTIONS ON NORTH   KOREA. IN TICKS, WE NEED TO MAKE IT   CLEAR TO THE LARGE BANKS IN  CHINA THAT THEY CAN NO LONGER DO BUSINESS WITH NORTH KOREA. WE HAD OUR FOOT ON THE NECK OF   KIM JONG-UN. WE NEEDED TO PRESS IT DOWN A   LITTLE HARDER TO GET THE   CONCESSIONS THAT WE NEED.  INSTEAD, WE HAVE A LIFTING OF  THE EFFORTS. INSTEAD OF RATCHETING OUR  SANCTIONS UP, WE'RE GOING TO BE  RELAXING THEM. THE WORD IS OUT TO BUSINESSES  AND BANKS IN CHINA, YOU CAN DO A LITTLE BIT MORE TODAY AND A  LITTLE BIT MORE AFTER THAT.  THIS IS A GIANT VICTORY FOR KIM  JONG-UN. THE NEGOTIATIONS WILL GO FURTHER -- FORWARD, BUT THOSE  NEGOTIATIONS WILL GO FORWARD   WITH KIM JONG-UN BEING ABLE TO   BREATHE BECAUSE WE NO LONGER   HAVE OUR FOOT ON HIS NECK. FOUR HOURS AGO THE PRESIDENT   TWEETED, THERE IS NO LONGER A  NUCLEAR THREAT FROM NORTH KOREA. HE MIGHT HAVE WELL SMILED WITH   KIM JONG-UN AND SAID, PEACE IN   OUR TIME.  NOW, I'M NOT SAYING WHAT   HAPPENED NOT SAYING WHAT   HAPPENED IN SINGAPORE IS AS  FRAUGHT WITH DANGER FOR THE  WORLD AS WHAT HAPPENED IN MUNICH IN 1938. BUT WHAT HAPPENED IN MUNICH WILL ILLUSTRATE FOR US THAT JUST  BECAUSE YOU HAVE A SUMMIT WITH   SMILES DOES NOT MEAN YOU ARE   LEADING TOWARD PEACE. BUT WHAT HAPPENED IN  THE PRESIDENT TWEETED, THERE IS  NO LONGER A NUCLEAR THREAT FROM  NORTH KOREA. IF YOU BELIEVE THAT, YOU   PROBABLY BELIEVE THAT HE HAS   BEEN FAITHFUL TO ALL THREE OF  HIS WIVES. WE HOPE THAT THESE NEGOTIATIONS  LEAD TO REAL PEACE, BUT SO FAR   THEY HAVE LED ONLY TO A BIG WIN  FOR THE PERSON PRESIDENT TRUMP   CALLS LITTLE ROCKET MAN. THAT'S A BIG WIN FOR LITTLE  ROCKET MAN.  YOU SEE, THE PRESIDENT'S MOST  FAMOUS BOOK HAS BEEN REISSUED. IT IS NOW CALLED "THE ART OF THE CAPITULATION." NOW, HOW DO YOU EXERCISE THE ART OF THE CAPITULATION? YOU MAKE ENORMOUS CONCESSIONS TO THE OTHER SIDE.  YOU SETTLE FOR VAGUE PLATITUDES, AND THEN YOU GO ON TV AND SAY  THIS IS THE BEST DEAL EVER.  LET'S LOOK AT THE CONCESSIONS. THE PRESIDENT HAS REFERRED TO  OUR MILITARY EXERCISES AS  PROVOCATIVE AND INDICATED THEY   WILL BE SCALED BACK OR   ELIMINATED.  HE HAS GIVEN THE GREEN LIGHT TO  CHINESE BUSINESS AND BANKERS TO  DO BUSINESS. HE HAS GIVEN KIM JONG-UN THE   PRESTIGE OF A MEETING WITH THE   PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,  NOT NECESSARILY OUR MOST   PRESTIGIOUS PRESIDENT, BUT A   PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES   NEVERTHELESS.  WHAT HAVE WE RECEIVED IN RETURN? A VAGUE STATEMENT ABOUT  DENUCLEARIZING THE KOREAN  PENINSULA, BUT, AS FAR AS WE   KNOW, NORTH KOREA DOESN'T INTEND TO DO THAT UNTIL THE ENTIRE  WORLD IS DENUCLEARIZED.  AND HE'S RELEASED THREE AMERICAN HOSTAGES AND SAYS HE'LL HELP US, ALLOW US TO FIND SOME OF THE   BODIES OF OUR FALLEN HEROES FROM THE KOREAN WAR.  THOSE ARE BASIC, HUMAN   CIVILIZATION.  HE RELEASES HOSTAGES.  AND FOR THAT WE GIVE MAJOR   CONCESSIONS. NOW THE ONE CONCESSION WE DID  NOT GET IS A HALT FOR EVEN A   MINUTE IN THE CREATION OF  FISSILE MATERIAL.  THERE, NORTH KOREA THROUGHOUT  THE NEGOTIATIONS AND WHILE THE   PRESIDENT WAS TWEETING MAKES   MORE ENRICHED URANIUM, MORE  PLUTONIUM, AND BUILDING MORE   BOMBS. THAT DIDN'T STOP FOR A MINUTE. SO WE'RE TOLD THAT THERE HAS   BEEN AT LEAST A PAUSE IN THEIR   TESTING PROGRAM. KEEP IN MIND, RUSSIA HASN'T TEST ADD A NUCLEAR WEAPON SINCE 12990 -- 1990. ARE WE GOING TO SAY THAT THEY  DON'T HAVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS   CAPABLE OF REACHING THE UNITED   STATES AND DESTROYING OUR  CITIES?  THE FACT IS NORTH KOREA HAS  PROVEN ITS NUCLEAR CAPACITY. SO THEY CAN GO A WHILE WITHOUT   TESTING. THEY ARE CONTINUING TO MAKE MORE BOMBS THAT THEY HAVE ALREADY   TESTED AND PROVEN. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE   GENTLEMAN'S TIME HAS EXPIRED.  MR. SHERMAN: WE ALL HOPE WE  REACH A PEACEFU

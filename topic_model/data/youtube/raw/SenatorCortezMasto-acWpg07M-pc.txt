hello everyone it's senator Katherine Cortez Masto in Nevada summer is a time for picnics and barbecues with family hiking playing sports and traveling it's also time when we must take care to protect our communities and guard against the threat of wildfires our brave firefighters are doing all they can to mitigate the risk of fire dangers and each of us can do our part as well did you know that in 2017 52 percent of fires in Nevada were caused by people that's why I am partnering with local fire departments across the state of Nevada including the Reno Fire Department and Truckee Meadows fire protection district to help get the word out on how we can stop fires before they start please remember not to throw cigarettes or matches on the ground or out of vehicle windows be mindful when operating equipment outdoors that can create heat or sparks only target shoot in areas designated as a shooting range when you're out at those family events enjoying your time together please be mindful of barbecues fire pits and campfires keep a defensible space clearance of at least 10 feet from fire prone things like dry grass and make sure fires or coals are always attended and fully extinguished prior to leaving be sure to have an extinguisher or water available just in case keep an eye on the weather before you go out check for high winds or red flag days before creating an outdoor fire of any type and remember to remove dead vegetation such as trees bushes and pine needles from around your property this includes in rain gutters and on roofs remember that embers can travel as far distance so a fire can ignite even if not close by you can find more information on how to prevent fires and protect your family's property and communities at Washoe County US under the Health and Safety tab on the website and if at any time during the fire season you see something that you think might be a fire be sure to dial nine-one-one to second this fire season is just beginning and it comes at drought levels in the West that are at their highest in more than four years I'm doing all I can in Congress to make sure our brave firefighters have all the support and resources they need and I know we can count on you to help us prevent wildfires thank you and enjoy your summer

let's bring in congresswoman nicole meliotarkis republican yeah we found one a republican from new york congresswoman last year the mta got 10 billion dollars from the cobit relief package they got all that money and they couldn't get their security cameras to work at those subway stations what's your response to that well we have serious questions as to why they weren't working is this a widespread problem and it needs to be fixed immediately the fact that the nypd is having difficulty catching this perpetrator is a true testament to the lack of leadership we have at the city and the state level for the last few years our leadership in new york has hindered the nypd they have made it more difficult for them to do their jobs and the fact that security cameras are not working in our subways is just part of the problem the real issue is is that look under democrat leadership the reality is they've attracted crime to our city we talk about this regularly and i'm so frustrated because i want my constituents i want my family to be able to travel around this city be able to go to work be able to go to school without being attacked this may be the most high profile incident that we're seeing but the reality is that people are being shoved in front of trains they're being assaulted they're being robbed in stations there's been a 65 percent increase in transit crimes over this last year and think about this half the ridership right now than it was pre-covered so if we want to get this economy back we want to get our city back we need to be serious about giving the police the tools that they need stop taking away their tools and stop making it more difficult for them to do their job well the mayor of new york eric adams he's blaming the subway shooting on guns just watch this please roll tape we removed 1800 guns off our streets in this city just think about that in the last three and a half months and they keep coming and so if we don't damn all the rivers that are causing this flow of violence in all the big cities across america uh we have a real crisis on our hands okay uh crime in new york city subways has spiked more than 68 in the last year congresswoman who do you blame for subway violence is it just guns what is it well i mean certainly go after illegal guns i support that but what about the people who are being stabbed and raped and robbed and the cars that are being stolen off our streets what about the people that are being assaulted you know it's not just the guns it is the fact that we are allowing bad people to remain on our streets the policies that have been put in place by democrats and i'm going to be very clear and i want to politicize this but it's a fact the democrats have changed the laws in our city and our state to release bad people back onto the streets the prosecutors don't want to prosecute you have left-wing judges appointed by our mayors that keep releasing people even when the prosecutors beg for bail and then you have a parole board appointed by the governor that continues to release cop killers and convicted murderers and rapists i mean her own lieutenant governor was part of the defund the police movement and now it was arrested yesterday so we have to start being careful about who we're putting in place in leadership positions and if we want public safety we need elected officials they're going to support public safety period end of story i mean don't keep voting for the same people that are putting these policies in place okay that's the last word and we'll take it uh congresswoman mario tarkis thank you very much for being here always appreciate it thank you market still

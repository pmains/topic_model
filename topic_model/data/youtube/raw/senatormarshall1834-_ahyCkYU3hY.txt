janitor uh senator roger marshall of the beautiful state of kansas i believe the home of amc by the way the beneficiary of all this crazy trading joins us um senator very good to have you what do you think of this do you think something should be done well neil thanks for having me and good morning from kansas city home of the defending super bowl champions kansas city chiefs and neil would how many people would watch the super bowl if we change the rules at half time and that's what i feel like a lot of investors feel like that that everyone deserves equal opportunity to make money on wall street whether you live in small town usa or a big city whether you work on main street or wall street we want an equal shot at this we don't want to overreact i don't think we need a bunch of new rules let's uh get some folks in front of us and listen to what actually happened but mostly we want a level playing field we want equal access to the markets and robin hood you know their their mission was great it was to give everyday people like myself and folks across the country the opportunity to buy stocks online at a cheap price without having to pay larger commissions so we got to be careful here not overreact but let's take a dive and see why did they pull the rug out from undress all right um they say they were inundated others suspect that um you know it's just a lot of people interested in making a quick buck and they're gonna get burnt on this senator leon cooperman of course the big hedge fund another uh gazillionaire was talking about this and saying that uh the no fee stock trading uh world and the non-professional investors that it attracts is a loser game played by people who don't have any idea what they're doing if that is the case that's his opinion just his opinion um do people have the right to learn the hard way or does the government have to protect them from making stupid calls just as the government has no obligation to protect those big institutions who are betting the opposite direction from losing their money hand over fist and a lot of them did and a lot of them are right right neil certainly i'm not a financial advisor i'm a physician as you know and i would caution anybody from a fred flintstone get rich quick scheme right but but we do do have the right to have some hard knocks and to go through some losses as well we want an even even playing field some of those comments are almost insulting right now there's millions of people out of work they're at home and with technology we can gather more information much easier than we used to now i'm not a day trader and i wouldn't recommend it for anybody but i do think that there's opportunities out there and especially with kovac going on some of these companies have have lost their market and their ability to to make money because of cobin now with the vaccines coming in line i think we could reach hurt immunity by april if the president and our governors do their jobs if that happens some of these companies that have been depreciating will start appreciating again all right we'll see if it spreads and what she's going to do or wants to do or should do on that very issue uh senator roger marshall thank you very much fair balance we're going to get the read from senator ben card not specifically on

joining me now is senator tim kaine democrat of virginia senator you have said that the u.s should do everything it can to bring russian president vladimir putin up on war crime charges at the international criminal court your remarks come as the u.s and its allies are pressing for an investigation into allegations that russian troops killed ukrainian civilians in towns that they seized why is it important for these charges to be brought against putin now will war crime charges be enough to deter putin reverend sharpton thanks for having on the last question you asked i don't know i don't think putin can be shamed but i think it might be possible to shame the russian citizenry and populous having a war crime committing president being a pariah nation because of these war crimes so shortly after the invasion began february 24th it was clear to me that there's indiscriminate targeting of civilians and i urge the icc to begin a war crimes investigation which they did before february was even over there but but the more recent atrocities revealed in bucha and elsewhere uh the attack on a train station that was purely designed to go after people who were fleeing for refuge classic definition of war crimes i agreed with the reporter in the earlier segment stating that ukrainians aren't a real people and ukraine isn't a real nation that that starts to get into the genocide territory so we need to do all we can to press it russia and the security council might veto it but in the general assembly of the united nations i think we would have strong support for this now overnight uh president zielinski issued a warning to european leaders that if russian invasion into ukraine is not stopped all european democracies are also under threat from russia this comes after a new report by the associated press that reveals intelligence officials of predicting putin may interfere in our elections again in retaliation for the u.s support of ukraine how concerned are you about russian and uh interference in russian threats um reverend sharpton i'm i'm concerned but we've been on this for a while the u.s helped not only ukraine but other nations um in eastern europe prep to to to defend the cyber attacks we knew they would be coming and we've been successful at that we did a very good job after after falling really short in the 2016 election and i was personally connected to that u.s failure in the 2018 elections there was russian efforts to interfere and we blocked them um so we know a lot about what they do and how they do it and i am confident that we will prepare strongly to defend our elections in november um everybody should watch this watch the french elections because as you know there's a there was a a first level french election this weekend with a runoff in june and you will likely see russia try to interfere with those elections to try to defeat president isn't one of the candidates le pen that's running against macron sympathetic to putin putin and the russians would likely look at her as a far preferable choice to president macron who has tried to stand up against russian aggression and be a bit of a peacemaker and so we need to watch what russia does in france and and then expect that they'll try to do the same thing in the us likely uh opposing you know democrats frankly they're they're going against anybody who uh is is on joe biden's team and do anything they can to impose chaos obviously we've got congressional republicans not all but some who are still carrying vladimir putin's water forum voting against for example a resolution praising nato in the house just about 10 days ago so we need to be very very diligent but u.s cyber command and other dhs agencies are prepping to protect our elections this november and if le pen defeats president macron in france that would be perceived as a victory for putin but but let me raise this question there's a growing debate over the future of title 42 which is a trump-era policy used to turn away people at the border due to covet concerns several democrats have joined republicans to go against the biden administration's efforts to repeal it uh and the law in in in may is uh uh what they're trying to appeal this this bipartisan push wants to put a new policy in place to prevent a potential surge of border crossings you support repealing title 42 but are you worried about the timing considering the midterms are just around the corner reverend sharpton i actually i am worried about the timing but for a different reason we need to get rid of title 42. it's a temporary measure that was blocking people's ability to seek normal processing for their asylum claims the timing i'm worried about is when is the right time to drop title 42. i think the good news is there's a consensus we need to drop it we just need to drop it when the public health emergency is over so here's here's the issue the biden administration has said it should be dropped on may 23rd the biden administration separately has also said new asylum procedures will be put in place on may 31. so there's some kind of questions about timing like which should come first is the covet emergency really over as we're seeking a new covenant aid package we have to kind of dig into the timing questions and let science dictate the answer but title 42 needs to finish but it needs to finish when we feel like we know where the code arc is going it's generally positive but there's some warning signs out there so we're going to have this discussion in the senate in the in the weeks to come because title 42 was based on health not based on immigration policy uh let me go to this this week justice designate uh katanji brown-jackson was confirmed thursday's 53-47 vote represented the culmination of a six-week process that was sometimes heated but in the end some republicans did cross party lines and vote for her historic confirmation after all of this do you feel better or worse about the way the senate handles supreme court nominees there was only three republicans went with her with the most impeccable credentials one could imagine reverend sharpton that you asked the question a good way i mean it was such a great day for the country to be in the chamber that day i've had so many people you know in the capitol and at my church this morning say what was it like to be in there during that vote um and you i spoke on her behalf and pointed out that when i started law school in the fall of 1979 the only woman justice at the supreme court was a white marble statue on the steps outside the building now to have four women uh two women of color on the court i mean what a what an exciting exciting uh bit of evidence that for everything we're frustrated about there is progress when we put our shoulders to the wheel so that makes me answer your question i feel better about the uh the senate even though the process was tough and even though she was put under you know kind of ridiculous cross-examination by people trying to make a name for themselves in a way that was kind of gross she stood strong showed the entire american public her character and credentials and she's going to be such a good addition to this body you you know you ran uh with hillary clinton in 2016 who also did her part to break many glass ceilings she was uh ironically at nash action network's convention with us in the women's luncheon when it was announced that uh judge jackson was con confirmed so the women and and those of men in that event uh with hillary clinton were ecstatic how how did you feel personally about this week's historic uh confirmation i mean how did you feel personally reverend sharpton i mean as you know i was a civil rights lawyer for 18 years before i got into politics in the capital the confederacy richmond virginia so i really felt excited uh to think that you know never been a woman on the supreme court when i started my practicing life as a lawyer and now four out of nine are women but i'll tell you where it really sunk in the day on the floor was fantastic the next morning i went to the health clinic at the capitol to get a booster shot and a young woman who was giving me the booster when when we were done and i was rolling my sleeve down we were in a little office she said senator can i ask you a question with a kind of a quiet voice and i wondered well like what's up and i said sure and she said what was it like to be in the chamber when you created from judge katanji brown jackson justice jackson it was a young african-american woman who was really moved who had watched it on tv but she wanted me to describe what it was to be there in person and it made me realize sometimes those of us who do the work even at historic moment we can kind of take it for granted because we do it what it has meant to people outside the capitol has really really touched me no it was one of those moments that you'll never forget uh thank you senator tim kaine for joining me

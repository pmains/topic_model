thank you chairwoman napolitano and ranking member rouser appreciate the time this afternoon and i appreciate all of our witnesses being here today and especially you ms labeouf with uh noah i'm speaking to you today from historic charleston's historic battery right here in downtown charleston and also behind me right on the water and actually a little bit further behind me uh we began that way is uh the south carolina department of natural resources where noah also has a lab and works with our department here um and while we're not always going to see eye to eye on funding priorities i know there are some areas where i think we can join together and work together with all of my colleagues here today and i want to echo how important the work that noah does your organization in regards to flooding which is why i'm standing in downtown charleston this afternoon 40 years ago flooding in charleston where i'm standing today averaged about two times a year today in 2021 40 years later we're seeing over 40 flood incidences of flooding every single year and it is predicted um by 2045 our city is predicted to be hit by coastal flooding up to 180 times per year additionally our region has been hit by several major flooding events over the years including the thousand-year flood which was the next in october of 2015. hurricane matthew in 2016 hurricane irma in 2017 and just last week we had a mere tropical storm which caused tremendous flooding throughout our great city the holy city of charleston the original sea level rise a strategy adopted in 2015 was aided by technical mapping assistance by the regional coastal resilience grant from noaa's office for coastal management the grant was awarded to the south carolina sea grant consortium on behalf of the charleston resilience network i've worked with the office of coastal resilience and have been out to the noaa facility here in charleston i've seen the important work that noah and your office is doing with the digital coast mapping software something it was very important to me as a state lawmaker and even more important now as a member of congress today we're working we're learning quickly learning that five-year 10-year and further out flood plans are constantly evolving because this issue is rapidly changing literally on a year-to-year basis and i look forward to hearing from you on how the administration in your office plans to account for the budgeting needs of cities like charleston south carolina that are facing ever-growing ever-changing flooding issues i also want to add that as i'm sure you know the city of charleston is working closely with the army corps of engineers to propose sea wall construction and which engineers believe they can save the city from long-term impacts of storm surges until and through 2082. we're all eagerly awaiting the course final report to be released and signed we're hoping will be next month i hope you'll be able to speak to your office's coordinating status strategies also with the army corps of engineers um again i appreciate your time today i see your office and know as a critical as critical for the needs of charleston of south carolina our first congressional district in the entire state of south carolina and i would like to invite you down here any time to come and visit so with the few moments that we have left on my my time on the floor i certainly would love to hear from you ms labeouf on on noah and what we could do to help charleston our flooding situation here today thank you congresswoman mace and charleston is absolutely one of my favorite places in the country and i share your concern about rising sea levels in fact later today i will be speaking at a media event to release our high tide flooding report for this year in my home state of texas for example we either tied or broke several records from galveston to corpus christi of more than 20 days of high tide flooding per year just 20 years ago that was two to three days per year and you're absolutely right in charleston in pensacola we saw more than 14 days of high tide flooding where just 20 years ago it was one to two days and so absolutely we are facing some big challenges and i i really appreciate you bringing those up we do work closely with the army corps of engineers and advise them with regard to sea level rise and inundation risks and projections we also work closely with the army corps on engineering with nature which is a program that they lead to better understand the value of nature-based infrastructure to protect our coastlines and to provide critical habitat for commercially and recreationally viable species with regard to this budget we are very keen to make sure that we have the water level sensors in place that we have high performance computing to be able to predict sea level rise and storm surge risks for all of our coastal communities for the first time in human history we must plan infrastructure for conditions that we've not yet seen we've never had to do that before and so it is essential that noaa's predictive capabilities and our observations be put to the task and work with other federal agencies to make sure that our communities are safe and that our federal agencies are able to complete their missions with climate change in mind so thank you so much i will absolutely take you up on your offer to come to charleston it's been too long

she came up with an idea for a new independent agency that would have one simple overriding mission standing up for consumers and middle-class families so there i was standing next to president obama thinking we're really going to do this we are going to change the world for millions and millions of people it was amazing [Music] this is an idea that i got from elizabeth warren she's become perhaps the leading voice in our country on behalf of consumers and let's face it she's she's done it while facing some very tough opposition elizabeth warren is heading into the lion's den elizabeth warren apparently not afraid to tangle with wall street she goes off and ticks off a lot of republicans no fans of a consumer protection agency they deem unnecessary by insisting sorry very much necessary so why were the giant banks and the republicans against it well they wanted to keep getting away with their tricks and traps let's be clear the 2008 financial crisis was a toxic mix of racism corruption and shameless greed and then after the crash wall street had the goal not only to take taxpayer handouts but then to double down spending a million dollars a day to try to kill the cfpb but we fought back consumer activists pushing from the outside and president obama and vice president biden pressuring from the top passing this bill was no easy task to get there we had to overcome the furious lobby of an array of powerful interest groups and a partisan minority determined to block change [Music] [Applause] since president obama signed it into law the consumer financial protection bureau has already forced financial institutions to return more than 12 billion dollars directly to people they cheated so there's 12 billion ways that this little government agency has helped people even years after president obama signed the cfpb into law republicans still are trying to kill it president trump and its acting director have charted a dramatically different course for the bureau mick mulvaney acting director of the consumer financial protection bureau requests no money for the agency it turns up being a joke and that's what the cfpb really has the trump administration's director of the cfpb kathleen krenninger has no experience in consumer protection we need to get a president back in office who believes in consumer protection we are now in the midst of a global pandemic and staring down another economic crisis a strong cfpb is going to be more important than ever to make sure that big financial institutions don't use this moment to boost their profits by taking advantage of people who are struggling as president joe biden will make sure the cfpb can do its job he will make sure that this agency can pick up its tools and go after greedy companies companies that target veterans students communities of color everyone who's using credit one of the many many reasons we need to defeat donald trump and elect joe biden is to have a strong consumer financial protection bureau that's on the side of the american people you

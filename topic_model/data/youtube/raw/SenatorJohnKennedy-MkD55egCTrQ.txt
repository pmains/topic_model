look i uh i don't have to tell you that opioid deaths in louisiana have increased over the last 18 months and they were bad before then too and you know it just breaks my heart one of the ways we can fight this crisis is by giving communities a safe way to get the opioids off the street the purpose of course is so fewer people have the chance to start or feed an opioid addiction toward that end i introduced a bill it's called the dump opioids act to make it possible for everyone to get rid of the prescription medications they they no longer need and uh by dropping them off into secure drop boxes at their local va centers the u.s senate passed the bill unanimously the house passed the bill unanimously on monday and now i understand from the white house that president biden has agreed to sign this bill which i think is a very common sense compassionate bill and he's going to sign it very soon the opioid crisis uh and you know this is it's hit families in louisiana and around the country and it hits us every day and i really believe the dump opioids act um is gonna give everyone an easy way to make our community safer and hopefully healthier

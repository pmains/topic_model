Thank You ranking member and chair for this committee and welcome chairman Pao it's good to see you again so I want to follow up on a conversation that you had with one of my colleagues senator Shelby on the policy effectiveness and asset unit that you have created can you speak to how many people will work in the unit and how the importance of data will inform the decisions you make you know I think it's five or six people now I don't know how big it will be but it's gonna be something in that range maybe a little bigger but the idea is that we'll have you know a strong quantitative approach that's tightly focused on cost-benefit analysis I would stress we already do cost-benefit analysis and everything we do but we we hear outside that there's an interest in doing more of that and we're actively pursuing it and and the reason why you're doing this is so that it can inform and your enforcement and policies decisions correct well yes and and the calibration of our of our regulations we you know we want to be able to implement regulations in the least burdensome way we can consistent with you know safety and soundness and the data is key for you rear ability to do so correct very much so yeah and so I'm glad you hear you speak about the importance of data collection I always support that and it is critical to the work of the Federal Reserve as I'm sure you're aware the legislation that we've been talking about that's pending in the Senate it would exempt 85% of depository institution institutions from full reporting of loan data under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act can you speak to how this might impact the ability of the Federal Reserve to properly conduct its obligations under the Community Reinvestment Act and whether the loss of this data might hinder CRA Supervisory exams I'll be glad to so as I understand it CFPB writes the HMDA rules and regulations and and we use that data in in what we do in supervising the banks we supervise which is a smaller group in addition to that we sorry lost my train of thought we what dodd-frank did was that it it took the base of historical data collection and it significantly increased that so my understanding is that what's being looked at in a bill is to is to create a broader exemption for just from the dodd-frank conditions and so we you know I think we we traditionally get almost everything we need from the historical data and I think we can continue to work on that basis right and that's my concern is the more data the better I mean you're creating a data unit because data is key to your decision-making and my understanding is that the data that's used in the CRA supervisory exams seems to exclude relevant data points loans under 1 million are designated small business loans even if they were not loans administered to small businesses there's no analysis has made whatsoever of whether lending is occurring in communities of color despite easy and accessible data via the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and so my question is has the Fed considered broadening that criteria and it's CRA supervisory exams and what factors do you think would be helpful in determining whether small businesses communities of color and low-income areas are truly receiving the support that the law intended are we still talking about HMDA data right so again at home did data is is really an issue for the CFPB they they hum that they were given authority under dodd-frank to write the HMDA regulations and and we generally defer to them in terms of what their view is on that so you don't think that data is gonna be informative and what you do with the community investment react Reinvestment Act and the oversight of that to ensure that that act is being enforced under the law to protect communities of color to make sure there's no discrimination to make sure that the loans are being sent to small businesses and ensure that the money gets where it needs to go that data is not going to be helpful for you I don't say that it wouldn't be helpful but what I would say is that first of all that that's an issue that the CFPB actually has has the lead authority on in addition we will still have my understanding is it will still have under this bill the the the information that we've traditionally relied upon for just about everything we do under HMDA so we may not have the additional data from some from some institutions but we think we'll be able to function well let me just tell you and my time is running out so I don't have enough time to answer ask the additional questions that I want to ask you but let me just say this as a former Attorney General in the state of Nevada my concern was discrimination against certain communities of color inland and the reason why we increased that data criteria is to ensure there was no discrimination and ensure that the money was going to where it was supposed to be going under the Act and federal authorities and so I don't understand while we're rolling back that data and those data criteria if we need if you've said it yourself to be better informed you're creating a data and a unit to for analytical purposes to create and collect data I mean it informs us and everything we do and so my concern is just that how can we say we don't want the data when we know it informs every decision that we're making particularly to ensure the money's going where it's going and there's no discrimination we've been talking about debt and let me take a step back and say that any kind of discrimination by race or gender or any other unfair basis in lending is completely unacceptable and we are committed as an institution to finding it and and using all of our tools to stop it thank you I know my time is right now thank you very much

i'm congresswoman betty mccollum it's a great honor and responsibility to serve our country as a member of congress representing the people of minnesota's 4th congressional district today i wanted to speak with you directly to you my constituents as we mark the one year anniversary the january 6 2021 attack on the united states capitol one year ago i was in the capitol as it was being attacked i was with a new member of my staff her second day on the job and we were trapped in the tunnel system under the capitol fortunately for us we were able to find refuge in senator tina smith's office where we spent hours of uncertainty with a very kind member of senator smith's staff only footsteps away from us a violent mob of insurrectionists inspired and directed by former president donald trump attacked the united states capitol police invaded and defiled our most sacred spaces in our nation's capital and this was all done in an attempt to prevent congress from fulfilling its duty to certify the electoral college results declaring joe biden the president of the united states this attack was an attempted coup and it did not happen spontaneously but it was designed to keep donald trump in the white house and overturn a legitimate free and fair outcome of the 2020 presidential election today we can reflect on that day but the truth is that the insurrection against our most fundamental american democratic principles is ongoing and gaining strength our country's democracy is in danger we are now faced with a republican party that is advancing an authoritarian political agenda focused on disfranchising voters particularly for people of color and sabotaging voting rights across the country the root of this authoritarian movement is donald trump's big lie that he won the presidential election this big lie is now the platform of the republican party and it's at the root of the anti-democratic violent extremist behavior that threatens our democracy we can see examples over the past year of civil discord that's deteriorating and eroding our democracy gun-toting mobs and state capitals to intimidate lawmakers violent outbursts at school board meetings and now there's even metal detectors that prevent members of congress from bringing guns onto the house chamber after the house of representatives concludes our investigation into the events surrounding the january 6th i strongly believe that all individuals responsible for planning and citing and in carrying out the january 6 attack against congress must be indicted prosecuted and if found guilty sentenced to prison terms this includes the former president donald trump and senior officials in the trump administration january 6 was not a singular event it's an insurrection that is ongoing in more than 40 states efforts have been made to suppress the right to vote often targeting communities of color some states have even succeeded as americans as minnesotans we must remain vigilant we must fight the misinformation and the lies that are being used as political weapons to sow division and discord in our country as citizens of this great country the burden to save our democracy falls on all of us as a united states representative i take an oath of office and i pledge to you that i will live up to the duty and responsibility associated with that oath every day i serve you in congress i will work to protect and defend the constitution from enemies both foreign and domestic the challenges our democracy faces are real and we must stand together as americans to keep our country free and strong and a land where truth and justice are defended thank you

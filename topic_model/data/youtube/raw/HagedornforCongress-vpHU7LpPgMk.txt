President Obama has submitted another plan to close the Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba and bring the Islamic terrorists into the United States you wonder who could be for such a silly politically correct idea well none other than soft on terrorism himself congressman Tim Walz congressman Walz has voted repeatedly on the House floor to close Guantanamo and he's so off base and out of touch that when asked worthy prisoners the Islamic terrorists would be housed in the United States he said it would be okay if they were put in the Rochester federal medical facility can you believe that a United States congressman inviting the terrorists into his district you know we don't need Quilly Jake Mohammed the mastermind of 911 two miles from the Mayo Clinic I don't know who the congressman thinks it's going to come visit characters like that but it isn't going to be Billy Graham in the Pope Tim Walz is completely wrong on this issue the Islamic terrorists from Guantanamo Bay don't deserve Miranda rights they deserve the last rites and it's time to elect a congressman who will go to Washington and defend this country and protect you from Islamic terrorism I'm Jim Hagedorn thanks for watching

good morning miss Connors look tomorrow welcome to in addition the blame bus thank you for joining us this week just want to give you a little bit of an update with regards to the fiscal cliff debate and situation that we have going on here in Washington right now as of today which is November 30th there hasn't been a whole lot of progress as you been following the news is probably well known you know we have a debate over whether to raise taxes or not to raise taxes and how much to cut if we can get it cut and there seems to be a stalemate at this point with regards to the Democrats believe they would need to raise tax rates the Republicans are willing to raise revenues by closing loopholes and limiting deductions versus raising tax rates so there's some room wiggle room there for both sides ever haven't come to any sort of agreement at this point the guards are spending cuts the other part of this equation there seems to be a little willingness on the Democrat side to try and do anything on cuts the president continues to pound on Republicans through a campaign if you would that he's taken to the country with regards to tax rates forgetting about that the other parts equation are they spending cuts even if we go along with what he wants to do it only raises about eighty two billion dollars and that's not enough when you have a 1.1 trillion dollar deficit to even begin to close that hole so until there's some meaningful discussions that happen especially with the Democrats coming a table with some willingness to cut spending I'm not sure where we get very far on this and that means that sequestration cuts will hit the year here as well we have in the house passed a bill that would eliminate the defense portion of that with some other cuts that we found in the budget and not impact our Defense Department to the tune of half of three dollars but at this point it looks like that's going to happen the employment tax which is two percent employment tax looks like that's going to go back up it's been a two-year window of allowing it to be two percent less than what it has been and with all that being said we still have a debt situation that this ceiling has to be raised to pray februari and if that comes about there's also going to be the discussion of Speaker Boehner has been very plain about this and if we raise the debt ceiling you have to have one dollars worth of cuts for every dollar worth of injuries that we allow the bit to go web so there's a lot of debate that's going to continue a lot of discussions are going to have to be taking place between now and and remember all these things happens stay tuned any questions don't hesitate to give our office a call there's a lot of things going on right now we're going to affect each of you individually in some particular way so don't hesitate to give us a call look forward to working with you and hearing from you take care see you next week

first it was congestion pricing facing us and now we find out that law and railroad is facing not only a rate increase but they're going to be paying for you know the discounts of city residents once again you know we were told by our alleged representatives in Albany particularly the Senate delegation they were going to stand up for commuters well it's not happening yesterday was revealed by the MTA that a plant that is going to subsidize and give discounts of greater amounts to city residents while at the same time have Long Island Railroad commuters face a four percent rate increase in 2021 is unacceptable and we are standing here for the commuters with the commuters and saying we need our representatives in Albany to do what's right and actually represent the interests of all the Long Islanders instead of simply looking at Long Islanders and the hard-working women who men who take this train as basically a pocketbook or a wallet to pay for the city residents our officials in Albany and officials in New York City have been taking advantage of the residents of the Town of Hempstead for far too long and now they're just trying to heap more costs on our hard-working families here in the Town of Hempstead a town of hempstead resident under this new plan who lives in Valley Stream and takes the loyal and railroad each and every day to work will pay under this new plan 270 dollars for their monthly wear another resident who lives in Rosedale about a mile away will pay almost $100 less another back to our tax basically it's a commuter tax congestion pricing is now costing the residents to the town of hempstead more muddy drive into Manhattan they're forcing onto public transportation to Long Island Railroad our only form of public transportation and they're raising taxes in the Long Island Railroad you're paying more to drive into Manhattan you're paying more to take the railroad while city residents are getting a discount it's not fair how are we supposed to go to work every day Albany is jumping off the deep end once again they've already made our streets less safe here in Nassau County with their pain criminal justice reform and now they're hitting us in the wallets in the pocketbooks no we have no train stations in Levittown or in East Meadow but I tell you what how people do use the way elbow to go to the city and this is this is a travesty how can they charge us more money than the people in the city everybody should be treated fair and I saw what I asking well the Town of Hempstead is a sand be treated fairly the residents deserve strong leadership in Albany they deserve voices and not just voices that centralize the five boroughs they deserve voices that represent the hard-working women and men who commute to the city and that is what is happening in here we have lost our voices and we are calling on our Senate delegation to stand up and do what's right the residents are tired of this the commuters are definitely tired of this and frankly we're all in unison saying we want and we deserve the leadership in Albany we deserve to have the voices heard and frankly for the highest-paying taxpayers in New York State in both Nassau and Suffolk that Senate delegation better do what's right hold the MTA accountable for and tell them to stop picking the pockets of Long Islanders and funding the special interest of New York City

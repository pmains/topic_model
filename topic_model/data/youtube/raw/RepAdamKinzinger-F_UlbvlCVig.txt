T OF OUR NATION ABOVE OUR PARTY. >> LET'S BRING THE CONGRESSMAN  IN RIGHT NOW. CONGRESSMAN KINZINGER, VERY GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. WE'LL LET YOU TALK TO OTHER  PEOPLE ABOUT YOUR PAST. I'M CURIOUS ABOUT YOUR FUTURE. UP HAVE STEADFASTLY SUPPORTED A  NO-FLY ZONE. OBVIOUSLY MANY PEOPLE SAY THAT  WOULD BE A TRIGGER FOR WAR. I'M WONDERING, DO YOU STILL  SUPPORT THAT NO-FLY ZONE? AND IF THE UNITED STATES CAN'T  GO THAT FAR, WHAT'S THE NEXT  BEST THING FOR US TO DO? >> WELL, HEY, GUYS. I DO SUPPORT IT. I WANT TO BE CLEAR, EVERY DAY  THAT GOES BY IT BECOMES A MORE  DIFFICULT THING TO DO AS MORE  RUSSIAN ARTILLERY COMES IN. RUSSIA IS THE ONE -- LET'S BE  CLEAR. THEY'RE THE ONES ESCALATING THIS FIGHT. IT'S NOT THE UNITED STATES. I KNOW WE'RE IN FEAR THAT  ANYTHING WE DO WILL BE SEEN AS    ESCALATORY. AND I THINK ANTI-SHIP MISSILE  SYSTEMS, THIS IS SOMETHING I  DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY UKRAINE  DOESN'T HAVE AS RUSSIA SHUTS  DOWN THE BLACK SEA. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO  CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THOSE  WEAPONS, TRAINING TO THE EXTENT  WE CAN, PARTICULARLY IN WESTERN  UKRAINE AND ROMANIA. AND I THINK THE THING THAT WE  COULD DO THAT WOULD ACTUALLY DO  THE MOST STUFF RIGHT NOW WOULD  BE TO QUIT SAYING WHAT WE WILL  NOT DO. IF YOU HAVE NO INTENTION OF  PUTTING TROOPS ON THE GROUND IN  UKRAINE, FINE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY IT EVERY  TEN MINUTES BECAUSE ALL THAT  DOES IS GIVE VLADIMIR PUTIN A  TARGET HE CAN WALK UP TO. >> AGAIN, I UNDERSTAND WHY JOE  BIDEN HAS DONE IT OVER THE PAST  THREE WEEKS BECAUSE, AGAIN, HE  HAD A RELUCTANT AMERICAN PUBLIC  AND A RELUCTANT ALLIES IN  EUROPE. THAT'S NOT THE CASE ANYMORE. WE DON'T HAVE TO KEEP TELLING  PUTIN WHAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO  DO. IT WORKS -- THE FIRST PHASE OF  THE WAR WENT REALLY WELL. WE'RE NOW IN A NEW PHASE. >> HE DID HAVE TO EXPLAIN OUR  POSITION. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE WONDERING  WHY CAN'T WE STOP THIS SLAUGHTER THAT WE'RE WATCHINGMEDIA? I MEAN, IT IS REALLY A VERY  VISCERAL EXPERIENCE FOR THE  AMERICAN PEOPLE, THIS WAR WITH  UKRAINE. CONGRESSMAN, WHAT OFFENSE DO YOU ENVISION THAT WOULDN'T HAVE US  GOING TOE TO TOE WITH PUTIN? ARE THERE ANY? >> YEAH, LOOK, IF THIS CONTINUES TO ESCALATE AGAIN, YOU KNOW, I  THINK IT'S CLEAR THAT IF RUSSIA  DECIDES TO ATTACK THESE AID  CONVOYS, THAT WOULD BE PRETTY  MUCH AN ATTACK ON NATO, AN  ARTICLE 5 POINT. >> RIGHT. >> SO WE HAVE TO BE VERY CLEAR  THAT THIS MAY LEAD TO  ESCALATION, BUT ALL THE FORMER  COLD WAR LAWYERS THAT ARE  ACADEMICS, RUSSIA IS NOT THE OLD SOVIET UNION. IN THE SOVIET UNION, WE COULD  NOT TANGO WITH THEM BECAUSE THEY WERE OUR MATCH AND WE WOULD  DESTROY EACH OTHER. I GET IT, RUSSIA HAS NUCLEAR  WEAPONS. I DON'T THINK RUSSIA INTENDS TO  DESTROY THE WORLD EITHER, SO  KEEP THAT IN MIND. BUT, AGAIN, UP TO THE POINT IT'S CONTINUING TO PROVIDE AID,  MEDIUM-RANGE MISSILE DEFENSE, I  THINK ANTI-SHIPPING WEAPONS, YOU KNOW, TRAINING, ET CETERA, TO  GIVE YOU KNOW WHAT THEY NEED TO  DEFEND THEIR TERRITORY WILL BE  IMPORTANT. SECONDARILY, QUICKLY, THERE ARE  RUSSIAN INTERESTS EVERYWHERE. RUSSIA IS IN SYRIA. RUSSIA IS OBVIOUSLY ALL OVER  SOUTH AMERICA. THEY'RE IN LIBYA. WHY ARE WE NOT EXPANDING A PROXY WAR AGAINST SOME OF THEIR  INTERESTS IN OTHER AREAS IF THEY INTEND TO, YOU KNOW, ATTACK OUR  ALLIES AS WELL? >> CONGRESSMAN, LET ME ASK YOU  THIS QUESTION. OF COURSE, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE LOOK AT MANY THINGS THAT DONALD TRUMP DID. I THINK ON THE FOREIGN POLICY  STAGE, ONE OF THE WORST THINGS  HE DID WAS TAKE OUR 2,500, 3,000 TROOPS OUT OF SYRIA THAT WERE  EFFECTIVELY HOLDING BACK  RUSSIANS, RAINIANS, THE TURKS,  THE SYRIANS, AND DESTROYING  ISIS. AND, IN FACT, THE ONE TIME  RUSSIAN MERCENARIES CAME AT US,  WE KILLED ABOUT 300 OF THEM IN  ABOUT FIVE MINUTES. WE WERE HELPING OUR KURDISH  ALLIES. WHEN I HEAR THE ANNOUNCEMENT  THAT SYRIANS ARE GOING TO COME  FIGHT IN UKRAINE, WHEN I SEE  STORIES ABOUT IRANIANS FIRING  MISSILES AT ISRAELI POSITIONS  WHERE AMERICANS ARE, WHY  WOULDN'T WE SEND THOSE 2,500  TROOPS THAT BELIEVE THEY WERE  DOING GREAT THINGS INSIDE OF  SYRIA, WHY DON'T WE SEND THEM  BACK TO SYRIA AND THEY CAN HELP  CREATE THAT SAFE ZONE INSTEAD OF DOING WHAT DONALD TRUMP DID? TALKING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP  TURNING OVER A MIDDLE EASTERN  COUNTRY TO RUSSIA FOR THE FIRST  TIME SINCE 1973. THAT WOULD BE US BEING  DISRUPTIVE, WOULDN'T IT? >> THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S HOW YOU HAVE TO THINK. WE'RE IN A MOMENT WHERE THERE'S  NO RISK-FREE CHOICES ANYMORE. YOU HAVE TO THINK OUTSIDE THE  BOX. YOU DON'T WANT TO DIRECTLY  CONFRONT RUSSIA, THERE'S A WAY  TO DO THAT. ALEXANDER VINDMAN HAS TALKED  ABOUT GIVING UNMANNED AERIAL  VEHICLES, THE TURKS HAVE DONE SO WELL, BUT DONALD TRUMP, I WAS IN THE OVAL OFFICE AND TOLD HIM,  MR. PRESIDENT, IF YOU PULL THESE TROOPS OUT OF SYRIA, YOU'LL LOSE A SEAT AT THE NEGOTIATING TABLE. HE TOLD ME, HE GOES, WHO CARES? WHO CARES ABOUT SYRIA? I WAS BLOWN AWAY. THAT'S WHAT -- PEOPLE THAT GO  AROUND AND SAY NONE OF THIS  WOULD HAPPEN UNDER DONALD TRUMP, IT IS A VERY CONVENIENT  FORGETTING OF HOW AWFUL HE WAS  AT FOREIGN POLICY AND HIS  COMPLETE LOVE TOWARDS  AUTHORITARIAN PEOPLE. LOOK, IF YOU THINK PRESIDENT  BIDEN IS BEING WEAK ON THIS, SAY IT. RIGHT? I THINK THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS HE'S CERTAINLY BEING WEAK ON. BUT LET'S NOT WHITEWASH WHO  DONALD TRUMP WAS. DONALD TRU

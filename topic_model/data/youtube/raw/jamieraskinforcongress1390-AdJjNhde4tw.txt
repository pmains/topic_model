hey everybody it's jamie raskin you know a year ago we almost lost our democracy think about what happened in three rings of activity at the outer ring there were tens of thousands of protesters who were brought to washington by donald trump with the promise of a wild protest and those protesters many of them became rioters 140 of our officers were wounded or injured with traumatic brain injuries suffering post-traumatic stress syndrome broken arms broken legs broken ribs broken jaws all of it the middle ring was the realm of the insurrection and here we would find the oath keepers the three percenters the proud boys the ku klux klan the area nations the militia groups the q anon networks many of them were training for that day many of them were engaged in paramilitary activity this became the vanguard front line of the protest and they were the ones that smashed our windows and led the violence against our police officers to get the riot going but that wasn't even the scariest ring of activity the scariest was the very inner ring donald trump steve bannon mark meadows the inner ring of the political plot against american democracy and there the whole determination was to overthrow joe biden's majority in electoral college and after trying to get state legislatures to set aside the popular vote and appoint electoral college slates for trump after trying to get state election officials like brad raffensberger in georgia just to find 11 781 votes after all of that failed then they determined that they were going to go after vice president mike pence this was a coup and the coup is a weird thing to think about in american political parlance because we don't have a lot of experience with coups and we usually think of a coup is something taking place against a president this was the coup organized by the president against the vice president of the united states to just get him to declare lawless powers to reject electoral college votes coming in from arizona georgia pennsylvania and if they could just get pence to do that and lower joe biden's total below 270 in the electoral college the whole contest would have been kicked into the house of representatives for a so-called contingent election under the 12th amendment now why you may ask did donald trump want to get the election turned over to nancy pelosi's house of representatives well under the 12th amendment we don't vote one member one vote we vote one state one vote and they ended up with 27 state delegations they controlled after the 2020 elections we had 22 and pennsylvania was split right down the middle even with liz cheney the at-large rep from wyoming not voting with them they still would have had a 26-state vote majority at that point they would have run it like the republican national convention declared that donald trump was the winner he was the new president and he probably would have invoked the insurrection act at that point which was what general michael flynn his uh disgraced former national security adviser was recommending that he do and at that point they would have sent in the national guard to disperse the protesters and to claim that it was donald trump who was restoring order to america those were the plans that they had in store for us those during those terrible dark days i'm doing everything in my power to try to surface the truth of what took place to get the evidence to the american people i'm hoping that this will be a year when we do get the evidence to the people in the meantime you can bet that i'm going to be fighting to defend ourselves against mass political violence against violent insurrection organized by the right-wing racist domestic violent extremist and i will be defending our democracy with everything i've got against donald trump and his cult-like followers who are doing everything they can to engage in voter suppression gerrymandering manipulation of the political system and the use of their court packing in order to thwart democracy in america we are the majority by far but we've got to make sure that the majority is heard and that we can defend our institutions against all of these ultra-right games being played by donald trump and his subordinates thank you for your support thank you for your solidarity thank you for your encouragement in this struggle

into order good morning and welcome to today's subcommittee subcommittee hearing I'd like to thank our panel of witnesses and our members for joining today's important discussion on apprenticeships an opportunity for us to grow our nation's workforce I'd especially like to welcome Miss Daisy Hughes a constituent of mine who lives not not even a mile away Zermatt who serves as the state chair of the Kentucky Federation for advanced manufacturing education or Kentucky Fame and mr. Robert arabe peg Lowe a student a Kentucky student participating in Kentucky fame I look forward to hearing from you and about how Kentucky is working to have young people get the skills they need to obtain good-paying jobs every day hardworking Americans search for a good-paying job that will lead them to a successful career many Americans find a pathway to a good-paying job through apprenticeship programs that provide real earn and learn opportunities that often turn into careers for workers apprenticeships are a chance for to prepare for today's high-skilled in-demand jobs alongside long-term time industry professionals in fact based on the National Household Education survey an estimated 2.1 million Americans participated in apprenticeships last year employers also see apprenticeships as an outlet to invest in work base learn learning programs that attract and help to retain highly qualified employees and many have seen the results in the form of increased productivity and greater innovation our hearing today we'll explore how apprenticeship style programs promote workforce development while also looking at federal programs that are need of improvement one aspect of apprenticeships were this committee sees room for improvement in order to help workers and employers is registered apprenticeships currently registered apprenticeships or programs officially registered with the Department of Labor's office apprenticeship or state office of apprenticeships the Department of Labor has issued regulations requiring that registered apprenticeships meet 26 specific requirements relating to program design DOL regulations also require that these programs adhere to Equal Employment Opportunity regulations that are specific to apprenticeships while the department continues to regulate the register apprenticeship program workers and businesses are not convinced this program is something that is best for workforce development in 2016 only two hundred six thousand individuals nationwide became apprentices through the registered apprenticeship program further less than half of the earning learn programmes choose to register their programs with the Department of Labor the registered apprenticeship program is yet another one-size-fits-all approach that works that works better for Washington than it does for businesses and students who wish to use apprenticeships as a way to grow our workforce rather than doubling down on the failed attempts of previous administrations to expand the registered apprenticeship program this committee is looking for a better way to build on the successful efforts businesses have found to grow their own apprenticeship programs outside of the registered apprenticeship program it should be noted that any effort to promote apprenticeship opportunities needs to provide employees and job creators with the flexibility to innovate and develop high-quality or in learn programs without the burdens of Washington overreach this has been the approach of the committee and our many efforts to strengthen workforce development this Congress and will continue to be our approach for the future today's hearing is part of the House Committee on education workforce ongoing efforts to strengthen our workforce for the future and it is even more important in the realm of apprenticeships now that the White House has taken note of the true success apprenticeship programs are having for workers and employers alike I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today on how they have been able to create their own innovative apprenticeship programs and how we can strengthen these efforts to help close the skills gap that exists in our country I now yield to the subcommittee's ranking member Susan Davis for her opening remarks

thank you thank you for the courtesy senator first Miss McDonald I I want to convey through you my compliments and thanks to the thousands of National Park Service personnel there they are the face of the parks and they are wonderful though everywhere I've been in the parks all over the country in the west and the east it's the people and their passion as well as the grandeur of the site that engages people and I saw my kids just light up when we were down at Kitty Hawk and and West at Bryce and Grand Canyon I mean so please convey that I think that's we can't lose sight of how important those people are I just want to make a point how excited I am about the pass program I can tell you exactly how long it takes we know some of you may have noticed I was typing away at the beginning of the hearing it takes almost exactly the length of a Steve Daines speech to download a park pass because that's what I did so I downloaded a park pass while the chairman was making his introduction and it's a pass to Acadia and I guess obligated to go up there this weekend because I paid for it but I do have one minor technical nitpick when you finish the process you get the the bar code and the pass you ought to have a button that says add to Apple Wallet or add to wallet so it just touches and it goes because then otherwise you have to put it in your photos and remember where it is it's just that's just one little extra technical step that I think would make it handier again using the model of the of the airplane passes I just I think the senator o'mara legs and raises a really serious question about how do we how do we make it accessible and engaging this experience while at the same time harming or diminishing the experience the same thing goes with our very popular national where there's so many people that that in itself diminishes the experience we have to think about how to promote parks in off times of the year parts of the park that may be less well known so everybody at Acadia doesn't go to the top of Cadillac Mountain on the same day and for example at the Grand Canyon everybody doesn't go to the South Rim perhaps we can find ways to move people to the North Rim so I just I commend all of you for the good thinking that you're doing and hope that we can continue to we have a business in Maine and over every door it says think of yourself as the customer and I've always thought that's an awfully good way to think about these things what are the what are the people who are coming to experience this looking for how do we give them connectivity when and where they need it without having the phone out on the trail looking at Half Dome I as a camera yes as a conversation tool maybe not but I certainly appreciate what you're doing and and hope that that the Park Service will continue do you have plans to expand the what is now a pilot program with the mobile passes we we do have plans to expand we're looking at some of our larger parks next that have the more sophisticated point-of-sale systems and have good connectivity at the entrance stations and then we'll be moving to expand beyond that during the course of the next year as we upgrade point-of-sale systems and other parks because one of the reasons I was so pushy about this with secretary Jewell was I think we're leaving money on the table at at least some national parks of people that are willing and want to buy passes but it's awkward where you get them how you get them whether whether you really need them and and this is a way that people are staying in a hotel nearby the park how do I get a pass oh it's right here so I believe it's also can be a significant revenue producer for the parks yes I think the Park Service would agree with that there are places where there may not be an entrance station we've maybe I've had an iron ranger in the past where someone was supposed to put something in a box it's much easier for them to get a pass ahead of time particularly since a lot of visitors are now planning their trips and wanting to make a lot of their arrangements before they arrive so we are finding that to be useful well thank you for all your work and I want to also thank the foundation because you all do just incredible work and as you say without taxpayer money and it's it's wonderful the promotion that you do so my compliments and let me put it in my wallet and then we got it made thank you all very much

good morning thank you for joining us for today's session of the agriculture summit for the virtual summit i should say across the third district we're grateful that you joined us as we live with the pandemic right now we know that the challenges are many and we've actually congress has taken historic steps with the administration to help producers help consumers a lot of folks all across the country we know that agriculture faces unique challenges certainly from other parts of the country and unlike other industries and we know that agriculture is hands-on work and cannot be done remotely and so i'm grateful though that we've had producers really step up the entire agriculture industry has stepped up and and the complications that we know um have and the challenges that are out there that they've they've been met and i'm grateful to say that consumers there have been a few bumps along the way but consumers have been able to access food at their grocery stores and ultimately nutrition has been strong across the country with us today we have two special guests and to update us on what usda has been working on namely the coronavirus food assistance program or cpap and the farmers to families food box program and how that can help farmers and ranchers across the third district as well as answer any questions that you might have administrator richard fordyce has been the farm service agency administrator at usda since may of 2018 he is a fourth generation farmer from bethany missouri and previously served as the state executive director for fsa and the director of the missouri department of agriculture also with us is under secretary greg eibaugh he's been the under secretary for marketing and regulatory programs since october of 2017 the mra includes the agriculture marketing service agency and animal and plant health inspection service agency as many of you know greg is one of our own and before serving in his current role he served as nebraska's director of agriculture administrator fordyce thank you for joining us today now last time you joined us the usda was still in the rulemaking process for the coronavirus food assistance program and now that it is up and running and conversations are in the works for the next steps beyond cfap i was just wondering if you could give us an update of where things stand right now i'm glad to do that thank you congressman um so good morning everyone it's really great to be here with the congressman and with the under secretary to talk a little bit about what's going on with the coronavirus food assistance program maybe you visit real quickly about the status of our offices across nebraska um and and other topics that that might come up so let me start with the coronavirus food assistance program uh that that's the program that was stood up primarily at the beginning because of the funding that was provided to the department through the cares act nine and a half billion dollars through the cares act and and our secretary secretary perdue wanted to leverage those dollars with additional dollars to provide additional support so six and a half billion dollars also um came from the commodity credit corporation so brought the total uh total amount of support um to support agriculture because of the pandemic to 16 billion dollars the the original rollout signup began on may 26 the original rollout had several categories livestock dairy non-specialty crops and specialty crops and i know there's been in the news anyway there's been a couple of announcements since that original sign up of additional commodities and i thought i might just explain real quickly about how that came about the secretary and the president were very adamant that we rolled this out as quickly as possible and we had access to data to be able to list some commodities originally that we had really strong data and understood the impact to those markets based on the impacts of coronavirus so um so those were the original commodities announced we knew at the time that there would be added commodities added added crops and so we asked the public to help us in gathering some of that information and so we issued what we call a nofa to ask the public for uh to submit information and data that could support uh additional eligible commodities and so since that time we've had two announcements um adding a number of commodities a lot of those specialty crop commodities but there are others that have been added since that time a couple of weeks ago we made an announcement that of the of the added commodities and the uh the the deadline would be extended to september 11 and then also if you remember we factored those those eligible payments at 80 um during that announcement we we also made the decision um to go ahead and pay the remaining 20 so if you're a producer you already have filed an application you have you have gotten a payment you don't need to do anything um the the additional 20 of those payments actually those payments were processed last weekend and were sent to county offices on monday for them to do more of a procedural thing um just to put eyes on again and make sure that everything is good and and those payments then will be issued um maybe today congressman could be started going to going into producers today and certainly i would think you know a lot of those payments will be out by the end of the week so that's good news um you know nebraska has been very very active and very involved in the cfap program nebraska's state executive director nancy johnner sent me some numbers uh earlier this week as of monday nebraska had 29 304 applications worth 508 million dollars almost 60 percent of those payments were for livestock 303 million dollars followed by non-specialty which probably are probably primarily here in nebraska corn and soybeans 38 196 million dollars and then dairy with eight million dollars there were a few specialty crop applications um for just about a half a million dollars so some of the added commodities in the most recent announcement sheep we had sheep yearling sheep that were in uh in the cpap program uh now we're including all classes of sheep so that could have some impact in some areas here in nebraska and then the addition of liquefied and frozen eggs um that you know how that'll work here depending on how the egg production or the egg breaking facilities in parts of nebraska how that'll impact that so um so that's kind of a real quick overview of cfap obviously you know the farm service agency one of our primary one of our primary functions is acreage reporting that's an annual kind of an annual event and in some cases depending on what you grow you do it more than once and we have had we've had some changes in how our offices are delivering uh the customer service that you expect from the farm service agency um right after the coronavirus really uh hit its peak um we have we ask our folks to work from home to telework and uh and our agency really had not been equipped to telework as you all know it is a personal relationship over the counter um and so we had to adjust very quickly get our get our employees some equipment maybe that they didn't have where there was connectivity issues get hot spots and other other technology to them to be able to work and they did and we've got you know we've got the numbers to prove it here in nebraska and across the country our employees really met the challenge and we're able to really deliver programs congressmen um that are impactful to producers and keep that going maybe not quite at the pace that we would have had we been in those offices personally but you know i think our folks did a did a really good job and acreage reporting is moving along uh really well here in nebraska some counties that maybe were falling a little behind we were able to mobilize some jump teams to go help uh some of those counties to get that finished up um from a crp standpoint in our in our general sign up nebraska added 132 000 acres to crp in the general sign up and the most recent crp grasslands enrollment uh 209 000 acres were added to crp so a lot of activity around crp wanted to mention real quickly a change that we announced that i think everyone is going to be very happy about and that is the process by which emergency hang and grazing of crp is triggered previously as if you've ever done it you know how this worked you um you went to your county office or your county uh your county committee said hey you know we're experiencing at least 40 floss and forage we've been in drought we've been in d2 drought we need to act we need to give producers access to crp for hanging grace so the county would make a request to the state state would a lot of times bundle those wait for multiple counties to come in send those to headquarters so send them to washington dc and then get final approval there and in some cases maybe it would take a week or two or maybe even longer to get the clearance to go ahead and access that crp but we know if you're in a drought or your excessive dry period every day makes a difference on the quality of that forage so um so thanks to the congressman and his colleagues in the 2018 farm bill there were there was language added that allowed for the farm service agency to streamline that process and so uh how it works today is is if your county is has experienced d2 drought for one week that your county automatically triggers there is nothing that needs to happen that county automatically has access to that crp for emergency hang and grazing another i think really good component of that is is and it all it all um it all revolves around the primary nesting season as we know and nebraska i think the entire state of nebraska is july 15th so any time in an eight week period prior to that primary nesting season expiring if your county had experienced d2 drought for one week the day after the primary nesting season is over your county is triggered for for emergency hanging grace so this has really streamlined the process and when you're and as i said earlier when you're in need of that forage um you literally could get on it the day after the end of the primary nesting season so um you know certainly if you're in that in that case and i know nebraska has some drought affected counties um you know i would encourage you to contact your farm service agency office you're going to have to let them know that you're going to access that forage and there's some provisions that you need to know about that that they can fill you in on but really a streamlined process to to get there i know that was uh at times um i know here in nebraska because i know it was the case in missouri at times it was very frustrating process over the years in the past so a great improvement so thanks to thanks to congress and and what and the work that they did through the 2018 farm bill to be able to allow that to happen um i think oh and just i'll just mention real quickly i mentioned earlier about the status of our offices um every county and so we have phases and we do this very very very carefully and we rely on what's going on actually in the county it's not not something that happens from lincoln it's not something that happens from washington it's data that we get from the local county as far as how do we move forward with opening offices so every office in nebraska is phase one which means the employees are back they may not be accepting um farmers and ranchers into the office yet and nancy said there are most of the counties are now in phase two which means employees are back and they're taking customers by appointment only so that's a big that's a big step forward for the agency as to where we were earlier in the pandemic so anyway i just i just want to say thanks to all of you for your patience as we've worked through a lot of programs a lot of things that need to be done a lot of things that you need to get done uh your patients that you've exhibited working with our with our staff and our county offices and certainly want to say a huge thanks to our staff that are in those local county offices that do a great job every day representing nebraska agriculture and the farmers and ranchers in their individual counties when i travel i hear um i hear from employees whether they've been there a year five years or in some cases 35 years um that they refer to the they refer to the producers in their county as their producers so there's a great deal of a great deal of passion certainly support for agriculture from our staff and just want to say a huge thanks to them and the effort that they're putting out so congressman i think maybe that's enough for now thank you i know you've been busy and i think what you mentioned though in streamlining and making making it easier for producers themselves i think there's quite a theme across the administration in that respect and so thank you for helping implement that i think producers are very grateful as well um his title is under secretary but i know most folks watching know you as greg so we'll try greg what would you like to add no that's a wonderful one it's great to be back here in nebraska and joined the congressman today uh we got to have supper at the ranch last night and enjoy each other's company and so that was a great opportunity richard has done some incredible things and the farm service agency has done some incredible things here over the last few years of the trump administration i think richard that at the end of this cpap payment period you will have pushed out almost 50 billion dollars to america's farmers and ranchers on behalf of the trump administration between trade mitigation and disaster programs and uh maybe even close to 60 billion it's getting close to 60. it's a that's pretty incredible what the president has made available through usda and secretary is implemented to be able to support farmers and ranchers in their time of need as we've struggled the last few years durian with cpap or with covet rearing up and things everything shutting down in march there were some real struggles and obviously at mrp where i have the ag marketing service which is in charge of most of the grading programs across agriculture whether they be specialty crops or grains or livestock as well as on the animal and health and plant protection side of the house with aphis uh over half the employees in my mission area which is total employees of about 13 000 people have been deemed essential personnel and so they've worked right through this and many of them worked in very high danger zones with a lot of infections that were being reported whether they be in packing plants or in new york city at best fruit vegetable marketplaces and distribution centers where they were grading or at the border where goods were coming across the border that needed to be inspected to make sure they didn't have any pests or diseases coming in so we're very proud of those employees at usda that worked right through and we were very lucky and that we have still had a very low percentage of our employees with in my mission area that have contracted uh kovid and we have not had any deaths from covet in my mission area so we have been very fortunate there and i think it's a testament to the way they handled themselves the way that we were able to get personal protective equipment to them and the way they went about doing their jobs in a way that allowed them to be safe at the same time the other half of the employees had to adjust to working from home and working remotely and incredibly proud of the job they did as well during this time we were pushing through and finalizing a whole bunch of regulations that allowed us to uh update the plant biotechnology regulations for the first time in 30 years we were able to finalize those regulations in the middle of cobit we've uh proposed and move are moving through different phases of the regulatory process and updating protections and and the organic industry that will hold foreign companies and growers accountable to the u.s standard as well as make sure that we have the protocols and protections in place to make sure that our own producers are adhering to our standards and that there is fairness across the board for those producers that we are having more and more of in nebraska every day that are growing crops organically we also have worked very hard to do some things that will be new we'll have conversations ongoing with fda to look how we can work together to provide opportunities for animal biotechnology to move forward with a regulatory process that has certainty in nebraska alone our livestock industry could really benefit from being able to advance disease resistance be able to eliminate horns through genetic alterations that don't do anything but change just those one or two genes that we're looking to change and they're things that we want to regulate that can be done in nature through a breeding process that might take multiple generations and maybe as long as 10 years we can do them pretty much overnight with gene editing and have the same result exactly that we would through a breathing process if you examine that the dna you would be able to tell the difference so we think there's some great opportunities there the secretary earlier in the administration also worked with fda to make sure that as we looked at cell based meat technology that we divided up that responsibility so cell-based meat is the technology to grow that meat in the laboratory is under fda's jurisdiction but the minute that that cell-based laboratory meat would be harvested if you will and made available to consumers that comes under usda's jurisdiction and the secretary has made clear that under usda's jurisdiction consumers will be able to know at the meat counter the difference between that meat that is produced in the laboratory and that meat that is produced by america's ranchers and farmers across our nation and so we think that's an important distinction and we know it's an important distinction for nebraska producers what we're really here as not only to do this listening session or i think you have a fancier name for it than that but uh we're also here in kearney to look at one of the things that ams is doing to help address the hunger needs that were across our nation during cope as we know as restaurants and food service shut down many of our farmers and ranchers lost their market we saw milk being wasted and not having a processor to go to because the supply chain had stopped when companies lost the ability to be able to be open and restaurants weren't operating and conventions got cancelled and so while we still needed the food at the retail level we had to go through a process where we transitioned all those food products that were headed for food service and restaurants into packaging and label packages and to be able to be at retail so we had that hiccup in the process at the same time many of our specialty crop producers in the south of the united states and and the west coast in california uh were destroying some of their crops because they couldn't get to the marketplace ams saw that need we also saw that the newly employed unemployed were having trouble feeding their families and we worked with the secretary to quickly react and develop a food box program and one of our great nebraska companies cashway is participating in that food box program and we will tour cashway here at kearney later today with the congressmen to be able to see how they're constructing those boxes of food that are being distributed not only in nebraska out of cash way here in kearney but also to north and south dakota and so we're very proud of the job that cashway is doing to help farmers and ranchers take that food that was going to waste be able to create demand for it and now give it to hungry people across our nation as of uh earlier this month we had distributed over 60 million boxes of food to america's hungry families and we're going to before it's over have distributed 3 billion worth of food as well and that's everything from fruits and vegetables dairy products milk as well as meat and that includes pre-cooked chicken pork beef pro and turkey products that are eligible to be included in those boxes so it's a great opportunity to let people have access to some great products that farmers and ranchers grow to become in some cases familiar with products that they don't didn't normally use in their homes and we hope down the road that as people have become accustomed to cooking at home that they when they go to the grocery store they will be customers for those great products they've been seeing in the box so with that look forward to your questions again i can't tell you how great it is to be able to be back here in nebraska uh this past week we celebrated a milestone for our family the arrival of uh teresa and i's first grandchild isla iba was born on 8 8 and so we're excited i'm excited to be able to be here and get a chance to get to know her as well so thank you everybody for listening in this morning so it's not just under secretary it's grandpa great now to grandpa there we go here we go i do want to introduce uh to everyone participating katie morley katie is on my washington staff handing handling agriculture and trade issues and some other issues and also here in the room today eric hamler from the grand island office many of you know as well as valjean santi from the scott's bluff office so we're all spread out here in the room just just to be sure but uh appreciate everyone's participation here today katie is going to moderate here and and mention the questions that the viewers and participants have have submitted katie do you want to fire off first question perfect yeah as the congressman mentioned if you all have any questions feel free to put in the chat box in the q a box and i will happily ask them for the panelists um so we have one question so far the first one is um clarification question why does the usda use the term meat when referring to cell-based protein that's a good question and that is one of the things that the secretary is working on and with the labeling scheme that we will have when cell-based protein becomes available to consumers it will have a label on it that will clarify that for consumers so there's no confusion on whether it was raised by a farmer or rancher here in nebraska or raised in the lab maybe we can even engage advocates who appreciate natural products to support natural meat instead of fake meat any other questions yet yes um a cfap question for you all is alfalfa eligible for the coronavirus relief program so uh alfalfa is not eligible for um proceed payments at this time um you know again as i mentioned the the first announcement when we announced the program and had the initial sign ups and and went through the process of soliciting input from the public and and the data that supported supported a either price loss or a disruption in the supply chain looking at the numbers for alfalfa or other hay products didn't support inclusion into the cpap program you know we continue to look at that data we continue to look at what is the effect of coronavirus on on commodities moving forward so but at this time alfalfa is not included in the coronavirus food assistance group usda went through a pretty extensive process to be able to not only determine in that first round as administrator fordyce talked about what would be eligible that we were able to determine but we also made available a nofa period of time when most of the commodities across america were able to take a look at their market and their price history and uh either as a individual uh group of producer or as a national commodity then those nofas were completed so uh all commodities had an equally equal chance to be able to submit their data and establish whether or not they had a sufficient loss i think five percent was required to meet the minimum threshold in price to be able to be uh eligible so uh i think it's not necessarily all usda's decision anymore because we were able to work with many industries to analyze the data that they provided to be able to establish their eligibility as well and i would just say kind of to the under secretary's point when when we asked the public to submit data for inclusion in the cpap program we got as you can imagine we got all kinds of different different data sets so some very very complete some not as complete some maybe just merely a statement saying i think you should include whatever in the cpap program and so what we did and um you know greg mentioned that ams is in his mission area so it was more than fsa it was fsa we worked very closely with ams we worked very closely with the office of the chief economist and we split these we split these submissions up into teams that work specifically in certain categories and if they looked at that submission and there were additional questions or they had additional questions you know we reached out to the submitter and had them um had them clarify you know and help explain what the data meant so it was it was it was way more than just getting a submission in uh from the public and you know going down through a paper and saying uh no that doesn't work we actually um had personal dialogue and visited with folks for them to further explain what the data meant so i think i think it was a very good process but again we continue to look at those those impacts and you know as we look at what the impact is going forward usda tried to make as many commodities as we could justify eligible to be part of cfaf we have a responsibility to the taxpayer as well as to adrian and the rest of congress to make sure that we can justify those actions that we take and but we did approach it with the bias that we wanted to provide aid and assistance next question all right administrator fordyce what has been the biggest hurdle with cfap for producers well that's a that is a great question and um greg knows this because he was in on some of the conversations uh early on um you know what we wanted to do was uh certainly because of workload in our county offices the status that a lot of our county offices were working in at the time we wanted to make this as straightforward and as as uncomplex as that'll work uncomplicated as we could possibly make it and so um whether depending on the category that the producer applies in um it could be if you're a dairy producer it could be um you know first quarter production you're going to need to know what that is um if you're a livestock producer some sales during a period of time january 15th april 15th and then a number and inventory number um you know if you're uh if you're non-specialty so corn soybean producer here in nebraska uh know what your 19 production is and and then um what you had after after the first of the year after january 1st that wasn't already marketed and it depends on the different categories but we really tried to make it straightforward and and easier for the producer make it as easy as we possibly could now you know if you're diversified operation depending on your records and and access to those records it could be a bit more of a challenge you know in some on some farms or ranches than it than it would be in others but we really tried um you know the one of the paramount priorities was to make this um you know as as as simple as we could so you know from i guess from a hurdle standpoint i'm just thinking you know my wife um my wife is doing this for our farm now and you know and i know she had to she had to scramble a little bit to um to come up with an inventory number she had a couple of the guys that worked for us she had to work with them certainly to get an inventory number of cattle um and but it's um it's a producer self-certification and i know we've got i know maybe in some cases we've had some county offices that have been a little more aggressive um and maybe asking for more um and so we've tried to we've continually communicated to county offices that this is a producer self-certification um you know the producer is subject to a spot check um potentially a random spot check and so if you put down a thousand head of cattle in your inventory number um you know we're going to ask if you get chosen for a spot check we're going to ask you to provide some kind of documentation to support that that number but um but it it should be pretty straightforward really you know the only burden that or hurdle that i can think of would be just being able to access those records and having an accurate um an accurate account for for the application very good katie great thank you all right we have from brett from south dakota so this is a multi-state um webinar um we do need immediate relief as long as well as long-term fix along with this relief is there a way to offer dollars off of either financing or tax credits for new structures for the farmer and rancher so um so from uh from a structure standpoint you know the farm service agency does have the farm storage facility loan program where we loan we loan money to build um a lot our list is quite extensive of the things that we will finance but you know primarily what we think of in the farm storage facility loan program are drain bins and grain storage there's also hay storage a lot of a lot of a lot of kind of structures can be can be built under that farm storage facility loan program the interest rates are um really really competitive um depending on the number of years that you want to finance that project but that's a that's a program that works really really well and it's it's pretty straightforward program it runs through our the program side of our house not necessarily the loan side of the house so there's no test for credit um you know you've got to have you've got to have the assets to support obviously support the loan but um but it's a little different than our farm than than the approach that we take on the farm loan side um you know certainly the under secretary may have better ideas about tax credits and those kind of things but but we certainly can participate in financing a lot of things on the farm and that even extends also it extends to um hopper bottom trailers livestock trailers um trucks a lot of things um grain carts anything that may that you may need to store either for a short period of time or help move the product along through the value chain we can we can help you with that i will add you know tax reform that we did not long ago it's conducive on the expensing inexpensive tax reform is very friendly to producers and those tax incentives that are out there and let me say that uh other ideas you know the producers have we are on the lazy means committee uh wanting to be mindful of how we can help through tech the tax code um get the economy back on track so ideas from producers i would certainly be happy to hear hear those ideas because we know even before covet yet we a lot of statements were made that we shouldn't wait 30 years to reform the tax code when we when we see opportunities to grow our economy through the tax cut and obviously the congressman is on one of the most powerful committees in house of representatives the ways and means committee and so they have broad jurisdiction to be able to do a number of things but one of the things that the administration has been particularly focused on and under the president's leadership is to look at the regulatory burden that everybody has but particularly for usda it's a regulatory burden that agriculture is under and so we have a lot of the reforms that we've made to our regulations in the past three and a half years have been to get rid of silly paperwork to get rid of the time it takes to uh document for documentation for some of richard's programs for uh some of our programs uh extra steps or or inspections that are required that weren't necessary we we've really tried to uh provide relief that is real financial relief by taking that regulatory burden off of americans definitely and not just in usda but across across the federal government tonight the economy being so strong before kovit one of the reasons was that industry across america and consumers themselves were able to experience the efficiencies of better regulations smarter regulations and not just more regulations it was much much better applied katie back to you all right um next question based on current commodity prices specifically with corn is there any discussion of an mfp payment this fall so mfp would uh you know we've kind of got that term in our head that's really was a trade mitigation uh terminology and so we're not probably considering uh that at this time because we think that we have done a lot to straighten out a new trade agreement with nafta with usmca now we've also made progress with china we see china making some record purchases of corn soybeans and grain sorghum that are all important to nebraska but we do realize that the impact of copiod is not over and so we are working right now at usda to uh be able to utilize about 14 more bill bill 14 billion more dollars that congress had made available to us just a few weeks ago to be able to roll out a second wave of cpap payments and uh we're getting uh in discussions about how we're going to roll those payments out again focused on being a farmer and rancher friendly ease of application and ease of administration for richard and his employees in the farm service agency so i think as producers and agriculturalists uh you can look forward or be watching for uh that announcement coming out sometime in probably the next 30 to 45 days about how we will be pumping 14 billion dollars more into the id economy and let me just add on on the trade front when you look at the magnitude of usmca that was done of course it went into full implementation on july 1st amidst a lot of other news too but i i want everyone to understand that usmca got done despite a lot of naysayers saying it could never be done and you know from the legislative standpoint of congress being involved a house under democratic control with the white house uh being republican i mean all sorts of challenges and we got this done and naturally i was i myself was a little bit nervous at first representing agriculture that had done well under nafta but the president and the administration in general saw opportunities to to leverage our markets more effectively more efficiently through negotiation and i think america is better off with usmca now there were some points that i didn't really want in there but you know what it gave us probably the strongest passage of a trade agreement in congress than we've ever seen i mean i have colleagues who have never voted for a trade agreement before but they voted for this one and i think it's teeing up more opportunities down down the road so katie all right so we have one last question i know that where our time is coming to a close um and that question is where do things stand with the epa and dicamba approval i know that that's also with you know another agency but any information or things that you can share with us would be great so at this we work very closely with epa on on dicamba and other crop protection chemicals that are out there obviously the decision by the court in california was a blow to agriculture at a very bad time we worked very closely i had several conversations myself with epa officials about how they could try to allow farmers to utilize the genetics they had purchased as well as the crop protection chemicals that they had purchased in this growing season and i think epa came up with a pretty good compromise to be able to allow producers not to be harmed at the same time we all knew this fall that we would go through a re-licensing or re-labeling approval for dicamba and uh that uh process so was in full gear we have uh the companies that have those crop protection uh chemicals that are in that category of dicamba have submitted the data to epa or are working on submitting the data to epa we have lots more research we also have more stabilization anti-drift qualities built into some of those products now and so again we're inco providing some guidance and some assistance to epa but ultimately the decision is there but i'm very optimistic that epa will be able to address the california courts the ninth ninth district questions and basis for their ruling against dicamba in a new labeling process that will be able to allow producers access to that crop protection chemical in the future well um maybe one more question if we have one more question i think we are closing out so um all right well again thank you uh to our panel here today richard and greg i i'm not only grateful that you're here today but i'm grateful for your service across america and we know that amidst the challenges there are some good things happening when you look at our farmers and ranchers and producers in general their their ability to help feed the world we take that for granted not only feed america but but help feed the world and we're helping people around the world because of that now we want to see some some economic viability of agriculture production here at home as well and so that's always on the top of my mind of how we can maintain you know grow the ag economy and amidst our challenges though we've got some some great stories out there in terms of new ideas and innovation because i really believe that whether it's our national debt or whether it's a pandemic the answer is innovation we we can innovate our way out of this we will not be able to tax our way out of it regulate our way out of it or use the heavy hand of the federal government thinking that that will lead the way into effective solutions we can do we can do far more and we can do far better with innovation and so thank you to all of our participants today tomorrow morning we will be focusing on telecommunications broadband i will we'll hear from some experts there and then on friday note the time change uh on schedule change on friday we will have our chief ag negotiator greg dowd ambassador dowd will be able to uh give us an update on on trey we know there's a lot happening so it's pretty exciting but i want to thank all of you for participating and hopefully see you tomorrow thank you so much god bless and go be great

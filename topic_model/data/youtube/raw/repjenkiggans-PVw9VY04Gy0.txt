Republican Jen kiggins is one of the nearly 80 new members of the 118th Congress representing Virginia's second district which includes Naval Station Norfolk the world's largest Naval Station she told C-SPAN about her political influences her previous work as a nurse and why she wears a pin with wings along with her Congressional member pin so I served for 10 of the best years of my life as a Navy pilot as a helicopter pilot I flew h46s and H3 helicopters stationed in Norfolk in the NAS Oceana which is in Virginia Beach so it was a great time in my life but my dad was a Greenbrier in the Army and I I was on an nrotc scholarship for college and so chose to fly the year that women could fly in combat 1993 and it was just a great experience serving the country being at the tip of the spear my husband is a retired F-18 pilot and I have children who serve now too so it's a it's an important part of my life an important part of who I am as a person and as a legislator how did you decide to become a pilot Maybe what was it that made you want to pursue that just that service to Country I think it's very important if we leave the country that we know how to serve the country in politics is really about as a service job as well so being a representative of my district is is another way for me to serve and I think my whole life has really been about service service to countries and navy Pilots service to my family as a mother and then I was a nurse practitioner so service to my community and to our older and greatest Generation as a nurse practitioner so what a better next step for me to serve to serve my country than as a representative for congress how did being a pilot shape who you are so really just instilled a love of country and understanding how to do a mission and what the mission is for the country and I want what's best for America and I understand the importance of a strong military it really motivates me when I think of my priorities especially legislatively I know that deterrence is our best form of preserving peace so that's a priority of mine serving on armed services committee is another way for me to do that but you know my children will inherit this Navy my son's in the Naval Academy I have another son in Navy ROTC at VMI so my children are inheriting this Navy this military along with their friends so I want it to be strong I want them to inherit a peaceful world that they can live and raise their families in but I want them to be proud of their military so so it really really shapes who I am and just that patriotism and love of country that's what my years in the military really did for me and I carry with that you know throughout my life with me where were you deployed to and when so I deployed a couple times to the Persian Gulf I did two deployments one was on a on the USS Seattle where you did a lot of vertical replenishment and age 46 and then I also deployed on the USS Incheon which we were more of a search and rescue capacity for an age 53 Squadron and then my last tour in the Navy was search and rescue at NAS Oceana so for the master jet base on the East Coast that was 10 years of your life when did when were you a nurse practitioner it's a long story yes so I served for 10 years and then I got out of the Navy we started to have children and we were deployed back to back during our active duty time with my husband so it was challenging and and I got out to raise my kids which was another rewarding yet very hard job to be a stay-at-home mom I had a GI Bill that was burning a hole in my pocket and and my mother is a nurse I have a brother as a nurse and I had grandparents that just made really a great impact on my life one of my set of Grandparents were aged in a nursing home had Alzheimer's disease so I knew I wanted to serve that that patient population those older adults who were often voiceless in government especially but I went back to school using my GI Bill to nursing school and then to Vanderbilt to become a geriatric nurse practitioner where I've been able to practice in long-term care Assisted Living I've done some home health and hospice which I really loved and memory care and working just with frail elderly and cognitive impairments so excited to to advocate for them here in Congress I was able to do that in the state legislature and just really excited to be their voice again and then when did you run for your first public office so that was 2019 and that was in Virginia it was the year of the Blue Wave we saw a lot of Democrat women especially that were running and winning elections and there really were no Republican women that were that were stepping up especially veteran women so I felt very underrepresented in government and the state senator for my district kind of retired all of a sudden and the seat was open so and and I hated what I saw on television I used to yell at the TV from my couch I just hated the division and the negativity on the news so I decided to get off my couch and literally Google how you get on a ballot and it really just worked very very hard that year and a tough year for Republicans to win in state elections and and we won and showed up in the state senate as the only new Republican that year and and I sat in the minority in Virginia for a few years and I really learned a lot of lessons about governing about bipartisanship about how to get things done in the minority and three of the again great years of my life but really prepared me well for my my current job here in Congress and what made you to decide to run for this seat so one big thing that really this was a motivating factor for me was that I felt like we we were weak we were weakening our military and for me just my district is so veteran heavy so heavy in our active duty you know population but also our military families live there as a military spouse as a military mom you know I couldn't do that on the state level I could do a lot of work with with not only health care but with our Veteran Affairs type legislation but just being able to impact change for our active duty military working with Department offense and with our Navy I want to restore that strength for our military I want again for them to be proud you know I think a lot of veterans that ran this cycle we watched Afghanistan withdrawal that was an embarrassment for us it was really hard to watch what that did to our military and I know that that impacted our reputation throughout the world and if we don't have World Peace we have nothing right so for me it's all really about restoring that strength in our military

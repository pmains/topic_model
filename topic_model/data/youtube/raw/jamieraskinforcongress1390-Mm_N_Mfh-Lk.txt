hello to democracy summer hello all you wonderful fellows hello supporters and patrons of democracy summer hello Americans all across the country joining us for the first of our democracy Summer Seminar series which for the very first time in 2020 we are opening up to all of America in the whole world because we've gone online and so it's not just for these wonderful young people or high school and college students and young working people who've joined us it's for everybody and they get the first dibs on questions of our magnificent political leaders and intellectuals and activists and organizers who are joining us this summer but we very much welcome the participation of others as well and we're starting a few minutes late that's totally my fault because I'm just getting back from Capitol Hill where I voted for DC statehood and I helped to manage the DC statehood bill and I got to rebut a lot of the more absurd constitutional and legal and political arguments being made by the Republican Party which to its shame voted on blocked all masks against DC statehood but we passed it in the House of Representatives for the first time in American history voting to admit Washington DC Washington Douglas Commonwealth named after Frederick Douglas to admit it as the 51st state in the Union and there is great celebration and jubilation going on in Washington DC we know that there's a very tall hill for us to try to scale in Mitch McConnell's Senate but this is a huge landmark achievement the last time there was a vote in 1993 on DC statehood it failed two-to-one and today you've got every Democrat voting for it except for one Colin Peterson from a very conservative district in Minnesota but otherwise it was unanimous among the Democrats and so check out some of the footage and check out some of the the argumentation I think that the Republican arguments were very weak but I know it's of interest to everybody who's tuned in about voting rights in America and it is completely consistent with the theme of today's and negation we are kicking off our eighth seminar series which has the theme of 2020 vision is a time for a new reconstruction in America but we're kicking off with voting rights and what could be more central to American democracy than that and we have two remarkable guests with us today first I'm going to introduce you to Greg Moore who's perhaps the greatest voting rights activist thinker and strategist that I know he was for a long time the executive director of the n-double a-c-p s National Voter fund he was the chief of staff for congressman john conyers from michigan he worked for the rainbow coalition directing all of the voter engagement registration and mobilization efforts and he continues to consult caucus write and agitate on voting rights we're delighted to have you Greg and I also want to introduce you to the great Alexander case our who's a professor of history and public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government he has written the Magisterial authoritative and Cree eminent book on the history of voting rights in America called the right to vote : the contested history of democracy in the United States it's a remarkable book that I recommend to all the democracy summer fellows and to everybody else out there and the prolific professor gates R has another book coming out this month called why do we still have the electoral college which I read in one sitting through the night it was gripping and I think I've got a blurb on the back of Professor K Tsar's book because it's such a magnificent contribution and we will get to that later in the summer democracy summer fellows but let's start off with the professor case art to give us historical overview you know I've asked him to kick us off with 12 minutes of reflections about where we've come from in terms of the right to vote where we are today they're going to kick it over to Greg Moore to talk about the voting rights struggles he's been involved in both historically and then the ones today that we need everybody on the front about that we're going to open it up for your questions professor case are the floors yours Thank You G gave me for the very generous introduction and and for inviting me to participate in democracy summer this great program which which you have created and thanks to the two fellows who are out there whom I can to everyone else who may be drawn and you know thank you for coming to this discussion you know my mandate has been to cover 100 years of history in 12 minutes and I will I will do my absolute best let me just try to hit a couple the highlights some of the major theme on you know little details first let's start with something with you I think the original and voting rights in babies which is that there is no right to vote in the US Constitution if you thought that there was a right to vote I'm sorry what you do the Constitution does not guarantee you a right to vote that was a decision made by the framers of the Constitution in 77 it had very little to do or almost nothing to do with principles or values it had to do with the complicated politics of the ratification of the Constitution they thought it would make it easier if there was no tional suffrage requirement or those no standard that suffers law they left and consequently they left it to the states the federal go boating rights largely to the states and that's where most of the action has been although there have been a series of conscionable amendments over the local hundred years that have protected the right to vote and a little bit we'll put up a chart that what that will list those so at the outset beginning of our country each state has its own set of requirements I think we can put up the first slide now as a backdrop the normal the most common sort of rule in a state was that emit is that you had to own property or pay taxes in order to vote you had to be a white man a white male property owner and the most you know my favorite quote which is up there on the slide is from Benjamin Franklin and was published in 1828 but he said this long before his dismissal of property requirements with what became known as the famous jackass story saying because if you probably farm animals counted as properties they you if you had a jackass you could meet the property requirements and then as Franklin tells the story of the following year the jackass has died and the man goes to vote and he can't vote because he doesn't have the requisite property so though Franklin says at the end informing whom is the right of suffrage that in the man or the jackass and at the outset also interesting anomaly is that women in New Jersey could vote for a very short period of time for about 15-20 years and in some northern states african-americans could vote although they lost that right in most northern states every place outside of New England by the 1830s so we start out with a very constricted right the vote is broader than it is in countries of Europe at the time but it is very constricted since that time you know when we're talking now more than 200 years I think one has to understand the the basic shape of this history as having two very broad trends one has been towards an expansion of the right to vote the extension of suffrage rights the new groups most often happening after decades of organizing you know this the right to vote doesn't just happen because people wake up on just enlarge because people wake up one day and say oh that would be the right that would be the right thing to do there's a history of struggle and struggle and struggle taxpaying and property requirements are pretty much dropped by the first end of the first half of the 19th century that happens at the state level not at the federal level although to attach an important asterisk here in fact constitutionally the Supreme Court decided that property requirements were inappropriate for vote to to vote only in the 1960s it was perfectly constitutional until then to impose them but most states did get rid of them and then the 15th amendment and here I think we can put up the second slide which lists the different constitutional amendments the 15th amendment was passed in the late 1860's after the Civil War and it prohibited the denial of the right to vote the people based on race color or previous condition of servitude as we'll see in a couple of seconds the 15th amendment didn't really hold didn't really govern for a very long time then there's the 19th amendment which is listed there also which eliminated sex as a barrier to voting and madelyn if you about the third slide here - this is a quote from the standard participants history of women's suffrage in which she and one paragraph narrates the amount of effort that it took to extend the franchise to women sort of 52 years so campaign is 277 campaigns to get state party conventions it went on and on and on it starts in the 1850s and it finally succeeds only in in 1920 and another constitutional amendment which happens somewhat later like these 60s is a constitutional amendment lowering the age of voting from 21 to 18 that really happened there are a number of factors contributing to that but an important one had to do with the Vietnam War and resistance to the draft on the part of young people who were making the claim that it was wrong and perhaps unconstitutional but at least wrong to put young people between the ages of 18 and 21 in a situation where they could be drafted and forced into military service but they had no right to vote but one other thing piece of legislation I want to mention is the Voting Rights Act in 1965 this is extremely important piece of legislation that is designed to restore and I'll get to that in a second there or to enforce the Fifteenth Amendment actually the subtitle of the Voting Rights Act is an act to enforce the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution because it wasn't operative in the South Voting Rights Act is passed as a way of getting the federal government to enforce the Fifteenth Amendment and permit African Americans in southern states to vote and then the Voting Rights Act is enlarged and expanded in a number of ways until as effectively partially gutted by the Supreme Court just a few years ago so but this the broad history here is a history of expansion and then largely and but here's the but here's the second theme the second theme which is very sobering in just about all of these cases the advances were followed by attempts to reverse the progress and to narrow the gains the history of the right to vote is not a history it's not a straight-line history of progress it's it's it's up and down or perhaps the month a appropriate metaphor for the rhythm is that it's two steps forward and one step back you see this as early as the 19th century when elimination of property requirements is accompanied by the disenfranchisement of african-americans in some states and by the imposition of quotes proper requirements saying that anybody who depends on public aid to not burn the Fifteenth Amendment coming in reconstruction is followed by draconian efforts in the south to circumvent the amendment with devices that some of you have probably heard of literacy tests poll taxes to keep african-americans from voting understanding causes where black would-be voters had to demonstrate the white registrar's that they understood obscure causes of the state constitution and then eventually the white primer a number of southern states why the top the Republican Party had been driven out of the south the Democratic Party the party labels and categories and politics are quite different from when they were worth today but the Democratic Party controlled all the south and then the only elections there really matter were the Democratic primaries and in a number of states they said well don't rent primary it's just the private organization we can limit membership as we wish and and thus we limit membership to white people importantly while that was going on in the South something similar was happening in the north to restrict the rights particularly of immigrant workers and poor people the issue the pressure is leaning since franchise were very much based on classes not this is not just a matter of race in the United States literacy tests were imposed in in the north as well as the south very very complicated and difficult registration remnants were passed there were all sorts of you know of shenanigan on you in some places you had to register every year and you had to provide a proof of residence or state this is one of my favorite examples as an attempt to keep for Jewish voters from the polls the registration date in a couple of years the what the the date for registering to vote was unfor well the holiest holiday in the Jewish calendar when Jews would not be allowed to go and register and then moving more towards the present the Voting Rights Act and other of 1960s and other progressive steps that were made have follow over the past 40 or 50 years by new a new surge of efforts to restrict the right to vote to create these take the form generally not of saying category X of people cannot vote there on that form the idea is that procedural obstacles that will prevent people from voting make it more difficult to register you can reduce the number of polling places and probably the most well known such devices in recent years are the voter ID laws that have been passed in a number of states laws that require a recent or current government-issued voter ID of the sort that is readily available to anybody as a passport or driver's but there are a lot of particularly among the poor who have those documents at hand and many states have made them increasingly difficult to acquire last thing I want to mention before summing up at handing this over is and with the last slide that we could put this up is as you as we approach the November election you should all keep in mind even if you are 18 that in fact you have no constitutional right to vote for president that remains the case congressmen are asking and I have been involved in efforts in the past to try to remedy that but we we were not successful and the Constitution specifies that electors go to the electoral college will be chosen in the manner that basically in each state legislators will choose this nature decides whether there will be an election to choose electors and they can also reverse that decision this brings me actually in the context of the current election but you know summing up here if if the history of mining rights is a history of the law Arcas of progress but it's always been a battle and i think that what we are in the midst of more recent years is the counter attack against the expansion of voting rights that occurred in the 1950s 1960s and 1970s and it's and and also with the things like the passage of the motor what's called the motor build on that ridge line teen 92 which made it easier for people to register what we've been witnessing in recent decades is an attempt to undercut the breadth of the franchise by putting obstacles in people's path and my own conclusion from this and those of you out there is this means that we have to think of the right to the line as something which is permanently it's amok recedes and something we have and we say okay check that box the right to vote always has to be protected or for nurture and I think that that's exactly the kind of thing that greg has been doing and will tell us more about what's that what's going on in the trenches in recent years professor K star thank you so much that was splendid and you mentioned the motor voter law which greg moore was actually instrumentally involved in sir just in getting done he was really a pivotal force there and has worked on all the voting rights struggles of our time so Greg let's turn it over to you to offer your perspectives and then we'll go to Q&A well again thank you congressman Raskin and um just for those two who don't know I'm going to aid you Jamie thirty years ago we were working on DC stays erect and it was a fight to get the vote on the floor in 1993 and it was a struggle to get the democrats to vote for it and we didn't win that vote in the Democratic Congress and a Democratic Senate with a Democratic president so I want to congratulate you Jamie for managing that and for the Congress and the leadership of the Congress to get this passed on this historic day also one thing professor Kesar for laying out the case the case that for many many years has been a big hidden secret in our country that our democracy was not made for everyone that it took years and years of struggle and so he could have went on for another hour I'm sure about the things that have been put in the place the roadblocks have been put in a place over the years what's interesting about what he laid out was that I as a young student activists coming up in the 1980s can recall vividly how we encountered many of those barriers that have been erected I worked on the Jesse Jackson or the rainbow coalition when Jesse Jackson was running for president and we actually went throughout the south and we saw for ourselves the inaccessible registrar's we saw for ourselves the inability to get people to get even voter registration cards you had to get 25 at a time in Louisiana the red star had to be assigned to your event to cap anybody register to vote there are counties in some states like Georgia where you had a whole different set of requirements for voter registration than you did in another part of the state there was no uniform system of voter registration in our country and in 1989 after the two presidential campaigns of Reverend Jackson I got involved with the NAACP and a number of other activist Leadership Conference and others so we started working on back then the National Voter Registration Act of 1989 it was an attempt to use mechanisms of our government like Department of Motor Vehicles and public agencies to use those mechanisms to actually register people to vote now at the time voter registration rates were so somewhere in the 60 percentile range high 60s for the most part but for low-income people people of color African Americans Latinos it was under 50% in a lot of states in some states in the south it was in the 30% tolerate even after the Voting Rights Act passage so what our attempt to do was to try and bring about a national uniform system we started as a coalition we started off with actually same-day voter registration which is what we felt was the answer we pushed that agenda item as part of the 84 and 88 campaigns and in 1989 we began that effort in the legislature in the Congress well it actually took from 1989 to 1993 for that bill to get passed we went through five filibusters the two of them were in a Democratic Congress we went through a veto by President Bush the first in 1992 in fact he vetoed the bill on with the 3rd of July before he left to go on his vacation for the 4th of July weekend after we had worked for four or five years to get motor motor as he called it motor voter on the books it was called an extreme bill at the time having people register to vote while they're getting their drivers license or applying for food stamps or applying for unemployment benefits was considered criminal there are people in Pennsylvania and Alabama right now who have criminal records because they were registering people to vote in line against local statutes and so when that bill we didn't get that bill to pass until 1993 and that was only because I do accredit president was elected for the first time since 1980 and so and allowed us to take that bill that we have been working on for five years the other big thing that changed with it I became a member of the Capitol Hill staff John Congress hired me my first job on the hill was to help get the motor motor bill passed and so I my job started on January 3rd 1993 and thank God for those four or five years I have worked in that bill because it was on the President Clinton's desk by May of 1993 that call listen worked that we had done over the years have built the foundation for that work that we had done and that wasn't the bed that wasn't the end of it that was just the passage of the law the law didn't take effect until 1995 so we spent two years in court battling states like Illinois California Mississippi South Carolina Louisiana ds4 all states with Republican governors who were blocking the implementation of that law after he had become the law of the land and so through litigation through state legislative action that had to take place we were able to get that piece of legislation activated in all 50 states but only after many many struggles by 1995 we found out that all the arguments we have made about the importance of people being registered to vote came true by the first just six months over 15 million people have been registered to vote that we did a study with the group demos and between 1993 and 2003 almost 50 million people have been registered to vote and by the twentieth anniversary of that you know in 2013 over a hundred and ten million people have been both have been registered to vote through the provisions of the NVRA so the great amount of work you sing over the years by the civil rights community and the activist community that get people registered to vote to knock down these barriers came pretty much out of that effort to change the way we get people registered so a hundred million more people to vote and by the time 95 96 97 98 by the time 1999 and 2000 came people were being rested devoted numbers that people had not seen and this in fact is what led to the debacle that we faced in Florida because the turnout in Florida in 2000 was so great that the lines were so great that the machinery was not equipped to capture those many people trying to vote and something as small as emptying out a sad box for punch card muthoni machines that were inadequate led to tens of thousands of votes not being counted and so the big fight and Gork Lee Bush was to say that we should count every vote and that every vote was that there was a massive amount of people not just in Florida but around the country who were turned out in that election in fact it was the election where and we getting back to what the professor was speaking about for the first time since nineteen since 1896 the person who won the popular vote Al Gore lost the election because of the Electoral College so once again that is she became front and center so even though we had to in VRA even though we had the popular vote one we went through eight years of administration that was never popularly elected now I'm from Ohio I'm right now I'm in Ohio and I've done a lot of my work in Ohio but I was in Ohio in nineteen thousand four and again a repeat of what happened in Georgia last week and what happened in Florida happened in Ohio and in 2004 literally people in lines for hours and hours and particularly young people on college campuses for hours five hours six hours nine hours these were people who were standing in line because the machinery did not allow for a large turnout it was raining it was pouring down it was cold it was November people in line the things that were done to reduce the number of polling places to reduce the number of voting machines reduce the amount of people who could be actually a vote or a cuckoo boat early all those things led to a breakdown of the voting systems and so it was out of that movement that the help America Vote Act came about in fact after the the Florida movement to help America Vote Act which basically set national standards for counting votes not registering voters but counting votes and so this counting of votes has become our new challenge and the professor mentioned obviously the last blow to us was the 2013 Supreme Court decision to get rid of the Shelby the Shelby be Holder decision which basically eviscerated section 5 of the Voting Rights Act and it allowed allows states like Georgia and Mississippi and others to no longer have to submit their changes to the Justice Department so when you ask what happened in Georgia last week what happened was the Voting Rights Act was not fully enforced the Supreme Court and did not that the US Congress did not take the steps to update and modernize the Voting Rights Act the Voting Rights Amendment Act has been on the floor of the Congress Jamie as you know since 2014 we have not been able to get Congress to act on that and so you will see more Georgia's and more situations where there are inadequate provisions for people to actually be counted so I know I'm running over time let me just mention one or two other things the coalbed 19 crisis has made this an even bigger imperative we have people who are not yet prepared to go vote and so we have to use mail and registration as our new our new battle cry we have to do that because people have to make decisions between living or threats to their life they're in that vulnerable population they may not vote they may not think that's worth risking their lives so the Mellen reference is essential to this this is the year the US census so the census has to be done redistricting comes next year and I guess the last point I would make is that we need a whole new generation of young people to serve as poll workers one of the reasons we have these long lives because a lot of the poll workers that we have are not showing up because they're in that vulnerable community and so we really need hundreds and thousands of people over the next few cycles to register I will become poll workers and that's why we hope the young people will be there but let me just say again all these struggles from the what the professor laid out to what I've been laying out have been long drawn-out battles have an honor of serving as the house Minority I'm sorry the house administration's representative to the EAC the election assistance Commission Advisory Board I forgot to mention that to you Jamie sorry about that but this this is a position where we've been able to advise the election assistance Commission we continue to provide funding estates and that funding has come about again recently in just the last one or two years which is allow space to upgrade to voting systems and deal with some of the problems of cybersecurity but I'll stop there and again I just want to congratulate all the young people who are involved with this democracy Summer Seminar and thank you again congressman for putting this front and center on your agenda a standing ovation at home to Greg Moore and to Professor Ellis case art for giving us really a remarkable and compressed history of the struggle for the right to vote the continuing struggle for the right to vote and why the young people in democracy summer are such essential players at every level I mean we are not remotely through the struggle over democracy we've got the struggle over the Electoral College and the National popular vote campaign which I introduced in Maryland is my very first bill and Maryland passed it and we now have 13 states trying to break away from this rickety and obsolete system to have a national popular vote by having an interstate compact in which all of the states agree to cast their electors for the winner in the national vote we've got the problem of gerrymandering the teal with we've got millions of left out citizens in DC in Puerto Rico and American Samoa Guam Virgin Islands we've got millions still of former prisoners were disenfranchised in seven or eight states and despite the fact that the vast majority of states have said no we're gonna allow former prisoners vote and now we've got this whole new generation of problems that's great more tells us with kovat nineteen we saw what happened in Wisconsin where the state Supreme Court overrode the governor who said we're going to delay the election so we can institute vote-by-mail voting from home and the republican-controlled Supreme Court said no you got to have it in two days and so we saw as Greg was telling us hundreds of poll workers who didn't show up because they're in high-risk categories and they were afraid so lots of creasing polling places that just lay fallow and nothing happened with them and in some of the largest jurisdictions like Milwaukee and Madison there were three two or three huge precinct places for literally tens of thousands of people waiting hours and hours to go and vote so with all of that I want to ask this question and then Bob you can prepare to get the fellas questions and what do you think our democracy summer fellows need to be working on this summer understanding our major constraint is that we are not going out doing door-to-door registering people to vote in person we are on the phones we are on the internet I what do you think are the critical voting rights efforts or struggles that we need to be involved in and let's start with you press ok sorry then we'll come back to you Craig you know I'm not sure I can prioritize the different activities then you have to be done did the whole was an immense amount that needs to be done and yes it's you know do we get doing it on the phone but I think that I think that this is a moment I think well I think one thing that has to be done is gathering the information and distributing the information to counter the Republican arguments or some Republican arguments voting by mail the subject is going to be subject to fraud and should be permitted I mean that's that's a current argument and it's baseless but you know the Democracy fellows in doing whatever organizing they should know that that's baseless and they should have the facts of their command to be ready to do that they should be in whatever fashion they can really really encouraging their colleagues other young people to absolutely guarantee that they will vote I mean one of the disappointing things for me in the last twenty or thirty years is that there have been a lot of years when before the election who said AHA it looks like the youth vote will be up and and young people were more engaged and then it has it hasn't happened coming here which 2016 the young people did not vote the very high numbers it did changed in 2018 and I found that very encouraging and I think that this particular group of people can help that the change to remain changed in 2020 great Craig how about you congressman I think we temporarily lost Craig but we're trying to get it back let's go to some questions and your questions so yes the first question we have is from Richard Palmer whose fellow is it coming out like he's coming online yeah great let's see just a moment in the meantime in the meantime Claire pfann could you could you ask your question I don't see an area where I can start my video sorry about that I'm I'm working on that but for now could you just ask it yeah yeah sure so I know Asian American turnout rates are often very low so I was wondering going forward how are we working to increase that and is the Asian American vote becoming increasingly important awesome I no if Greg is back you know Craig Greg has worked in that field if he's not back let me just say I'm hoping that over the course the summer we're gonna have Dale Ho who is a really a leading voting rights specialist for the ACLU come on and talk about the Asian American community and both efforts to suppress that vote by right-wing enemies but also what's being done so at least until Greg comes back let's just reserve that hang on to that question Thank You Claire and go to the next one okay Suroosh could you ask your question yes if you look across the country there like as you guys are talking about there's like a lot of different voter suppression laws and if you look back like nineteen sixties the whole purpose of the Voting Rights Act was to combat like stay order suppression so what like currently what federal action could be taken to counteract those voter suppression measures like voter ID and also mandate things like early voting and no excuse absentee options in every state would it be something like a Voting Rights Act 2.0 or and what would be the biggest obstacles to making that happen well let me take the first shot at it thank you sir ish the Voting Rights Act 2.0 is exactly the right idea we passed it as part of HR 1 which was the comprehensive democracy reform package that the Democrats started off with when this Congress the 116th Congress began the major obstacle to it is summed up very easily the Republican Party they voted against it we passed it HR 1 passed the house but McConnell said he's not taking it up and it's got a full range of voting rights reforms in there including Universal mandatory voter registration which of course has done in dozens of democratic countries instead of there being all these obstacles to registering people to vote you're just automatically registered it goes along with your Social Security card it goes along with just you know turning 18 so there are a lot of things that we put in there that is the main problem it's kind of like the disease kills the cure we've got a lot of good legislative solutions but the Republican continuing Republican control of the White House and the Senate makes it impossible for us to make any progress on it and they've been blocking money that we want to send to the states for the purposes of having vote-by-mail in this election so we asked for four billion dollars in the Kiara's Act they said zero and we settled it 400 million which was ten percent of what we wanted not nearly enough and we're trying to get the rest in the heroes Act but of course they're dragging their feet on that and there's not much time left for the states to get contracts for vote-by-mail if they haven't already done it so a vote you know Voting Rights Act 2.0 is going to be necessary if we get the kind of landslide election we're fighting for in 2020 then we really should start with what Alex case are signing out which is a constitutional amendment guaranteeing everybody the right to vote and to be represented at every level of government okay can I come in on that also please I think you know I mean another path to trying to protect the right to vote is of course through state legislation and but at this point that requires I mean in effect I hate to make it sound like a partisan battle but it is it's electing more Democrats to state legislatures and electing with Democratic governors I mean either a number of voters to most of the voters suppressive efforts are coming from state governments now the history also tells us that we can't rely on the states to solve the problems over the long run because states have a long tradition of suppressing the particular people that they want to suppress which varies by state and that's what that's why Voting Rights Act 2.0 is absolutely essential but there are paths particularly in some states which are becoming more purple to make getting doing effective things at the state level great let's go the next question next up we have Richard Palma I'm good afternoon everyone my name is Richard Palma currently I'm on Montgomery College student my question pertains to voter suppression and I also want to thank professor kazar and please send my regards to mr. Moore when he gets back online but my question contains a voter suppression currently my concern is what's the most common form of voter suppression in the United States and what can passionate youth organizers do to dismantle set voter suppression in their respective states so what ballots do you want take a shot at it guy I have a reaction to but if you want to kick it off sure you know I it's hard to say what the most common is it really varies by place I mean voter ID laws which have not really institutionalized are you know are or a big obstacle in in many states and then you know there's kind of second-order obstacles that then get built into that so you have a voter ID law which requires you to get a certain document and then you close the offices where you might be able to get a hold of that document or make somebody travel 75 miles I think I think I think I think there's a there's you know there is a lot of variety at the same time you know not to be a little bit more hopeful there's some real evidence suggesting that when the community mobilizes and when when folks like yourself mobilize the fact is that the voter suppression laws end up in some places sort of increasing turnout because people are so angry and become very motivated to vote by being told that we're not going to let you do it he's Greg back I think so mr. Moore or either Gregg we are you back on to get sir well let me let me just me hear me now oh good yeah we got we got okay my apologies everyone I hit I hit the button the wrong way after I finished my comments but um could you just repeat that course I heard the word voter suppression but I didn't hear the rest of it boy you think what are the key tactics of voter suppression we need to watch out for if we want to stop it because the young people are very very disturbed about voter suppression what are the ones we need to watch out for it's point one well there's several things the first thing I would be the attempts to reduce the number of polling locations now we know they're doing that because of Coby at 19 but when you have one two and three polling locations which are reduced from say 300 as they did in Kentucky and they did in some of these places in counties in Georgia you're going to have a long line so you want to prevent that if there's any legislation that's pending that says we're going to expand mail invalid so that the state can mail out ballots or mail out applications for absentee ballots you want to support that effort if you have an organization you want to try and get as many people as you can to vote early if you have early voting but the main thing is that we have to be vigilant about Election Day it's going to be chaotic we don't even have to guess but we really have to make sure if we're going to be in line let's start setting up those structures for people to make that a day of voting and spend all the time we can between now and then trying to put pressure on election administration officials to ensure that the voting is going to be safe and that the resources are going to be there to ensure that people can vote yes sir but let me just add that's that's such an awesome statement Greg I wanted to add to it the practice of voter purges has been very diabolical and we saw that in 2000 where Kathleen Harris who was the secretary of state of Florida in charge of superintending the election and doubled as the campaign chair for the George w bush for president campaign she wrote a more than million dollar contract for a private consultant to purge people dubious voters from the rolls and they were purging people whose names remotely resembled the names of former prisoners I mean it's the most outrageous thing I've got some stuff in my book overruling democracy about it and there are entire books that have been written about what they did but you know somebody would be registered as you know Robert Johnson jr. and then they would purge them from the rolls that their name was Bob L Johnson you know she'd say yeah cast a wide net and of course that was in african-american neighborhoods Latino neighborhoods high you know neighborhoods with high numbers of Performing minority voters so the voter purges we've got to watch out for we got to be fighting on the other thing is all of those voter repression tactics and suppression and depression tactics that we haven't even seen yet but that just come up along the way because voter administration election administration is actually extremely complex and there are thousand decisions that are made all the time I was watching the news the other night when they closed the polls in Kentucky at the awesomely early time of 6:00 p.m. I couldn't believe that the polls we're closing at 6:00 p.m. but what working person can make it to the polls afterward after work if they weren't able to get you know the kids off to school make breakfast and get to work by 9:00 and they had to go after work and they closed the polls at 6:00 but anyway there was this huge line of people waiting outside of one of the few polling places they had left open in Lexington Kentucky and the rule is certainly in Maryland in any other state I know that if you're in line before the polls close you're okay even if you're six blocks away at that point they draw the line after the last person right when the clock hits 8 p.m. but at 6 p.m. and instead of going to the end of the line which was a few blocks away they just locked the doors and they said if you're not in the building you can't vote now nobody's ever seen that one before there wasn't anything particular that could have been done but people started banging on the windows and luck there were voting rights lawyers on the spot who immediately began making calls and you know getting their injunctions ready to go in but mobilizing the community getting the media out so you know the I guess the final answer is we don't know all of the mischief that they're up to right now we didn't know everything that they were going to be doing with Putin in 2016 in terms of the cyber sabotage against the DNC and the d-triple-c and Hillary Clinton's office we didn't know all that stuff that came out later so but now people are alert and we've got to be basically defending the barricades at every turn every state every polling place all of the political institutions against all these forms of sabotage let's go to the next question thanks for that great one so Claire pfann is back I'm Claire and I'm a rising senior at Churchill High School and I know that Asian American turnout rates are often very low so I was just wondering what we're doing to address that and if the Asian American vote is becoming increasingly important great Craig will you take that yes this is again an area of under participation over the years and so people of color in general have been underrepresented in our electoral system we know for a fact that the discrimination and some other abuse against the Asian Pacific community Asian American community is growing because of this president and so we don't want to do anything to create fear or create any hesitation on a part of our brothers and sisters to fully excuse their right to vote so we want to hopefully be a coalition of conscious people of color progressive forces who are basically looking out for any problems that there might exist I know there's a lot of organizations working on bilingual ballots because I know there provisions in the Voting Rights Act from 1975 that allows for bilingual provisions to be given to communities that need the different language requirements four ballots but we want to make sure there's that consideration being given by local boards of Elections and secretaries of state let's keep the pressure on them and let's make sure we do what we can to including everybody in this selection grading let me just add to a Claire thank you so much for raising that essential point the president has been making on an almost daily basis a series of racist remarks designed to gin up anti-asian sentiment in America memory keeps talking about the clung foo that's now his major go-to rhetorical device at these Sikh disease-spreading rallies he's been conducting and we know that that is actually a point of danger for Asian Americans to be stoking that kind of racist sentiment in the country and we want to make sure that it does not show people's willingness to participate in voting and that's another reason we need vote-by-mail so people can vote from home and the event that they're afraid to go to the polls because the president has been stirring up all this anti asian-american sentiment so we will stay on this and we're going to be working on in this summer clear and thank you so much for participating let's go to the next one if we get next look we have Isabel to ask for question hello my name is Isabel it's iya I am a rising sophomore at college Frederick Maryland it was very awesome to hear both professor kazar and mr. Moore and Senator askance becomes Laura suppression is youth what I really wanted to bring up was the gubernatorial race between Stacey Abrams and Georgia Governor Brian Kemp we were talking about voter purge again him being the second and with him being the Secretary of State I was reading statistics on this because when I was writing an essay last semester about how a student secretary of state he had the power to grant voter voter IDs to to prospective voters in in the Atlanta area and in October there were over 50,000 not that yeah over I might be in the number on but they were a significant amount of voter IDs that still hadn't been granted in brine Ken's office but Brian Kemp was also the person who ended up running and winning oh yes um my question was why um why do you think um he was not investigated for corruption or held again actually when he was that Secretary of State that could have that set that precedent what is about what an awesome question I'm gonna kick it over to Greg Moore but before I do I I've got to say this America's UNIX elections are unique because we have thousands of electoral jurisdictions across the country you know you go to Canada or you go to Mexico there is a Mexican Electoral Commission there's a Canadian Electoral Commission they're made up not of partisans and elected officials but they're made up of independent nonpartisan people whose job it is is just to administer the election fairly and neutrally without favor to any side then you come to America and you get situations just like that's a perfect example with Brian Kemp who's supposed to be overseeing the election making sure everybody gets the right to vote but he's also running as governor and there are all these people being purged and that's what stacey abrams in this magnificent campaign she's organized is blowing the whistle about that they purged tens of thousands or even more than a hundred thousand voters and there was record turnout but lots of people got turned away from the polls so um you know and maybe why are we not getting prosecution and by Bill Bar in Donald Trump well one guess about that I mean it's a completely partisan railroad of the democracy but Greg you take it from there if you would well yes and this sounds so much like what happened to us in Ohio in 2004 Secretary of State was Ken Blackwell he was the co-chair of the bush for president campaign committee not only was he the co-chair but he took steps throughout the course of leading up to their campaign to to make it harder to have boats counted they were two hundred and fifteen thousand uncounted votes on the morning that the John Kerry conceded the race which means all those provisional ballots were never most of them will never count and we knew that 78% of those ballots get Americans what happened in Georgia was a rout was a repeat of that except in this instance their voter registration advocacy groups that had done massive voter registration they presented those applications at the end of the term at the deadline when a lot of us registered toward the end but they never processed those all of those ballots in time to be put into the poll books the poll books are the place where you store all the registered voters so if your name doesn't show up in the poll book you register but it hasn't been transferred over it's one of those my new details but that can lead to several hundreds if not thousands if not tens of thousands of people having a vote provisional because they did everything right but the administration of our elections was wrong I could say one more thing Jamie is that please the election assistance Commission was defunded by the Republican Congress for four years they block funding they stopped the Commission from meeting they wouldn't allow advisory boards to meet and it wasn't until 2014 did they even appointed the commissioners enough to get a quorum that was on purpose because these election administration issues would have been fixed if you had a fully functional and fully funded election assistance Commission and the resources to move dollars to States to upgrade their systems see this is my design and we have to just keep being vigilant about this fight terrific and I don't know Alex if you want to say anything on this one to this one okay so I think we got to do is go to our final question and then we'll ask our panelists each to to to wrap up and I'll have one thing to say it's if it everybody I drew today so what do you got so I you had said you want to ask a question of both nameless about if there's any historical precedent for US president working this openly and aggressively to suppress the vote give me a president United States yeah okay if both of you guys would take a shot at this I mean are we in a completely unique territory or do we romanticize the past too much and it's actually been just as bad with other presidents and use that as a way to give us whatever concluding remarks you have let's go to Alex first up again I can't think of any I certainly know of historical examples we're suppressing the vote of the of the other party was was part of the strategy that's you know that's not new a number of years ago I had an assistant do some some engrams of the phrase vote suppression or voter suppression and there are two peaks in it most the phrase is it use very often there's no peak at the end of the 19th century and a peak at you know in the early 21st century and what's interesting about both of those periods that their periods that follow in the wake of the acquisition of some political power by african-americans and period their periods of high immigration where immigrants are starting to acquire political power it's a voter suppression usually it is not to get the focus more directly on your question Jamie it's usually not openly choreographed or cheered on by the candidate himself or by a sitting president but certainly you know that there were prominent political actors I mean you know it's known for example that the man who later became Justice and Chief Justice Rehnquist was in Arizona involved in voter suppression efforts decades before that I think that I guess my concluding remarks here are that I don't come away from this history even though I can easily point to precedence and and and I can locate what's going on right now in terms of broad historical patterns I have worries that go beyond that in in this a Oh in this election I think you know what but what Jamie was saying before about we don't even know about the ways in which things might go wrong and the fact that that this election is in fact going to be administratively very complicated with a lot of you know counting mail and certifying mail-in ballots County it's going to be very complicated and what I I guess in the end the sober note that I would that I would come to at the end is that I think that mr. Trump and those around him have signaled an interest in having an outcome that they can say is not legitimate and that concerns me a great deal and I think that's something that we all in our own way we can have to be alert to yeah that they would want to set the stage for some kind of revision or just divorce from the electoral process right or just to state you know I alluded to this earlier you know if you sample mine you know this is one nightmare among many for those of us who are in the voting business these days but to create a situation where they're disputed and challenges a disputed or challenged outcome in a state to a couple of states which are close it's taking weeks to count the ballots and then the legislature of the state says nope you know actually this is this is not this has not been a good and clean election so we're gonna choose the electors by ourselves and if it's a Republican legislature in Wisconsin or Ohio or North Carolina we know what they'll do exactly yeah thank you so much Alex great let's come to you for your closing thoughts on this Thank You Jamie again for inviting me to be a part of this and thanks for all the courses that came up and for the other panelists and professor thank you for your comments as well I believe that this election will be unlike any other lecture in our history one of the most contentious and contest elections and so we have to prepare for is the fact that we do have a president who is going to do it the congressman said try and discredit the results of this election because I think he sees the way it's going well we have to fight against is a few things one we have to fight against fear let's not be afraid tubal let's not be afraid to turn out let's not be afraid of how long it's going to take second we have to be vigilant and we know that the election may not be called on November third we may have to go two weeks three weeks in fact in 2000 you will all remember it was a while before the Electoral College met because there was a contestant vote in Florida so my guess is that we will have a president who will be reluctant it's not defiant in this election results no matter what they are and so we have to make sure we're there make sure provisional ballots are counted make sure contested ballots are counted to make sure overseas ballots are counted and make sure that we stay involved with the process and keep our eyes on the prize as you can see from a professor's presentation the right to vote is a long battle it won't be won this year it won't be one next year it's going to keep being a battle but if you could stay with this and this democracy summer seminar as I look at it represents a lot of information that will help you throughout the process to gain a better it's going to be great activists so I'm very proud of my work now the work that I've done over the years but I just encouraged all of you to continue your work and keep in the fight I'll be there with these long as I can and sorry my visual kind of lost it but I hope I didn't lose my voice on this Thank You Gregg more than you you have never lost your voice you know we are a thousand percent with you on anything that you need and we are so grateful to you for the extraordinary work that you've done in the past and you're doing in 2020 professor case our let's also add our voice in praise of your amazing work your book the right to vote which is indispensable which I recommend to all the democracy summer fellows want to read more deeply into the history of the struggles we're talking about thank you for being with us too and I want to close with this thought I you know I went to a number of the protests which I have found just utterly amazing and uplifting and I didn't see any violence except for the right-wing white supremacists that I've seen on TV trying to spark violence in different places but at one point we were chanting this is what democracy looks like and somebody spotted me and said wait a second your Congress rascal I said yeah and then she said you're saying this is what democracy looks like why are you saying that I said well this is what democracy looks like democracy looks also like what goes on on the floor of Congress sometimes it's nowhere near as pretty as what's going on in democracy summer because that's what democracy looks like - in this conversation to me is just the epitome of democracies people making a passionate engagement with the process with the issues of the time with the values of the time to make sure that everybody gets to participate so I want to commend all of the democracies summer fellows all of our participants who've decided to drop in from outside again Greg Moore professor case' I want to thank Paul Ellis Matti crack off the whole democracy summer team for putting this together next week we will be I believe July 3rd we'll get you more details with Reverend William barber and the subject will be actually the theme of our democracy summer this summer which is is it time for a third and final reconstruction in America have all the elements come together with black lives matter and the young people's revolution and democracy summer and the agitation for change are all the elements they are for us actually to get back to powerful interracial progress on all of the critical issues of the time public health and climate change and police brutality and violent racism and on and on and on are we ready to do it that's what we'll be looking at next time thank you for tuning in and we'll see you next week for the democracy Summer Seminar series thanks everyone thank you thanks to great thank you so much good luck everybody

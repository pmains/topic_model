what i was hearing mr chairman was that biden's transition from fossil fuels is gonna chat is gonna we gotta have alternative employment uh if we're gonna do that and and uh but we look at what john kerry said president biden he says president biden wants workers to have alternatives he goes on to say to make solar panels gina mccarthy says workers from coal communities will be quote put to work making solar panels and even vice president o'hara said displaced workers coal miners can work quote reclaiming abandoned land mines i'm not sure she meant to say that but nevertheless that's what was said so i'm saying that mr chairman let's be fundamental there are no solar panels or wind man wind turbine manufacturing plants in gillette wyoming hazard kentucky caddus ohio or welch west virginia these are communities that are based on fossil fuels with downstream jobs and steel fabricating concrete plants machine shops so i i just i don't understand what these alternatives since these towns and these workers don't have other alternatives you understand these are small towns they don't have choices

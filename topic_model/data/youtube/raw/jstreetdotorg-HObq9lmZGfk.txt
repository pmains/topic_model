hello J Street I'm so sorry I can't be there with you in person but I'm glad to have the opportunity to talk to you today I want to thank you for the critical work you do to ensure pro-israel pro-peace voices are represented in our political debate I believe in the Worth and value of every Israeli and every Palestinian and I believe that the way we respect all parties is through a two-state solution this is the best outcome for US interests the best outcome for Israel's security and future and the best outcome for ensuring Palestinian rights freedom and self-determination a two-state solution ensures an end to Israeli occupation it also will mean the creation of a sovereign Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip living alongside Israel in peace and security I believe that Israel is a strong and important ally I am committed to Israel's security and safety and to cooperating closely on the threats the Israelis face from Hamas Hezbollah and Iran but let's be clear we can speak out against the far right wing policies of the Netanyahu government like annexation and settlements while supporting Israel just as we speak out against President Trump while supporting the United States as president I will take immediate steps to fix the damage caused by Donald Trump's reckless policies I will welcome the Palestinian general delegation back to Washington and I will reopen an American mission to the Palestinians in Jerusalem I will make clear that in a two-state agreement both parties should be able to have their capitals in Jerusalem I will also immediately resume aid to the Palestinians and financial support to Unruh and focus on fixing the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza and on bringing greater freedom and prosperity to the people in the West Bank we must find ways to make tangible progress on the ground toward a two-state solution sometimes that might mean finding ways to apply pressure and create consequences for problematic behavior as previous Democratic and Republican presidents have done for example if Israel's government continues with steps to formally annexed the West Bank the US should make clear that none of our aid should be used to support annexation achieving a just and lasting peace won't be easy but we must persist and we must lay a foundation that enables Israelis and Palestinians to move beyond the broken status quo toward a brighter future and I look forward to working with J Street as we build that future a future where Israelis and Palestinians can live together in peace freedom security and prosperity

Mr Speaker I yield one minute to the gentlewoman from California the Democrat leader miss Pelosi generally from California is recognized generally is recognized Thank You mr. Speaker I thank congresswoman slaughter I ranking member on the Rules Committee for the time and also more importantly for a great leadership in so many ways and in so many ways it has been about her advocacy for the priorities of American people and so today we have on the floor of the house legislation that is a serious matter about suing the President of the United States instead of doing the people's business which is what mrs. slaughter and others have advocated for whether it's bringing good-paying jobs home creating jobs by building the infrastructure of America reducing the cost of higher education for family investing in our children raising the minimum wage passing legislation have equal pay for equal work everything that would increase the financial stability of America's families instead we are wasting their taxpayers time and money on the floor of the house and a matter that is serious but is a waste of time there are those who have said that this says initiative to sue the president of the United States is a step toward impeachment others who say no it's instead of impeachment I told the speaker that I had a similar situation years ago are not similar in terms of of the subject because I think there's no basis for this and no standing on this house on on the subject of suing the president but similar in that there were calls by some to impeach President Bush when we took the majority and P we're very unhappy about the Iraq war and the false claims made to draw the American people and to support of that war effort which proved to be untrue it wasn't about people in your caucus clamoring for suing the president it was about hundreds of thousands of people in the streets objecting to the war in Iraq and the false basis on which we went in but when I became speaker and people clamored for the impeachment of the president I said what I advised the speaker to say right now impeachment is off the table if this isn't about impeachment that simple sentence will be a clear one impeachment is off the table why hasn't the speaker said that why are there those in your caucus who won't deny that that is a possible end in sight for this ill-fated legislation that you bring to the floor we're going to adjourn tomorrow for five weeks five weeks leaving unfinished business here we need to solve problems for the American people to create opportunities for them but that kind of legislation is nowhere in sight whether it's job creation reducing the cost of higher education equal pay for equal work raising the minimum wage some which I already mentioned we have precious few hours remaining to act on the priorities of American people and finish the can't wait business before the Congress so much needs to be done the immunity marant arian situation at the border which provides an opportunity for us to do the right thing the Highway Trust Fund to deal with it appropriately and give it the proper amount of times that are brushing it through but once again republicans are putting the special interest in the house of impeachment hungry extremists before the needs of the nation the lawsuit is only the latest proof of hazzard problems contempt and disregard for the priorities of the American people it is yet another Republican effort to pander to the most radical right-wing voters at taxpayers expense 2.3 million dollars spent defending DOMA a doomed case defending DOMA more than 3 million dollars on the Select Committee to exploit Benghazi and by the way something that had been investigated again and again at the very admission of leaders on the Republican side it why are we doing this and then this which we don't have a price tag on that they will reveal to us but again why would you sue somebody unless you want to prove something and why would you go down that path unless you wanted to do something about it but the fact is Republicans in Congress have no standing on this suit most constitutional scholars have or do admit that even your expert witnesses have in the past said you don't have standing on it middle-class families don't have time partisan grudge match with the president they know this is a it's a funny thing because well funny and the one strange interpretation of the words funny but on the day a couple of weeks ago in the steps of the Capitol House Democrats were there to launch our middle-class jumpstart about some of the issues I raise job creation here in the US affordability for college early childhood education all of those things equal pay for equal work raise the minimum wage we were doing that on the steps of the Capitol and in the capitol buildings the Republicans were launching their lawsuit against the president what could be more different in terms of addressing the needs of the American people we made the point that this was all happening on the same day but the fact is that difference of focusing on progress and job creation and process and do nothing is what we live through here every single day and today is another one of those days on the floor of the house so let us recognize us what this is serious serious on a path to nowhere or maybe among some of your ranks a path to impeachment but if we just want to talk about the lawsuit it behooves the Speaker of the House to say impeachment is off the table I hope we can hear that soon and then we'll see what the merits of our this case are I have no standing it has no merit it has a political basis and let the American people judge it for what it is if you don't want people sit use the word impeachment as your people have done then tell them impeachment is off the table that's what I had to do that's what this speaker should do I yield back the balance of my time

rand paul senator good morning to you good morning uh you listen to the reporting there what do you make of this why i think the most i think the most important thing is that the investigation can't be done by the who or an international group but it also can't be done by americans who are involved with funding the lab so dr fauci and his hand-picked person from eco health they can't investigate themselves because they gave the money to the lab they have a conflict of interest and a desire to make sure nothing bad is discovered that could have occurred with nih money so they can't be the investigators either this is very important i think dr fauci should be made to testify under oath about the money that was given to the lab and the good news is yesterday i passed an amendment on the senate floor that says no more gain of function money can be sent to china this is very important because this could happen again i mean they are experimenting with the sars virus which is 15 times more deadly than kovid 19. kovid 19 kills about 1 but that's been 3 million people more than 3 million people if sars got out of lab that could be 50 million people so this is a very important task ahead of us okay we have a we have 11 labs in our country that do this kind of research you raised a number of interesting points let me see if i can knock off as many as i can in the next few minutes here uh we are told that the nsc the national security council is the one that's running this investigation now is that acceptable i think it needs to be a bipartisan commission not just the administration i think really this should not be a partisan issue and i think yesterday we demonstrated that democrats will vote for some uh repercussions on this but i don't know that the administration can investigate this particularly since they've shut down the previous administration's investigation so i'm worried that they're trying to cover up the government's involvement our government they would argue they haven't shut it down and i i mean maybe it is just a question of whether it's in this silo of the state department or in this silo over here at the national security council stand by for more on that you mentioned anthony fauci here he was on the hill about the funding for that lab and wuhan and what was legitimate and what was not watch about six hundred thousand dollars over a period of five years so it was a modest amount there was nothing in the grant application that would call for what is referred to as gain of function gain of function meaning taking a virus that could infect humans and making it either more transmissible and or pathogenic humans okay so a couple of things in there this take the value of the dollars he mentioned six hundred thousand over five years is that a lot does that matter uh sure well sure it's a lot it actually there are some reports that it added up to millions over time but the other thing he said is that there was no gain of function in the application there are scientists who have looked at the application and absolutely and categorically disagree with him they say the application did include gain of function the other evidence we have is that dr she from the wuhan lab published a paper that is clearly about gain of function and in that she thanks dr fauci and his group for funding that paper so there's a lot of contradictions going on the bottom line is he cannot investigate himself he was responsible for giving this money so he has every incentive incentive to cover it up and not reveal the truth about it because if the pandemic did come from the lab he would have great culpability in this so he can't be investigating this nor can any of his people that he picks be investigating us he needs to be excluded from the investigation so you allege today this is a cover-up is that what i hear no what i'm saying is is that there could be a cover-up because there's an incentive about people like dr fauci not to uh reveal anything because he would be then culpable because he was in charge of funding this lab okay one more thing i want to squeeze in here the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases earlier james freeman wrote about this in the wall street journal a few days ago the quote from that group was it's impossible for us to be aware of nor can we account for all of their activities just final word on this senator i think that's true and one of the strongest evidence that this came from the lab is they haven't been able to find the virus in any animal nobody no they tested thousands of animals in the wet market none of them tested positive for covid so there's a lot of things that need to be investigated but so far a lot of the evidence is pointing towards the lab well senator thank you for coming on today it continues okay the mystery there deepens rand paul from the hill thanks

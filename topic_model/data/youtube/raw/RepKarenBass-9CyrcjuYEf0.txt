good evening everyone it is so good to speak with you in the town halls I always run into constituents at the grocery store or other places and they tell me how they enjoy these town halls and I always enjoy speaking with you I wanted to do this town hall because the student loan issue I know has been a critical issue in our district from oh my goodness from the time I became a member of Congress and at different points in time we've had in-person town halls and workshops to work on your specific issues with your specific loans but we all know what President Biden did and we're going to talk about that we are so fortunate to have two experts who are with us today on the call who will be able to answer your questions about student loans let me introduce our guests and let me just thank them so much for taking the time to be on this call I know so many constituents have questions and we want to just get right to it we're going to ask them to do a presentation and then get right to your questions our first expert is Daria uh Jimenez from UC Irvine law school and Devon Graves formally of UCLA and now is at Cal State Stanislaus so darier um why don't you take it away the scene you might have heard in the news recently the 10 000 or 20 000 um in forgiveness or cancellation of federal student loans that President Biden announced as an executive action that will apply to people whose single income is 125 000 or less so who or whose joint household income is 250 000 or less and the difference between the 10 and the 20 is if the person ever took out a Pell Grant whether that was as an undergrad just at any point in time uh those who had a Pell Grant obituary people who were particularly needy at the time um of a receiver programs for a particularly duty at that time they will uh get up to twenty thousand dollars in cancellation and that will apply to All Federal loans um that are currently held by the Department of Education which you can check uh by going to a national student loan Clearing House um database if you search for those words National genome Clearinghouse you can get a login and see what student loans you have if you have loans that are held by the federal government then when the program rolls out which we are being told is through an application that will be available in October you'll be able to apply and basically submit proof of evidence that your income qualifies and then once that's processed basically the the amounts will be reduced I want to turn it for a second to Professor graves because I think he might have had some more to say on this bit well thank you opportunity I want to also highlight some of the other key aspects that came out of this was undergraduate loans if you have undergraduate loans they can cap repayment at five percent of monthly income and the student loan payment pause has been extended through December 31st 2022 which means that payments will resume in 2023 also more importantly tied to this is information about Public service loan forgiveness that has been a huge reform undertaking by this government and the Department of Education has announced limited time changes to pslf that have a deadline in October for borrowers who worked in um military federal state tribal or local governments or non-profits at any point can have some of those payments count towards Public service loan forgiveness so this is a lot of Reform a lot of change and I'm looking forward to participating and answering the questions so that folks have the information they need to go about making the best decisions for themselves yeah and I want to just add um to that that there is a lot of information a lot of changes that are ongoing um and Department of Education is suggesting that everyone sign up for their um sort of email alert on student loans uh information in particular and that website is Ed like education ed.gov government slash subscriptions s-u-b-s-c um r-i-p-t-i-o-n-s subscriptions like email subscriptions and um the very first thing there's a bunch of things you can sign up for but the very first one is about student loan announcements and so if you sign up there for an email you will receive information when the application for example for the student loan forgiveness of 10 or 20 000 when that becomes available you will receive more information when the income driven repayment caps are actually effective or the professor Grace talked about um and so I highly recommend doing that if any anytime that there's a change for instance right now the payment pause will end on December 31st it's not likely to be extended but if it were extended it would be you know you would get an announcement through that um the last thing I'll say on on this uh you know or another thing I'll say I guess is um the pause is going to end on December 31st which means sometime in January you'll um if you have a federal student loan those will be will begin to come in um the best thing I can suggest to anyone in that situation is to sign up for an income driven repayment plan um and there's a another website here that will help you do that studentsaid.gov IDR student aid aid.gov IDR which stands for income driven repayment um and there's it's a complicated mass of payment plans that are potentially available to you but the tool at that website helps you figure out what is available um because not all loans are eligible for all types of repayment plans and what is um uh you know what's the best choice for you to lower your monthly payments if you do this before December 31st then whenever your first bill arrives you will then begin with that new payment amount and not the standard repayment amount which is almost always higher um than uh you know than whatever income Journal repayment would have done for you and just so you know some people may actually qualify for a zero dollar income driven repayment um because essentially you know you don't have enough income per the various programs um you know to pay your student loans and so you will be able to pay zero dollars okay nothing at all so long as you have certified uh your income and done the application for IDR um so I highly recommend doing that before December 31st foreign thank you thank you both so much and let me just um take a step back and give you a proper introduction Professor Jimenez of UC she said prep professor of the Menace spent a year as part of the founding staff of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau which I don't know if you were there during the years that Trump and the Republicans went after it and tried to eviscerate the the consumer part uh of these I I was that was not there at the time I was there but 30 from this very beginning it was it was a hard slide I appreciate you and the work that you've done uh and Professor Amendment currently directs the UCI student loan law initiative that aims to think deeply yet practically about the future of student loans and education financing and Professor minutes if it doesn't take us too much off uh Off the Mark I'm always amazed at uh understanding that how much money the government makes from student loans and I've never quite understood uh why we make money off of our young people um our our second guest uh Professor Graves was nice enough to have spoken at Taco Tuesday that we held a few years ago that was a specific event in-person event that we held um talking about student loans a few years ago and then at UCLA his research focuses on community colleges financial aid race and racism and fortunately another example of our bubble I'm sure that Professor Graves is not having to struggle with CRT critical race Theory which has turned into a boogeyman and is just really a way for people to say they don't want full U.S history taught you can actually teach about race and racism at UCLA and since you've joined the faculty at Cal State Santa Claus and the department of advanced studies in education you've also were appointed by the governor to serve on two of California's higher education governing boards the Student Aid Commission which administers two billion dollars in State financial aid programs and you were a student region so why don't we move to questions and I would ask our moderator if you could please uh we were going to begin with a poll question as we always do and then uh we will I will read some questions for our guests excellent thank you so much we'll get to those polls here want to remind everyone to get in line with your question comment concern please press zero now to get a started off poll question we want to know do you have student loan debt press one for yes and two for no again the discussion of the night do you have student loan debt press one for yes and two for no while everyone weighs in there I'll turn this back to you congressmember great so the first question is will private lender funded loans qualify with the loan forgiveness bill or is it only Federal loans and let me read another question what's the difference between student loan release and Pell Grants if you already have loans and they're only for giving up to ten thousand to twenty thousand what happens in the future foreign yeah go right ahead yeah so what's the difference I mean the first the first one I think they're related but uh but not exactly so so the cancellation of 10 000 or 20 000 only applies to loans at the Department of Education essentially controls or are due to them um right if the Department of Education is actually one of the largest banks in the world it only does student loans um it does about 40 billion dollars I'm sorry um 45 million people that it that um that you know have accounts quote unquote at the Department of Education and and 1.6 trillion dollars um of debt that it holds uh and so it only refers to those private lenders um you know the the department of teacher can't do anything about that that would need to be Congress through appropriation um so unfortunately only Department of Education or Federal loans can qualify uh and then the the Pell Grant is a grants program that you know uh basically uh I believe it only applies to undergrad um but it's for people who uh fill out the FAFSA the free uh federal student aid uh financial application um and and basically don't make enough money um uh them and their family and uh it even considers um assets they receive a a grant um you know for their studies and then of course eligibility to get uh federal student loans yeah I I and if I could just tag along uh Professor Jimenez if you received the Pell Grant at any time so one time all throughout your time in had your questions as an undergraduate you would be eligible for uh debt relief at the twenty thousand dollar amount so that's why knowing if knowing that you received the Pell Grant will help you understand the difference between the 10 000 and the 20 000 in debt relief that's right so the the people who um at any point at all received a Pell Grant even if that was you were an undergrad but all your loans are graduate loans or something like that the 10 000 and 20 000 cancellation announcements um I just want to make clear applies to all Federal loans and that doesn't matter what kind of Federal loans they are in the sense that they could have been taken out for undergraduate studies for um a certificate program no well yeah for for a two-year program um for a graduate program that doesn't matter it also doesn't matter how much how much you owe on them um and it doesn't matter how old they are um so all of those things uh you know what matters is the income qualification uh 125 000 uh for an individual or 250 000 for um uh for a two-person household and um those times that will be for 2020 or 2021 is what the administration has said so the lowest of those two um and um and and the only thing that matters between the 10 and 20 is the Pell Grant um uh having to received the program before oh go ahead I I was just going to tack on one area of releases for The Parent PLUS Loan so for any of our callers who help support their children go to college and took out that Parent PLUS Loan uh and you meet the income thresholds you will be eligible for loan forgiveness on The Parent PLUS Loan as well and if you yourself as a student receive the power Grant you would be eligible for up to twenty thousand in relief on the plus loan as well oh well thank you Professor graves because you just I was just going to ask you about um Parent Plus loans and whether or not parents actually can get relief and your answer to that is yes um another question is is there any relief for uh Educators um there is a Carrie Thorne from Pasadena she has student debt she was an early childhood educator and she wants to know is there any forgiveness for educators yeah so the thing I want to say that most important right now because it's time limited is that the Public service loan forgiveness program which has existed since 2007. um but has gotten a bad rap uh uh charity it's had a bad rap because very few people have actually been able to get through it um given that the barriers basically in terms of all the requirements um that people had to meet in order to have a payment or a month but they were in name payment um count um where there is a limited waiver of many of those requirements that is currently in effect that expires as October 31st and October 31st is a date by which you have to do at least two things in order to make your previous employment at a public service employer and that means government schools or any non-profit any 501c3 and it doesn't matter what your role was what matters at those jobs what matters is what your employer was whether your employer is a public service employer um so you don't have to be a teacher you can just work at a school um or you know in any level of government um or any non-profit so those people who are in those situations they may have payments in it and they may think many of them in fact I talked to them and they say oh I already tried that the public service won't forgiveness and I was told my services told me I wasn't eligible I was in the wrong plan my loans weren't eligible um and so basically I give up well during this very limited time until October 31st um you can apply for the waiver to count many of your previous uh employment um history as a payment including the entire two and a half years or so that we have been uh the federal student loan payments have been paused um that entire time period even though you've had you have not had to pay any money and you probably haven't paid any money um that entire time period can count as a payment uh you know in quotes um for the purposes of the public service forgiveness which at the end of the day in order to get to forgiveness it requires that you make uh or that you have 120 months of qualifying payments so it's about 36 months that will count um you know just if you were employed during that time for someone like uh like the caller that we were talking about um you know for someone in education and the website to do to look for that um and to start the application is studentaid.gov psls Public service loan forgiveness you have to apply um you have to if you have certain kinds of Federal loans you may have to consolidate your Federal loans which is a step that takes several days um and that the pslf um the studentaid.gov pslf website will tell you that you may need to do that before October 31st and you would also need to get your employer current employer or previous employer that you had to basically submit a form saying that you worked there at least part-time I'm sorry at least four to 30 hours um that you work there for whatever the period was so that those periods can be counted for your Public service loan forgiveness uh total and a lot of people I actually know a lot of people who thought they were it was totally hopeless for them and they submitted all their paperwork and it took about six months um you know for it to and it may take me a little longer as most people are submitting in it towards the end of the deadline but they submitted all those people work and now they have no more student debt um because if all these payments in the past uh were counted I just wanted to make sure to plug again um as Professor Jimenez was talking about applying for Public service loan forgiveness don't forget that you have to apply for the student debt relief as well and so that application will become live on through the Department of Education that's why it's important to sign up for the subscription so the ed.gov subscriptions so you can see when that application becomes live so you can submit your application so don't forget that applying for Public service loan forgiveness and the student debt relief are two separate applications okay I'm going to read another question um from Joe in L.A please the cream the screen will stay still I'm confused about the forbearance income driven I'm confused I'm I'm confused about the forbearance income driven plan I heard something about that lenders should have done it on the income driven plan but did forbearance instead and that loans should have been canceled by now is any of that true how can I apply for forgiveness as well I'm over 25 years uh out of college and I should have had enough years to qualify for zero income payment but I was put on forbearance which was difficult different lending rules I hope our professors can understand that question I don't know exactly but I have again a guest which is [Music] Consumer Financial Protection Bureau we sued Naviance and other services for putting people in forbearance um instead of driving them into income different repayment where they would also have a zero dollar repayment that this would be much better for their credit and it would count for things like Public service loan forgiveness what's not clear from the question is whether this person is actually eligible for public service on forgiveness which would have meant the date in these 25 years they worked at least 120 months it doesn't have to be continuous but at least 120 months um you know for a public service employer it is true that outside of this time limited waiver um you had to you could not be in forbearance and have a month's account for the 120 so you could have been in the right employer but if you were in forbearance um the the regular rules of pslf were very are very draconians and basically you could even though the that was the wrong place to put most people and their services did it you know unlawfully you would not have that payment card account but if the person is in this situation and they apply for the waiver um then they actually uh this payment would count all the forbearance payments um everything but in school determined basically uh so graduate students uh would you know who were also working as Pas or something they wouldn't be able to benefit from this because they would be in school uh deferment but if forbearance delinquents at times period uh periods will be made less than a full payment all of these things are waived during this waiver but again you have to apply studentaid.gov pslf and that application may require consolidation which is take some time so I would do this ASAP um you know uh because October 31st is the deadline but there will be steps that will uh take you beyond that if you start too late oh one other thing I wanted to say actually I'm sorry can I say one I think this would be really important and I doubt anybody will ask the question which is we are have been since March 2020 we have been um you know if federal student loans have been paused payments have been paused you haven't had to pay any money if you had a a Department of Education student loan and um your interest has not grown during this time which has been you know fantastic for people that is those payments um you know that pause period is gonna we start on January 1st during um the if you made any payments um During the period of the pause if you had Auto deduct you know auto payments on going out or if you paid off your loan as I've talked to some people they paid off their Loan in this period you can call your servicer that is whoever it is that you actually made the payment to whatever company uh you know mogula Nelnet navient any of them but you made the payment to and request a refund and they need to give you a refund if what you had was a loan that would have been subject to the pause but you made payment so this is a time in which you can actually get these payments back and especially if you're in the situation where actually the cancellation is going to erase um you know ten thousand dollars or twenty thousand and that would make a difference perhaps erase your entire student debt you can get some of that money back um but you have to do it before December 31st and uh and again what to do is to call your servicer response so they're not even sure that their application has been accepted what do you do after you apply on the website I assume they're talking go ahead go ahead oh no no we're supposed to remember this I just was uh answering the question in terms of there is an influx of folks on accessing these things so it's looking like four to six weeks of time to reviewing applications so the first piece of advice is continuing to check in with your servicer to see if there's any updates to your account Professor Jimenez is there anything else that you would add on to that um yeah I would say so I'm assuming this is a psls application Public Service on forgiveness because the other application for the cancellation hasn't yet been released um but the answer is probably similar which is it will take some time you should have received though something um through the web anyway that that basically uh you know you have submitted the application if you haven't heard anything you can um actually contact the Department of Education at 1-800 for fed Aid I should have the number those um it's f-e-d-a-i-d I don't have the actual numbers I'm sorry oh wait um 433-3243 1-800-433-3243 um and or you can actually chat with a live agent on their website studentaid.gov um and basically ask them if they have at least received your application I am hearing that people are getting um uh automated later letters uh sense fairly quickly after they apply even though the information in those letters may actually be incorrect it may actually say say you've been denied um and you know if you do get one of those letters call the number that is stated there uh that would be from your servicer but um but it's taking you know months for these applications to actually be uh processed so long as you get it in and you know that they've gotten it before October 31st you should be fine in the sense that you should you know you can later add more information or correct any information uh but you would have been gotten in by the deadline so Karen from View Park says she went on loans she went online to the student loan website and was trying to see if she qualified for the psls Forgiveness there was a tool there where she had to put in an EIN number and and she worked for a tribal um something which is federal I couldn't get anywhere on the site what can I do it's yeah so that's the psls tool studentaid.gov pslf and that um it does require it actually doesn't require it it just it's easier for them and so it really tries to steer you into typing essentially the tax ID number of your employer that's what an EIN is um employer identification number and then um from there it's kind of out of populate the form that you then give to your employer to verify that you uh we worked there for the period of time that you're saying if you can't um you know people have had success basically Googling their employer and Ein or asking their employer directly what is their tax ID number it's not a secret number or anything like that um the tool has some numbers you can just search by name but it definitely doesn't have everyone um and it might even have incorrect information uh is what I've been told unfortunately but if you have the number from your employer um record of your employer like you know through Google like if it's a public um you know if it's a public employer you should be able to find it then that's where to start um you know that's what to do and if you're having trouble the number I gave earlier the 1-800-433-3243 for fed Aid um that number is two is the Department of Education federal student aid which is the department that the part of the Department of Education that handles federal student loans um and so that's a person that works with the Department of Education um that should be able to give you a lot more guidance um I have a question here about an individual who has two loans in default and is in the income driven program she contracted her services and they had her complete an application and they told her it would take up to 10 days before they could process the application she wants to know how she can get her loans out of default and if she's even starting in the right place I don't know if the new policy assists people who are in default doesn't hmm you know I don't have the answer to that question uh um I think there is a way to get out of default that's the typical way I guess the end I don't know if there's anything special I'm not aware of anything special right now um but being an income German repayment again that that means you've gotten out you can't be an income during repayment and be in default you go ahead oh I'm sorry to catch up with those 10 minutes I just wanted to administer defaulted loans are eligible for the student loan debt relief so don't forget about that folks if your defaulted loan you're still eligible if you meet that income threshold so don't give up hope in terms of having defaulted loans absolutely and as we get ready to do our next poll question I want to let everyone know I know that we are reading out a lot of links to different resources during this call you can visit our website that's vast.house.gov forward slash student loan info which will have most of if not all of the links mentioned on this call so again this is just Congress member Karen's best website fast.house.gov forward slash student loan info so a lot of those links and resources that we've discussed on this call will be on there on that page so pulling question as promised would you be interested in attending an in-person student loan debt resource Fair press one for yes and two for no so again we want to know if you would be interested in attending an in-person student loan debt resource there press one for yes and two for no back to you congressmember well thank you very much and I want to ask a question from Justin from Redondo Beach a brilliant who um started his student debt in college when he was 13. he got a seven thousand dollar loan but he didn't even know about signing for that loan his credit score went way down and he's wondering if there's any way that that can be um rectified and he also wants to know how could he even sign for a loan at 13. he skipped four grades and graduated the University of Penn at 15 but he's wondering if he qualifies for debt release that's quite an interesting one that is a I mean um I don't so I I teach contracts as well as in general 13 year olds are not uh by themselves eligible to um enter into loans um in the sense that they're not the loan shouldn't be held against them uh if a lender wants to give them money that's sort of on them um if you're 17 or 16 and you're in college can you actually sign legally I they might when you're that close they might let you do it in the sense that you will um it gets complicated but basically 13 is very young uh and that would be I would be so I mean I um if their parents didn't sign anything the problem is that this is at recent um and so they probably this person has probably made payments already and so it's you know because it sounds like they're you know from a while ago so they are eligible for you know all the things we have discussed um but is there any specific relief for having taken out the loans at 13. um I I don't think so um unfortunately okay um Gabriel from Palm said that her husband went to culinary school that is no longer in existence and now we're still paying on this debt through Naviance uh duties loans qualify another person Christine has asked she has a daughter that just started college she wants to know will this plan be available in the coming years or is it just for this year I can answer that one it's just for this year we do need to make sure that we have another president like um that we need to make sure that we keep a democrat in the White House in the Senate and in the house otherwise um this will be the last time this happens so this is a very political thing and um Republicans are not supporting with this so how about that other question about um the culinary school the culinary school that closed so there is a separate program we haven't talked about yet called the borrower defense rule um that applies to people who went to schools that closed or um just closed for any reason or that that closed for basically lying or defrauding their students so think of your Corinthians your ITT Tech you know um those schools so this culinary school may be one of those or not but the um it is very complicated for people who went to Corinthian or ICC staff or any of them very large ones that the department itself essentially shut down um it is a little easier like I would I would suggest this person go to the studentaid.gov borrower defense d-o-o-r-r-o-w-e-r slash or I'm sorry Dash defense and um you basically apply for borrower defense um there and that could mean if total forgiveness of the student loans that were taken out to attend that school or partial forgiveness and so it's a separate program that obviously only applies to people who are in these situations um but it's definitely very worthwhile for the person to do this even if they might get otherwise you know the 10 or 20 000 as well Lori Harvey wants to know if is there any tax uh implications for participating in this program so uh right now there is not so doing this uh should not impact federal taxes so it's still not clear about the state implication for state taxes that there are not implications for federal taxes and that's another great thing about this reform that's taking place and there's a couple of people that that are asking questions that are uh uh in their 60s um one individual is trying to oh I lost it um she let's see she's 62 years old her financial status has decreased she still had the student loans did she have to make a certain amount of payments before she can get forgiveness another individual who was in their 60s uh wants to continue her education and uh she has she has 40 to 50 000 in student loans and she wants to she does she qualify if she is trying to go on for her PhD that she even though she's still in school and will go on to get her Masters if we're talking about the 10 or 20 000 not only does she qualify but if she's recently in school I've been in the last two years that means he's still got a FAFSA in the last two years that Federal application for student aid um then the Forgiveness may actually happen automatically the department has said that the the president and Department of Education has said that up to 8 million people will have their uh balances reduced automatically because they have enough income information from them enough recent income information that they can just do that administratively those people will not need to apply um and uh so so that's great um if she is actually going to school the age of the person you know doesn't matter the age of the loan uh doesn't matter um you know how whether or not you've ever made a payment does it matter um so I think both of those uh um both of those Scholars would actually you know be I mean other things matter like having a federal student loan but um but if they're in that situation then then the things they described as potential show issues I don't think are well here's a sad one the vet wants to know she's in her 60s and she says if she were to pass before these loans are paid off would my family then take on the remainder that is a sad question but there is a a notch bad answer I guess um no um for uh federal student that is uh there is a death discharge when the person dies and in general I mean there's a death sister to the debt the government just gives up all together but in general um any debt that is really one person said the the dead deceased person set um is not the other uh people you know it's not it's not their respect sorry it's not their inheritors uh you know their family members are not going to have to pay that debt the estate that is the remainder access that that person has may need to pay it but it's important to know as a family member of someone who passes away like you don't you know you may get calls from debt collectors being like Oh you need to call you need to pay your parents so your siblings or you know whatever is that but you really don't you're not on their hook for that debt it may be depending on very complicated laws that you know you don't don't get to inherit as much because some of the whatever you might have inherited needs to be used to pay um you know the creditors but it doesn't have to come out of your own personal money ever well I I can just say that I went through for years uh my daughter passed away and the um they tried to collect from me even though I had not co-signed on her loans and they they uh came after me for years for years and I sure that other people experience that they basically try to trick you to see if they can get you to to pay it back they make you think that you might be obligated even when you're not yeah unfortunately that's a that's a real issue the local bank will she qualified for this loan forgiveness also are there any plans to lower the interest rates on these loans to help people pay them off more efficiently so to answer that question a private loan I would not be eligible uh for the student debt relief and um there is still conversations about um reform in regards to interest rates but uh as a reminder um your undergraduate loan repayments on undergraduate debt can be capped at five percent of income so that's still ongoing conversations there and I also wanted to Circle back on to the Public service loan forgiveness so folks who are still make have 10 years of payments to go and you haven't apply for a public service student Public service loan forgiveness and started that process you can begin that process right away so having your services have your servicer Who currently will be mohila mohelia who is administering or servicing all Public service loan forgiveness you can start that process by getting your employment certification form I'm going and keeping track of that throughout your 10 years and keeping track of those 120 oh did we lose we I wanted to add something so I just hopefully he can jump back on I just I wanted to add on um that yeah just to stress that because I think we didn't make it so clear that the Public service loan forgiveness waiver the program continues it's ongoing since 2007. the waiver this limited time in which you don't have to meet the onerous requirements that uh that otherwise uh existed um that that period um allows you to basically add more months to the total pound 120 month count uh that is needed for for actual forgiveness and and by forgiveness Public Service on forgiveness is an Erasure of all the remaining debt whatever that is whatever that amount is the entirety of it after the 120 what are called qualifying payments is right now you don't have 120 you have them work 10 years in public service you maybe have only been out of school one year but you have been working in public service all of you should still apply it's where the waiver because the very least the last two and a half years of zero dollar payments because of the student loan payment pause that last two and a half years would count towards if you were working for a public service employer that would count towards 120 so you might not get you know if you haven't been working 10 plus years in public service you're not going to get all your loans erased but you would get your the count of the number of months that you have eligible for public service increase so it is still worthwhile even if you're not you know if you haven't been out a very long if you have been working for again any non-profit whatsoever 501c3 any 501c3 um a government a school um for the last uh any any time since 2007 which is when the Public service loan forgiveness program began uh you should do that waiver which again is at studentaid.gov pslf foreign well thank you thank you so much for your time I believe there's one other announcement from our um moderator about people who want to want us to contact them during the blackout period if you would like to go ahead and make that announcement excellent thank you it's so much congressmember that is very simple right now if you would like to be contacted by the office of Congress member Karen Das during this blackout period simply press one right now on the keypad on your phone again get that keypad out pressing one and that simply lets us continue to stay in contact with you continue to keep you updated with what's going on right now uh back to you congressmember oh and one more thing actually I'm going to jump in and repeat that website one last time sorry forgot to do that math.house.gov just our regular website baths.house.gov forward slash student loan info tons of information there go check it out everything hopefully mostly if not everything from tonight will be on that on that website now back to you congressmember absolutely so it's our goal to have a tape of this uh telephone town hall on the website because we know we gave you so much information and you know as always uh whenever there's something that happens in DC that impacts you that's a hot button issue I always like to do these Town Halls uh because we're close to the election I won't be able to do another one until after the election but we will certainly do one immediately after let me just thank Professor Jimenez and Professor Graves I'd like to ask both of you if there's any closing comments that you have but I just want to thank you so much for your time because this is such a complicated stressful issue for constituents and both of you have so much information and Clarity to give and I'm just very appreciative that you would take an hour out of your our couple of hours out of your busy schedule and uh and do this service for the constituents of the 37th District thank you very much and I'll let you two close yourself thank you very much congressmember it has been my pleasure this is um I dream about the student loan uh cancellation basically and working towards this with various coalitions for a long time so it's been my pleasure what I would say um as sort of closing remarks is to stay tuned um to you know to the news and to stay engaged this is as you mentioned Congress number a political issue and whether this ever happens again or whether there's other kinds of extensions for example um the public service on forgiveness waiver could be um you know expanded uh in time like you could have more time to do that that is a political issue I think people should stay involved and um you know speak to their members and speak to uh you know the president about uh what they think on those issues um and you know stay in touch and I want to Echo my thing Congress member and to your awesome team doing great work for the 37th congressional district I just want to pass on some advice to those still listening in this is difficult work but it's worth it and so take the time to find out your eligibility for student loan debt relief find out about public service on forgiveness and reach out to those resources that the Congress member will be having on her website because this we have to take advantage of this huge reform to higher education loan and financial aid so this is just important work and I appreciate to be a part of this conversation and I hope that um both of you would be open to us calling on you again in the future and once again thank you so much and thanks to everyone in the 37th congressional district good evening

Thank You chairman rakita I want to echo the Chairman's appreciation for the witnesses here today the open word crisis is having a profound impact on my constituents as well and I'm sure the stories we hear from the witnesses today resonate with many of the stories I've heard in Kentucky the opioid crisis is a public health emergency and Congress must continue working to face the epidemic that is that an impact on all aspects of our society unfortunately a problem is widespread as the opioid epidemic which has already had an impact of 11 and a half million Americans has also taken a devastating toll on local economies and the national economy as a whole and we're only beginning to see more clearly as the opioid have to worsen the economy will continue to suffer data from CDC analyzing opioid overdose deaths by age groups in 1999 and 2015 show that people most likely to die of an opioid overdose are between the ages of 25 and 39 years old these are people who have entire lives careers and untold contributions to make to their communities and our country ahead of them numbers are important but people with their own stories are at the heart of this crisis too Americans who live in some of the area's hardest hit by the opioid crisis including my home state of Kentucky they are seeing their co-workers bosses friends and family members suffer from this horrible affliction the administration and Congress are coming together to identify community-based solutions to combat this crisis but the day-to-day hard work fighting this outbreak has already been done on the ground by the people that face this issue every day the witnesses we have gathered here today have seen the impact of opioid crisis as having it on their communities every day and it's important we hear the stories of how it specifically impacted them as individuals as well as their friends families and co-workers when it comes to finding solutions for the workforce development needs and creating more good-paying jobs we look to state and local entities who are leading by example and the opioid crisis is no different our witnesses before us have learned a lot in their communities about how to spot opioid abuse and implement successful forms of treatment it is important we hear about these experiences in order to inform the congresso response to this crisis at this committee we talk a lot about how we are addressing the shortage of skilled workers across the country and how we want to empower people to build the lives they want for themselves for many workers and snared in this epidemic it is critical that they receive the treatment they need to help them return to the workforce and to find a good job once they are drug-free we also have to acknowledge that the opioid crisis are resulting in too many lives ending far too soon we have to look at ways to stop it I'd like to welcome Tim Robinson here today from a home state of Kentucky I know that Tim and I were discussing earlier Luise where he's from is probably closer to this Capitol building than it is to my hometown of Bowling Green but it just shows how broad and wide and diverse Kentucky is and the problem is pervasive through all economic groups all people and it is something that we are struggling with I know that my the Dean of the Kentucky delegation Hal Rogers has been a strong supporter of what you do in Louise in Martin County and all through Appalachia and also across the Commonwealth so I certainly appreciate you being here today in a your testimony in a few minutes I appreciate the witnesses for appearing and I look forward to hearing your testimony and I yield back

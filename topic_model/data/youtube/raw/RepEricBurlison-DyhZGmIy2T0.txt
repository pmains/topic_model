hi I'm Eric for Olson with another Capitol report and this week I want to talk about the budget this year the budget was the most challenging the most challenging situation we've faced severe budget deficits and like all states across the country Missouri is facing difficult economic times and I want you to know that in Missouri we do things a little different than the other states and then the federal government we balance our budget this year we worked hard to go line by line to balance our budget and pass a budget that was 20 3.1 billion dollars for the budget year beginning this July one and it was greed upon by both chambers at house and we sent to the governor for final approval together the house and the Senate we shaved off about 484 million dollars from the governor's proposed budget and making we've made some very tough decisions in the process but they're necessary decisions in order to balance the budget and keep Missouri a physically strong state I'm what I'm pleased to report to you is that we in doing this we've kept priorities in the state we had to make some tough decisions but education continues to be my number one priority and my colleagues number one priority education is our topics one of our top expenses in the state of Missouri it is our top expense both so what we decided to do was to keep the funding that the funding levels equal we can't afford to continue to increase education in our in our cusp and our expenses towards education can't afford to continue those and increase them at this time so but rather than making cuts in going cutting back on education we chose to keep those funding levels equal and that way those school districts don'ts don't feel as hard of a burden and instead we focused on reducing the other parts of government the the other parts of government in fact looking through my own committee we're on the Department of appropriations for general administration offices included the offices of the governor the lieutenant governor the Secretary of State the Attorney General the state auditor's office the House of Representatives and the Senate and within that department we made significant cuts in those departments and I'm pleased to tell you that we identified and and a limited over more than 1,000 government jobs including taxpayer-funded lobbyists and unnecessary items like equipment travel and expenses we found going line by line we're able to find a lot of wasteful expenses on meals and travel expenses that government employees were doing in the state and so we were able to line those items out we completed the budget it one week early and I think that that that credit goes to our Budget Chairman Alan Ison we did a tremendous job he did it with integrity and had got gained the respect greater respect from all of his colleagues include the those members on the other side of the aisle who once the budget was passed stood up and and gave him a standing ovation so we we have nothing but respect for our Budget Chairman who did a great job of leadership and leading us through this process because Missouri is continually continuing down a fiscally conservative path and balancing our state budget and focusing on keeping Missouri in a good strong fiscal safe we're able to keep Missouri in a leadership position amongst other states where we'll be able to grow faster once the economy turns around and again we have done things unlike other states and the federal government when times get difficult we don't go into debt in Missouri when times get difficult we don't raise taxes on the working people in the state are people that are trying to make a living and bring food home to their family we're and have a life stop for their family and improve their own lives we're not trying to reduce your lives we're trying to improve it and we it's our responsibility of state legislators to focus on to focus on the people of the state and not the departments and bureaucrats and their budgets and so I feel like with our budget we've kept the right things in focus and I'm proud to be your state representative and I'm proud to present that much this year next year will face probably even more budget difficulties and I'm excited about the possibilities that we can do in Missouri we have many ideas on the forefront of consolidating departments and making government much more efficient and we'll be having interim study groups on what we can do in that that regard and what I would like to ask for you to do is please contact me if you have ideas on how we can make government more efficient and more effective you can reach me on facebook you can also reach me on my email it's eric Burleson @ gmail.com I appreciate all of your thoughts and together we can make Missouri a much more efficient state thank

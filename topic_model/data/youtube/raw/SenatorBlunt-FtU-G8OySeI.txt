for the past several weeks we've seen numerous attempts by our colleagues on the other side of the aisle to take a serious issue and frankly I think turned it into a political football it's an issue and I both spent a lot of time on sir having served on the Intel committee and in my case on the Rules Committee looking at what we need to do to be sure that people have maximum confidence that what happens on Election Day is reflected exactly in the results now our friends came to the floor last week and they sought unanimous consent to make sweeping changes in the election laws of the country and then somehow suggested there was a conspiracy that anybody would say no to that mr. chairman unanimous consent mr. president means exactly that it's what we do when we name a post office it's what we do when we make decisions that are unanimously agreed to and usually that's all it takes to get that issue settled it is not how we shape the laws at the heart of our democracy nor is it what we do when we try to make a point about that in my opinion in fact one of the bills they sought unanimous consent on had passed the house it got exactly one Republican vote in the house so it clearly was not unanimously consented to over there and would not be unanimously consented to here this is about press releases not policy in fact the president today called for us to pass voter ID laws that would require voter ID in every state and a law that would have a paper trail in every state I suppose if right now I would have drafted that bill and would call for unanimous consent under the same standard I should expect my friends on the other side to say oh well that would there's that's something that others say would help elections I should just be for that and be for that immediately of course mr. president that would not be the case now these attempts have all been brought to the floor on the basis of saving democra see this is what we need to do to save our election this is in the name of election security but really it's not what it's about at all three of the bills are about campaign committees which are managed by lots of laws and may need to be managed by more but how you run a campaign committee is not how you secure what happens at the voting place on Election Day one of the Raposa 'ls was for the federal government to secure the personal devices of members of congress and their employees that could I assume since you and I know one of the things we do and the Intel committee has put out if you have a Fitbit like this one you put it in the shelf before you go into the meeting if you have a phone like this one you put it in a shelf before you go into the meeting that law would say that the federal government should secure those personal advices of mine so that there's absolute security that if they interact with a federal system that they have done no damage to that system I guess it would also mean that if one of my children calls me on their personal device whether they live at home or not I'd of course take that call immediately they would then have gotten into my personal device do I need to as the federal government need to secure that as well even if it was appropriate for the federal government to do that for members and their extended immediate network I'm not sure it's possible I'm certainly sure that it has nothing to do with election security it might have something to with security of our of our system here in the Senate frankly I think it might make it less less secure which is why I've chosen not to bring that bill up before our committee until I know more about it I think it might make it less secure if everybody thought without hesitation well somebody has looked at this personal device of mine and they have secured it so I can go into any of the secure system in the Senate I want to with this device and not run any sense of danger that I might endanger that Senate system this doesn't protect the elections they're numerous you see attempts we've seen on plenty of other bills that claim to secure elections one included a provision that would take away the authority of the states to determine their own process for voter registration I'm not for that I also think it's hard to make the case that that would secure elections but in case you think it would another one was for to require every state to have online voter registration I'm pretty sure that would make the lessens elections less secure we talked about all the infiltration of bad information out there in the internet and one of these provisions to secure elections would require states to have online registration another was automatic voter registration another was same-day registration you know in Missouri it was in out in in the non urban part of our state we didn't have voter registration in all elections until 1975 or so and the view was well in small towns and school district elections and all they're going to know everybody so they really don't need to have registration but finally it occurred to somebody they might just think they knew five people and the bond issue might be decided by five people so we'd have voter registration in fact we'd have it and not only have it we'd have it enough in advance that anybody could look at those voter rolls 28 days in advance and see if there's any question about whether they were registered or not other states have decided to have same-day registration but one of these bills to secure our elections would require anybody that walked up to vote would be able to register to vote that day if you think that works in your state I'm not really arguing that you shouldn't do it because maybe it does if that's what the voters of that state believed to be the case pretty sure it wouldn't work in every state and let me revisit that online voter registration again I'm sure that doesn't secure elections there was one proposal in these bills that were rejected elections that for every $1 contributed a certain level there'd be six federal dollars given to that campaign that's one of the secured election things that was rejected wasn't accepted by unanimous consent you know at this point it does seem to me and if you're not if you're not willing to accept all these things that were sort of this hair on fire moment where somehow if you're not willing to accept anything somebody else says with secure elections that you're undermining the election system you know we really undermine the system when we say this kind of thing helps it frankly I've been watching this for a while and that list of things I gave you that's been on every Democrat wish list of what would advantage them in the election for about twenty years never before did they purport that it made a more secure election they just said they thought it was a better system and more fair it was obvious to them it would help them it was obvious to us it would help them and we haven't done it and we're probably not going to do it right now you know there are people in this building mr. president who just simply won't accept the fact that there is not a Federals that there's not a federal solution for every problem and sometimes if there is a federal solution it's not the best solution frankly I think the diversity of the election system that we have is one of the strengths of the system I mean get back to that later but that's what President Obama said in October of 2016 he said the fact that we don't have a federal structure made it really more difficult to impact our elections than if we did now I believe everybody here knows that clearly state and local officials faced a significant threat from Russians particularly in 2016 that they hadn't faced before and probably added to that you could add the Russians and the Chinese and the North Koreans and the Iranians all of whom for not much money can do very disruptive there's no question that the Russians affected our elections but they've been trying to impact elections in Eastern and Western Europe for well over a decade why this would be a surprise to us is shocking to me why in 2016 we would act like we were totally flat-footed that oh the the Russians would actually interfere with the elections just because they interfered in elections in a double handful of countries in the previous decade and the world's pretty small when you get to that internet world we live in now critical infrastructure declaration came from the Obama administration in October where frankly they terrified most state election officials that suddenly the federal government with about two weeks left in the election was going to federalize a system that they were personally responsible for and so recently the Intelligence Committee that started this process mr. president when you and I were both on it and I'm still on it released some key findings about what the Russians had done they found that the Russians had worked hard to find the seams between where the federal government could be helpful and state and local governments it found that the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security warnings to the two local officials came way too late in the process and were not well thought out it scared the wrong people and confused more people when they FBI and DHS did what they did and while there's no question that particular that both of those agencies have redoubled their efforts to build trust with the states and deploy resources to help secure elections that we have to remain vigilant to see that they remember that they continue to do that even when you and I worked on a bill together last year that local officials continued to have some problems with even after we worked on it I think I know I said at the time I believe we're doing everything this bill would do but I'm not sure we'd still be doing it 10 years from now so we need to memorialize that they haven't significantly changed my view on but I haven't changed my view most importantly that we're doing what we need to do now but Congress needs to be vigilant we have to insist that state and local officials have the clearance levels they need I talked to and I frankly let me say this too on that topic I'm not sure you can legislate that I'm not sure you can legislate here's what you have to be willing to tell state and local officials not sure you can ever put that in writing where you can ask them what they are telling people I talked to one of our state election officials just last week and he said that I said how's this going he said well everything we request seems to be one level above the security that I had the security clearance I had everything too many of the things we asked meet that criteria we're gonna have to insist that that not be the case while this is not likely to be solved by legislation I think it can be solved by congressional oversight and inquiry the Intelligence Committee also found that Russian activities demand renewed attention to vulnerabilities and the us voting infrastructure certainly agree with that we even said in that report we should replace out-of-date machines with improved would improve ways to vote and improve cybersecurity think that's happening election officials been taking this threat very seriously DHS the Department of Homeland Security has reported that all 50 states and more than 1,400 local jurisdictions have signed up for the cyber threat information sharing program we've had reports to the Senate on that that rules committees had hearings on that Intel has asked repeatedly about that the Intel committee the monitoring sensors that help detect malicious activity have been deployed to election infrastructure in most states remember in 2016 we had a cyber defense but we didn't have a cyber offense and in early in the Trump administration I remember asked people being asking an open hearing do you have any any any direction now to be to have a cyber to be fighting out there to have a cyber offense well that was about five months into the Trump administration when the person said no you'd think that somehow the old cyber offense had been turned off in fact there'd been no cyber offense and sometime in 2017 the the cyber fighters were given what they needed and they're out there helping they're fighting back - and we had a report on that just recently that all the Senators are aware of one of the chief state election officials in terms of that cyber war said that they're in their system there are about a hundred thousand attempts every day to scan the system the voter registration system and see if you could possibly get in I don't know how many thousand of those might be from foreign actors I suspect a majority of them are from people just let's see if I can get into the system we should assume all hundred thousand of them are from somebody who wants to do something wrong and I think the states are getting the help they need to fight that back we've seen states use equipment that didn't have a backup that when the election was over you could count something individually that the voter would have been able to look at get their hands on and recount that's the great man fact if you ask me that's the the best proof you could have is is a is a backup the ballot that can be counted a ballot where if I vote in Missouri I vote my voting machine it generates something that I look at and then I put that in the ballot box that's counted at the polling place but if it ever had to be counted again if there was any question about that precinct counter they can go back and open that ballot box and count them again on Election Day in 2016 and even an 18 there was still four states that didn't have that system it took anywhere in their States there a couple of other states that are partial for states that didn't have it Delaware had it as it in place for this year's election Georgia announced just last week that they'd awarded a contract to replace their equipment that will be in place by 2020 the 2020 elections and have an audible ballot trail South Carolina made a similar announcement last month the fourth state Louisiana is working through a contracting bidding process right now whether they're in place by 2020 or not in Louisiana I don't know but I know that they'll be in as soon as they can reasonably be in and not confuse voters Congress has to continue to move states to do that we need to look and see what happened with the states that were given 380 million dollars in 2018 49 states took the money immediately one state Minnesota has some glitch with their legislature so they don't have their money yet but if the 380 million dollars that states have they've only spent 25% of it so there's still 285 million dollars that states have to do the kinds of things that the Congress thinks that states should be doing now there may be some states have already spent all their money and need more that's something that in the appropriations process I'm sure we'll look at again just like that money that 380 million dollars came through the appropriations process mr. president I recall you were pretty involved in that discussion at the time the federal government's role isn't to run elections for the state but it certainly has a place in trying to be a valued partner ensuring that the states have all the help they need in fact I believe that a larger federal Rover requiring a one-size-fits-all approach the election would be a big mistake I'm not for federalizing the elections I 20 years as an election official either as the individual responsible for elections in the third most popular County the populous county in our state or the chief election official as the Secretary of State and in 20 years of doing this I guarantee you that the person on the ground generally elected by the voters that he's trying to secure he or she's trying to secure their election that day is intensely interested in that election going well and people having confidence in it there is very little kicking the buck up to some federal official in a faraway place and saying well we can't prepare for that because we haven't been told we could prepare for that public confidence in elections is fundamental it is the central thread in the the the fabric of democracy elected officials take it seriously when they're elected to do this job or supervise this job just like appointed officials and Boards of Election Commissioners do that that system would not be improved if it was directed from Washington DC in a one-size-fits-all world these public servants undertake an important job and they understand it's an important job we need to support them we are supporting them we need to have oversight there may be a time when that oversight is has produced a system that's so finely honed that we're ready to make it permanent but every time you put something in law permanently you reduce a lot of your flexibility to insist that something be done differently that needs to be done right now you know both the Intel committee report and I want to both senator Warner and senator Burr have done a good job keeping our committee on a bipartisan nonpartisan track in this report but both that report and former FBI director Mahler both focused on the insidious efforts to confuse voters this is a much better bigger question than what we could do at the government level election security let's not confuse that certain fight about bad information that's out there with a fight about whether our elections are secure on what happens on Election Day frankly much more attention on what we can do about information that's out there and frankly put people on alert you know sometimes even your political opponent says things that aren't true they don't have to be Russian to do that people need to be on alert about information that's out there but they also don't need to be scared to death that somehow we're not taking seriously the important moment of democracy when people decide I believe we're doing the doing that I'm committed to it I believe this Senate is committed to it I think these this effort to make everything that might advantage one side an election security issue is something that people need to be thoughtful about and mr. president it needs to stop

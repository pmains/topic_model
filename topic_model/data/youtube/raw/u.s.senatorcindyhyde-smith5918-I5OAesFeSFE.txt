what are the odds that the department could break with the past precedent and exercise the option to hold zero lease sales as the proposed five-year lease plan is finalized thank you very much for the question senator and uh first what i'll say is that um we we do have a 90-day public comment period um obviously those comments that come in will be um factored into any decisions that we make and um it's it's we will i can't prejudge anything at this time but i i absolutely appreciate your perspective and and know that we will we will work to have a balanced approach to um to this issue and um happy to stay in touch with your office as we move forward so you do think we will have some lease sales i can't prejudge the uh i can't prejudge this issue uh until we come to a decision uh that will be after uh we will work on that more after the 90-day public comment period okay in your opinion what is the earliest we can see a lease cell i can't prejudge that your department has issued a draft plan to the public that has yet to file the request for information that i'm sure you're familiar with which is the action that triggers the first 45-day comment period that is necessary as you know pre-leasing activities such as area identification nepa review environmental impact statements and other activities are allowed so work can begin as quickly as possible once the lease is finalized since your department is already well passed deadline for conducting lease sales what progress has been made inside your department on preparing a request for information on any pre-leasing documents to ensure the most efficient transaction once lease is finalized thank you senator i just i i guess i i want to just make sure that i uh mention the fact that the reason why this five-year plan i is has been late to begin with is because it was dropped by the last administration they started it and didn't finish it we picked it up after that they took no further action after releasing the draft proposed plan in 2018 so we're moving forward expeditiously on the next steps we have two steps of five completed the we released the proposed program on july 1st the environmental impact statement we began the 90-day public comment period as i have mentioned that started on july 8th and then we will incorporate input to develop and publish the proposed final program which can be approved by the secretary and adopted 60 days later following presidential and congressional consideration so it's the last administration's fault who by the way was energy independent thank you senator hyde smith your time is so expired but you're welcome to adopt a second round if you'd like

hi Senator Mark Warner here wanted to bring you up on the latest steps of what's been taking place here in Washington on dealing with the corona virus I'm going to talk about the legislation that by the time you see this hopefully will become law that I've been working on it literally had been closeted with the secretary of the Treasury for hours on end over the last number of days and other Senate colleagues as we tried to make sure that this relief package which will go down is the largest relief package ever in American history was done right was done smart was done with the appropriate oversight that I think all Americans deserve I will tell you that negotiate with the secretary I think he has been straightforward and a fair negotiator and I hope as as this bill is rolled out and more importantly the programs are rolled out that we can get this assistance as quickly as possible to Americans in need let me go through some of the key provisions first there will be direct payments of $1,200 to every American adult up to a certain income threshold along with close to five to six hundred dollars per child so most average families would see an influx of around $3,000 we want to make sure that capital gets out there quick in an efficient manner second there'll be a major program to assist small businesses think here about your local restaurant barber shop local retail store we will provide one of most generous packages ever to make sure that at least for the next four to six weeks these small businesses can keep their employees on payroll and make sure they don't have to simply close down their businesses because with no revenue there's we've got to keep these small businesses alive or even when we do reopen for business many of them will not come back at all third we've greatly expanded for those workers who are laid off unemployment Jones finally to cover the whole segment of the workforce gig workers independent contractors freelancers who in previous unemployed programs didn't receive any coverage I think that's an important important step I've also been working on a program to make sure that businesses larger than small businesses for example over 500 employees have access to credit as well an awful lot of Virginians an awful lot of Americans work at that firm with eight hundred a thousand twelve hundred folks I wanted to make sure there was low-interest loans for these businesses but I also wanted to make sure that these funds were not used for stock buybacks dividends or excessive executive compensation and all of these lending programs I wanted to ensure as well that there was appropriate transparency so they wouldn't see some of the abuse that took place after the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009 and finally in a major way there's over a hundred billion dollars what we call in a sense a Marshall Plan for hospitals and health care across the country these are folks who are helping keep us safe they need to get the resources whether they're in nursing homes whether there's a doctor's office or in the hospitals to make sure they EMTs first responders are both have the equipment they need but also the support they need we've asked hospitals for example to not perform elective surgery that's where hospitals generally make their money having somebody in that's quarantine with the needs for respirators that is not a money-making item for hospitals so we need to provide the financial support there there are a series of other component to this bill be happy to visit my website and we'll lay out that in more detail my sense though is we took an important step forward on the economic front to make sure that we can stabilize our economy and on the health care front to make sure that our health care first responders have the resources they need to do the extraordinary job they're doing

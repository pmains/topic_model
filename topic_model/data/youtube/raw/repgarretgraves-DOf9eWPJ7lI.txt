[Music] from louisiana's news channel this is 9 news at 10. good evening i'm elizabeth vowell greg has the week off you're hearing a lot about a plan for a federal gas tax holiday to help curb the skyrocketing gas prices but this latest plan from president biden is drawing mixed reactions from both you and our leaders in congress perry robinson joins us with more on this one perry hey liz the gas tax holiday would help you save about 18 cents a gallon but some people are skeptical about the plan just about everyone has felt the pain at the pump i did 13 hours that's all you can spare for right now that's it president biden proposed suspending the federal tax on gasoline for three months to ease some of the pressure at the gas station the plan could save the average driver about 18 cents a gallon for regular gas and 24 cents for diesel having some relief at the pumps albeit temporary three months of saving some money will mean a lot to families who are having a hard time but some wonder if it will make a difference it's a band-aid on a much larger issue experts in the oil and gas industry want leaders to look at methods that could provide a long-term answer we don't have a focus in this country right now in domestic production because of the policies that his administration puts in place congressman garrett graves says he's offered a plan to cut the cost of gas but he wants to see a permanent plan not a temporary one plus he says a gas tax holiday could damage future transportation projects like the mississippi river bridge and i-10 expansion that are critical to our area you've got to keep in mind that the gas tax right now whether it's at the state level the federal level it's actually a user fee and that's what funds our traffic solutions our transportation solutions the president says the brief pulse would not be enough to affect the federal transportation fund but grace believes the president will have a tough time getting the proposal approved this proposal would have a tough road making it through the congress and being able to get any kind of support even from the democrat side much less the republican side every little bit helped but at the same time after three months it's going back to 13 to 15 dollars which you can afford to put in your gas tank but congressman troy carter says this is just a small step to a much bigger plan this is not just a one and done i mean there's not going to be one single issue that that solves the the crunch at the pumps it's going to be a combination of things and so while this is a temporary measure it's three months of relief and i'd ask people the question who who suggests that this is not enough we all agree it's not enough but every little bit helps and again congress would need to approve the federal tax break before any of this can happen liz back to you all right perry robinson for us tonight thank you

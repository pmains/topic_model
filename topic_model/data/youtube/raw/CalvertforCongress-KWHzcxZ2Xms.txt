Filling up at the pump takes a bite out of
your wallet. I'm Ken Calvert. Every time we get gas or check out at the
grocery store we feel the pain of Bidenflation. That's why I've supported polices to increase
American energy production and suspend the California gas tax. And why I'm fighting against trillions in
wasteful spending that has sent prices soaring. I'm Ken Calvert and I approve this message
to stop the runaway spending and end Bidenflation.

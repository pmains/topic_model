uh first of course i have to ask you about these dramatic developments in and now out of the texas legislature what is your take on this move by most of the democrats in the texas house um well thanks craig for the question yes when we when we scheduled this we didn't know what would be going on this morning but it's fitting i think for me to follow the state legislators that you just had on because of course they've gone to washington to talk to congress about what we can do and congress has been working to protect voting rights for texans and for people across the country we have passed out of the house of representatives hr one a a really important um voting rights bill that protects voting rights that makes it easier rather than harder to vote which is what our texas democrats are saying um and we also uh as we passed in the last congress and are again intending to pass hr 4 the john lewis voting rights advancement act to restore the parts of the voting rights act that have been struck down by the supreme court i think what we've seen over the last six months and over the last few years is that there are people who are working hard to make it harder rather than easier for people to vote texas is already the hardest state in the union to register to vote we don't need to make it harder and what we've seen here in harris county is that when we make it easier for people to vote people show up they vote they participate in our democracy they feel an ownership and we saw record voter turnout in 2020 for republicans and democrats there were new voters on both sides of the aisle and so you know what we want to see in congress is that everyone's able to exercise their right to vote and we have two huge pieces of legislation one of which has already passed the house the other of which we are working on right now and we need to see them pass the senate and get signed into law well and that is the challenge isn't it because uh while as you said uh the john r lewis voting rights advancement act that's the one that would reestablish federal pre-clearance for election changes that passed last session you anticipate will pass again here uh in the house the the for the people act passed the house already but the senate it's not gone anywhere there uh there are not as we understand it npr's scott detrow reported this morning there are not even 50 votes at the moment for that in the senate much less the 60 necessary to overcome a filibuster threshold so what good does lobbying do at this point and what can you do more importantly to the point uh in the house to convince senators the that this is worth passing well that's the question of the day craig and i do think the lobbying is important i think it's important for everyone to to talk to their senators um i think it's important for them to talk to their house members we have a sense of urgency here in texas that you are seeing reflected in the actions of our state legislators and it's important for everyone in washington to understand the urgency and the real threats to voting rights uh that's that's really the challenge before us it's not as much about the tactics it should be a conversation about the substance about making it harder for people to vote about criminalizing uh the work that election workers need to do about making it impossible for neutral elections administrators to inform voters about their ability to vote by mail there are a lot of things in this bill that are real problems and frankly i think um i think representative shaw said it too what i've been saying you know these bills are a solution in search of a problem there's no evidence that these things uh are are going to um respond to an existing problem but there's a lot of evidence that they're going to disenfranchise voters and i think what what our texas legislators can do what i can do and have been doing is really convey the urgency the importance and frankly the extent of what is going on what's in these bills and i think that um i do think it matters i do think it's important and i've been in a lot of conversations so i can tell you the conversations are happening in the senate uh the conversations between house members and senators are happening uh things do change uh over time and i think that continued conversations and a strategy to make sure we get these bills through that the senate has already brought up um hr one or its version s1 so so there is movement in the senate and you know your filibuster question is a great one that's also one that people are asking and i think what we're seeing members of the house suggest is that we carve out uh an exception to the filibuster for civil rights for fundamental rights like the right to vote um and we have seen too many people fight too hard for too long to go back now that's why hr4 is named after our hero and former colleague john lewis who died about a year ago who was the conscience of the congress whose fight for civil rights animated his entire life and is an example to all of us and his fight for voting rights continues and we see it right now in the halls of congress as well as all the people who are testifying in austin we saw people testifying i know there were buses going from houston this morning for people to talk about why it's important that we allow everyone who's eligible to vote in our society to cast a vote to be able to make their voice heard at the ballot box and to be engaged in our government that's what it is it's a government of by and for the people and we need to make sure that that remains the case

Thank You mr. chairman thank you for being here secretary I appreciate it very much let me say first of all I appreciate the administration's response to the nuclear energy budget in this budget that you proposed I've seen many strange many administration's come through that say they support nuclear energy then when the budget comes in it doesn't seem to do that this is really the first one I've seen that actually looks like it that they're serious about nuclear energy so I thank you for that it's very important but i do want to i told you i was going to ask you think about Yucca Mountain and I'm not yeah but I will make a statement and you can respond if you want to you don't have to you know the the white elephant sitting in the room back there is what we all know why it's closing nobody wants to say it but we all know why it's closed as nothing doing science or anything else it's just a reality and I get it it's going to close but I do have one complaint you're seeking to withdraw the license application I understand why you're doing that what I don't understand is why you're trying to seek why you're seeking to withdraw it with prejudice which means that some future administration some future Congress when we're all gone can't decide you know those guys back in two thousand that they were doing and this maybe is a good place to put it now the Blue Ribbon Commission is not a sighting Commission it's a process commission that to look at how we're going to deal with this stuff but we all agree that at some point in time we're going to need a geological repository you said that last year so at some point in time we are going to have to have some siding Commission some future administration's some future Congress whoever is going to have to sign it's going to have to have a sighting Commission why not leave everything on the table instead of trying to tie the hands and in fact this doesn't really even tie the hands what it does is just make it more expensive because it just means you cannot reapply it for the same license application they could say we're going to expand Yucca Mountain it's a different license application we can't apply for it all the withdrawing with prejudice says is you're going to have to go through some additional steps may be reducing the size of maybe expanding the size of it change it somehow so it's a different license that just means it adds cost to it so I just don't understand why you would withdraw with prejudice having said that I think what ranking member Frelinghuysen was saying was the ability of the of the Department of Energy to discontinue the OCR WM division a division that was created by Congress by statute is questionable and so we probably need some legal clarification or at least some discussions with you on that having said all that will you guarantee me that it is the intent of the department of energy that they will meet the milestones in the governor's agreement to the state of Idaho and does that include having all the SNF removed from the state of Idaho by the year 2035 so can answer your last question the answer is a very simple yes we intend to fulfill our obligation the reason we are withdrawing with prejudice is so that we give a very clear signal this administration does not intend to proceed and so we move on with it and so they're going to blow it up I mean it's a big hole in the ground I mean we have abandoned mines that we try to take care of are they can put cement overt are they going to you know none of the above I think it's a pretty clear indication you may I don't think you have to recharge prejudice I mean you said rain going to pursue it so what anyway it one other question loan guarantees I appreciate the fact that you put out the eight billion dollars in loan guarantees in the conditional loan guarantees for the new reactors it's a huge step forward as you know front-end enrichment facilities there are proposed loan guarantees that are currently before the Department of Energy I talked with the undersecretary the loan guarantee program director a loan guarantee program there have been applications there for that have been going on for about 18 months his goal is to try to reduce that to four to six months any idea when we are going to see any type of results from from the loan guarantee on the front end enrichment and I also applaud your decision yesterday with 45 million that you've done it you sacked at oakridge and stuff I think that's the right step I don't think these companies have to be in competition with one another the fact is we need all technologies yes I agree with that and what we are doing is we are proceeding on the two front end loan guarantee applications they're on different timetables one is not holding up the other there we're trying to work and finalize arrangements so that we can finance both of them I think that's proceeding forward and so in fact if what we hope as in the restart of the nuclear industry we will need both yeah could you tell me how the credit subsidies or decide are determined in the loan guarantee program very very complicated issue it depends on the financial stability the assets that the company what in in case of default what the federal government could put a liens on these are complex determinations on the you know the bond rating if you all the company many other things the assets and and then it's then we determine arrange and then through discussions with OMB then one credit subsidy is finally determined

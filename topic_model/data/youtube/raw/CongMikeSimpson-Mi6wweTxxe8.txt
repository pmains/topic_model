for what purpose does the gentleman from Idaho rise Mr Speaker I have a motion to recommit at the desk is the gentleman opposed to the bill in its current form the gentleman qualifies the clerk will report the motion mr. Simpson of Idaho moves to recommit the bill HR 3183 to the Committee on Appropriations with instructions to report the same back to the house forthwith with the following amendment page 31 beginning on line 11 stripe nuclear waste disposal and all that follows through page 34 line a page 40 beginning on line 23 strike nuclear defense waste disposal and all that follows through on page 41 93 the gentleman from Idaho is recognized for five minutes Thank You mr. speaker mr. speaker this motion to recommit strikes all funds for the upper mountain geological repository I think it's time to get everyone on record on where we stand on this important issue this motion would fulfill the President stated intention of terminating Yucca Mountain it would support speaker Pelosi's anti-nuclear stance and it would probably make senator reed very happy some on the other side of the aisle may question the intent of this amendment but there is no gimmick hear the motion does exactly what i described even more it provides each of us with the opportunity to show where we stand on this critical issue of a permanent geological repository at Yucca Mountain mr. speaker the house is not in order gentleman from Idaho let me tell my colleagues what else this amendment would do first most of our districts are either storing or producing spent nuclear fuel currently 104 nuclear reactors provide twenty percent of the nation's electricity needs spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste is being stored on-site in 121 locations across 39 states sites that have met were never intended for long-term long-term storage these are sites in your districts i personally know that this fuel is safe where it is today however the Secretary of Energy has admitted that even with his blue ribbon panel a permanent geological repository will be necessary voting for this amendment by voting for this amendment we would ensure that this material stays where it is for the next 25 to 50 years or perhaps longer and it would add additional delays and cost to the development of a permanent geological report repository to be built in any state other than Nevada second it would rob our constituents of potential jobs and tax revenue for those of you who have metal workers or pipe fitters or welders or scientists in your districts this amendment would curb their ability to gain and secure high-paying jobs operating nuclear power plants that can sustain 700 permanent jobs while new plants generate as many as 2400 construction jobs our constituents need these jobs in our country needs the power these nuclear plants create as I said twenty percent of the electricity is produced by nuclear power what you may not know is seventy-two percent of the non carbon emitting electricity is produced is produced by nuclear power third killing Yucca Mountain would bring over 22 billion of liability against the federal government 22 billion is just an estimate some have estimated as high as 50 billion dollars this is money which the federal government will owe to the industry because we have failed to live up to our responsibilities the gentleman from Idaho this is money which the federal government when old willow the industry because we have failed to live up to our responsibility we have signed contracts with these companies to take this waste off their hands and because of political deals like that between the president and Senator Reid we have failed as a result the taxpayers will have to pay 22 billion dollars or more in fines and penalties colleagues these are ramifications if you support killing Yucca Mountain you see the President and Senator Reid's plan to kill Yucca Mountain has no alternatives it is only a study a blue-ribbon commission this project has been studied to death we have spent ten and a half billion dollars on it 1.5 million documents over 50 studies by the National by the National Science Foundation have been done on this mount on this Yucca Mountain we know it is scientifically sound the president's decision was a political bout of the President to the Senate Majority Leader not one based on good science or good policy I think this motion to recommit so that none of us here can claim I make this motion to recommit so that none of us here can claim that we don't know the facts I want all of us to have the opportunity to be on record today we can vote for this motion to fulfill the president and Senator Reid's plan to kill you up the mountain this will keep nuclear waste scattered across the country for the foreseeable future potentially costing taxpayers 22 billion dollars or more in liabilities jeopardizing the stability of the electrical system lose jobs and tax revenues in our districts and kick the can down the road on the location of a permanent geological report repository that will still have to be built or we can defeat it supporting good policy and ensuring that science not politics rules the majority of our decisions here in Congress mr. speaker in 2002 this body voted overwhelmingly in favor of approving Yucca Mountain the Yucca Mountain site location I'm not here to urge you to vote for or against this motion to recommit the choice is up to all of us but none of us can or should remain on the sidelines mr. speaker how much time remains gentleman has 15 seconds remaining ideal 15 seconds my gentleman friend all right

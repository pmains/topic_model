report due to stronger than expected numbers mean the stimulus plan is actually working here let's ask former republican pat toomey from pennsylvania a u.s senate candidate and former vermont governor howard dean a cnbc contributor good to see both of you guys you know pat i i saw these numbers crossed today and the first thing that went through my head was number one wow i mean it was a tremendous surprise i think to everyone certainly here at the new york stock exchange one of the reasons the market's doing so well this morning but the second question was you know do we really need more stimulus given that we seem to be very much now on the road to recovery well look i'm very encouraged by today's numbers but i don't think we should extrapolate too much from one very solid set of numbers the revisions are encouraging as well as november's numbers but let's see if we can sustain this and actually go to the positive where we're creating jobs we haven't gotten there yet but in any case there's no evidence that that giant stimulus bill is the reason that we seem to finally perhaps be bottoming out uh you know you can always point to a specific job that's created here or there but what these analysis tend not to uh point to is the fact that this money has got to come from somewhere it's coming from the productive private sector and it costs us job growth there so on balance i don't think we're getting anything from the stimulus and frankly i think we should rescind the unspent portion of it uh mr dean i know you have probably a different interpretation than that do you think that the stimulus is really behind what we're seeing in terms of lower numbers i don't think it matters so much what uh what pat or i think i think the congressional budget office which is probably the only real nonpartisan organization in washington thinks it's made a big difference they think it's created between 600 000 and 1.6 million new jobs now look i i do agree with pat that we don't want to take this particular set of numbers as as the uh the beginning of the the end of the recession and the start of the of the of better times but it's very these are very very good numbers and i i honestly think you just kind of i think you got to give credit where credit's due and credit is due to the people not all just to the obama administration the bush people had something to do with this too uh but it looks good more money real real quick i i just want to ask you that i'm not going to spend any more money i mean we haven't spent all the stimulus money thus far for example you for example the same reason that the previous discussion was about is when do you start hiking interest rates i think to cut off what's already been allocated would be an enormous mistake the same way that if the fed suddenly raised interest rates by a quarter of a point next week would be an enormous mistake we still at ten percent unemployment that's better than it was last month this is going to be a gradual glide path and i think the biggest danger right now and other than the the commercial real estate market which i still worry about the biggest danger right now is that wall street might not have learned anything from this because there's still there's got to be much more restraint uh than there was uh in the eight year lead up to what just happened howard dean my friend by the way i'm larry kudlow how are you i'm great thank you sir i am swooning that you gave the bush administration some praise they had to lift me up that's why the camera switched off i am swooning that you gave the bushies some praise on that good for you my friend i have long said larry that that what paulson did and bernanke did i'm in favor of bernanke being reappointed and reconfirmed what those guys did was it was hell it wasn't always the right thing they didn't always do the right thing but you got to do something when the financial system is about to come out governor dean you are an honest man let me go back to my friend pat toomey pat an argument can be made however on this stimulus debate that what recovery we are seeing including today's jobs is coming from business we still have a mostly free economy private enterprise business is very productive they're very profitable they got big cash flow now they're lengthening their work week and they're hiring temps that didn't come from this fiscal stimulus package was supposed to be consumer demand i'm saying the evidence shows it's really business leading the way what's your take well i think that's absolutely right and the concern is that i don't think we've yet seen the kind of top-line revenue growth that we need to make this long-term sustainable and so the jury is still out you know businesses can only cut costs so far and they've done that they've improved productivity profitability is stabilized but you know real growth just isn't going to come from more borrowing and spending by the government i think we actually have to worry about a 1.4 trillion dollar deficit i think we got to get spending under control i'd like to see us rescind the unspent stimulus money take back tarp money where we can put some kind of limit on the rate of growth and spending at the federal level so that it's sustainable and then improve the deficits and then maybe take a look at cutting payroll taxes which would really be a pro-growth uh step peter we're almost out of time here but just real quick what is this going to mean for the u.s dollar and therefore the economy as a whole pat forgive me oh i'm sorry yeah look well it's encouraging i'm glad to see that the dollar is bouncing i don't think that we can uh you know depreciate the dollar to to uh to prosperity uh you know if the dollar continued the decline it's been on that would be very very worrisome who knows if this reversal of today is sustainable but i think we need a strong dollar to attract capital to this country and make america continue to be a great place to invest okay pat toomey howard dean thank you very much and i think we're getting a round of applause from kudlow that's a bad sign thanks for having me

our next guest proposes a bill that will increase penalties for this fake family stuff Texas congressman Lance Gooden is with us I think I've got this right congressman 3100 faked families and DNA presumably would fix that problem wouldn't it yes and those are just the ones we know about what this legislation does is say that if you're coming across the border and you have children and you're claiming them as family we're gonna do a mouth swab DNA test and make sure that they're actually family the reason this is a problem is because you get preferential status and treatment if you're a family and what traffickers are doing is they're recycling these children bringing them across using them as a vehicle to gain better access quicker access to the system then when the child's over and the trafficker has made it through with whatever victims he's shuttled across they send the child back to be recycled through the process again it's a horrible thing it is a horrible thing and your bill would stop it and increase the penalties for it yeah I would imagine that the left opposes your bill because they don't want anything on the border at all I'd like it for for the first time in the seven months I've been in Congress I'd like to give the left the benefit of the doubt on this one and that I'd like to believe that they're going to join with me and my Republican colleagues in opposing child trafficking I don't know how anyone could be against this you would have to admit that there's a problem at the border which the Democrats have finally started to do in the last few weeks but what this bill does it doesn't address immigration so much as it addresses child trafficking it's a horrible horrible crisis that we have going on at the border and this bill seeks to stop that I've got breaking news on the immigration in front here it is between May 13th and July the 11th 899 people with final orders of deportation were arrested by ice of those 899 people 605 had criminal convictions 93 were facing criminal charges congressman the left says no raids whatsoever the left is essentially protecting these criminals you know I said on your show a few weeks ago that that's that's the same as sedition we're encouraging people to break the law and we aren't what the Democrats are they're saying that they're opposed to these raise they're encouraging people to escape ice and encouraging people to come across the border and say the things that they need to say to get around the system it is total chaos at the border and we're seeing the same thing in the US Congress I can't imagine why the left would be opposed to enforcing the law I can't imagine why they'd be opposed to ending this child trafficking but the numbers you just read off are not surprising they're upsetting but unfortunately I'm not surprised is your bill gonna succeed our bill will succeed if the Democrats will put aside their partisan agenda on immigration and I'll even concede that Republicans are gonna have to step back from some of their immigration demands with respect to this bill this bill should be bipartisan this bill should be something that we all say Democrats Republicans let's stop talking about all these polarizing issues and all come together on this one issue that I believe we agree on and that's the child trafficking as a horrible outrageous thing that must be stopped this bill will stop it if Democrats and Republicans will come together if we can't agree on that we can't agree on anything Carlson Gooden always a pleasure thanks for being with us sir thank you thank you thanks for having me

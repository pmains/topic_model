um so grateful and honored to introduce my good friend in illinois sixth district community health champion and expert dr karen ayala dr ayala serves as the executive director with the dupage county health department prior to that role she served as the director of community health and public health services since 2007. throughout her career dr ayala has worked in community services and public health bringing a strong commitment to social justice and a creative approach to system design i'm particularly proud that dr ayala was responsible for the opening and management of a mass testing and vaccination facility in the district that allowed dupage county to be one of the most successful examples in the country of why high vaccination rates could mean a quicker return to normal for businesses and students just as a personal note i am i cannot tell you how grateful i am for all your great work dr ayala the you know those moments through the crisis when we had uncertainty about the status of the disease uncertainty about how supplies of testing and vaccines were going to be allocated from the feds to the states from the states to the counties learning the sciences we went and of course the growing politicization of that and all the slings and arrows that were thrown in in the directions of anybody including you you were just consistently such a rock and a beacon of strength and you made us all look better and i know you made our constituents all feel like they were in good hands so thank you dr ayala for your service to our state to our country and i look forward to hearing your testimony good morning and thank you for this opportunity to share testimony and for the warm welcome dupage county health department is considered a large suburban local health department serving nearly 1 million residents in northeast illinois incredibly today marks the 800th day on the front lines of our local public health covid response since january of 2020 we have based our local response on the best available public health data what are the best data to communicate to our residents as a local public health official who routinely interacts with residents community leaders health care partners the best data are those that are locally and consistently available as near to real time as possible early on at the health department we invested in developing interactive dashboards and easy to use platforms for sharing information that was available within our county still we know being able to describe and analyze detailed in-depth information about who is becoming effective and potential outcomes and opportunities for treatment is critical to allow us to intervene more effectively and strategically unfortunately due to lingering data system and interoperability issues we are yet to meaningfully respond to these reasonable expectations of our constituents a new challenge around data infrastructure is related to the rapid rise in at-home tests in the absence of a robust reporting and surveillance system to capture capture these results and information about those testing positive as a result we once again risk creating ad-hoc uncoordinated inefficient efforts that will ultimately limit our ability to analyze broader trends and waste precious resources in the absence of a coordinated effort we request investments in electronic data sharing practices across healthcare and federal leadership to promote the development of data sharing standards those are critical to our ability to collect analyze and report back to our communities in standardized ways we have repeatedly learned that when communicating with the public it is critical for public health agencies to be speaking in a coordinated fashion with one voice while the cdc the executive branch and our other federal agencies are responsible for formulating national guidelines across our response efforts many of these announcements were made suddenly or unexpectedly local health officials were left in an avoidable position of scrambling to evaluate and develop local messaging that would assist our residents both to understand as well as to implement those guidelines what is after all the value of even the most sound public health guidance if no one can explain what it means or how it applies to me we must refocus our collective work to coordinate communication between local state and federal agencies now in order to be better prepared for the next surge and the next public health emergency by rebuilding that structure finally i'd like to highlight the need for sustained investment in local public health departments and the public health infrastructure to enable us to address the ongoing public health challenges that already existed as well as to be prepared to respond to future emergencies we know there is a huge cad chasm between the per capita spending for public health services when compared with spending for traditional health care services now is the time however i believe we can agree that our priorities for preventing severe disease illness and death can be and must be in closer alignment with the priority of simply treating those conditions through our funding decisions local public health departments need sustained predictable disease agnostic funding that can be used to support poor public health infrastructure activities upon which disease-specific funding can build when the situation and the need further arises investing in these core public health capabilities will strengthen and support all the work done by local health departments and it will also assure more effective use of all health care resources thank you so much to chairman foster to congressman caston and all the other esteemed community members for the opportunity to share my perspective and for your work to ensure that we are better prepared tomorrow to protect the health safety and security of our residents

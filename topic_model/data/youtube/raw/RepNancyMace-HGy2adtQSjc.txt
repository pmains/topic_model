bring in republican congresswoman nancy mesa of south carolina she's one of hundreds of gop lawmakers who sent a letter to speaker pelosi calling for an investigation into the origins of kovat 19. congresswoman great to see you here today so that the biden white house has launched a 90-day investigation but they signaled yesterday that they do not expect that they're going to have a definitive conclusion at the end of those 90 days what do you think about that and what do you think will happen after that well it's not excusable and look at copied 19 right now as you stated earlier martha 4 million people around the world have died from the virus 600 000 of those people right here in the united states and there are three labs in the world that do this gain of function research and it just so happened that one of those is in wuhan china the exact same location where the wuhan virus originated and nancy pelosi just recently said any hearing in congress investigating the origins of covet 19 is simply a distraction that statement not only is it negligent but it's grossly negligent we owe it to the american people and every other country around the world that's suffering right now to get to the bottom of how this happens so we can prevent it in the future and quite frankly china is playing big ball here and we're just slapping them on the wrist we've got to hold them accountable for this you know it's so unfortunate how politicized so many of these things become and this is a select committee so you have this select committee and you have dr fauci and dr collins not showing up um because undoubtedly they would be asked some pretty tough questions we've asked them some tough questions here um but they did not show up for that and here's uh representative jordan and admiral jour talking about why they didn't come why don't you think they're here you know i don't know i know tony and i i know francis uh pretty well um i i can't imagine a reason because this is a worldwide pandemic in which millions of people have died when public officials who are supposed to have our trust don't show up to members of congress i think that's a problem yeah you know unfortunately there's this you know sort of back and forth history and you have the pelosi investigation select committee that's focused on january the 6th republicans not didn't want to do that then you go back to the benghazi committee select committee investigating hillary clinton so unfortunately we have this environment in washington and we're faced with something that as dr johar rightly points out is a global pandemic and we can't even get together on trying to make sure that we figure out the to the best of our ability where this thing came from that that that's disturbing yeah absolutely and therein lies the problem with washington where we're so divided we can't put the health of our nation and our kids first i look at everything that's happened over the last year the the negative economic impact on our country i have two kids i've seen what it's devastated to them in their school and their education and the inability to see their friends and being at risk of getting covid19 and we're not doing the people's work we don't show up and we should be listening to and following the science even when we disagree and just a few weeks ago when dr fauci's emails were were publicized his remarks and comments regarding the lab leak theory were actually redacted for no reason because those particular emails were not classified emails the people deserve an answer and dr falchi should show up and answer the tough questions now that we have more information on the floor well you know it's really incumbent upon him to do that because one of the other questions is why some of the early samples were deleted of the virus by the nih and there are indications that the virologists in china requested that that happen um this is uh u.s virologist jesse bloom's response to that he says there's no plausible scientific reason for the deletion it therefore seems likely that the sequences were deleted to obscure their existence particularly in light of the directive that lab destroy early samples i mean what do you make of that well dr fauci i would love to be on a panel or in committee when he testifies i have so many questions he lied about the use and utility of masks early on in covid19 he lied about the amount of funding going to nih to the from nih to the wuhan lab he has been dishonest with the american people he's a scientist supposedly but not following the science he's more of a scientist activist and he should be there to respond to republicans and democrats alike and i wish that nancy pelosi would take it more seriously the american people now more than ever need our country to come together on areas where we can agree and that includes saving the lives of millions of americans in the future understanding the origins of covet i mean if this happens again to our country it's gonna be pretty sad that there was sort of a level of uh trump derangement syndrome over the fact that he pointed to the lab early on and so therefore you know an entire class of people in the country um decided that that they were just not going to look there do you believe that's what happened i do believe that because anything that former president trump touches they want to disavow even when he's right um look at the ko kova 19 vaccination the reason we're so far ahead of any other country in the world because president trump allowed the fda to be run like a business rather than a bureaucracy we saw an idea to market in 10 months rather than 10 years we had great innovation in our health care markets and they don't want to give him any sort of credit and it shouldn't be that way we should be united yeah it shouldn't um you know you have to give credit where credit's due no matter what you think about the people who are carrying it out whether they're republicans or democrats and you're right um we're going to talk about this for ah heading into the 4th of july none of us will be doing any of the things that we're going to do on the 4th of july if it hadn't been for that vaccine right there's absolutely no doubt about it nancy mays congresswoman from south carolina always good to talk to you thanks for coming in 100 thank you you

dr king great to have you back i'm glad my colleague mr barletta mentioned the importance of extended learning opportunities i wish you would have told us how the marshmallow pizza tasted though i'm glad this committee is continuing its work to make sure that the implementation of every student succeeds act delivers on the goal of congress of providing state and local education agencies with the flexibility and the resources that they need to meet those unique needs of their communities while also advancing equitable opportunities and outcomes for america's students especially those who have been historically underserved and it bears repeating that the elementary and secondary education act is really civil rights law its core purpose is to help level the playing field and provide those resources and opportunities where they're lacking and require action to help close the gaps and the rigidity of no child left behind i appreciate the chairman's comments his list of problems that we're well aware of in many ways worked against this purpose and i'm confident that every student succeeds act will uphold the civil rights legacy of the original esea and be responsive to the needs of students in each community i want to thank you dr king for mentioning the power of the arts to engage students i have two nationally recognized steam schools in the district i'm honored to represent and if you want to see engaged students visit a steam school so i want to follow up a little bit on representative wilson's questions one of the most frequently criticized pieces of no child left behind that i've heard about over the years is the high stakes testing fortunately essay takes a number of steps to reduce the punitive measures we know that teachers need to assess students we need to start looking at assessments as a positive tool to help inform instruction the department's testing plan is aligned with the bipartisan legislation i sponsored to lead to the provisions in essa to reduce the duplicative and low quality assessments i'm pleased that uh the budget presence budget prioritizes funding for auditing uh those assessment systems so can you briefly follow up a little bit on representative wilson's question as well and talk about how the funding from these state assessment grants can be used to develop streamlined assessment systems that support teaching and learning yeah you know we've seen we've seen good progress on this across states you know one of the things that states have begun to do is to ask if students are in eighth grade and they're taking an advanced math class they're taking an algebra class do they really need to also take the eighth grade math exam as well as the algebra exam and we've and we've worked with states so that students are only taking the one exam it's been an opportunity to reduce assessments we know that there are states that have gathered educators together across the state to look at both the state assessments and the local assessments i think one of the challenges and you know this well one of the challenges is that districts responding to the narrow accountability system of no child left behind have added many interim assessments over the course of the year some of which may be useful to inform instruction some of which are actually a redundant exercise in mimicking the state test and i think we've seen states and districts take meaningful steps to get rid of those in some cases replace uh low-level tasks with a research project in social studies or with a science experiment and a lab report on that science experiment in place of of a bubble test and so we're seeing progress on this i think the additional resources i'm going to get to another question thank you dr king certainly removing the the high stakes uh and changing that aspect will matter um during our hearing on subcommittee hearing on february 10th the oklahoma state superintendent discussed her concern that the their state's current accountability system masks the performance of the state's subgroup population so how does essa raise the floor for equity and address that concern yeah it's critical that essa requires uh that also that information be provided on the performance of all subgroups and i think joy from oklahoma spoke to the ways in which that will enhance equity in her state that she wants to make sure that schools are paying attention to each of the subgroups and that is one of the areas where some states will need to make adjustments to their accountable existing accountability systems and i think state chiefs are eager to do that thank you and and i'm going to try to squeeze in one more question i appreciate the department's commitment to hearing from stakeholders uh so far to date can you talk about how the department will continue to involve and be responsive to diverse education stakeholders and we continue to meet with stakeholders across the department senior staff i've been doing meetings myself with civil rights leaders across the country we're going to continue to make sure we engage educators whether we're doing the rulemaking process negotiated rulemaking process obviously has a particular structure and then when there's a rule that we will gather public comment on that uh but we see this as an ongoing conversation with stakeholders and think that's one of the strengths of the every student succeeds act is that it really requires at every level at the federal level and at the state level uh meaningful engagement with educators with parents with community leaders with civil rights leaders thank you for the ladies has expired mr rakita

joining me now we welcome back Senator John barrasso of Wyoming Senate GOP conference chair senator barrasso you know I almost don't know where to start but I think of all the things seriously wrong with this story is the fact that bidens have essentially transferred world energy power back to the Saudis and OPEC which now includes Russia I mean world energy power is real power right it's political power it's economic power 80 percent of the world is powered by fossil fuels and they have given the whip hand back to OPEC and I think that may be the biggest sin of all what do you think about this we're seeing here American weakness at home and abroad gas prices are going to go up you saw today they're in over six dollars a gallon in Los Angeles and Joe Biden and the Democrats are guilty of gross mismanagement and negligence in terms not just of energy security Larry but Economic Security National Security may they have undermined us as a nation taking us from energy dominance to energy dependence they need to be held accountable on Election Day they need to go and it's because they worship the false god of climate that's what Joe Biden went after by attacking American Energy day number one in office with killing Keystone and stopping oil and gas leasing it's why Joe Biden had to go to Saudi Arabia in the first place this summer well he gave him the fist bump and yesterday they gave him the finger and I will tell you this is our opportunity for American energy that is the answer on all of this but right now we have a president who is very weak at abroad and at home and he's brought it to himself because of his policies you know I saw that um the National Security Council National Economic Council put out a joint statement and they said all this proves quote unquote that it's time to rely less and less on fossil fuels I would reckon that you will draw a different conclusion on this but I want to add to this okay I mean this is insult to injury the news report in the Wall Street Journal today says as that President Biden is contemplating a complete 100 100 percent block on federal offshore uh Leasing and drilling so I would guess sir they have learned nothing basically from this whole Saudi experience if if the president really did put America first uh what you would do is unleash American Energy instead he announced yesterday he was going to release 10 million barrels from the Strategic petroleum Reserve from our emergency sources I mean they're there for a real emergency and over the last six months he has released over half of the volume there we're down to a point where we have only about 20 days worth of emergency supplies we're at a 40-year low he's done it in an effort not because of an emergency but to try to get gasoline prices down Larry we're going to have to replace this at some point and as you said earlier I started you on Fox news we are between a million and two million barrels a day less production now in the United States than we should be right now and it's because of policies of this Administration it is time to unleash American Energy we have it the Democrats want to keep it in the ground we need to replace them and turn the entire Congress House and Senate over to the Republicans so we can get the job done yeah you know just on those numbers it's true um just looking at the Energy Information agency or whatever it's called Department of energy we ought to be at 14 million barrels a day that was their estimate a couple years ago we are less than 12 million barrels a day and on top of that San Brasso as you probably know uh we're about a million and a half uh gasoline barrels less than where we should be so we've just essentially handed this over the Saudis and to OPEC and to Russia and you you know I come back to your point on strategic petroleum Reserve that's a very important economic energy and national security issue I mean we don't want to go back to the Stone Age when there was Arab oil embargoes or you remember every single OPEC meeting was life and death hold your breath financial markets and the whole economy we gotta add of that during the Trump years okay I'm gonna you know brag on it we got out of that during those years by being independent and dominant Biden has given that back but he seems this is the hardest thing for me to swallow he seems he and his people seem to have learned nothing Senator Brasso nothing I mean how easy is it to just turn on the fossil fuel spigots again and Pipeline and so how easy would that be well that's why they call Energy the master resource it Powers our economy it Powers our country it Powers our military that is what we need to have done the American people get it they know what they want they want energy that is Affordable available and reliable that's not what the Democrats want no not at all they are so focused on renewable energy regardless of the cost and regardless of the consequences and as you talked about in your opening monologue the consequences of this of their policies are you end up going to Iran or going to Venezuela going to dictators going to the Ayatollah asking them begging them for energy for oil well as you point out Larry they don't do it with the same kind of environmental stewardship we do it here in the United States and as you saw from the reports yesterday this White House is panicked I guess I guess they are very very worried about what's happening but they don't seem to want to do the right thing because they continue to to sabotage what you and I know are the pull the geopolitical greatest power that we have the greatest power of our economic engine it is energy we need to unleash American Energy I think you had John Hoven on a couple of days ago he said take off the handcuffs that's what we need to do yeah I mean Rick Perry you're right that's what Senator Hoven said uh a very smart guy your colleague and my good friend and it was you know last night Rick Perry said essentially the same thing you know just open up the permitting for heaven's sakes just open up the permitting what's so hard about that and I don't understand Senator why you have to have one or the other in other words why is this Administration insist that in order to have Greener energy we can't have can't have any fossil energy I don't understand that I mean I I would regard that as a stupid policy you could have both all the above nuclear uh natural gas those would be the Baseline power source why whoever said in order to get greener you have to abolish eliminate fossils which by the way will do great harm to our con me as it already has in inflation and recession and give the Saudis and OPEC and Russia and maybe Venezuela and Iran more power why does it have to be either or Senator I don't get that and you know I'm in Wyoming an energy capital of the world and I would say as with the people of Wyoming we need it all the oil the gas the coal the uranium for nuclear power to wind the solar we need it all and we all want to make energy as clean as we can as fast as we can and do it in ways that don't raise costs for the American families so we need energy security we need economic strength we need environmental stewardship Nobody Does it Better than the United States but we have an Administration and Democrats in the house and in the Senate who vote in lockstep on this they don't believe it but this is what the American people are concerned about and this is a big part of what this election is going to be about come November why I think it's so critical that Republicans take back the house and take back the Senate and throw the bums out one last thing Sam Brasso in the last moments here I'm looking at these the return of these half-baked ideas from left-wing Democrats in the main that the judge justice department is going to sue OPEC or we're going to take all assadi's weapons away which would turn them even further towards Russia things of that sort in other words anything but go back to fossil fuels is any of this stuff serious it never has been in the past but I just wonder what you're thinking I'm sure you saw the same reports in the papers today that's not going to go anywhere Larry we need American Energy we have it here we have it in the ground we have an Administration that is committed to keeping it in the ground it is the wrong approach for America the American people know better and deserve better than what we've gotten from this Administration all right Senator John barrasso thank you sir we appreciate it as always

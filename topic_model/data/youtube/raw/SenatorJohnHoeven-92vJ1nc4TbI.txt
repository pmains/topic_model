let me ask you this senator can you put us put to rest some of this speculation that you guys are not going to get anything done in 2017 I mean are we just talking about a difference in the corporate rate or a couple of deductions that may go or may stay or or like you said revenue neutral or are we talking about the possibility that no tax reform happens are we just talking about a change in corporate rates here put to rest any speculation out there that you guys get nothing done this year we're already we've already made real progress on reducing the regulatory burden that's real it affects every small business across this country it's helping our economy we're going to combine that with what I believe is real tax reform and I hope an infrastructure package that's all important stuff to grow our economy create jobs

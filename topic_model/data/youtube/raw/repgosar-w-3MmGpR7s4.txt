hello and welcome back to your mineral monument recently i introduced the stopping terrorist mineral trade act this legislation would prohibit importing to the united states minerals or products made with minerals from afghanistan when introducing the legislation i said that for two decades nearly 90 million dollars of american taxpayers money was spent on afghanistan mineral exploration and the mapping through the united states geological survey now those resources have fallen into the hands of the terrorist taliban regime and we cannot allow the development of those resources to enrich the taliban in addition the stopping terrorist mineral trade act would require clear documentation by any importer from countries that do business with afghanistan and encourage other nations around the globe to join this effort to stop the funding of the terrorists in afghanistan the united states cannot and will not assist terrorists this is paul gosar and you just experienced our worldwide mineral monday

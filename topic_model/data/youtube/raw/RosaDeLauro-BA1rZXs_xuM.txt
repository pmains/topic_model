let me begin by quoting sir walter scott what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive this amendment is an exercise in deception it is designed to shut the government down it drastically underfunds the fundamental priorities of the american people and it tries yet again to delay families access to affordable health care we do not have time for this sort of recklessness the nonpartisan congressional budget office federal reserve chairman ben bernanke warned us that the automatic across the board cuts could cost us as many as 750 000 jobs in 2013. the majority wants to make these cuts permanent regardless of the job loss damage to our economy or harm to working families across the country and because of the deep cuts enshrined here over 57 000 children lose access to early learning through head start these children never get that opportunity back the biomedical research that saves lives is being curtailed delayed or lost educational programs are sharply reduced for over a million of our most disadvantaged kids even though one in five children currently live in poverty hundreds of thousands of unemployed adults are losing access to job training low-income seniors lose out on 5 million congregate and home delivered meals mental health programs are being gutted and with this funding labor health and education programs are slashed seventeen percent beyond the deep cuts the republican majority is once again trying to use the budget process to take the government hostage unless we delay the affordable care act and because of the affordable care act americans with pre-existing conditions finally have coverage women's health is finally on an equal footing maternity and pediatric care is covered preventive care can be obtained with no out-of-pocket cost the donut hole is closing for seniors young people stay on their parents plans it empowers patients and doctors and yes insurance companies no longer can make the decision about whether or not you will get health insurance or not get it the affordable care act is at last affordable health care for more american families you know we stand on the verge of a government shutdown and instead of behaving responsibly of working towards a reasonable compromise the majority continues to put their personal radical ideology above the fundamental priorities of the american people this is wrong and i urge my kids to vote against it and i yield that gentleman from kentucky mr speaker

hi tracy mann with a quick man minute from my office here in washington d.c first off my prayers go out to the individuals who were affected by the devastating wildfires in reno and harvard county over the weekend the wildfires have burned twelve thousand acres of south central kansas and according to the most recent reports destroyed 35 homes 92 outbuildings 110 vehicles and heartbreakingly took one person's life thank you to all the first responders and law enforcement who've been working around the clock to put the fires out and offer aid to their neighbors my team and i are monitoring the situation and contacting local community leaders in the area to help in any way we can and i hope to be able to visit the area soon god bless you kansans i hope you can stay safe and please reach out to one of my offices if there's anything that we can do to help so far as this week in washington d.c government funding runs out on friday the house is expected to vote on an omnibus spending package on wednesday which would fund the federal government for the rest of the fiscal year two days before we're supposed to vote so in just two days we still don't have any budget text the package is expected to cost more than 1.5 trillion dollars which would be spending increase of nine percent over last year adding more fuel to the inflation fire if we don't receive an omnibus it's expected that the house democrats will introduce yet another continuing resolution band-aid which basically kicks the can uh down the road and this will be the fourth time that that's been done in this congress this is no way that we should be funding our government any funding passed by congress my view must include aid for her ally ukraine we need to hold a true debate over the national budget and put an end to the democrats last-minute attempts to ram through partisan wish lists in addition to that this week we are going to give another speech on the house floor in my farmville impact series and tomorrow i'll be discussing biofuels and u.s energy independence the farm bill doesn't just deal with america's food supply which is incredibly important it also aims to strengthen our access to reliable affordable and environmentally safe energy sources like biofuels in light of the recent russia invasion of ukraine it's more important now than ever for the us to be energy independent and there's no reason that we're not we currently buy 500 000 barrels of oil from russia every day in part because president biden killed the x the keystone xl pipeline and imposed restrictive unnecessary barriers on oil and gas producers here at home we need to support biofuel pioneers here at home like kansas corn growers and also our sorghum growers who aim to keep us energy independent tune in tomorrow on my facebook page and in my weekly newsletter to hear more of my thoughts on biofuels and why it's critical that it's included in the 2023 farm bill thanks for joining and more to come

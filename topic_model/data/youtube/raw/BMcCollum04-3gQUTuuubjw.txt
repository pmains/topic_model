using the arp funding the county has embarked on efforts to address the lack of affordable housing in our community workforce development changing public health needs community first public safety and racial equity and community engagement the profound lack of affordable housing is the most significant challenge to growing prosperity in our region a housing crisis has been building for years across ramsey county and the twin cities metropolitan area and in many other regions across the nation our response to this crisis has two fronts a proactive upstream approach to build new affordable housing and reduce the burden of housing costs on rams and county families an immediate program to stabilize and provide long-term shelter spaces for people experiencing homelessness last year we passed our new economic competitiveness and inclusion plan which identified a shortage of more than thousand housing units across the county that are affordable for those in need subsequently we passed ramsey county's first county-wide levy for affordable housing and economic development which will provide 11 million per year to create and preserve affordable housing in ramsey county to kickstart this work in advance of the levy becoming operational we're investing 20 million in 21 and 22 of arp funds to immediately expand the supply of affordable housing finally the county has a robust data portal that we're really excited about that shows the economic impacts comet has on our residents in real time and how we're putting erp funds to work the portal reflects our goals the progress towards those goals the challenges and opportunities that we are experiencing in each of our programs we believe we're one of the only municipalities across the country that has such a robust data collection and analysis and we're happy to share that with you as well we believe the community served well by a public reporting process thank you again representative mccollum for your leadership and for opportunity to share some of our story while i would rather be joining you in person and talking about something other than a response to a global pandemic i am pleased to report that we are working hard to leverage these critical funds to create bold transformative investments that will bring lasting change to our community thank you so much for your work in delivering this for our community next we're going to hear from amir carter the city of saint paul's receiving 172 million dollars in the american rescue plan funding and one of the things that i know you're going to let us know is how that federal assistance enabled the city to meet its crisis your honor over the course of the last couple of years we have seen more americans more saint paul lights more minnesotans are homeless more unemployed more hungry more socially isolated and experiencing mental and physical health trauma than ever before in our lifetime and those have always of course been the things that drive neighborhood safety challenges the opportunity it also came as part of that economic crisis we found ourselves in a mode very swiftly to say we have to find new ways to help businesses we have to find new ways to help families because so many people are struggling of the arp resources that the city is set to receive we've already received our first two of uh uh our first of two uh 83 million dollar allocations to date saint paul we've budgeted 45 million of the initial 83 billion we've received in arpa funding the 45 million includes investments to strengthen neighborhood safety like supporting our city attorney office city attorney's office's criminal division supporting a significant amount of police over time uh to ensure that our neighbors and residents can rely on the level of high quality police services that we've come to take for granted in saint paul that we've come to rely on in saint paul we've built our downtown alliance ambassador program which is those community members who are downtown cleaning and helping visitors find their way and you know scrubbing off you know paints or anything graffiti and things like that to make sure that our downtown is a clean and safe place for our visitors to go uh we have experienced as you know uh some very harrowing and challenging experiences downtown and with outside of some very unusual and extraordinary events we saw this past summer thanks to the big partnership that we've had between the city and the county and lots of other folks we saw this summer local media reported that downtown crime was at a five-year low that of course is fundamentally different than some of the challenges that other downtowns and some of our peer cities have been facing as a result of some of these we are advancing a radio replacement program to ensure that our emergency responders have the ability to communicate with one another and we're investing in some of our domestic abuse prevention programs in our community because we know that as we've seen this increase in violent crime that one of the things that has driven particularly the national increase in homicides is a shift from gang involved violence to domestic involved violence as people were literally stuck in the house with one another council member i i had the privilege it was a much warmer day than it is today um maybe this is good this is virtual none of us had to get in a cold car go back out into a cold car to do this but it was a beautiful sunny day it was a little brisk but we had our jackets on and we sat outside at kagan case in your ward after i had been visiting with many of the businesses throughout the fourth district but i was in your ward that day and um you were really working hard with the businesses on west 7th and throughout your ward on the challenges and the city was providing help along with what we were doing in the recovery act could maybe you talk about how you've worked with with the mayor with the county with with others with the small business administration here federally to help uh to do better outreach for our small business community i'd be happy to congresswoman but before i do that i i would be remiss if i didn't start by just again echoing my colleagues thanks to you for this incredible opportunity to be here today and also the incredible opportunity represented by the american rescue plan i'm honored to be representing my colleagues on the city council uh who who all wish to extend their thanks to you um and just say i i think it's really important that you know that we recognize as the mayor and as chairman castillo said that this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and that we're fortunate to live in a time when leaders like you and president biden and the federal government understands the importance of investing in our local communities and and i want you to know that we also know that this comes with a responsibility to make the most of the money and to spend it with with urgency and with thoughtfulness so that we can make the most of it in the time that we have um my council colleagues and i are committed to working very closely with the mayor's office even even more proactively than we do during a normal budget session to make sure that we fulfill that responsibility to determine in advance what our strategy is going to be and so to make sure that as projects come in front of us at the council we're all in alignment and we're approving them to get the dollars out the door um there are a couple of values that the council has brought to this work um in addition to the mayor's uh statements which he shared earlier about our specific funding priorities that i think are important um first and and i think this session today really highlights your commitment to this too we want to be really transparent with the community about how we're spending these dollars and that includes having that coherent strategy that we can communicate about in advance so that everyone understands what this historic investment means and it doesn't appear that we're just making piecemeal investments here and there but that it's all part of one coherent strategy we also want to make sure that we are working smarter not harder and sometimes that means enabling others in the community to do the work such as many of our non-profit partners this is especially important in terms of the office of neighborhood safety and our public safety investments and alternatives to policing there are lots of nonprofits out there that can do the work better than we can and we want to make sure we give them the opportunity and we also know these are one-time dollars so even though it's an incredible opportunity it's it's a time limited opportunity and so we want to make sure that either we're spending those one-time dollars on one-time uses or that the uses that we spend them on have long benefits so that the investment now pays off over the long run even after the dollars are gone um and then finally i'm really glad that you asked the question about businesses because uh we recognize on the council and i know the mayor does as well that the pandemic is far from over and that businesses and nonprofits are still in need um and that and that we need emergency relief to them to help them get through this pandemic so to your point um i have been meeting with a number of business owners including kegan case um including the children's museum and other small businesses and non-profits um that have that have brought up the fact that they either were not able to get some of the pots of federal and state dollars that were available earlier and so they're in a unique and a uniquely dire position um or just because they they provide particular services to the community that have been impacted by the pandemic for example operating a large food market like kagan case or a children's museum with communal play areas so um we are working very hard to figure out how to get those dollars out the door i know our planning and economic development director nicole goodman and i spoke just last week about what that emergency aid could look like and we're talking to the mayor's office about that too but to your point i feel the sense of urgency and i know my colleagues do as well um to make sure that our businesses can make it through this um i want to thank you again um madam chair your honor uh council member uh for your your testimony i want to thank you for your public service i've been a council member i've never been a mayor or commissioner but i know the the important work that a local government does every single day and i appreciate your willingness always to involve our office so that we can do a better job in partnership as i like to say we each have our own lane and we want to be traveling down that lane of traffic working together putting our blinkers on when we have to change lanes and work together and we have to merge and i couldn't ask for better partners than the city of saint paul and in ramsey county i want to just point out that i am so proud of the work that has been done between ramsey county and the city of saint paul it truly has been a perfect example of working together in order to build back together we know that we need to work with people of all ages all backgrounds all skills and to make sure that they feel secure in their lives and that they have an opportunity to mean good paying jobs i want to just let you know on one thing that we've been uh focused on and that is uh we know that uh there's work to do so the treasury department listen very carefully to what uh you have been saying and i'm happy to report back that uh the information that you provided has helped us in issuing the final rule for the coveted state and local recovery response fund this rule is going to take place in in april but thanks to your input counties and cities can begin to take advantage of the new flexibilities and simplification to meet the immediate pandemic needs and to promote long-term recovery so our office stands ready to work with you as we you know interpret through that and and work through that so we look forward to being a resource and a partner in you and doing what we need to do but we have more work to do we talked a lot about you know how we've come back from the darkest days of the pandemic with the american rescue plan that was 8.5 billion dollars just to minnesota for vaccines and testing and small business and putting food on the table for so many children helping people stay in their homes help people get into safe shelter you talked about a lot of that but i just want to let you know that we're focused on investing and rebuilding america's crumbling infrastructure and that includes the seven billion dollars to minnesota and i know that there was talk about in some of the the housing and some of the road and building transportation on that but i'm excited about this bipartisan piece of legislation it's going to create millions of good paying jobs union jobs and rebuilding america's infrastructure and thirdly we continue to work to build back better for the future to lower costs to fight inflation and to strengthen things for working uh working families so together with a bipartisan infrastructure bill and the buildback better act we will create an average of 2 million jobs over the next 10 years now the buildback better is still a bit of a challenge for many of us to get that second phase for the human infrastructure done as you know we're facing obstruction from republicans in the house but mainly in the senate from being able to meet the full needs of our community and that included the loss of the child tax credit a lifeline for millions of our families here in ramsey county and it lifted so many families and children out of poverty so you have my pledge that i will continue to work moving forward on all of this we have some time remaining so i have a couple of questions and this is if you want staff to get back to us this is a fact gathering opportunity for me mayor i'm going to start with you how has the rollout process in your opinion and when you talk to staff and with the council how is the government recovery funds from the uh from the department of treasury directly to you you know we didn't want we have a great governor governor walls he was willing to just share the opportunity to build back better but not all governors or governor walls we wanted to make sure though that there was no time lag in getting things directly to the cities how's that been going congress remember thank you for the question it's an important question i'll tell you in 2020 as we were at the beginning of all of this one of the frustrations and challenges that i had was with a cares act under a previous administration that was approved in a way that did not bring direct allocation to the city of saint paul we were large enough to be able to receive significant impacts and to incur significant costs associated with our response to the pandemic but not large enough to receive a direct allocation you're right not all governors are governor waltz and we're very thankful for governor walsh's willingness and acknowledgement that the work that we do on the ground at the local level in cities is critical and it is important that we of course are thankful to be able to work in close partnership with the county uh who also understands the importance of cities and municipalities but that was one of our biggest challenges a year ago a year and a half ago in addressing karazak dollars was first getting access to care back dollars to being able to use it the second piece is uh and it became something of a i'll date myself with a reference to the movie brewster's millions uh with karazhak dollars as we had uh literally a matter of months to spend and get rid of and be able to allocate all of these resources that we needed to be able to allocate now we're thankful for the resources and of course it's a challenge when trying to think about how in a two-month stretch of time in a four-month stretch of time without the type of process that council member naked just described engaging community members and being very thoughtful to be able to leverage resources in the most effective means possible i'm proud of the way that we ended up able to do that and i say all that to say is that one of the immediate differences that we saw with the transition to a new administration was the advent of the american rescue plan act in a way that created a more a longer term scope to be able to leverage and plan those resources and to be able to make sure that they're having the biggest impact possible in communities uh guidance that is significantly more flexible and of course the direct allocation uh to a city like saint paul is very very important we acknowledge and we're aware that we're all in the federal kind of staff people who are building this have had to build an entire enormous program one of the most uh probably the most significant investment in the american people in certainly in our lifetimes and that's required an enormous amount of work on their behalf and i'll tell you i'm amazed by the way that they have done stood this up i'm amazed by the way our city staff and our county staff has internalized and you know operationalized what the program requirements are and been able to leverage that towards uh towards community benefits we're fortunate in saint paul that we've uh have built our whole administration at least for the past four years around this kind of public engagement to build these focuses that's how we know when we get an infusion of resources like this that the focus area is our public safety affordable housing and job creation because that's what we hear from our residents year in and year out so we're sort of already on the starting line where that's concern that type of public engagement process to be able to be informed by our community where this is concerned but all of the investments as you know well all of the investments that we've described in this conversation today uh have happened not because uh the the political figures on this call have given speeches about it but because we've had you know front line staff at the federal level at the county level at the city working tirelessly day in and day out to ensure that we're able to move these investments forward a council member i thank you for bringing up the nonprofits uh we we are we are so blessed in minnesota but especially in the metropol twin cities metropolitan area with the non non-profits here and at first with the karazak they were pretty much shut out and i along with a few other colleagues made it made it loud and clear that we needed to support our our non-profits as uh as we were supporting our non as our we're supporting our small businesses they support small businesses they support everything the county in the city uh does uh they help our libraries i mean they're just so integral um as we're looking forward to do another there's talk about doing more help for some of our small businesses especially for some of our our our arts venues and we have quite a few here in the twin cities we have a vibrant arts community and nonprofit community is there anything that you would like to add or say more about the work that our non-profits have been doing uh during uh during this crisis thanks congresswoman and i um i would just like to add that i think they have been doing yeoman's work and um they're struggling and i i think the there's a distinction without a difference when we're talking about businesses versus non-profits in terms of being in need of help um your tax status really doesn't determine either your impact on our community or the fact that you might be in need um and you know our nonprofits have the secondary effects that you mentioned many of them have been are the ones out on the front lines doing the work to help our community make it through this pandemic um and and they're also the ones doing some of that um maybe less direct pandemic relief work but something that has been very important in our community especially downtown which i represent which is the the people presence um something we've struggled with so much in our neighborhoods mayor carter mentioned the public safety issues that we've been struggling with and that cities across the country have been dealing with part of that is just the fact that we don't have the eyes on the street we don't have the foot traffic we don't have the the public safety that comes from a bustling downtown or bustling neighborhoods our nonprofits our arts venues our civic venues as you're talking about those are often the generators of that foot traffic and that people that people present so um to me the the benefits of making sure that our non-profits make it through and and thrive beyond this um go far beyond just ensuring that a particular non-profit is successful ma'am sure i'm going to let you lead off with this question that um others might want to add to it and this is going to be the the last question um that that will have so last month it was it was huge the city of saint paul and ramsey county pledged to pull their resource to to invest you know i'm going to round it up 75 million dollars in air and a rp funding on new affordable housing and that's one of the largest investments in affordable housing in the nation so congratulations you all aside from this historic investment how do counties plan to address the homelessness crisis in the in the 4th congressional district and i know you have partners here in the city of st paul so last question yeah thank you so much congresswoman for paying attention to this issue you know i didn't even know it was the biggest investment in the country we were so focused at doing the right thing for our community we didn't even pay attention to what others are doing which really tells you that our partnership is about doing the right thing for people right here and so we appreciate that um you know we are working side by side with the city of saint paul as well as our suburban communities because homelessness is is across our whole county even though we see the greatest population in st paul but collectively we haven't asked to our our state legislature and actually while we're on this call governor walls and uh lieutenant governor flanagan just announced the historic investment in homelessness services uh just just moments ago as well in partnership but we're working together to really say how do we go beyond this investment that we've had during the covid response because we found a model that is actually working as i said earlier for people to stabilize as we go down upstream and do this historic investment on building affordable housing at the 30 ami which is our greatest need in ramsey county those projects will probably take three to five years in reality to get them built and get families moved in and so we're working together to to secure additional funding so that we can maintain the shelter system that we have now that's working until we can move families into permanent housing and i think that's incredibly important especially as we're stabilizing families stabilizing individuals with supportive services and come and wrapping around to help them get to where they need and all the things they need in order to get that permanent housing to include jobs to include health care and and other resources in addition to that we also have identified a group of people who have experienced homelessness over a long time that's called our familiar faces program together at the city of saint paul and our court system that we have a small number of folks that that require so many resources that just need a little bit more help and and dedicated resources to keep them out of in and out of bouncing their shelter or the criminal justice system or the court system and so we are asking for funding so that we can put caseworkers specifically tailored to those with the highest greatest of need as well well thank you any anybody want to add to add to that i think she did a great job and everybody was nodding their head yes so i want to thank you for your testimony for taking time out for today

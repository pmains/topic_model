Mr Speaker I rise today in appreciation that H.R 4951 the VA electronic health record transparency act legislation I introduced and was approved by the house last year has now been approved by the Senate and is being sent to the president's desk to be signed into law throughout my career I have been privileged to have close working relationships with veterans and veteran service organizations throughout Northwest Indiana these established relationships are motivated me to secure a position on the house Veterans Affairs committee as chairman of the technology modernization subcommittee I have seen the great need for Congress to conduct oversight and have accurate information to ensure that the electronic health record modernization program is able to meet our needs and our veterans I thank the leaders of the senate for also seeing the value of this legislation as we move forward I look forward to obtaining the requested information and continuing our work to ensure that all veterans receive the world-class Health Care they deserve thank you Mr Speaker and I'll back my time

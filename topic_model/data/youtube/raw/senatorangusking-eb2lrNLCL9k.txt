my next guest Maine senator angus King and independent to member the Senate Intelligence Committee we want to ask you about all Russia connection but first I don't know if you have an immediate take on this health care bill and whether eliminating anything but a catastrophic policy for a lot of people would actually pass muster with any Democrats or moderate Republicans well well the first thing Andrea is this is an absolutely preposterous process I mean a bill drafted in secret by we literally don't know who we're going to see it may be this afternoon they're talking about a vote on Tuesday I mean it's absolutely ridiculous to be making laws that are affecting one-sixth the US economy and tens and may perhaps 100 million people that nobody knows what's in it it take for example the insurance provision that you just mentioned of the my first read and then in hearing from insurance people is that that would essentially destroy the individual market because only younger and healthier people would buy these bare-bones policies that would take them out of the risk pool that would leave older and sicker people in the individual market that would drive the costs up which would drive more people out which would drive the costs up further it's a death spiral and that's the kind of thing we ought to have hearings on we ought to have people in from the insurance industry people from the medical industry people from hospitals across the country and understand what this will do before people vote on it if I were on the other side I would vote on it until I got more information from the people that will be affected by it otherwise you're asking your people to jump off a cliff and not know what's at the bottom and it seems that they well we'll have to see whether they are really willing to go ahead and do that the center you're on the Intelligence Committee we now hear that the Judiciary Committee senator Grassley and Feinstein has suggested this as well are not going to only ask for a man afford but we're going to ask for testimony from Don Jr do you think the Intelligence Committee needs to also hear from Don jr. about this extraordinary email chain with the Russians and the meeting that was held back in June absolutely I think it's critical part of this discussion I mean the the piece of did the Russians do something to interfere with our elections is very well established there's no doubt that they did that they were trying to assist the Trump campaign the missing piece was were there connections between the Russians and the Trump campaign and frankly that's what a lot of the investigation has been focusing upon but now we have this email that pretty much says yeah we're going to we're going to work together from the Russian government we have information on Hillary he responses his responses I love it maybe it will help us later in the summer which would be later in the campaign so that opens up a whole host of questions what happened in that meeting but more importantly what about future meetings and future relationships and future connections and we don't know that yet is this an isolated incident or is it the tip of an information iceberg that is going to have a substantial effect on the course of our investigation but the short answer is yes he has to come well I believe I'm not speaking for the committee but I believe that the committee has to talk to him not only about the emails but what really happened in that meeting now there's also reporting from McClatchy which has not been confirmed or established yet as far as I know by the Committees of the investigators looking at the possible connections between the data mining operation that Jared was not only in charge of during the campaign the data that worked so well in terms of the boss and the other online attacks against Hillary Clinton and whether they were in any way using the WikiLeaks email with any connection between the Russians WikiLeaks those cutouts and the campaign itself do you have any evidence so far that there is that connection Andrea you know I'm not going to answer that question as a member of the committee I can't tell you whether what what evidence we do or don't have I can tell you that that is an area of inquiry and it's an area of there was coordination an area of inquiry is there in terms of the social media aspect I think it's important because we've now learned that the Republican or the Trump campaign use of social media particularly in the last month of the campaign was extremely effective and the question is who who was doing the implementing how did it work we don't know that and it's certainly a question that I believe bears examination now this meeting with another one of the meetings that was not originally put on his disclosure on his on his reporting forms by Jared Kushner when he was getting his security clearance from lawyers close to this I understand that the president United States has sole authority over who does or does not get security clearances at that level so even though there have been four months now letters from Elijah Cummings and others on the house side and perhaps some of you as well add to Jared's security clearance given all of these subsequent disclosures the Russian banker the president really had sole authority over whether Jared Kushner continues at this level to be operating on foreign policy my understanding is that that's the case that the president has that authority just like the president can declassify information upon his or her own own authority so ultimately I guess that decision is going to rest in the White House but the question is whether the the information that keeps coming out bit by bit is going to undermine the president's desire to maintain that relationship remember the president was very close to Michael Flint but when it became apparent that number one Michael Flynn had not been forthcoming about his relationship with the Russians what had been discussed had mislead other members of the administration particularly the vice-president president fired it now it's somewhat harder to fire your son-in-law I suppose but I believe if the information compel that the president's going to have very little choice Federer Blumenthal of apparently from Connecticut has just said to some of our colleagues said he should that Jared should be fired do you think that there what would you say to that because he is a member the family and he has a unique role in the White House I'm not going to say whether he should be fired or prosecuted I believe that's the the prosecution side rests with robert muller the firing side rests with the president but the president's going to have to take a hard look at the at the evidence and he's going to have to ask if he himself has been misled in this process and if he has been then he's going to have a tough decision to make thank you very much senator King thanks being with us today

you Thank You mr. chairman and thank you for all that you guys do at the inspector Jen office mr. Horowitz thank you for everything specifically when my next questions come on the Department of Justice quick question is the Department of Justice run from the bottom up or from the top down I think generally from the top down hmm and you're a dependent or an independent agency we are an independent agency has within the Justice Department there are no lesser of an attorney than anybody in DOJ I'll let others make that judgment congressman I think I think I've put your credentials against anybody what I've seen whistle whistle blower protection are you concerned about that we're deeply concerned about it and I'm deeply concerned it's arisen in this context that I've sent a letter today have you seen the protection of whistleblowers get stronger today or are they less so than let's say 2009 and I'm picking that particularly well we have certainly made efforts to make them stronger but when you see this action where we are trying to move forward on a whistleblower retaliation allegation and the involving an FBI employee and the FBI wants to first review the documents to see if we're legally entitled to get access to them that causes me great concern absolutely and I go back to something you're your partner right next to you said Trust is a series of promises kept and to the gentlewoman across the Daiya saying what happened since 2010 well there's fast and furious the AAP reparations James Rosen IRS Benghazi it goes on and on and on are you familiar mr. Horowitz with slow-walking documents we have certainly had difficulty getting prompt access to documents prompt access to documents also supports proper protection for whistleblowers does it not that's correct so I'm gonna go back to your testimony in September 2014 to this committee you stated and I quote the FBI and some other department components have refused our request for various types of documents as a result or as a result a number of our views have been significantly impeded you added that DOJ officials caused significant delays in gaining access to important documents in the IDS review of Operation Fast and Furious do you believe that the delays caused by the refusal the DOJ officials to release documents were intentionally done by some officials within the agency in order to slow down the II's investigations I actually was not the IG back when that all played out before but you've seen significant delays but I've certainly seen significant I mean just like us in those delays you've seen those delays because it took a Freedom of Information Act to get that information when it was not available to you or us I've seen them and my staff frankly has lived them okay so could these delays and impediments to the infest investigation into fast and furious can which continued they amount to obstruction in your opinion they mean this is not normal course let me just it's not normal course of procedure is it not it shouldn't be unfortunately in many reviews we're seeing it over and over again and it has impacted those reviews so let me go back to this DOJ being top-down so if the Attorney General wants to set an atmosphere of change in compliance he could could he not I think across all of the components that culture that was talked about earlier is critical to set and the same thing with this president he promised an era of transparency hardly seeing that you know the most transparent administration period so even the president could actually expediate this could the could he not I think there are a lot of people in this process I agree that could have an impact by sending a clear message that what happened prior to 2010 which worked just fine no law changing in 2010 is where we should be so you're very familiar with the Vaughn index right correct so was there anything in the Vaughn index that really merited executive privilege congressman I wouldn't opine on that frankly I haven't I'm familiar with the index I frankly once again it goes to that mindset from the top down I mean so when you start seeing private emails being put on an executive privilege owner I it behooves me that we're not following the law and the way our systems based is that everybody in good faith upholds their oath to defend and protect this Constitution to uphold the rule of law would you agree I agree with that so it starts from the top down not the bottom up I think frankly it's both the top and the bottom and everything in between but you've had but as an executive you set the tone you told me that it's grown from the top down so you set the tone from the top and we're responsibilities of aggression are responsibilities of accountability you need to be placed you know we've we've taken the position from certainly since I've been there in 2012 with the leadership of the department that given the past practice given how things worked before 2010 there is more than a more than enough good-faith basis to send the message that the IG as section 6 estates is entitled to access all of these records and we've always handled them appropriately we have never violated any of the provisions in the grand jury secrecy title 3 etc that are rightly there to protect privacy interests that has never been an issue we've done the Hansen review we've done national security reviews we've done FISA Amendment Act reviews we've done Patriot Act reviews I could go on and on about the sensitive work my office primarily as I said the staff has done for the 25 years of our existence we've acted responsibly and appropriately nothing changed in 2010 and what we need to do is get back to where we were before 2010 when there was a culture of openness and a dialogue that occurred between our office and the components on how we to appropriately handle those materials review those materials to ensure that among the most sensitive information which is what we are seeing when we're looking at the FBI national security matters we do maintain that carefully and we should have that dialogue but it shouldn't be whether we see it but how we handle it and go forward mr. Chairman I just would like to say that this is a very important question for the future Attorney General to be a pointedly

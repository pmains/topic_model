old school choice week and it comes as parents Across America are outraged over woke lesson plans something that we've hit a couple of times this hour South Carolina Republican senator Tim Scott has been an outspoken champion of school choice look at all the legislation that he's been behind he's turning his expertise into a legal battle he wants to see law several bills to expand options for families and this has got to be popular so many different places Senator Scott joins us live in Focus now great to have you first of all tell me what you're trying to get done for parents and why you think this is urgent parents deserve as many options as humanly possible the more options a parent has the better chance the child has a succeeding in life your ZIP code should not determine the quality of your life and today millions and millions of kids are trapped in poor underperforming skills simply because of their zip codes thank God for States like South Carolina and Iowa Florida and others who are championed the cause but I've been Champion for the last 10 years the cause of school choice letting that money follow that student because they're about to fight that battle that they'd won in Arizona with a new democrat who's at the helm yeah no doubt about it the the easiest way to understand this is put the money in a backpack put it on the child and wherever the child goes the money goes as well so whether that's a public school a public charter school a private school homeschool virtual school we want kids armed with an amazing education Harris today it's not black or white it's the quality of your education will determine the outcome of your life Senator why do you think this is so hard for some people to understand I mentioned Katie Hobbs the new governor Democrat Governor down in Arizona if she flips the switch on that putting the money proverbly proverbially into the backpack of a child and letting parents make choices I mean that really changes the game right when they were about to get a footing why is that so hard well Harris unfortunately it comes down to one thing the current environment is saturated with adults who have power and that power means they decide where the money goes unfortunately we need education system designed for kids not for adults and so big labor unions have taken over public education that's bad for parents bad for kids bad for America you know I look at where you and I and so many people across America you know who are culturally racially diverse whomever these people are they're Americans first right we weren't we didn't have all that woke stuff in school we got math and reading one made us a sin the other wasn't even part of the curriculum your last Quick thoughts yeah ABC not CRT it's that simple we need to take we need to teach the basics in education we don't need to teach people that because of the color of your skin you're a presser or a victim amen good to see you Senator always happy New Year because I hadn't seen you yet in 23. thanks for being in focus

is and thank you to our witnesses for being here today discussing the important issue of the vaccinations and the amazing efforts by american industry to create manufacture and distribute vaccines at a record pace um i want to just briefly discuss one of my bills here today i was disappointed it was not included in the budget reconciliation i know a lot of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have the same concern on the topic of vaccine allocation transparency every american who wants a vaccine can get a vaccine we're fortunate to have an excess supply to share with the world it really is an amazing thing to be an american um but i want to remind of us remind us of where we were in february and this by us i particularly mean texans for the houston chronicle around a story with the headline nobody's getting enough why texas ranks near the bottom for covid19 vaccines per capita again of course that's comparing to other americans in other states not the world um i'd like to submit that article for the record this wasn't an aberration it was captured in a moment in time on january 14th the cdc was reporting that total allocations to texas were 7 602 doses for 100 000 individuals on that day the national average of allocation to the states was 9 303 339 per 100 000 individuals fast forward to march 12th where reporting shows that texas was allocated 37 000 doses per 100 000 individuals compared to the national average of just under 42 000 doses per 100 000 individuals so the administration set out to allocate the most basic metric out there with population but even a population-based formula will still have variances and that's why my bill would require hhs to make their methodology public i would love to see this committee continue a robust debate on how to prepare for pandemics and i do think this bill will ensure that allocation transparency should be standard practice in the future in addition i'm submitting for the record my letter to the gao asking them to investigate allocations as well as a bipartisan texas delegation letter to the cdc on this issue as well thank you madam chair i yield back the remainder of my time

I think the gentleman from from Indiana for yielding and mr. chairman in Arkansas district we grow world-record watermelons I heard a story about a watermelon farmer who had a bad business model it took him costs him four dollars to grow and get his melons to market and he was only selling them for three dollars so he hired a DC consultant to solve this problem and consultants recommendation was that he just needed to get a bigger truck mr. chairman this amendment is not a solution to help children seniors or people with disabilities it's simply a bigger truck for a bad business model I think the gentleman from New Jersey mentioned seven million people i think the actual number of people receiving health care funded through medicaid's closer to 11 or 12 million people across the country the current Medicaid program is broken its costs are rising out of control and ultimately American taxpayers are paying for it whether it's state tax dollars out of one pocket or federal tax dollars out of the other pocket we need a cost-effective Medicaid system that is sustainable and meets the needs of our most vulnerable children seniors and people with disabilities I served in the state legislature we're Medicaid with our single largest expenditure exceeding what we spent on k12 and higher education combined the current system actually encourages higher spending because of the limitless uncap supply of federal money the more states spend the more they get back from the federal government with a minimum one to one match and up to nearly two and a half times federal match for every state dollar that's spent in a lot of states including my own our states have real solutions for Medicaid but their hands are tied and implementing them we need to unite untie the hands of our states and send their federal tax dollars back without cmss strings attached and give them flexibility to solve their problems my state along with many others wants this flexibility and will accept caps for that flexibility this amendment does just the opposite and would only grow a broken program making it less effective and ultimately the Medicaid funded services for children seniors and people with disabilities we need innovative thinking and real solutions as outlined in the budget resolution we can't continue the old tired ideas of throwing more money at a problem especially when it's borrowed money I encourage defeat of this amendment so that children seniors and people with disabilities and ultimately the American taxpayer can win and I yield back

and I rise in support of this much-needed legislation that would expand housing options for individuals who are transitioning out of addiction treatment and required continued support now these are typically people who have exhausted all of their resources already why because they're addicted that's why they are in this that's why they qualify for these housing assistant assistance vouchers and this is this is right on target for helping them so the Thrive Act is an important piece of legislation with strong bipartisan support that came out of our committee that would create a pilot program to allocate section 8 Housing Choice vouchers to transitional housing nonprofits with evidence-based models of recovery and life skills training it's important to note that this is 10,000 total vouchers out of the 2.2 million that are available or one-half of 1% of all of those vouchers whichever is less so we're talking about a portion a small portion of all the total vouchers that are available but here's what we do know mr. chairman our country our states our communities are in crisis right now over the last decade there's been this dramatic rise in opioid abuse whether it's the non-medical use of prescription drugs as well as illicit ly manufactured heroin we need engagement at every level in light of this medical emergency there's an extremely pressing need for additional transitional housing for opioid recovery these housing programs must follow a proven and proven evidence-based approach that has helped thousands of Americans to maintain sobriety after completing rahab rehab gained these valuable job skills obtain employment and eventually transmission back into society to lead independent lives time and timing individuals who have just completed inpatient rehab programs are forced to live in housing situations where they're surrounded by the people that are using the same illegal substances substances that sent them into rehab we have to change that and while evidence that suggests that the effective treatment and recovery plans should cover a span of three to five years for an individual based on their needs and severity we have a long way to go to properly no ties and fun the recovery support programs and resources that individuals in need in their communities 23 million Americans are in recovery today let me repeat that 23 million people are in recovery today for substance abuse a sober safe and healthy living environment that promotes recovery from substance abuse is essential in providing quality recovery support these are people who qualify as I had said before for these section 8 vouchers and because they've exhausted their resources let's throw them a lifeline let's throw them some help let's allow them to have an opportunity to go and succeed so that's why I strongly support the Thrive Act which also has the support of the Michigan heroin and opiate prevention education program which is known as my hope and I urge all my colleagues to support this bill and I yield back the balance of my time

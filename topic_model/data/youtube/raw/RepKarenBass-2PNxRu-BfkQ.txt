and joining me Democratic congressman from California Karen bass she is a member of the judiciary and foreign affairs committees a congressman thank you very much for joining us how do you feel about meeting to hear directly from Robert Muller oh I think it would be very important to hear directly from him I mean our first step is to get his full report but I would not be surprised down the line at all if if we get every single page which we all know is doubtful that we wouldn't want to hear from him as well what would be sufficient in your eyes in terms of what you get out of the reporting well well what would be sufficient would be all apparently it's 400 pages all the underlying evidence and all of the information so that we can look at the issues whether we are talking about collusion or obstruction of justice why did he come to the decision that there wasn't enough evidence to move you know to move forward why didn't he say that whether the president was indicted or an unindicted you know whether the indictment was sealed why we you know why did he come to the conclusions that he did so that's why it's very important that we receive everything the full report and the underlying evidence will you accept any reactions whatsoever well I'm sure that there would be some redaction so it would be hard for me to say we wouldn't accept any but here's what I'm worried about I'm worried about ten pages of full you know redaction so you know I understand that some things have to be redacted but if you're gonna send us 400 pages and 300 pages are redacted that's going to be completely unacceptable here's how the Wall Street Journal is talking about this today their editorial board they're pushing back on Democrats saying the AG surely understood on release in the summary of conclusions last week that he would be open to contradiction by mr. Muller if he took such liberties mr. Barr also knew he'd be called to testify before Congress once the rest of the report is released there's a lot of talk from Democrats that that they just don't trust William bar because he is a political appointee from the of the presidents and because he wrote that that memo talking about what he believed to be presidential authority what do you think of the the prospect of Ag bar being in such direct conflict with Muller do you think the chances are high at that oh I absolutely think they're high I mean really and truly the 19 page memo he wrote was unsolicited and so you know that that was interpreted by many including myself that he was auditioning for a job we knew sessions was going to be fired and so if he wanted to be in line for the job we know that the way to deal with the president is to you know uh sure preys on him and to talk about how there's no collusion no conspiracy he did that in an 18 page memo or 19 page memo saying that a sitting president couldn't be indicted and then when he went through his confirmation process you remember that many people didn't feel he should be confirmed and if confirmed at a minimum we should recuse himself he did none of that so it's very hard to take him seriously which is why we have to see the entire report we need him to come before the Judiciary Committee I know chairman Adler is going to have him come before the committee he needs to explain himself I want to ask you about this another subject the house has reauthorized the Violence Against Women Act that earlier today the votes total was not as bipartisan as it usually is why is that well I think that it's unfortunate I think that many of my Republican colleagues were scared away from voting for the Violence Against Women Act because of the threats from the NRA you know the National Rifle Association wanted people who had been either victims or perpetrators of abuse to have access to guns that's something that you know is completely ludicrous and so I know that that was one reason I also think that some of my colleagues were not happy with the protections and the expansion of the Violence Against Women Act to include the LGBT and trans community so those might be some of the reasons why they chose not to vote for it now one thing that I want to do is and I haven't seen it yet I haven't looked at the vote but you know out of a hundred and 99 Republicans there's only 14 that are women and so the question is how did the Republican women vote and also the co-sponsor it was my legislation the co-sponsor of the legislation was a man so even out of the 14 women they couldn't have one of them step up to be the lead co-sponsor of the legislation it was pretty sad moment I have to say and just one final question the death of raps are the rapper of Nipsey Hussle he did a lot of advocacy work in your district do you want to say anything about that yeah I just think that was such a tragedy I mean not just in my district but in the neighborhood where I actually live and and I will tell you that the grief the outpouring of grief you know he had turned his life around and made really significant contributions to the community starting businesses hiring people he was a developer you know getting ready to embark on a major project so he definitely has a stamp on the South LA area in a very positive way so I think it was such a tragedy his loss California Congressman Karen bass Karen or congresswoman thank you very much we appreciate thank you you say

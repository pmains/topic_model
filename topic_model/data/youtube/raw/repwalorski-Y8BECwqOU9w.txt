thank you mr chairman i would also like to extend to my colleagues uh sympathy and prayers for the great losses that they've suffered uh just in the last couple of months including my colleague andy barr as well the cares act provided 600 per week in temporary supplemental unemployment benefits to support public health by allowing businesses and workers to get through closures stay-at-home orders and to flatten the curve this was a necessary step back in march but if we want a v-shaped recovery as states and cities safely reopen we need to take a different tact on this benefit so that it doesn't inadvertently disincentivize people from returning to work so for instance in my home state of indiana workers receiving the 600 federal supplement would be getting about three times as much as they otherwise would on unemployment so factor in the comparatively low cost of living in my district and in many cases a worker would make more on unemployment than they would if they returned to work in fact the university of chicago estimates that over two-thirds of unemployment insurance recipients nationwide are in this situation and that over 20 percent are receiving double their salary i want to be clear i have no issue with any worker who took this benefit congress made it available at a time when much of the economy was going to be shut down for an undetermined amount of time that additional benefit that did help workers pay rent put food on the table and have peace of mind as they found themselves unemployed or furloughed through no fault of their own but now businesses are reopening and rehiring and shouldn't have to compete with a temporary government benefit that's why ways and means ranking member brady and myself have supported looking at a back-to-work bonus proposal that would make work pay by allowing workers to keep up to two weeks worth of that additional benefit after accepting a job essentially a 1200 sign-on bonus we also want to make sure that states provide clear notice to unemployment claimants about work to work obligations and good cause exceptions i also think there's a better policy than the democrats partisan bill the heroes act which would extend the 600 work incentive through january of 2021 the nonpartisan cbo said that doing this would weaken incentives to work decrease economic output and decrease employment in short it would kill our economic recovery another misguided policy in the partisan heroes act is restoring unlimited deductions for state and local taxes or salt the nonpartisan joint committee on taxation has found that only one percent of the benefits of this policy would go to those making less than a hundred thousand dollars a year so instead over half of the projected benefits would go to those with annual incomes of one million dollars or more this does nothing to rebuild our economy in fact it gives the wealthiest a whole cake while the middle class is stuck with the crumbs tax experts on the left and right agree that restoring an unlimited salt deduction is a bad policy and just a few weeks ago mr furman who's with us today reportedly re said restoring salt was a waste of money that would not help the economic recovery so as we climb out of this crisis we need serious substantive bipartisan proposals that incentivize people to go back to work and to rebuild and to rebuild our economy and their lives not bloated partisan bills that incentivize disincentivize work and provide rich to rich um things as giveaways miss gressler would we be more or less likely to see a v-shaped recovery if we extend the 600 a week unemployment benefit for six more months and restore the salt deduction as the democrat heroes act does no and i think the cpa report that came out evaluating that 600 proposal shows that it will actually hurt the economy in the long run we will see lower output employment next year and all this push with the 600 benefit is just keeping with the inertia but we have to recognize that when congress establish this business benefit it wasn't because it was the best designed program it was simply the quickest way to get the money out the door you know recognizing that it was going to have these problems now that we see what the problems have been that's all the more reason to let that benefit expire and then to more properly target the benefits the people who actually need them and talk about ways that if you have a reduction in hours of income maybe you can have that partial benefit that's coming in so that you go back to work 20 hours a week and you still get something from unemployment but we don't want it to be manipulated there's even been cases you know portland oregon has what they call furlough fridays they're laying their teachers off for furloughing them for one day a week so that they can collect the six hundred dollar benefit plus a particular employment taxpayers are better off it's federal taxpayers who are going to bear the front of that i appreciate mr chairman i yield back

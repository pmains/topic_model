i know there are a lot of issues out there that are that are making people worried uh and anxious and and that's one reason why if you look at the democratic side of our primary in cd7 this year we're we're completely united um we we made democratic parties a big tent we've got progressives we've got moderates we've got people who have all kinds of different priorities but i think we are completely united right now by an understanding that there is great danger in in this time in our political history we are of elections uh so we are uh a lot more united than uh the folks on the other side as their primary results uh are are showing tonight and i think the the unity on our side is also a reflection of the incredible work that this team has done uh over the last four years in getting to know the voters of this district listening to their concerns and and delivering for them as you know i've held now well over a hundred town halls uh all across this district in comparison to i guess my likely opponent uh tom kane jr who's been in politics for 20 years and held zero public meetings this doesn't get as much attention but the the people of the district know that we have done absolutely awesome constituent service we've helped over 10 000 constituents working one person at a time resolve problems with with federal agencies people out there whether they're republican democrat independent know how how hard we work to make sure that they are taken care of that they get what they are entitled to as citizens of this country from the government that is supposed to serve them and for all those reasons we we've got the wind uh at our backs we can talk we can go into this election heading towards november talking about all the things that we've accomplished um remember where we were four years ago the number one issue in our first election in 2018 was health care we were one vote in the united states senate away from the affordable care act being repealed that one vote was senator john mccain and then we lost john mccain had we lost him and the house of representatives tens of millions of our fellow americans would not have health care right now would not have had health care during the covet pandemic imagine how horrific that would have been we prevented that and not only did we prevent that but we then acted to make health care under the aca more affordable for working and middle class americans all across new jersey and this country another big issue four years ago was was infrastructure because duh we're from new jersey and this is what we need the most from the federal government and what we were getting the least of investment in fixing our roads our bridges our our mass transit our water systems all of the things that that that represent the foundation of our economy in new jersey so what did we do we elected a democratic house and ultimately senate and we passed the biggest investment in infrastructure in our country's history including full funding for the gateway tunnel and funding for dozens of projects in every single community in this district that are going to improve people's lives and then remember where we were two years ago two years ago every single small business on every main street in new jersey uh and across the country was shut down unless they were essential tens of millions of americans were out of work and the leading economists in the country were on the phone with us in congress those first few weeks of the pandemic in march of 2020 and they were saying if you don't do something big you don't do something fast we are heading towards a great depression in america those jobs would have been lost permanently those businesses would have disappeared permanently we we did something uncharacteristic for a united states congress we acted big we acted fast and we can now say absolutely definitively that we brought the american economy back from the debt we have lower unemployment today at the end of that effort than we have had in the united states for over 50 years but we also have significant ongoing problems and right now our big challenge and what should be the big issue in this election um is having saved all of those jobs those tens of millions of jobs we've got to come together to protect the paychecks that go with those those jobs by dealing with inflation by dealing with the supply chain crisis by dealing with gas prices that's why i've been leading in the house of representatives to pass bipartisan legislation that's going through both houses right now to bring those supply chains to bring the manufacturing of those goods that are critical to our economy back to america so we can make it in america again whether it's the microchips that are now the critical component of almost everything we buy or pharmaceutical ingredients or ppe or battery technology we've got to break our dependence on countries like china for these supply chains that power our economy that is one of the central lessons of the pandemic and a way to deal with the root causes of the inflation that we are now experiencing and while we're at it let's lower costs for american consumers as well and this is going to be a huge difference in this election i'm for letting medicare negotiate uh the price uh of prescription drugs to get the price of prescription drugs down my my opponent is absolutely against that i'm for capping the cost of child care for middle class new jersey uh families i'm for slapping a windfall profits tax on our oil companies that are making record profits right now to fund rebates for consumers that are suffering with high prices my opponent's not for any of that stuff and in fact if you look at where the republicans are on economic issues on on inflation they're going to say a lot about it they're going to complain about it they're going to blame biden but ask what what is their solution what are they actually proposing there is absolutely nothing there look at the states that they're actually in charge of the places in america where they have actual power are they doing anything about the economy are they doing anything about gas prices no but all we see them focusing on in those states is banning abortion it's it's censoring school textbooks it's it's all chaos it's culture wars it's trying to reopen issues that we thought were settled in this country for many many years and we see even worse than that and in a lot of these states republicans are trying to do by legislation what the writers on january 6 tried to do with baseball bats they're trying to essentially subvert the next election of the president of the united states by turning over to politicians in these states the ability to decide who won an election no matter who got the most votes from the american people i'll tell you that the easiest question in american politics right now the easiest question i think is was the attack the brutal violent attack on police officers in the capital of the united states on january 6 legitimate political discourse i can answer that question most americans can answer that question tom kane refuses to answer that question he is afraid to to do it most americans including a lot of republicans i speak to want to move past trump want to move past the craziness and chaos of those four years and tom kane is advertising his support for donald trump right now i don't know is it real is it phony is it conviction is it cowardice i don't know but it doesn't matter that's what he is there's no coming back from that and another difference i want to do this job he just wants to have this job he's been running for this job for the last 20 years to the point that i think he's forgotten why he wants it people of the seventh district will i think see the difference there so a lot of this i think explains the other interesting development uh in our race today um obviously i'm i'm proudly accepting the nomination of the democratic party awarded to me by the people of this district to be um the the congressman for the seventh district for another two years but you guys may have seen the news that today i also accepted the nomination of a new party in new jersey the moderate party which was formed by republicans and independents including elected republican officials in in our district who are just fed up by the extremism and chaos on on their side what has happened to their party since donald trump took it over and and who are desperately trying to find a way to bring this country back to the center back to moderation they've offered me that their support their nomination uh for uh for this congressional race and i think that's reflective of where we are right now there there is a growing alliance in this country of democrats independents and moderate republicans who i think occupy the middle ground we're people who support law enforcement we support the police but you know we support them whether they're protecting our homes from crime or protecting our capital from an insurrection you got to do both if you say that you support the police we're folks who believe that our immigration laws need to be enforced at the border but we also understand that america is a country of immigrants and we need legal immigration right now it's the right thing to do it's good for our economy we're pro-business we're pro-capitalism we also believe that corporations should pay taxes and we we understand that the future of american business is clean energy and i want america to lead the world in this clean energy revolution sometimes it seems to me at least by their actions and their policies the republicans want china to lead that transition that's that's completely unacceptable to me um and in the wake of these horrific massacres of children like the one that we saw in texas i think we occupy the middle ground in this country when we say that children need to be protected from criminals with guns not from librarians with books i think i speak for the vast majority of parents in the seventh congressional district when i say that above all i i think what what i'm hearing from voters in the district rep republican independent or democrat is that they're just tired of being told to to hate their neighbors over politics they want to get a sense of community they want to be able to go to baseball games and bake sales and and parades and have legitimate constructive arguments about policy but not ones that break up families and ruin friendships and lead to violence in in this country there's a yearning out there for leaders who when when they see a fire burning reach for a bucket of water not a canister of gasoline that's the kind of leadership that i've tried to offer these last four years it's why we're i think a unified party around this campaign it's why we are attracting independents and republicans to unite with us around those values and it's why i'm absolutely confident that together this team is going to win another historic election in this district that is going to send a message around the country about where we should be going as americans over the next two years thank you all so so much for everything you do to make this possible and i can't wait to to be back home this weekend and and to see you again and again and again and again until we win our victory in november bye-bye everybody

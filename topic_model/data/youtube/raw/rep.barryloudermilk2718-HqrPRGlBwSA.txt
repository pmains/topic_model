and on the Patriot Mobile newsmaker hotline is one of the best and uh we've got them for the next 10 minutes it's a very busy voting session today in our nation's capital Congressman Barry Loudermilk of the state of Georgia's 11th congressional district joins us Congressman welcome to Todd's program well it's good to be with you today and thank you for picking up the mantle for uh person and you're doing a great job uh thank you so much Congressman Loudermilk 1994 was the year as you know Democrats had control of the House of Representatives for 40 years and Along Came the contract with America the American people both liked it and voted for it in Republicans commitment to America I see the same philosophy of governance being very appealing this November 8th and of course we have to look now that so many people vote even before people are already voting now uh but I really believe that you can't copycat it but it's it's a prescription that works uh Republicans came in they kept their word I believe every item in the contract with America ultimately passed even Bill Clinton worked with it because it was so popular he wanted to get a second term so he he worked with the team uh do you see the parallel between 1994 and the this 2022 election cycle now there's definitely a parallel and it's not coincidental because the architect of the 1994 contract of America is engaged with us enhancement engagement has been working with us on this plan and one of the things that we want to do is just not replicate what they did but take the success of it and also look at you know what were the failures how how come some of that inevity may have passed the house but it didn't get all the way through what is it that we can do better and what we're doing is taking it a step further instead of the contract with America saying hey we want to do lion item one and everyone campaigns on that and it's great but then when you get here because you haven't defined what that means you just you're not defining how you're going to do it then you end up being Your Own Worst Enemy because part of the Republicans say actually I want to do it this way instead of that way so what we're doing is coming out with some of the details not only is it the contract with America but we're going to have legislation with it we're going to have details this is what we're going to do and it's and we're looking for buy-in from all of America this isn't just a republican plan even though the Republicans are taking it from a constitutional standpoint um and and a conservative standpoint Americans are ready for Less government not more because if you look at the issues of everything it's because of too much government across the border states the inflation I just had a hearing today with uh the largest bank CEOs one of them came out and said look it's clear the reason we're facing inflation is because of the deficits spending by Congress which the Democrats basically their answer to that is well we just need more yeah I've never met anybody that spent themselves out of debt so we have to address these things one on the short term and another of the long term this is a long game we're not going to get out of debt in the next year or two years but we can in 10 or 12 years if we follow a plan and so that's what I think is so great about this and when it rolls out you're not going to hear it rolled out just from Washington D.C it's going to be rolled out across the entire country every Republican member of Congress is going to be rolling this out the details of this plan because this is something we've worked on it isn't something that has just come topped down from uh the minority leader Kevin McCarthy this is because of working groups that we put together over a year ago looking at the problems of America and said how can we fix this more importantly what can we do to allow Americans to fix the problems themselves by getting government out of the way Congressman Loudermilk How concerned are you that not only the Democrat media but of course their accomplices the Democrats uh that you're running against they cannot run on the cost of a gallon of gasoline because obviously it was like two dollars before they broke it all we were energy independent we were a net oil exporter we had anywhere from zero to maybe one one and a half percent uh inflation now it's it's just over the moon over the top off the charts they can't run on anything their record is terrible we're going to get to the Border crisis their record on that they've broken that so of course now they're running on my former boss president Trump they're running on uh abortion they're running on 50 people came to Martha's Vineyard uh I thought they should have loved that they say they're Sanctuary cities and states uh but I guess they didn't like it so much uh how concerned are you that they that they have any chance of succeeding in transference and flipping the script and getting the American people to to look at the shiny object instead of what's right in front of them well I mean that's that's always the term but what's unique about this election this is one election that we don't have to go out and tell America how bad their policies are because Americans are living it every day when you look at what the Top Line issues are they keep trying to push other other issues but when you go get a tank of gas you go try to buy groceries at the store and then you find out that you know four small bags of groceries are costing over a hundred dollars here's a constant reminder that Washington is the problem and it's a democrat-controlled federal government that is basically the entire issue so this is what's so great about this is you have Independence you have moderates um that they understand look they may be socially liberal but they also have to balance their checkbook they also have to buy gas and they're like look the Democrats and they're progressively ideologically left a leaning policy or humbiness they're hurting America and it's not that I think all of a sudden there's going to be Epiphany across the United States that uh that massive groups all of a sudden become Republican no I want to think they're going to say is these other folks have messed it up so bad we're at least going to give Republicans a chance to fix it yeah and so um if we focus on the economy we focus on these issues then it's a win for us and then we have to deliver it's uh exactly right it's the Todd Starnes show with the United States Congressman Barry Loudermilk of Georgia's 11th congressional district we have them for a few more minutes on a very very busy voting session day in our nation's capital we have to talk about the Border uh abject failure by any measure they have the audacity all of them Biden uh the whole peanut gallery prime minister claim uh that's his nickname Believe It or Not ladies and gentlemen on the Todd storm show I know that uh the congressman has heard it before he thinks he's the Prime Minister uh you've got Susan Rice you've got all these characters uh Kareem Jean-Pierre they say the Kamala Harris the vice president they will say the border is secure the border is closed uh even the illegals coming into the country have gone on camera to say the border is open that's why I'm here I got in because it's open and I came because I was told it was open so it's it's it's complete intellectual dishonesty I believe that remain in Mexico co under President Trump was working this way if you can come in you come in if you're not supposed to come in you never got in in the first place seemed like a pretty good idea to me what are your thoughts Congressman about the Border well it's it's it offends me that this White House and the Democrat leadership thinks so little of America that they will tell the people the border is secure are you kidding me the entire world knows our border is not secure that just shows that disregard they have for the American people it's almost you know it it's offensive of of how stupid they think Americans are and it's like well we're just going to tell you you need to believe it but the irony in all this is when the governors of of Texas and Florida started taking action and then Americans were seeing it they were they were responding positively yeah this is a good idea so they called a emergency meeting at the White House to determine what should they do about this my answer is secure the Border you don't have to worry about what are you going to do about he you know uh the immigrants that are being bussed into other areas just secure the Border but then when you look at what happened to Martha's Vineyard then you then you called the national guardian and they supported them off of that Island in record time in record time yeah they should be that responsive to everything that they do boy that was that was a profile and courage there they had to get them out of there as quick as they can so they speak one way they say they're for all of this but no they don't want it in their neighborhood uh but it's okay in your neighborhood uh really incredible stuff I know you have to run how important you're running on the ballot wait you're not you have no problems you're you're you're you're good you're good to go uh but there's some tough races uh Herschel Walker who I believe is going to win I believe it's imperative that he defeat Rafael Warnock and of course Governor Kemp defeating Stacey Abrams which is looking more and more comfortable make a quick comment about uh the ballot how important these positions are absolutely Russell Walker could be the deciding factor of whether we continue on with the Democrat majority or a republican majority correct commercial plus several more which I think it can be um and you're right we feel we're very confident in our own race uh behind and so we're spending our time helping others I think Governor camp in a really good place because he's shown courage he's shown how to lead out a terrible situations that he stood up against uh an oppressive federal government including uh you know the current Administration and so people are responding because Georgia's economy is good except for the problems the national economy is is causing and so and and rehearsal is beginning to show who he really is and people are responding very positively and they're sick and tired of Washington elitists which war not is one of those I've never seen somebody who adopted that so quickly that's so true yeah I know you have to I want to squeeze this in I know you have to run where you've seen it all but were you at least a little bit surprised a little bit shocked because I thought I heard it all too in the last 31 years doing what I do but when Stacy Abrams said that the state of Georgia is the worst state in America who in the world says that that wants to be the chief executive officer of the executive branch at the state level who says that it's it's the same reason they say everything is okay the same reason they say there's no inflation the same reason that they say the gas prices are Putin's problem though it is Big Oil it's because they can't tell the truth because the truth doesn't make them look good so they they believe they're better at telling a lie than we are telling the truth the problem is their lives are catching up with them Stacey Abrams she knows that isn't true but she she can't give Brian Kemp any credit for doing anything right so let's just try to make everybody think that George is at the backfires on him Congressman Loudermilk thank you for the bonus time because I know you have to run uh appreciate you and the great job that you do for Georgia's 11th and the country all the best to you all right all right thanks sir you're welcome that is Congressman Barry louderman

thank you of course thank you for your appreciation i want to thank you for uh holding this hearing on the bills to improve air quality monitoring all three of the bills that we're talking about today will improve our air monitoring network which is desperately needed to improve public health and access to clean air in our communities california as everybody knows is no stranger to polluted air going back to 1955 15 years before the clean air act and before the creation of california's own air resources board the city of los angeles where i was born and raised experienced the single smoggiest day in its history and i know firsthand what that is like when i was a kid growing up in los angeles i remember the the smog days when we were sent home from school early due to the devastating air quality we've come a long way in improving air quality and clean air access for our communities but california's clean air gains have not necessarily been equitable throughout the state and i won't go into the entire history of redlining but i think the results are devastatingly clear in many california communities i'll just give an initial example in the east bay area in california red line neighborhoods in berkeley in oakland among others were closer in proximity to polluting industries and further harmed by major highways that separated communities and increased exposure to pollution now data shows that even today people in those areas disproportionately suffer from higher levels of nitrogen dioxide pollution which in turn increases rates of childhood asthma a study from 2019 focused on eight california cities found that residents of historically red light neighborhoods were twice as likely to visit emergency rooms for asthma so my first question is for miss johnson ms johnson how would the environmental justice air quality monitoring act help redlined neighborhoods specifically like those in the east bay achieve the same air quality gains that non-redline communities have enjoyed thank you for your question senator i think that there are examples of hyperlocal air quality monitoring projects in california that give us an idea of the benefits that we can can gain from these these bills one is a pollution monitoring project that was designed to increase youth literacy around air quality issues but what it really found was that as it followed youth in their day-to-day activities it found that their exposure at home and at school to transportation pollution was higher than expected because of the path that they needed to take to walk back and forth between those two places and when we think about a project that the nrdc the environmental group and google um engaged in it really showed that people living in a redlined community have a higher percentage of exposure to pollution that is eight times that of any other area and so i think our ability to really be able to capture this data will um will be the step the first step um or an additional step in the in the um path that we need to be able to um actually bring corrective action um to these communities that will improve air quality okay thank you and uh uh i want to just uh piggyback on the question the topic raised by senator markey about hyperlocal monitoring which you just acknowledged uh once again we've been working together uh with senator duckworth as well uh on an item but i'll preface it with highlighting once again a tool developed in california known as cal enviroscreen that helps identify communities with the most significant pollution burden part of the innovation of cal enviroscreen is how it maps communities that are impacted by multiple sources of pollution not just each source in isolation it collects data on over 20 indicators to help california policymakers identify disadvantaged communities so we can better target climate investments we're working as i mentioned with my colleagues as well as the council on environmental quality to make recommendations for how to improve the federal climate and economic justice screening tool and we hope that our recommendations which are based on lessons learned from california can be used to improve about the federal tools and the states that have similar tools so ms johnson how is cal enviroscreen unique in its use of air quality data and how would the legislation that we're focused on today help improve california's tool and the federal tools at uh ceq and epa mrs johnson i'm going to ask you to answer that very briefly times expired on the floor but answer that very briefly and then we'll ask you to ask answer it more completely for the record go ahead ms johnson well the cow enviro screen is unique in that it uses satellite data and pairs that with other sensor technologies it is the process for that tool had a robust community engagement complement to it and when we think about the climate and economic justice screening tool married with other data sets as noted in these pieces of legislation today we do think that that community engagement the use of satellite data and other data sets will really go a long way in ensuring that we are able to direct benefits to communities that have been most impacted by redlining and air pollution good i'm going to ask you to hold it at that again senator peter thanks so much for coming back and i want to thank all of our

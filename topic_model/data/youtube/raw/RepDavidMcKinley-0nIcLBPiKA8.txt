you're always you cut you're always too kind uh let me yeah let me begin by saying look i support let evs and renewable energy but not on this particular timeline that we're talking about politically driven timeline but i'd rather on a free market approach and certainly certainly not until researchers have developed an alternative mineral composition for our batteries now look no one on this panel can tell us the impact uh on the global temperature changes that a 100 percent renewable grid in america and a 100 percent ev mandate is going to have but what we do know that the are the devastating environmental and human rights consequences by pursuing this objective in this time frame look in recent years my democrat colleagues have called republicans quote climate change deniers but i can tell you mr chairman maybe it's time they look in the mirror and ask for themselves why are they denying these devastating environmental and human right abuses in order to obtain the critical minerals needed for batteries is it because is it because they don't want it to occur in their backyard that look this road to get 100 evs and renewables is littered with environmental damage and human rights abuses example just the u.n just came out with a report last last last year they talked that warned us about these they talked about the critical minerals being mined in the cobalt by an estimated 40 000 children and i've shown these pictures before but here are some of the pictures of some of these children that that are impacted with it there's there's another with the children being impacted uh and and lithium to produce just one ton of lithium you need to you need to use 500 000 gallons of water which consumes more than 65 of all the water available in chile and and this this will only make 20 batteries out of a ton so and there's similar problems in harvesting graphite uh uh and manganese like so and an excavating according to marx mark mills at the manhattan institute to make one battery he had to excavate 250 tons of dirt just to get the minerals necessary to make just one battery now do the man mr chairman as we transition to ultimately 20 million vehicles by let's say 2050 that will require 5 billion tons of dirt that have to be excavated that's an amount that will fill the vast chesapeake bay just in one year and we're talking about years and going on in the future so isn't it time to be honest with the american people about the raw materials needed to make these batteries where they come from and the consequences of extracting these raw materials this is nothing more just exporting american guilt and turning a blind eye to the devastating impact we're doing to these emerging nations the environment these emerging nations so dr foss uh can you just tell me although am i wrong in assessing these consequences with this government should we be considering alternatives like we've been mentioned before about hydrogen fuel cells and a carbon capture that we can continue to use fossil fuels into the future as part of our mix where am i wrong on that first of all to be fair anything that we do requires minerals and materials we need platinum group metals or noble metals of other sorts for hydrogen-based fuel cells we need metals for our legacy energy businesses our carbon-based businesses oil gas coal whatever the problem is the metals intensity in the vehicle designs and i think you can go to just about any other source you could look at something simple like copper and you can see the amount of metals intensity in in the electric vehicle designs versus the traditional combustion engine designs so i think we have to be honest about all of that when it comes to all of the excellent points that you're making about responsibility accountability governance i think that people are aware of all of these issues but this is one of the things that will take so much time it's very very difficult to get countries on the same page with regard to best practices in extractive industries things that make sense with regard to responsible operation i think the mining industry overall is actually a very responsible industry has good practices but the rules and the government government oversight the protections for labor and environment and other countries are not the same and and the issue is the cost structure of minerals that are available in the timelines that everyone is talking about versus where they're located and the governance structures in those countries and i think that is what you're trying to get to here thank you and i just want to reinforce for everyone you ought to read this united nations report because it really does document very clearly some of the problems that we're we're forcing on other nations instead of doing it ourselves so mr chairman i i thank you and i yield back the german

know about well from controversy surrounding Yucca Mountain to the budget and Dhaka yeah a lot going on right now and we have congressman mark Amodei live in Washington DC this morning he's going to talk about some of these topics and more good morning congressman thank you so much for joining us good morning thanks for having me first thing I want to ask you about immigration of course the big thing right now Republicans want to vote first on a plan to crack down on sanctuary cities what is the deal right now can we find a middle ground with Republicans and Democrats to get this done with immigration reform you know fair question one that's been being at about a decade I think the answer is yes if you can get both sides to cease their addiction to their rhetoric the facts and circumstances are out there to do the right thing for the country to do the right thing for for daca folks and all those other sort of things we just have to get beyond which is a huge ask we have to get beyond each side retreating into its rhetoric and it's talking points and when you actually focus on the issue the solutions are out there it's trying to deep politicize it which I know is an incredibly naive thing to say for somebody from talking from Washington DC let's talk a little about something that at least Nevadans have been dealing with for a long time as well and that's Yucca Mountain and on Monday we hear that there's some new renewed interest in it and potentially bringing it back up and getting it running still people battling over whether or not it's the right thing for the Silver State what say you well I can tell you that the interest in the House of Representatives even before I got here never really stopped I mean if you go to Congressional Record dot-com and search under yucca or nuclear waste you'll see that people have been on the floor almost every week from states other than Nevada talking about getting this process going because they obviously want to get that material out of those generating facilities which which are in many of the other states so when you talk about rekindled you've got john Shimkus who's the chairman of the Subcommittee on in commerce who's been a very strong advocate of getting it moving the whole committee sent a bill out to the floor several months ago that actually came out on a bipartisan pretty large vote and so now they've been they've been having some problems with the appropriations process whether funding for things like research for reprocessing should be mandatory spending which means we don't have to rely upon another Congress to appropriate money or whether it's discretionary which means that that funding could be discontinued in a subsequent funding cycle that's what's here I'm obviously not privy to what goes on in the Senate but I can tell you that I would highly doubt that Mitch McConnell is going to schedule a Yucca Mountain vote before November when one of the members of his conference Nevada's Dean Heller is in a tight race and so I don't think that the Senate majority leader wants to risk the same thing that happened in the house potentially happening in the Senate so I don't think anything will happen this year in terms of House and Senate I do expect the house to have a bill come in front of it this year though all right congressman you've been representing Nevada second district since 2011 in Washington you've been with the Obama administration and now with the Trump administration huge contrast there and I know you get this question all the time what are the main differences and what is it like to work with the Donald Trump administration well I'll tell you this this administration whether you like the tweets don't like the tweets the personality stuff all the rhetoric going around about the administration most recently background checks Rush all that other sort of stuff is focused on getting things done so when we talk about fixes whether it's defense whether it's health care remember this administration was out there wanting something done on health care so the paralysis by analysis is kind of gone it is nice to be able to call those executive branch agencies that we typically want to interact with for Nevada issues not the least of which is the Department of Interior their Bureau of Land Management folks like that whether it's the Health and Human Services Department under Shima Verma and Tom Price before that the Labor Department when we talk about issues affecting AG workers the sheep industry in Nevada MSHA is under there which is which is mining safety it's nice to have the ability to make a call as the missions committee and ask to interact with the administration on what they're doing from an oversight perspective and actually be able to do that so that part's nice but I'll say this and it seems like it happens with every successive administration I thought things were pretty political under the Obama administration and guess what that was kind of medium volume there tremendously political it seems like everything is looked at politically the frustrating thing about that is if you're trying to focus on the facts for instance immigration and say here's what the facts are here's what we think your responsible policy is there are days when it seems like it's almost impossible to penetrate that veil of politics to get to actually doing something on the issue congressman mark Amodeo reporting live for us this morning or at least answering some of our questions from DC we really appreciate your time

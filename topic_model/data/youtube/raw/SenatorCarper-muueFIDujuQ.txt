thank you so thanks very much it's great to be able to it to work on this with there with you and folks that are here today and another said to have joined us as co-sponsors I want to provide some historical context for this if I could in 1974 Congress passed president sign something are dealing with impounding impounding of funds and basically this is what the law said in 1974 when the president signs into law an appropriations bill he or she may then send to the Congress a rescission message calling for resending reducing spending in that bill that he had signed into law as a matter of fact over the years presidents have sent any number of rescission messages to the Congress sometimes they are adopted often times more often than not they are ignored as if they were never offered starting in the 1990s I offered in the House of Representatives legislation that said effectively the President signed a appropriations bill into law could send indecision message to the congress and we could vote it up or down but we had to vote on it and at the time we proposed this or doing this for two years I called it a two-year test drive for a statutory line-item veto power it passed 312 I believe 297 majority of Democrats in the house majority of Republicans in 1992 voted for it came over to the Senate where it was to die not a slow death but fairly quick that and there was not the taken up in the Senate I'll let you figure out why via in the 1996 saying senator mccain i think senator coats and others put together the bill that was actually signed line and beat oval designed by a president clinton subsequently declared unconstitutional how does it differ from our proposal here today the 96 version that was declared unconstitutional was in fact unconstitutional it also extended the president's powers not only on appropriated spending extended his powers to entitlements at extended his powers to revenue measures and it said unless the congress by two-thirds vote in the House and the Senate overrode the president's proposal they would become law it was an enormous shift of power of authority from a co-equal branch of the legislative branch to the executive branch what a friend of mine once described that bill as a bazooka under the desk of the president what we're proposing today is not a bazooka what we're proposing today is really a rifle to take enable us and the president to take a rifle shot at spending which in a day of billion trillion dollar rather trillion dollar a budget deficit just does not make sense we need in our government today to create what I call a culture of thrift a lot of people around the country thing we operate here in Washington with with a culture of spendthrift we need to replace that with the culture of thrift we need to look in every nook and corner of the federal government to make sure that we're spending taxpayer monies in the cost effective way my mantra for throughout the debate on health care reform was better health care outcomes for less money and we shouldn't just be focused on better outcomes for health care for less money we need to be focused on better outcomes for virtually everything we spend money on whether it happens to be discretionary domestic spending defense spending or entitlement spending i'll close with with this 2008 president barack obama going to president-elect barack obama was giving his farewell address given his farewell address as a senator in the united states senate chamber and as he was doing that I was writing down a number of ideas that I wanted to share with him to help begin creating this culture of thrift he was about to inherit a budget deficit of a trillion dollars or more we had just seen our nation's debt doubled in eight year period of time and looking at deficits are going to be even larger I wrote down almost on the back of an envelope six ideas that I gave to him that day those ideas included let's do something about improper payments which last year exceeded 125 billion dollars let's just let them to go after and recover monies that have been privately taken from the Medicare trust fund post audit cost recovery let's do something about all that surplus property that we own that we're paying money for to maintain to provide utilities to secure it to maintain that was do something about those and save tens of millions of dollars let's do something about the tax gap where we have over 300 billion dollars of revenues owed to the Treasury not being collected let's do something about major weapons systems cost overruns and John McCain has done a lot on this already I'm like the f-22 which he and Carl Levin led to fight on say you know if it's not a cost effective weapon system let's do something about that but let's do something about that in the last item that I wrote on that list that day with statutory line-item veto power to make the president's statutory rescission pires real and to put the accountability on us if he says these are areas were frankly when you can spend our money more cost-effectively the Congress would have to stand up and be counted get voted down with a simple majority we have to vote on it and that's what we need to do that having been said who do we go to we go to knit in general terms I I both Tom and I have had conversations with members of the administration and and the present but I didn't address it a specific proposal as Tom mentioned he's been supportive in the past and but what I didn't specifically I raised the issue with the President as you said earlier over two years ago when he was leaving the United States and actually the notes that I wrote on the back foot envelope and gave to him he looked at him he said he walked off the floor he said I can't read your writing why we sent it to him we tied to Don sent to him later in the Indy and the day in the last day you we haven't made from Russ triangle we should mention what Russ Russ and and John and I were a team in the last Congress and I know his hardest still in this this fight but we we've raised his remote OMB last year we have had discussions as recently as this week last week rather with Jack Lew about the other proposal president will send us his budget in a week or so and when we leave through that budget we'll see what the president has to say about this proposal our hope is that he will endure severe the operator concluding our concluding thought I spoke earlier of the need to replace in Washington a culture of spendthrift with a a culture of thrift everything that I do everything I do everything that we do almost everything that the government does we can do better and there's a pretty good chance we can do better for less money and the real challenge for us is as we look at programs from A to Z defense domestic discretionary entitlements as we look at all those programs to ask ourself this question can we do this better can we do it for less money remember of my staff likes to say are we looking for a bigger bang for the buck I think we're looking for a better bang for the buck looking for a better bang for the buck and this is part of the way this is one of the ways that will get to that to that goal again thank you John for your great leadership in the others joined us thank you so much

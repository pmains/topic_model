as members of this of the Natural Resources Committee we have all taken an interest in in trying to ensure that we try to protect and ensure the long-term viability of investments that have been made by the federal government to assist our local communities in our region's over decades this member day allows us to advocate on behalf of certain areas of interest and projects that we've been engaged in the infrastructure that has been a key part and parcel of the West and California's development over decades as it relates to water usage is well known but unfortunately the fact of the matter is is that our infrastructure has been rated by the Society of American engineers as a d-plus in 2017 a d-plus I need not remind all of us that that's not a very good grade we're living I believe off the investments have been made by our parents and our grandparents a generation and two ago and we're only going to continue to see the adverse effects of climate with climate change and sea levels rising I need to mitigate through smart and efficient infrastructure planning in the San Joaquin Valley where congressman Cox and I and other of our colleagues represent we're also having an additional challenge of land subsidence that is impacting our infrastructure and so I want to take this time to talk about the imbalance that in continues as our state grows and has more demands on our water resources with climate change we must update our laws to reflect the new reality of the impacts that climate change is having the committee of which I have the honor to serve on with all of us has the jurisdiction over one of the key key issues of the San Joaquin Valley in California that's water or water flows food grows we know that the water infrastructure of the Central Valley Project operated by the Bureau of Reclamation really implemented in the late 1950s forms the foundation of our local economy it ensures that we have a safe reliable water supply that not only irrigates our forums provides water to our cities and our local communities and really has allowed California to develop post-world War two we have two thirds of California's population living where there's little water period and so while we know that droughts are becoming more severe floods are becoming more impactful the resources of our community are continually strained as a result now more than ever in this committee the natural resource committee we need to act in a bipartisan way and in constructive fashion to invest in our water storage or conveyance or conservation and to meet current and future needs of our valley I want to commend the chairman of this committee for taking the time to come with congressman Cox and myself to personally firsthand see the challenges that we face in our infrastructure two years ago we authorized with senator Feinstein and congressman McCarthy a bipartisan piece of legislation called the water infrastructure Improvement provements for the nation Act otherwise known as the Wynn Act we need to address the capacity killings of science issues on the Friant current canal that provides a major water corridor to move water from north to south subsidence is dramatically impacting its ability to do so I'm certain that congressman Cox will speak in more detail we need to fund the san luis dam seismic retrofit that was authorized in the wynn act in doing so we can expand the capacity of the San Luis reservoir by as much as maybe a hundred and forty thousand acre feet of water and the cd-i canal that like on the west side like the Friant current canal does on the east side provides key corridor of water to the west side of our valley both in congressman Cox's district and in mine we need to also address the rehabilitation infrastructure the Mendota pool that was a part of the San Joaquin River restoration Act it's really a major key central focus the Mendota pool that will allow us to better manage our water resources in addition to that we have the del Porto lost Carroll's sights reservoir all of these are projects that go with real benefits to the people of California and their partnerships local state and federal and that's really how we've been successful over the last post-world War two local state and federal projects we should encourage the development of climate resilient technologies to use all the water tools in our water toolbox and we should expand federal financing for new water projects as part of those water tool in our water toolbox and we must work together for these goals because it's the only way we can get it done so let's do the work we need to do that we were sent here to do for the future of our communities that depend upon it for our farm workers or campesinos for the farmers dairymen and dairy women and for the greater good as a long-term benefits of California I thank you and I yield back the balance of my time thank you mister

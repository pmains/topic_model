I I wish we were a better topic honestly because this is outrageous I mean what we are learning here about the secret program and the details just keep getting worse and worse Congressman so correct me if I'm wrong on any of these details here but from what we know from at some point in 2016 to at some point in 2019 at least 15 individuals maybe more um voluntarily signed away their right to keep and bear arms when the FBI showed up at their house or maybe it was the Secret Service or or ice and presented them with this form uh and and pressure maybe pressure that maybe didn't pressure them but I don't know they presented a form and said here sign this form uh and uh and you won't be able to buy a gun and then we'll leave is is that is that accurate that is accurate Cam that is the way I understand it I mean can you imagine the FBI showing up at your door and uh wanting to inquire about uh you know your life and then saying hey uh here's a form that if you fill it out that uh uh you know will go away and um that's just incredibly concerning it's troubling uh we have a every citizen has a constitutional right to keep in bear arms every solitary one there is no provision that I'm aware of in the federal government and as you know I've been a federal farms licensee for a very long period of time over 30 years there's no provision for someone to do that short of an actual judicial court hearing and be you know and be judged you know incompetent or to be um you know adjudicated such by a court um you know the executive branch and the judicial branch are different uh as well as the legislative branch we have three equal branches here and for the FBI to be able to do this um is wrong and it warrants immediate and aggressive Congressional oversight and I think that is where we're going to go with this because here you have a form that somebody created you know I haven't yet seen a form number on it and as you know every Federal Form has a form number like a 4473 like a gun on you know ATF Form 4473 I haven't seen that form number that form number I think will give us some history as to where the form came from who approved it uh how did it get created um and then how did it get distributed who's using it uh we need to know all of those answers um because this is wrong this is absolutely wrong the executive branch doesn't get to make those decisions yeah I mean so I want to go back and touch on a couple of things that you said first of all as an FFL um you're right you have a pretty good idea of what the federal law is regarding firearms and in order for you to become prohibited under federal law you either have to be convicted of a prohibiting offense right either a felony or a domestic violence misdemeanor or you have to be adjudicated that's correct as mentally defective so the first question is is this even legal uh is this form even legal are these people uh who signed these forms are they being wrongfully denied their ability to purchase a firearm because of this you're right is it even legal that's why it's so important to pull the string on this form and find out who created it where did it come from who approved it um and how it's been distributed I mean we know right now that it has been used by the FBI it has been used by the Secret Service and it has been used by Immigration and Customs Enforcement ice so who else has it been used by is it being used by the Veterans Administration you know I mean for for veterans who maybe are battling PTSD right now and um and they potentially if they sign this form they could lose their second amendment rights for their entire life because you know that once you get on this next database uh even the form itself says you may not come off all right um so that's really really disturbing to me which is why I said it warrants aggressive Congressional oversight to see why where when who approved it um and then how many times has it actually been used yeah and and is this still in place I know the FBI said that they stopped using this form in 2019 although they haven't said why but to the best of my knowledge um and correct me again if if they've provided this information have they said whether or not this form was replaced by another is there is there something uh you know some some similar practice taking place right now that we don't know about how confident are you that that's not the case at the moment and I'm not confident at all that that's not the case at the moment you know they say they stopped using it in 2019 um okay I don't know if I believe that as you know and I know a lot has come out lately about the FBI and what uh they're doing and um there's a lot I don't believe and rightfully so I think we've got good evidence that what the FBI is doing in in cases in numerous cases Hunter like uh Hunter Biden laptop story for example you know is just wrong so are they giving us the straight story on this form have they replaced it with another form oh yeah we're not using that form anymore we're using another form now you know I mean that's bait and switch uh and the federal government the FBI uh you know they're they're very smart folks um and they can mince words and make you believe one thing um and uh where something else may actually be what's happening no again this warrants aggressive congressional oversight I think that's the third time I've said it in um and you know I introduced a resolution of inquiry uh last month uh which went through Judiciary and um the Democrats shot it down but that's okay we'll be in the majority here in just a month or so and in less than a month so we'll have the opportunity to introduce it again that resolution of inquiry demands from the president of the United States and from the attorney general all information regarding this form in an unredacted in an unredacted form so um we're going to get to the bottom of this um you know we have already highlighted it to the administration we've already put them on notice so I fully expect that uh when the 118th Congress comes in then and I'm sworn in then we will drop this resolution again uh rather quickly because um we are going to find out the truth that's why we're here find out the truth and to expose it to the American people you know you talk about some of the other scandals that we have going on in our nation's capital right now and obviously this is just a one of them I'm curious I'm so glad that this is on your radar um but when you've talked with your colleagues uh maybe not your colleagues from across the aisle it seems like they've got no interest in getting to the bottom of this um but but what are your fellow conservatives and fellow Republicans saying about this is this going to be a a big issue you think uh for congress overall uh or when uh when the next session of Congress is sworn in oh I think this is a very serious issue uh We've I think the Judiciary Committee is going to be as well as the oversight committee which and I'm on the oversight committee uh we're gonna we're gonna review this we're gonna take this up um and whether we actually have an open public hearing on it is one thing but a lot of our work actually happens behind closed doors in things like depositions in um in demand letters and subpoenas that sort of thing so um we may have a public hearing on it we may not but I will tell you we will get to the bottom of it we will get and we'll get to the truth of the matter here uh and I think that the American people because this has to deal with a constitutional right the Second Amendment of of our Constitution which defends and protects our first amendment the most important amendment of all um it will be something that will uh warrant Congressional uh time absolutely all right listen representative Cloud I can't thank enough for your time today one last question for you um given that Republican control of the house uh thankfully means that Joe Biden's legislative uh anti-gun agenda is going to be uh done the water for a couple of years uh I I I think that uh that makes it far more likely that he is going to continue to use and abuse his executive power to uh get the ATF Tillman all kinds of new regulations and impositions on Gun Owners we've already seen I guess the ATF moving forward with their pistol stabilizing brace rule How concerned are you that there's even more coming down the pike I mean you've got gun control Advocates right now who are you know whispering in the president's ear hey you know these semi-automatic Firearms they're like machine guns they're readily convertible to machine guns you could ban them uh through you know the through executive action you're not you don't need a vote in Congress um How concerned are you that we might see the blind Administration you know deploy their anti-gun nuclear options so to speak uh and and try to uh follow the advice that they're getting from the gun control Lobby right now well we have seen President Biden Time After Time issue executive order after executive order which is not legal you know the an executive order is in order to to tell the executive branch how to Faithfully Implement existing law it is not it does not give the president the ability to create law and he would be creating law here but that doesn't mean he won't try and I believe he will try uh his you're right his legislative agenda will be firewalled because of the Republican majority in Congress but that doesn't mean his executive branch Authority through an executive order is firewall no I think you're right I think we have to be on guard for that and um and I think that uh uh that we're going to have to do everything possible to make sure that every executive order that he issues passes the legal test uh which means they need to be challenged so I agree with you 100 Camp well listen I I really appreciate you joining us on the program today I'm glad we've got somebody with your expertise and experience in the the Firearms world uh on the oversight committee I think that's going to be hugely beneficial for uh for gun owners going forward and representative Andrew Clyde hope you have a very Merry Christmas a happy New Year and look forward to talking again in 2023. thank you Cam uh next time we talk will be the majority so yes sir

I'm from Capitol Hill a member of the intelligence armed services and budget committees independent senator angus King of Maine senator so great to have you here it's surreal we've been complaining about no regular order here like I think most Americans who want Congress to work right now we're finding out that Republicans are getting angry at bob corker because he may call another meeting because he's concerned about additional 400 500 billion thrown to the national debt what's happening there well it's first let me put it in context Joe this may be one of the most important votes any of us ever take we're talking about something that's going to affect every American every American business the entire economy for decades probably 20 or 30 years and so you'd think in that situation that the the care with that went into creating the proposal in the bill would be extra good instead it's the worst ever I've never heard of or seen anything like this on this huge bill huge impact you know how many hearings we've had on the bill zero nothing nada zilch and we're talking about voting on it today Joe we don't even know what the bill is as of now nobody can tell you what's in this bill there's going to be voted on sometime today and we're talking about this gigantic impact it's absolutely ridiculous that's unbelievable every bit as reckless is the way they tried to reorder heidi 1/6 of the economy and health care senator Hezbollah what happens if this version because we do know the general outlines of it what happens if this version blows up at Kirk the corker can't get his trigger we already know that's not going to happen because of parliamentary rules so what is the next version of this look like because like we saw with the Obamacare repeal it doesn't go away it just keeps coming back in different iterations well you know here's the best case that it does blow up that that it that it stops that they can't get the votes and then what might happen is what happened with the health care bill last summer later on in August we started working on a bipartisan bill with Lamar Alexander and patty Murray and Mike rounds and myself and another a bunch of others and came up with a bipartisan bill sponsored by you know 24 25 senators and that's the way it ought to be done and that's the way it could be done I know there at least a dozen probably more like 20 or 25 Democratic senators in the caucus who want to do tax reform but they want to do it in a targeted way that will in fact stimulate economic growth and not slant so much toward the wealthy and and do it in a way that everybody understands the implications this is really complicated stuff and that's why you have to have hearings so people can come in from the outside experts and say now if you do this it's going to have this effect we're we're not looking before we leap off a 30-year cliff I mean it it it is I said yesterday on the floor the Bangor City Council wouldn't amend the leash law using this process Senator Donny Deutsche I'm missing something here because the Republicans seem to feel that passing this bill is going to save the party and and put them on the right track yet every study shows that in most simplistic term two-thirds of the benefits go to the wealthy it's a redistribution of wealth and if I was running Democrats campaign in 2018 I couldn't wait to run against this so I'm curious why they see the politics so in their favor here yeah I don't understand that either and I've said to my Republican colleagues and said publicly if I were a Republican senator I would be very afraid of voting for this bill because there are so many traps in it and there are things in it that are going to come out over the next several weeks in several months I thought it was very instructive in the house when the bill passed the house my understanding is the Republicans as the as the vote came in the Republicans started to applaud and Cheer so did the Democrats because they saw this as an albatross for 2018 this like I say it's unbelievably complicated I have a new rule by the way this is this is Kings rule the faster a bill goes through the worse it is and and that's what's going on here and as people learn and that's one of the reasons I predict there'll be a vote today because the longer the days go on more people learn how really terrible this bill is and and of course the real blow was yesterday when the sort of neutral umpire that looks at economic growth came out and said this thing would create eight tenths of one sent additional GDP in ten years you know a couple of good summers can give us eight tenths of GDP over ten years and all of this drama is about improvement in the economy that is can only be termed marginal in the kicks of a trillion dollar hole in the deficit Paddy's son senator your Democratic colleagues did a pretty masterful job around health care reform in killing attempts to repeal and replace Obamacare they've tried some outreach with tax reform but the phones aren't as jammed as they were over healthcare so what why is this not resonating with the public I think two reasons well number one my phones are what Mike calls I checked with my office pretty much every day running about fifty to one against this bill but I think the difference is time the the health care bill percolated for three or four months and the pressure built up as people came to understand it better that's one of the reasons this is going so fast they don't want to slow it down because the the longer it goes the more people will realize what the problems are and it'll become even harder that there's no deadline here there where everybody's acting like they're you know there's a Christmas deadline or the new year or something like that there's no deadline for this nothing happens if you do it in January instead of in December but I think the motivation is as I told one of my colleagues last night the longer this goes the more people realize that it it it just doesn't make sense it doesn't hold together as a coherent piece of tax policy and and it'll lose support but the difference is between this and this and health care is I think just the passage of time Senator John Heilemann here I want to take you to a different topic you're on the Intel committee in the upper chamber we have this report in The New York Times today that says that President Trump over the summer was pressuring the chairman of your committee of that committee and as well as putting some pressure or at least making some some some requests of the leader McConnell and others on the committee to shut down the investigation into Russia's activities in the 2016 election first of all do you know anything directly about the president trying to exert that kind of influence and secondly if the work times report is true does that not look to you like another potential instance where the president is trying to obstruct justice well I think there's there's bad news and good news about that number one I I never got in one of those calls so you know I have no direct knowledge the bad news is the president shouldn't have done this there's I think just incredibly inappropriate it would be like calling up a jury in the middle of a trial or close to that it just it just shouldn't have been done the good news is as near as I can tell Richard Burr and the other folks on the committee who got those calls didn't pay much attention to him I can't discern any change in the direction or momentum of the investigation after these calls came through and I know Richard Burr pretty well and and yeah I don't I think he just you know moved on and we're still interviewing witnesses we're viewing documents and and proceeding with our investigation so yeah it was inappropriate to make those calls it and again it adds to the impression that if this is a guy who is as innocent as he says why is he trying to shut down investigations he ought to be giving all the information all the cooperations saying yeah we're we're we're innocent here and we're gonna be vindicated and instead you get phone calls saying let's get it over with all right thank you so much senator angus King we as always greatly appreciate you being with us yes sir and coming up

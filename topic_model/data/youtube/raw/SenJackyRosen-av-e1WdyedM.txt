but I'm going to talk a little bit about um of course some things in Nevada because uh uh Nevada National Security Site of course right in our backyard so miss creedon the remote sensing laboratory both at Nellis Air Force Base and Joint Base Andrews provides radiological emergency response teams along the west and the East Coast respectively who stand ready to deploy anywhere in the world these personnel and those of the Nevada National Security Site are the nation's experts in detecting locating dirty bombs loose nukes sources of radiation and determining the origin and attribution through nuclear forensics I was recently speaking with nnsa about the remote sensing laboratory and the radiological sensors we have provided Ukraine as Russia has seized control of several Ukrainian nuclear power plants as part of its Invasion and of course we know continues to threaten them so miss creedon from your time at nnsa and DOD can you speak to the interagency and Multinational effort that is occurring to prevent a nuclear disaster from happening in Ukraine thank you Senator as you know as you've noted the remote sensing lab is an incredibly capable lab it's a very small lab as as these things go but it's a very capable lab but it works also in a much larger system of Laboratories at the department of energy in the nnsa as long as well as with cooperation from the state department and and DOD to put together and develop do the research do the deployment do the acquisition of a whole Suite of sensors for radiation detection on the ground on on Personnel we have radiation detections in space but it's it's it's essential that we understand what's going on there from a public health perspective if the Russians as Rose mentioned earlier do something really awful at these at these two sites including the second one that they've now shot at thank you I want to continue on this um so miss creating the United States must deter two nuclear-capable competitors for the first time in history a fact which is widely discussed including um here today of course so miss creedon how does having to defend against multiple nuclear-capable competitors affect the nation's strategic requirements and should we reorient our posture as a result and when you look at the range of diverse and increasing nuclear risks potentially around the globe how do we how should we be prioritizing these threats which ones are most concerning to you well certainly taken together Russia and China particularly on the trajectory that they are both on with respect to their nuclear systems the variety of their nuclear systems and the number of their potential systems do present a threat to the U.S um but my my first priority for the US is to make sure that the current modernization program is continued on Pace on track that it's funded and that it's supported and the second thing is that the systems that we have now which are very old that they be sustained because you know my assumption is that some of the new ones could very well be late and sustaining these old ones is absolutely essential but I also think we need to look broader so our deterrence is is more than our nuclear deterrent even though our nuclear deterrent is at the heart of it so we do have to look broader to look at how does the U.S present a full deterrence picture to the to all of our adversaries at the same time assuring our allies that we are in fact committed to them and protecting them and that we have this the capability to deter so it's it's way more than just the um nuclear part of it thank you Ambassador Edelman same question to you how should we be prioritizing these multiple threats in your opinion well I think we have to prioritize first the threat That Remains the only existential threat to us today which is uh Russia but China is moving a pace and so as my colleague Mr Miller said I think we have to rethink um what might be required to hold both at risk simultaneously and we do have lesser included cases that you know have been mentioned during the course of this hearing including North Korea and and Iran as well as the the terrorist threat that Senator King mentioned and I would add on that point uh it does seem to me that we need to think about because nuclear weapons while Senator King pointed out you can look up pretty easily on the internet how to build a nuclear weapon in theory we are lucky that that it's actually not that easy as an engineering feat to do so the most likely path for terrorists to get their hands on nuclear weapons is to get them from a state actor that has them and I think in that regard North Korea is a particular particularly worrisome threat but Pakistan is as well and in fact if I had to pick one place where I would most be worried about it would be Pakistan and it's one reason why I for one am very sorry that we no longer have a presence in Afghanistan because to me that is the most likely route loss of control of nuclear weapons in Pakistan that terrorists get their hands on one thank you I know I'm out of time so I'm going to be submitting some questions for the record based on the discussion here today what legs uh the for Miss Creed and of the Triad do we recommend that we focus our investments on and of course building on um Senator Peter's cyber security um questions so thank you

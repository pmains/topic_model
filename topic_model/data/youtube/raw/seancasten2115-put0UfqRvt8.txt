the two-minute opening statements for each candidates and for this opening statements we'll begin with Kevin sesame hi everybody thank you very much for coming my name is kelly mineski and I'm running for Congress because I believe we chose over a representative who actually stand up and work for us and I feel like a Peter Roskam has thrown us under the bus is this astounding write something okay I'm a breast cancer survivor and three years ago when I was going through chemo our insurance company of 20 years informed me that they weren't going to provide for my family the following year and this was devastating but I got on the phone did some research and I'm happy to say that the Affordable Care Act came through for my for me and my family and I was able to find quality care and treat my doctors but Peter Roskam and Donald Trump led us to believe that repealing the Affordable Care Act and gutting Medicaid is in our best interest and we all know that's not true I'm a scientist and because I'm a scientist I understand the harsh realities of climate change is the biggest threat facing our generation I've been a longtime Sierra Club member and a longtime grassroots activist for our planet and because of that I was elected in 2014 to the Illinois Environmental Council because of my work Donald Trump and Peter Roskam want to put politics over facts when it comes to climate change they want to jeopardize the health of our planet the health of our children to simply pop up failing fossil fuel industries to make their supporters happy and that's got to stop so I'm running for Congress to make sure that we have a representative who will stand up to trump on health care on climate change and for our hard-working Family Service six and I'm fortunate that I've been endorsed by EMILY's List congressman tusky and Cheri Bustos thank you thank you I so I'm Kevin Kasten I am a biochemist and they entrepreneur by background I spent the last 60 years running kind of different companies that all went into industrial facilities identify energy that was being wasted recovery to turn it into even power we did that because climate change is the existential threat that we face and I felt that if we could build a company that allowed us to make no moral distinction between our obligation to the planet and economic obligation to evolve it that we could have some success we did with about 70 projects every one of the lowered co2 energy costs created jobs and I now find myself with a president any representatives who not only refused to find that win-win but deny the very facts of climate change and they have a general approach that says that when they confront a fact they don't like they will deny it none of us in this room have that luxury and this denial of facts has become kind of endemic in the Republican party tonight effects on health care they might have backs on taxes they deny that their decisions on those have created massive deficits which they're however used to justify ethics Security and Medicare these decisions when you make policies without facts you kill people that you don't mean that to be hyperbolic I believe the facts matter representing people matters I believe that when Peter Roskam doesn't like facts and doesn't respect people that doesn't have the courage to confront you tell that to your face he needs to be called everyone giving Peter Roskam unelected is critical and it will not happen unless we have somebody who scares his pants off the kitchen function when the facts of health care on climate the economy and can appeal not just the Democrats but independents and Republicans what we see in this district that didn't historically to support a generic Democrat on economic issues good evening and Jennifer's are dying thank you for being here you're here because you know Peter Roskam is you know he doesn't represent you he's not your voice in Washington I've been running for almost a year now meeting the voters in our district and when I first started knocking on doors in the summer and met a couple I knocked at their door and looked through the screen they were watching TV side-by-side or in their 70s I remember it because they were watching Wheel of Fortune and I'm an 80 year old at heart and I love Wheel of Fortune but when he came to his door and I said I'm a Democrat running he said to me was will you protect my social security and as I run this race I think about what Peter Roskam doesn't think about he doesn't think about the people in this district yesterday I met a young man going to college working three jobs he's paying Social Security for every single dollar he earns Andy's going to college and he's trying to do it in a way that he doesn't build this huge debt Peter Roskam doesn't focus on a man like him he doesn't focus on our young people what matters to the people in our district Peter Roskam Hashim follows Paul Ryan follows Donald Trump you know that I know she been an attorney for 24 years I've been a regulatory attorney he grew up in DuPage County I live in Clarendon Hills I would love to represent you to work for the values that we share and to help you build thank you hello everyone my name is Ryan Huffman I am 31 years old I live in Palatine I'm a data analyst I actually grew up here in Elgin on the east side one set of all the schools to be 46 graduated Elgin High School in 2004 I've lived in this area almost my entire life stay for a couple years of DC so in addition to those understandings are the problems that we face around here I also have the political experience and the policy expertise to go about solving these problems I have a master's in public policy from the University of Chicago I've injured the White House under President Obama I've also spent on my Capitol Hill living votes so I can help solve these problems and also make sure that they're actually turned into legislation is really difficult to navigate the system in DC right now I'm in this race because the country is a really bad path right now and it's not just Donald Trump the entire government is failing the American people if the government was working properly we would not see debates about them that we believe in climate change the debates would be about what's the most efficient way to reduce carbon emissions we wouldn't be debating which Americans deserve to have health care we'd be debating what's the best way to lower overall costs in the system or every single American is covered and I've spent time on Capitol Hill I've spent time in campaign campaigns and I see the root cause of all of this the reason that government is no longer working for the people and it's simply money in politics that is the close of all of it and it's helped me fix that we're not going to be able to fix any of these other problems so again unfortunately it's a problem not just for Republicans through pizza proper Democrats as well we're a little too eager to play into that system and say well that's just the way it goes but we are all blending for the chance to compete against the biggest coward in Washington DC Peter Roskam and if we're going to beat him we're not going to do it by playing on his turf we're not going to do it by us spending it we've got to do it by working in messaging and by showing real political courage no I feel that Peter Roskam and Donald Trump are a threat to the American dream they're a threat to the thought that everyone not just the wealthy should have the opportunity succeed they're our threat to the world Bagram our society to our economy to our climate to our healthcare I grew up in the south suburbs of Chicago my dad was at Union fortune and we didn't have much but we knew that if we worked hard we would have the opportunity to succeed when I was in high school my dad lost his job we had to sell our home and move into an apartment but I got my first job at age 16 I've been working ever since and I still knew that if I worked hard I would be able to go to college and I'd be able to succeed and I did go to college I went to the University of Illinois through affordable student loans and paying my way through in the dormitory food service with the beautiful hat that I got to wear and then I got a master's degree at the University of Illinois at Springfield and then I worked my way through northwestern law where I was honored to be the other very chief of the Law Review I was a full-time attorney a full time mom and a community volunteer and then life happened again a few years ago I had major surgery I was unable to work for a year and a half and I discovered during that time that there are many people like me who struggle we've done everything right but they need a helping hand and so I left the corporate world and I worked for congressman Bill Foster's is a Illinois chief of staff and in the imposition I did exactly what Peter Roskam did not do it is not doing I listen to constituents I met with them and their voices were heard I want your voices to be heard [Music] thank you candidates let's get right to the first run of your questions each candidate will have 90 seconds to answer and the starting candidate will shift with each question here is the first question and starting everything for the first we'll be killing his SP and the first question is the following immigration policy was a major issue in the last presidential election and remains so today what does good immigration reform me also what do you propose for an immigration policy and the war for it were security policy thank you well I think when people come to our country is undocumented immigrants they're coming here looking to live the American dream just like most of us in this room aspire to live and I think what we need more than anything is a comprehensive immigration reform bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform that would allow our undocumented immigrants to come out of the shadows and fully participate in our society and make a living pay taxes I absolutely will support extending daca and passing the DREAM Act 80% of Americans support passing the DREAM Act we need to let these people children who came over with their parents I had no say in the decision to become have the opportunity to become American citizens I think this is a moral issue and we owe it to them when it comes to border security absolutely think we should have strong laws but I think we can do it in a more cost effective manner and a higher tech efficiency I also want to mention that we have net zero immigration from Mexico and then the majority of our member coming from Guatemala Nicaragua Honduras and they're coming because of extreme poverty in danger and President Obama committed 500 million dollars a billion dollars to go to these countries and resolve it at the root problem so they don't want to come here and agree and they can stay in their homeland and that's what we should also be doing so in 2009 I was selected by the Chicago Council on global affairs in their second class of emerging leaders which was a awesome program I encourage you all to become members and they give us a two year project to figure out how comprehensive immigration reform rezneck the city of Chicago because at the time that was going to be something very soon to have it that's really impressive one of our conclusions was that if you could do nothing else politically do not get the dreamers because there's no real political objection to that and it's easy and we finished that saying well it's kind of a bummer because we got the easy thing and we didn't get a lot of stuff done and now Trump is basically kidnapped the larger issue that came out of what it would need to do comprehensive immigration reform properly number one the border wall is silly and stupid the the overwhelming majority of undocumented immigrants in the United States are these some of our states do we need to control a good opinion absolutely but there's some tricky civil liberties issues of abuse over States it's not a war number two we have huge confusion of how we coordinate our policy our terror policy that gets bound up in immigration and forces the wrong questions in the wrong places the last piece is our immigration policy since our inception has been fundamentally racist based on national origin we need to shift to a system that doesn't discriminate about the country people came from but what skills so let's start with the recognition that Peter Roskam knows that dreamers can't vote and undocumented immigrants can vote so those people are relying on us I think good immigration policy is recognizing that diversity is a benefit to America it's a recognition of where we all came from and it was not here unless you're Native American good immigration policy starts with fixing the immigration system so an agent that wants to bring in to the system an immigrant has to review twenty six different databases the immigration system is difficult and when people come here and they want go through the process it's hard on the agents it's hard on the people so good immigration policy starts actually fixing our government I am an advocate for comprehensive immigration reform when I began this race put that on my placard so that people could see that I'm willing to speak out for those who can't speak up for themselves that was standing but there is a smaller population in our part of the district where three-person undocumented but may in other parts of Illinois I think that the comprehensive immigration I'll stop now at 90 seconds is quicker than I thought thank you so let's start with immigrants are human beings and any policy should step from that that they deserve to be treated as human beings and that is not what's happening especially with the dreamers right now they're being treated as bargaining chips and Donald Trump doesn't care if he sends them back or not we need to be especially in this party as Democrats we have to stick up for them as far as immigration overall I'm proud that we live in a country that so many people want to come to from all over the world I think that's becoming less and less true as time goes on this they're being made by readers now but I'm proud of that and we should and we should recognize do that you know the majority of immigrants to come over become productive members of society within 10 years you know and you can pull Ryan talk about how well we're not we're gonna have to cut entitlements because we're not having enough children to support the future generations well having more immigration is a good way to deal with that too so there's reasons why we should create a pathway to citizenship citizenship for all undocumented immigrants and making it not a difficult process for people who want to come and support and pay taxes in America the border wall is a terrible idea and I think just what a message that sets the people of Mexico to say we we so badly know punching in this country that we're going to waste tens of billions of dollars on the stupid wall to try and keep you out can you imagine a candidate that that does I mean they may what I find particularly had the opportunity to achieve comprehensive immigration reform a few years back in fact it's funded voted for it it was in the house and it was blocked by House Speaker Boehner and Peter Roskam there were actually news conferences in this district encouraging here asked them to stand up in favor in support of comprehensive immigration reform and he chose to do nothing I heard about an interview on WBZ in November what he was talking about and he said comprehensive immigration reform is just not achievable it needs to be done piecemeal it was achievable and he blocked it we need to stand up for the daca recipients they need argan with this country they'd like to the country now their first information and they have been doing everything that they were supposed to do in accordance with the daka strictures and on March 5th they don't know what their futures will do I understand the need for certain securities but building a wall when our nation's infrastructure is crumbling and we can satisfy the infrastructure proposal it just came out today is not the way to achieve the security we're looking at nor our religious based immigration bans we can do things with drones with increased security how do you assess the state of our national infrastructure and our improvements needed do you support solving public financing of infrastructure projects or do you believe there's a role for private so I don't think there's any question that we need to improve our infrastructure you know my own background and the power industry the average power plant in the United States is coming up on close to 50 years old you could say the same of roads and bridges the I think we missed a huge opportunity in the tax bill the there are tools we have in the tax code to encourage people to invest and our company invested when there were tax incentives to invest and if you want to give corporations an incentive to invest capital use those funds get people tax breaks or depreciation if you want to create jobs get people tax breaks for creating jobs there are things that we have is illuminate the government do but so much of the infrastructure we have in this country today the steel mills the cement plants the trains these were built by the private sector with effectively the government providing some form of long term guarantee that you could get your money back had I not been doing this one of the one of the things I learned in investing about 200 million dollars with capital over the course of the last 16 years is that if you are if you're persuasive and good at your business you can get a lot of private sector capital people out of their comfort zone to invest in infrastructure it's really hard to have a comfortable investor and there's this huge as a as a friends entity said there's an ocean of money that wants to invest in the glacier of infrastructure opportunities that are out there and we're just looking for a river is forgotten we know that across the country infrastructure is crumbling it's costly to our productivity so we absolutely need some good infrastructure spending it's also a safety issue so it's not so long ago that we had the bridge collapse in Minnesota and we know that so many of our bridges remain very very dangerous I think there is some room for public-private partnerships in infrastructure building I'm more cautious about that maybe then Sean are some of the other candidates because growing up in the Chicago area and more recently I've seen some of the negatives that can happen to the public so when we sell our parking meters and you know the go to our roads in the parking and people have to start spending a lot more to park when we sell our bridges and we pay much much higher tolls those things don't benefit the public so there has to be a very cautious approach where we have accountability and how we don't allow those public/private partnerships where we're spending where we're requiring that we use prevailing wage standards so that we're creating really good paying jobs there's a lot that needs to go into an infrastructure bill thank you well I would spend I think it's it's inexcusable in this country that we have so many people still on willingly out of work when there is so much work to do and I know our unemployment rate is over taken a long time but I think we all know that's not really representative of the real strength of our economy because so many people are still unemployed wages are lower than they should be so it's a huge economic opportunity and the infrastructure spending of the 1930s is what build a middle class in this country Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal plan and I think that is something that we can go back to to revitalizing the class here as well in terms of public versus private I agree that when you add the profit motive to something it never ends up being good for the public things like roads and bridges it's it's too important to make sure that they're safe to really serving the best interests of the public and infrastructure it's not just roads and bridges you know it's it's smart grid technology it's broadband access to rural areas these are things that are gonna be hugely beneficial for people down the road and so I think the government should take a proactive role of making sure that that's being done safely and and properly and as a result we'll see another really great economic movement and especially the middle class miss Cheney our infrastructure can be used also to improve our economy particularly sustainable infrastructure when we're talking about a green environment why not have infrastructure that both is economically viable and environmentally helpful to the future I have to tell you what I find particularly troubling is the current infrastructure or build that Donald Trump has proposed really seems to trickle down the costs to local municipalities in two states and one of the concerns is if you look at the tax plan one of the things that people aren't really talking about the tax bill that we passed and something did is get rid of advanced refunding which allows municipalities to take advantage of a one-time there's a lower interest rate on a bond to refinance at once and the tax bill takes takes away that opportunity so as it is it's going to be more costly for the municipalities to engage in the very infrastructure improvements that we need as a country building the foundation of our country and the safety of bridges in Illinois the safety of bridges is one of the major concerns we do need to look at improving it and I think public-private partnerships particularly when I was working with congressman foster they were looking at partnerships in the waterway areas I think there is a role for that the structures in cinema I absolutely believe that we need to modernize our infrastructure the American Society of Civil Engineers has rated our infrastructure at d+ so we want to attract corporations and businesses from overseas and keep growth coming here in our country we need to have modern infrastructure to be able to efficiently effectively transport goods and workers it's also a win-win situation for our country because building the infrastructure would provide thousands of solid middle-class jobs with good wages so it's a way to build our economy from the bottom up and not just at the top level i I think that this is a wise thing to do when you talk about public versus private funding I am also concerned about Trump's plan because I'm afraid if we rely too much on the states to provide funding for this that it will result in tax increases for the people in those states so right now I support primarily federal funding for doing this thank you candidates starting question excuse me the started candidate for the next question will be Jennifer's value and here is the next question what should the federal government do to protect voting rights for all eligible citizens we need to restore the Voting Rights Act and start more closely monitoring the elections across the country to prevent voter suppression we need to look more closely at the election systems that we're using right for this election is upcoming election in Illinois I don't know if you've heard but I really prefer that everybody pull a paper ballot we know that there's some custody issues and concerns with the electronic voter and here in Illinois we have actually a good system we try to open up our voting it's better than a lot of places across the country so I do think that the federal government has a role and the Justice Department has a role in enforcing the availability of voting access to all voters across the country we saw in the last election that people were disenfranchised from the vote there's a ton of issues that go into free fair elections and we're seeing a lot of different areas different lines of attack against people who just want to vote in this country and that's one of our most sacred American rights is the ability to vote freely without restrictions and it's it's clearly under attack I would start number one thing I would do is say let's make elected a national holiday no reason not to do that it's a no greater that'll make it so much easier for me that is a a not having via a natural holiday it's sort of an implicit voter suppression tactic so we need you to eliminate that right away gerrymandering is another big cause that makes some people's votes worth more than others that's another big way that we can change that at the federal level to say you know what we have to have all our district lines drawn by nonpartisan committees where the courts and make sure that everyone's vote counts equally so beyond that I think there's efforts proceeding as certainly this voter fraud commission which was shut down thankfully the Crisco block one but has just been moved over to the Department of Homeland Security to do the same job we've got to make sure that we're turning that down as well I love that we've got automatic voter registration in the state of Illinois let's try and expand that nationally and then let's work on the disenfranchised felons roster and let's make sure that they have I believe that the Department of Justice should be engaged in this issue because the right to vote is the most fundamental right that we have in this nation and it is so unfortunate that excuses are being used for example IDs that are not required in other contexts being required of voters but I agree that this is a broader issue it's not only the issue of voting it is the general issue an order disenfranchising in all that this campaign finance reform is a huge example we've all heard of the issues with the super PACs dark moody when people feel that elections are so-called wat when they feel that politicians are voting for corporate interests instead of the interest of the individual that they were elected to represent they don't feel that their vote matters anymore and when there is Jam gerrymandering when someone doesn't need to listen to their entire community because they're safe in their district regardless people feel than their book doesn't mirror so there are numerous aspects to systemic reform that need to be undertaken in this country and governmental reform on all levels but including in the voter access is extremely important if we're going to keep our electorate engaged one of our fundamental rights is to cast a vote officials and we need to preserve that and suppression for our voters is going on very intensely in certain states and it's affecting the ability to vote for minorities for the elderly and for students and this has got to end I also believe that we need to have a national voting day so that people don't have to worry about missing work we can make it easy for them have them show up and cast their vote without worrying about being late or rushing through traffic I think Illinois is great in that we have automatic voter registration ins of DMV and I think we need to make that easier again we have two states that are even reducing the number of their Department of Motor Vehicles to make it harder for people to get some kind of photo ID to vote with and we also need to stop gerrymandering we're playing games with politics and maps here we need to allow love them but what should I say right now right now the gerrymandering politicians are choosing their voters and what we need to have instead is to allow voters to elect their representatives so again it's a fundamental right and we have to preserve this and make it easy for people to vote not harder mr. Casten let me start with an easy definition of success with the request that all of you hold us accountable one of us will win this election and this is the metric Congress has a ten percent favorability ratio and an 85 percent incumbency ratio when those two numbers are the same we felt have achieved it completely figured that percentage of voting system yes gerrymandering is a problem money in politics overwhelming problem it has unfortunately become a partisan issue because people have known for at least 15 years that all of the Democrats the trends of the society are favoring the Democratic Party the Republican Party could have decided to modulate their message to match demographics and instead decided on domestic murder suppression that is a massive problem there should be no difference in anybody's about individual polling place and you know I think we probably agree all of this but let me tell you what I think the biggest issue that Congress is going to have to deal with in 2019 how do we restore analyst faith that their vote is just as valid in the 2020 election as they thought it was in the 2016 election this is a massive foreign policy issue there is information about how the Russians impacted our election the people that said the only way they could have gotten that information is abandon side access to vote builder files from congressional campaigns we need to find out what happened we need to get the bottom up and we give you confidence that it won't happen again it's the start a candidate for the next question then applying Huffman here's the next question should the United States move to a single-payer health care system if so what steps should be taken to make this happen if not what is your vision for the future of health care yeah that's an easy one for me yes we need to move to a single-payer health care system this should be a no-brainer for us we're seeing other almost every other industrialized nation around the world is doing this they're doing it well they have better health outcomes they have lower costs there's no reason for us not to do this and this is actually one of the few real differentiators we have in this place is we tend to agree on a lot of issues up here but we're not all in favor of single-payer to me I respect the Obama care I was benefited when we expanded Medicaid and Obamacare for a couple years but I couldn't find a job so I think we absolutely need to protect it but people are not going to go for us if we say we want to make sure that a few more people have coverage I mean we need to say as long as any American doesn't have coverage our works not done we got to keep fighting until every single American has coverage and single there is the best way to do that is changing I personally am in the marketplace system and so I understand the need for basic affordable universal health care in this country in theory the idea of single-payer I agree with it's how we get there even the labels some people call it Medicare for all others call it single-payer and they don't necessarily be in the same thing and when we look at other countries it actually is a combination of most countries of public and private so it's getting to the details of how we would transition to that system and like with any significant change in society we would need do it in a reasoned fashion where we have it set out and in how we would achieve it one intermediate step and I believe this is currently is the plan is proposed as a public option to increase the risk pool because one of the big concerns right now is the narrowing of the risk pool and what's unfortunate is the people like Peter Roskam and Donald Trump are working very hard to sabotage the accessibility and affordability of healthcare instead of working to compromise and to achieve a healthcare system that can serve us all and do so affordably and when they access that we need I think in the long run yes it is how we would get there and making sure that we have have set the stage for it because you know UI is here the devil is in the details and it's finding those details because aspirationally yes I think that our country in the long run may end up with a system like that but getting to that and Peter the way permit takes timing and also how many labels things is very important some people will use a label Medicare for all of what does that really mean the definition of one person like different thank you thank you Miss Cheng miss mazurski I support Medicare for all public option and what this means is that people would be able to buy to a Medicare program at any age and his Medicare for all public option would compete side-by-side on the health care exchange with the policies offered by insurance companies the Congressional Budget Office has stated that by having a public option we would save taxpayers a hundred and fifty billion dollars over ten years now that is truly significant also the cost of care in this country per person per year is double that of the next three highest range nations so again we use the strong bargaining power of Medicaid to not only reduce insurance premium costs but to reduce the cost of care itself then we also have to have the ability to negotiate prescription drug prices I'm sure all of us have had sticker shock when we go to the pharmacy to pick up our medications so we have to have that for our citizens and use that just as we do with the Veterans Administration right now Health Care's personal issue for me I know it's personal for all of you in this room and when I went through breast cancer we had another medical my family I went back and figured out how much are those worth and they were nearly 750,000 dollars that is unacceptable we have to make sure everybody has affordable quality editor so they don't go broke from their medical bills so the functional goal regardless of how you get there is the best possible health care at the lowest possible price the u.s. spends more per capita than any other country in the OECD and we have worse health outcomes in any other country the OECD so the first steps are really easy all we do is go to what those other countries have the every single country that has better health outcomes than the US has a universal health care model and whether you're single-player or multiplayer it's Universal and let's be honest we have universal health care in this country right now it's just that for a lot of people universal health care consists of doing nothing until something really bad happens and going to the emergency room so what universal health care has to be is something that gives everybody an incentive and an opportunity both to deal with catastrophes and to get the preventative health because that's why it gets driven down to take the next leaf that universal health care is a no-brainer do you go to single payer there are no countries that have the size and heterogeneity of the United States that have single-payer and have better health outcomes than the best countries that have multi-payer and it kind of makes sense intuitively if you've got a competitive market truly competitive and disciplined and regulated trying to figure out how to provide the right option for a lot of different people that tends to be more efficient than a single-payer fitting and how to get it done and the ideal model would be one where everybody's got a floor we have something like the Obamacare exchanges but they're available for everybody not just by state by by employer and excuse me put that across the board mister I am first and foremost advocating for fixing the Affordable Care Act and I've been advocating for that most strongly because we now know that people on both sides of the aisle recognize what it is what it can do and they're supportive of it so to move to any new health care system we hear from the answers here how varied the approaches are how complex they are I'm not clear like what shawne's approach is exactly and I didn't realize America I've had but a lot of us would think of as a universal health care system I do think the Democrats are wrong when we say that the Affordable Care Act is almost there we've almost achieved our goal because we do have 90 coverage I agree with Ryan that's not acceptable to have only partial coverage but we also know that the coverage is not affordable for a lot of people there's a lot of people who have gotten squeezed in this program but let's face it the Affordable Care Act doesn't work because of Republican politicians torpedoed it Marco Rubio was very proud he failed to patient ensures when they negotiated to cover the risk of networkable Care Act that's been overturned by court so we'll start to see some money come in but the system still needs to be stabilized and clear I apologize I don't mean to trivialize this what I'm saying is that our health care system is expensive in no small part because nobody of good conscience would turn someone away at the emergency room that is the most expensive part of the care so a proper universal health care system gives everybody a base level of care that says you have regular check-ups you have protection if you have all the things that you come to a respectfully proper health care system it then is a separate question of who pays for that that should be the government do we then have options to opt in to other program just because you're separated because what's the right way to provide universe for everybody else is that okay we're now ready for the next and final question of the first round and the fifth and final question of the first round the start attending with me is Chaney and this is the fifth question of the first round president Trump has called for adversaries to be jailed attacked press sought to undermine an FBI investigation failed to clearly condemn those marching far-right extremists and in general has shown little understanding of our system of checks and balances for this reason concerns have arisen regarding the state of our democracy do you agree that our democracy is everywhere and if so what needs to be done to protect it I am concerned about how Donald Trump's actions are impacting our democracy as an attorney myself and as a former journalist I find it troubling that alleged violations of the emoluments clause which is the president shouldn't profit from being the president are kind of low on the totem pole of the purported violations that are appearing right now and what's particularly troubling is with what's currently going on with the Justice investigation and then when you look at the release of the Republican memo calling the DOJ into question in what could be construed as a political attempt to call into question the DOJ investigation I find extremely troubling and then when Donald Trump is also continually calling out the media his fake news the media has been called before the state it's always been looked at as the outsider looking in and trying to be objective Donald Trump is trying to discredit anything that goes against what he wants I find it extremely troubling for our system of government and I truly hope that Republicans like Peter Roskam at some point stand up against Donald Trump and what he is doing I do think that our democracy is that risk with this president we see someone who is reckless and very divisive and we should be we look to our president for inspiration that they're bringing citizens together and a steadies driving us apart and fueling a climate of alienation and hatred so what do we do about this we need to absolutely support the Moller investigation so this is can play out so we know our democracy was undermined by dropping together we also I also want to note that I don't think we have strong enough response to what Russia and say it according to our intelligence ease in his in our country we have been told that they undermine our democracy that more means many people's follows Facebook gas has voted in our election this has gotta stop so Congress voted to have sanctions put in place to prevent country with stations on countries that are buying military weapons from Russia and guess what President Trump did not support that so again we need to have a strong response in the future when we feel our democracy as its state we have to respond quickly and promptly and strongly and with their allies put sanctions on countries that have attacked our democracy it's the most basic part of the mr. Kaster yes democracy is a risk and yes we can fix it because our founding documents were written by people who had experience with tyrants and put a good system of checks and balances in place the problem is real easy the congressional leadership in the GOP has completely lost their backbone and been completely unwilling to fulfill their obligation to act as a check and balance not this crazy Trump is terrible Trump is proof that whatever exceptional thing we thought we had were just like everybody else in the world we are capable at some level and being manipulated by a demagogue and that's that's a human nature problem that's nothing us but if we have people in Congress who will hold Trump accountable who will stand up and truly put country over party not just say over there on their way out the door retire we will fix this problem he will be held accountable and we will get beyond it but Trump is an agent of chaos Russia as a government has a vested interest in a chaotic world you don't have to person collusion to know that he is doing exactly what Russia's bidding is and the fact the Republican party of all parties who used to be the people accusing people of being communist a national security is not standing up and saying I actually love America put us first stand up to chaos use the founding documents and we will fix this we all and we saw it in the run-up to the election we saw it from trying to undermine the press and then we thought when he chose his cabinet and putting government up for sale putting Betsey dr. Boston is the head of education the lack respect for the separation of church and state our institutions are at risk but I do believe they are strong enough to withstand the threat from this administration I agreed that the GOP leadership is not being strong but I also think it demands more from us as Democrats and as Congress person I would be speaking out more immediately and more vocally about some of the actions are being taken by this administration I agree we should have implement the sanctions of Congress voted for and the president would not implement but we're also now expanding our war in Syria and we're not talking about it very much in Congress that some Democrats as well we cannot control the actions of another person we are responsible for our own actions and Democrats have to take the lead on this a decency and competency that you must reach in order to be entrusted with the power that comes with the presidency of the United States and he has failed to meet those bars therefore he cannot be President and this is about holding people accountable so that the next time somebody like this wants to be President and wants to run again that will be able to say this is not acceptable it's the same thing with the Moller investigation if Trump is able to get away with the obstruction of justice and the clear collusion and everything that's going on that wants to stop the next step from doing the exact same thing we have these people have to be held accountable and Donald Trump in particular has field accountable and for all the ways that Peter Roskam has failed this district is cowardice on this issue is enabling a Donald Trump is the most egregious this is why we need people with political courage which is courage in general in Congress Thank You candidates we are now ready for the second we are now ready for the second round of questions in this round there will be also define a record but each question will be addressed to only three to three of you two as to only three candidates the group's Tiffany were selected in advance randomly every candidate for each candidate will have 90 seconds to answer by the end of this round each candidate will have had a chance to speak first second and third the first question will be addressed to Shawn Kemp Carole Cheney and the first question and it's a little bit of among administration's attack on the EPA and the rollback of long-standing environmental protections that you improve the quality of our air and water what would you do to protect the environment including the recently regulatory reckless and then there's a second part to this but the first part is essentially with everything that the president is been going to effectively rollback environmental laws what would you do about that now that second much of this question is do you believe that business interests should play a role in forming environmental regulations and if so what should their will be so first question there's been a recent and regulatory effort and how would you address that you later secondly people business appreciative of all this questions addressed to mr. Peskin mr. Cheney and mr. Hoffman okay so in the first point the we actually have an example of doing this most of you may know the name Gorsuch some of you may have forgotten that courses mother was the EPA director under Reagan who followed a very crew ish example and Congress helped her accountable through her out many good people in the EPA if their files brought in the bank when she was gone and restored regular order that will be done when Congress goes back up the yes that's about the most legit be different when say to bridge with and my goodness isn't with respect to the second question one of the things that I've spent a ton of time business context as a clean energy advocate the we have demonized the environmental movement from the business community and ontero the environmental movement is demonized the business community our peril there are a ton of policy fixes that are good for the economy and good for the environment I spent my whole professional career proving that for the most part those are done in spite of environmental and you can because and when you get smart people at the table who will be held accountable to be clear you must clean up the air but when you sit there and say if you could make money and come here do that before you do a mandate that structure is generally not in the rules it's been done in countries like the Netherlands fairly effectively there are a number of things that could be done with an existing environmental regulation and I'm going to be cut off so I would say go to my website there's a whole environmental section where the parts many pages of how to do that but there's a lot of things as it could be done with business at the table as long as you recognize that we're going to the movement first and then we'll deal with the trade-offs well if I could the first thing I would do is fire Scott Pruett I was just reading today about the number of unfilled positions there are in the EPA and that is purposeful the staff has declined by the hundreds and in working with Congressman Foster who was the only PhD scientist in Congress we would regularly track what was going on with the EPA and it literally is deconstruction of that agency they are trying to get rid of scientists by failing to give them folsom opportunities to do what they are supposed to do and they are kind of denigrated to lesser positions we need to stand up for our environment because we are stewards of this country we're stewards for our children and climate change is real and it is now and we need to address it and what's what's fascinating is it is not usually and assistance to have a business community that also is environmentally sound in fact that is the business of the future and as the government we can do more to create incentives for green technologies that exactly that's exactly what an infrastructure plan can do that's exactly what a tax plan can do is foster sustainable infrastructure and green technology well I think those two questions are very closely related because the reason the EPA is deregulating is because the business interests have far too much say in setting environmental policy they have Exxon Mobil and Chevron all these huge oil and gas companies that have such a powerful role in who gets elected and then they get their way once once Republican administrations get in there is that so I see someone like Scott Pruett pulling rolling way back on the EPA role in regulating the environment and the problem is that the environment doesn't have a really wealthy advocate if the government isn't going to advocate for the environment there's no one else with the authority or the power to be able to actually protect it and so it's not enough to say well we're gonna incentivize clean energy we're gonna give you no solution to solving the climate crisis that's it's not going to be enough immediately a price on carbon they have a carbon tax or a cap and trade system both of which say we are going to reduce the the carbon emissions in our atmosphere we're going to do that over time and that's the only way that you're ever going to keep carbon emissions low enough to a level that's actually going to put off the or stop altogether the worst effects of climate change we're already starting to see some of the worst effects of climate change so I would not cater to the business community at all that we are skewed 8020 are in favor of business so let's let's go back the other way an actual effect this planet thank you candidates the second question of this round will be addressed to chemicals st Jennifer's our Donny and Shawn Caston in that order and here is the second question from scaling back the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau delaying implementation of the Department of Labor's fiduciary role and repealing net neutrality the Trump administration is scaled back existing consumer protections and threatens others what should the government's role in consumer protection well I think that the government should have a strong role in consumer protection and when you talk about the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau I am really infuriated of what's been happening with that one in particular this Bureau was founded after 2008 after the meltdown because that mortgages and consumers be taken advantage of by loans and mortgage and just mortgage industry this has been a very very effective hardware government where people can file complaints and it can be a watch bar for banks and mortgage companies that are doing using discriminatory lending and charging higher interest rates for minorities and other people and now trauma wants to take the power to enforce this away from this agency and make it weak and this really upsets me so I you know in general believe that it is our duty to protect our consumers and make sure that they are protected against fraud and things along this line and what was the rest of the question it was a three point I do you think that they should have to do share responsibility I'm a former financial consultant for major investment firm I was a product development chemist and then eventually switch careers a witness to the finance field because I was interested in intrigued by it and it is absolutely imperative that people have fiduciary responsibilities it's people come in and are asking you to invest their life savings but they're gonna depend on they need to know that they can trust that person Evan Robley just to make a quick buck on a tree and as my degree issues were the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau the fiduciary rule for investments and the next so my 24 years as an attorney I practiced in a lot of areas of law but my primary focus has been financial services regulation so when I was younger I worked on the Florida Board of Trade and I think the Chicago Board of Trade Knight lived through the 1987 crash and at a first hand view of risk management I was very fortunate to work her woman who was an accountant to know for auditor and we had the risk management 2008 I watched and was concerned about Bear Stearns and whether it had enough assets to custody clients money so when dodd-frank was passed I understood the complexity of that huge bill and I understood that it was going to need Republican cooperation to start tailoring the bill but instead the Republicans sat on their hands and now they attack the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau which is doing very good work the fiduciary rule is a whole separate ball of wax because what really goes on is investment advisors are fiduciaries the issue is your brokers so when brokers manage retirement funds they're held to a different standard and the fiduciary rule is intended to protect retirement accounts there's a lot of fees that go into retirement accounts and that cost consumers billions of dollars as they're unaware of fiduciary rules incredibly complex and it affects a lot of industries a net neutrality aim for restoring the protection for net neutrality as his question was too long for 90 second let me make it they make an overarching observation on the role of governments and markets first of all that the business community is neither moral nor immoral it is a one it is a thing it seeks to accomplish things you cannot expect business to do the public good that is the role of the government but it doesn't mean any expand markets when you have a market solution are a fantastic way to achieve efficiency but what everybody seems to have forgotten the took macroeconomics and then fell in love with a neuron or whatever that crazy theory is out there is that being in a truly competitive market is a terrible way to live your customers have too much information your competitors have too much information your markets get squeezed we used to say if my various clean energy advocacy on the hill there isn't a single person who comes to Capitol Hill and advocates for competitive markets and so we desperately need people in Washington to understand that I have a massive respect and quarter length in preparation for Elizabeth Warren as somebody who actually understands markets and advocates for consumers she is the exception to the rule so what we need are people who understand markets have been in those spaces it's true for it's true for investment protections it's true for net neutrality it's true for a whole host of other issues you have to have somebody who sits there and says yes I get that there are business interests here and their interests are valid and should be considered but the one person who is not here about advocating our consumers who want to see an efficient market place that has to be the role of the Commerce thank you the third question of this round will be addressed it will be addressed telling the seski and here's a question like this like American education continues to lag local leaders in providing youth with the tools necessary to flourish in modern society what could be done to strengthen American education and prepare the next generation to compete well I wish I had a silver bullet solution to solve all our education laws but there are there are many and maybe almost all of them though can be dealt with just a lot more equitable funding and so much of the problem that we're having especially in the K through 12 level is that the funding is larger base especially around here on local property taxes so if you've got a school little met you'll have a very different education than if you go to school in Bronzeville that's something that we need to work out just the way that we fund our system beyond that I think that we we have said there are there are some very proven methods to to help educational outcomes early childhood education is critical it's a it's a great investment for our government to make because the the education outcomes the the health outcomes that you have later in life if you have early childhood education are much much much better if you have that very childhood experience you know three lunches at school there's a big part of that after school programs is a big part of it but in general we just need to we need to be focusing on our public education system and not trying to give it away to private schools to charter schools that's not where the fun things should be allocated and then it's a really super chart of our educational system we have to focus on post-secondary school we've got to make free public college tuition for all students it should not depend on how much money your parents had how good of an education you can get that is where we need to get as a country well education is a personal strong personal issue for me because I'm the first of my family to graduate from college and it was because my parents worked really hard to provide my sister and me with opportunities for that and I'm for that I'm very grateful in terms of education we need to invest in universal pre-k because children who graduate from Universal through pre-k earn higher incomes as adults we need to make sure that we have necessary funding at the primary and secondary school level so if a state can't provide the necessary funding for people areas that are don't have as much money the federal government should step in to help out with that and then we absolutely have to help when it comes to higher education and I just want to say that I think it's really critical that every person every child born in this country has the opportunity to live up to their full potential and then we do this by providing a good education we one have students educated for 21st century Java skills so we need to make make sure their apprenticeships available for them that they can go to community colleges or go to a four-year university and not be saddled with a tremendous amount of debt it's cheaper to get a house than it is to get a student loan and that needs to change and then again we need to be partnering with high schools and community colleges and local businesses to make sure that our students are getting the skills they need to get jobs as soon as they graduate well I think the most two significant factors in the educational system that is facing us is the issue of income inequality and it's the issue of what our jobs will be in the economy of tomorrow so first let's talk about income inequality under Benson of us we're diverting resources from our public schools and we're taking away the resources that those who most need them can have an education should not be something that only the wealthy can achieve and when you look at our higher education system right now the cost of tuition I have two sons in college and they both are going to have astronomical student loans but when we look also in the jobs of tomorrow we need to be preparing our students because we don't even know what the technology is going to be there are going to be the self-driving trucks there is going to be technology that we are not even aware of today and we need to be preparing our students now for those critical thinking skills and how to train because they're going to have different jobs every five years in the future and we need to be thinking now how to prepare our students for the jobs of the future thank you candidates the question [Music] I am an advocate for raising the federal minimum wage to $15 and I think it has to be staged in and I think there has to be some regional adjustments and I can appreciate that for certain businesses that may be problematic I'm not even sure though that $15 an hour is a livable wage but that's a good starting point I have to thank the really progressive people who have been pushing for a higher minimum wage for a few years now more than a few this when we first started talking about it there were concerns that it would be a shock to the economy we've seen it implemented in places with success it has to be staged in our wage our wages certainly have not kept pace with the other costs in the economy I'm sorry what is the second part of the question it's just you know do you consider do you consider a living wage what would you like to raise it to which it knows which they did um we have to recognize if people aren't working harder and getting less for their day's labor and I appreciate that some jobs may be considered more an entry level but those jobs well we see people say oh we should raise the wage because McDonald's will automate McDonald's is gonna automate anyway we need to focus on lifting up people's wages mister yeah $15 is a great number to start with I would absolutely support a $15 minimum wage and it's very critical though that we index it to inflation so that as the cost of living continues to go up so does that wait I understand the economic argument that it could cause hardship in a business community my solution to that issue is to take a page again from FDR's book there was a program in 30s where they were trying to bridge that gap between the scarcity of food and resources in the amount that people might exploit folks with the Great Depression had to pay the government filled that cap so they said all right if you can't sell this product for anything less than this and stay viable as a business and if you can't pay any more than this then we're gonna fill the gap you can do the same thing with minimum wage and that way small businesses are still able to compete if they say well I might not I can't pay more than $9 an hour per later and we have to make sure that our that our people are getting $15 an hour in order to have a living wage the government can fill in that gap I think that's the right way to approach this issue and then I would say the other really key piece of that is getting to universal health care because that's one of the other issues that's really that small businesses really struggle with to pay for so then the cost if you're not required as a business to cover the employees health care trip is service and that's a much lower cost to have that employee anyway I do support a living wage of $15 an hour I think that anybody who is working a 40-hour workweek and working hard deserves to have a chance to live a decent life and the majority of people earning the minimum wage are not high schoolers who are working in retail which sometimes I hear from people it's actually people over the age of 18 and most women some of these people are trying to support family we need to help them and give it a chance it's hard to battle this but years ago people are afraid of letting people off on the weekends businesses were afraid to let a 40 week a 40-hour Work Week transpire and guess what it all worked out so I think we have to do this we have to sort of living wage is there any legislation you would support with respect to the role of unions in our economy beginning with these change I grew up in a Union family my dad was a union butcher and I understand the importance of unions to the middle class and this nation and what's so troubling right now is the attack on unions the attack in this state and at the federal level right-to-work laws that actually are the right to work for Less we need to protect the workers in this country that is what provided a living wage to people and what's particularly troubling right now is the jamz decision that is facing the Supreme Court which has to do with collective bargaining for state workers and whether or not they can have to pay union dues for those collective or this is an attempt to eviscerate unions in this country and if we look at how wages have declined how income inequality is increased and if you look at the decline in unions at the same time there is a correlation you need to achieve some of the greatest rights for workers in this country and as a nation we need to understand the role that unions have played I think everyone should read the jungle it provides an instruction on the role of labor unions in this country mr. Paston so the Congress absolutely has a role here and you know there is always a tension in capital we live at a point right now where wages are at an all-time low as a percentage fee total wage income corporate profits are at all-time high as a percentage of GDP there is no way to look at this stuff with these relationships and say yeah labor cap more pretty much balanced somewhat cynically I don't actually think Republicans any opposition opposition and Democrats you need Simmons have strong supporters of Democrats that they're trying to take them down yes we need to defend against the encroachment right to work we need to defend against these project labor agreements that are allowing people to use public private partnerships to get around unions but I think beyond the broad protections to make sure that has a seat at the table this automation thing that another people problem is in real problem that I don't think we're focused on enough we had about 6,000 people who depended solely on us for their utilities and the company that I ran are either unemployed or massively under employed in jobs that are 1099 incomes totally lost in the system and if you don't find the way to protect those people we're going to be troubled I agree that you the Congress has a role in protecting unions and one of the key reasons for that is to protect collective bargaining and to strengthen the voice have this goes to the whole theme of where people have unequal bargaining power and the role that government is supposed to play and we know that workers have unequal bargaining power with their employers here in Illinois we have this continual assault on unions because we have this continual discussion of our unfunded pension liabilities that's not working people's fault they paid in thir share that was supposed to go to their pensions and whatever the leadership and the government negotiated they have an obligation to make sure that it was funded so that issue should not take away from the fact that workers need collective strength to maintain their wages over the winter the teachers assistance of an Palatine went on strike and the teachers have negotiated their contract the year before but in Palatine now when the assistance were up these are people help your kids in their classroom and prevent their you know peanut butter from hurting one of the kids who has a peanut allergy it's the nurses it's the people who help your kids learn and they were negotiating when they typically made 11 to 13 hours of negotiating for a quarter and some benefits people need to recognize how that is our collective bargaining strength thank you candidates we are now ready for the third round of questions in this round there will also be five questions which each candidate will be asked to answer by holding at the card mark either yes or no [Music] if after holding up the car did you candidates would like to briefly clarify their answers as well as as well as here's the question do you support the social all candidates have said yes now if the candidates I think will move out in the other direction this time if the candidates would like 10 seconds to clarify your answer if you like would anyone like to clarify your answer for the record all the Kennedys suggest I'm in favor but because we know that if we increase the level of wages on which we're paying Social Security it is going to help on the system a little more quickly and it would bring the but stabilize it a little bit more I would just have just add it's worth those of you don't understand the issue Social Security is a fundamental progressive system it's taxed in a fundamentally progressive fashion because it's only the first hundred twenty five thousand your seller that goes in so let's just okay that's question do you support making public colleges and universities tuition-free for all students and I will say that this is something we're obviously very interested in here find that to be interesting to discuss so again I'll say do you support making public colleges and universities tuition-free for all students clarify I think there is an issue with income inequality but at the same time I think we have to look at it realistically and I don't want to pay for if I'm good Trump's public college yeah I think it's a it's a no-brainer to do it and we pay for it all on about a tenth of the cost of the GOP taxable I also don't want to pay for Ivana Trump's college but I I think that there are differences in both the effort that's expended when certain students go to college versus others and we can do that yeah nobody should have a financial barrier than education but that's not to say that we should throw money at people who don't need who can afford to pay high for debt-free college versus free college so that we should provide waste font and how glow income students so they can't go to college and not be burdened with debt and also programs that you can trade work for tuition like they do at the military thank you I think you can fix their question can you support federal legislation banning states from a from an F that are so-called right-to-work laws as you support federal legislation banning States from enacting right to right-to-work laws and just by way of background I believe senator Warren senator Elizabeth Warren and we've introduced a bill to ban right-to-work laws in all 50 states along with some other co-sponsors of Congress last fall so do you support legislation I mean it's a difficult issue because the visions of federalism and states rights and and and that is something that I really struggled with so this is one of those in theory yes but no I feel like I'm on Jeopardy lots of a lot of people concern uh yeah again I think your favors from unions eww favor this I would get too complicated the states rights and that sort of thing you've got a thank you for my ten seconds mostly I think I agreed it's tricky I think the larger issues let's protect against the race to the bottom where status can just cannibalizing your nominee resources together I think this works but I'd like for you to go I come from a storm strongly and family through my grandparents worked on factory lines as well as my cousins and uncles I absolutely support unions and I will stand up against any efforts made by the Republicans to show you support banning arbitration clauses in contracts between corporations and consumers background there has been attempt by many corporations to incorporate arbitration clauses in particularly the contracts with consumers well give that's what arbitrate one of the things that arbitration clauses prevent from being able to happen is class sessions the arbitration clauses block the parties into arbitrating privately rather a whole ability to do our actual sentence okay so here's the question together can you support banning arbitration clauses in contracts between corporations and again arbitration clause Patricia because right now we were talking about assumer protection financial Bureau there is a push to allow baked consumers from finding class-action lawsuits pending arbitration clauses in contracts between corporations and consumers it gets to the issue of unequal bargaining power yeah we need a lot more regulation and restrictions on how businesses can screw over consumers and this is a good place to start with arbitration first to hold about we thought it would be more inexpensive for consumers who would benefit them and hasn't proven to be the case and it's not transparent enough mr. Casten I think it's fundamentally an access to the courts issue and this blocks access to the courts I do think that if you have two equally sophisticated parties they should be free to clauses that they go and that's a point well taken and that's why we were limiting the question to we're assuming is between the type of the corporation and the question is we've seen the other candidates for the nomination for some time now including in forums like this if you do not get the nomination when you commit to supporting including appearing in public I think it's very important that we stand up together after the primary because the most important goal is to defeat Peter Roskam because he is not listening to the people in this district is not doctor sending the voters yeah the real battle the real fight for the soul of the country is it delivers or whatever disagreements we have now will be pushed aside very quickly after primary yes well let's move to a big wheel to expand the pool because for a Democrat to win in the only six you have to convince typically but okay this isn't about clarifying my response to a particular question but I think all of these questions demonstrate the intricacies of the many issues that are placed by legislators every day there are nuances and issues in quick yes or no answers to many of those really don't get into the fulsome analysis that is needed to make a determination well I think some of the stuff is really not that complicated that like Xavier if you're favoring strata in favor strong unions you've gotta support the ban on right-to-work law in favor of consumer protection you have a support a ban on arbitration clauses and lastly I would just disagree with straw not on how you need to get thirty to forty thousand Republicans to win this district I don't think that's how we've seen the rest of it's happening in this country in Virginia and New Jersey over the last year or so it happens when you get more progressives to come out then you get Republicans to come out because we know that even when people are dissatisfied with Donald Trump they're not likely to known so vote for a Democrat who's sort of close enough to be a Republican if there's not much different still still vote for the Republicans so we've got a rally the base we've got a lot of energy and enthusiasm in this district and we may get people fired up to come out go do something a bit before I think that's true when Democrats vote Democrats win so we need to work with the people we know I would also suggest that there's many people towards that mill who recognized that this Republican administration and Peter Roskam do not represent their values in any way nowadays so their party is left behind and political divorce is so easy come join us so so I guess we absolutely need to motivate all the base to vote and I guess this is the topic du jour we're talking about let's not lose sight of the fact that in 2016 Hillary won this district by seven points she did it because she convinced a lot of people who normally pull a Republican ballot that if we're gonna get the country on the right track that to go the other way I think if we are sitting here in this room and saying well the Democrats from China have shame on us we're gonna represent the entire district not just the Democrats I think that we have an excellent opportunity to pick up the independents and Republicans in this race because the majority of people are concerned about health care the majority of Americans did not support repealing the Affordable Care Act which fortunately has not happened I also think Peter Roskam is very vulnerable because he supported eliminating the state and local tax deduction was the permanent architect of this tax bill which through his own district government was five million dollars with the tax cuts were taken by nearly 50% of the residents in the Illinois six district and also I would say then he's very vulnerable because he doesn't hold town halls as well if anybody for the fourth and final round of questions ever this time there opportunity to begin the final round of questions there will be two questions asked why are you the best I've been doing exactly what Peter Roskam hasn't been doing is the Illinois chief of staff to congressman Bill Foster we held town halls they're not what Peter Rustom says they are I've done it we took I personally took phone calls from constituents in this district in the sixth congressional who Peter rostov's office was not taking on the ACA I took and answered those phone calls but aside from that Peter Roskam is a savvy politician he talks as though he's a rational moderate when he's an extreme conservative and we need someone who is able to call him out on that I have experience as an attorney Peter rostov's an attorney I have experience as a journalism as a journalist I'm used to speaking in those sound bytes but unfortunately we need today we need someone who can go head-to-head with them on the issues in a crisp articulate fashion and someone who has the on-the-ground congressional experience on that candidate was a sort of line with what we were just talking about it yes sir we did win this district but Bernie Sanders also won this district in the primary I think what you're seeing is that the district is it's not that the Republicans in the district are moving more moderate it's that more liberal the district and what Republicans don't like about Democrats is not really our policy this was said earlier what they don't like is Democrats so I still don't think that's a winning strategy so my if I approach to appeal to voters of all stripes I know all political persuasions is to say I'm gonna be an independent voice the stuff that you hate about Congress about government I'm not going to be a part of that I'm not gonna spend every day in elected office calling people on the phone for four hours a days you're expected to do I'm just not going to do it I'm gonna be fighting for the people of this district and that's what we need to that's the argument we need to make these people and to say I'm going to actually be fighting for causes that are going to help you and going to help you in your life that's how we're going to get people to vote for us honest in this issue so I'm a new voice for this district I think I'm very well-qualified because I'm not an establishment politician and I'm stepping up to represent the citizens here and I do think my 24 years as an attorney has prepared me well to go toe-to-toe with Peter ask them to debate him any issues to talk substance and to represent what the people in this district are asking for I disagree with Brian we're gonna spend time on the phone raising money that's the unfortunate sad sad reality of the job right now but part of what I'm going to do when I get in Congress to start pushing against that reality and I know that I owe you for hours on the phone not doing the job for you I owe you 12 hours I owe you 14 hours whatever it takes to get the job done and start moving us forward again that's what I want to do I want to talk about that job of being a member of Congress as opposed to getting one if anybody thinks that this job is easy and doesn't require a believable confidence and disappointment you're doing the wrong job so now the Tea Party has injected this idea that inexperience is what it takes we need people who have proven that they can get things done outside of their area of expertise when I started a company I didn't know how to do it it was an idea we eventually had 150 people we had a decent sized group of assets I had to learn it under stop I had to learn how to surround myself with people who had experience that I lacked and we can't afford to hire to put people into this job we're learning those skills on the job 2019 is going to be really hard to hear and we're not going to at the support of the White House we can't have the support of the Senate we better believe Melinda with a record of accomplishment in professional career prior to that point well house a candidate I believe I'm the best candidate to be Peter Roskam because they had the strongest grassroots support in the strongest institutional support we turned in my team the most petition signatures of any of the candidates and I also have nearly 3,000 individual donations to mine for everything an eighty-two percent of that money is from people in Illinois and that's what's helped me earn the endorsement of emily's list congresswoman jan Schakowsky Cheri Bustos and other members of Congress environmental leaders also I'm the only candidate who has walked the healthcare walk who is the scientist who has a financial background who is a longtime advocate for the environment most of her adult life and has 18 years of experience in government I provided greatest contrast to Peter Roskam as Kennedy and I also just want to briefly mention that before I even announce my campaign last May I had the wherewithal to put a strong team together because they knew to beat him would take a very strong cohesive infrastructure I have been listening to our community as the Illinois chief of staff for congressman Foster and I not only listened to the community I got results and that is something that Peter Roskam has not been doing I can hit the ground running I have experience not only in the booth in the congressional office but 20 years experience as an attorney handling complex issues I focused on appellate law which is applying law and facts together before that as I mentioned that I was a journalist I think these are the skill sets that will make an incredible difference in representing this district but most importantly I understand the relationship between the district and Washington and the importance of conveying what the community wants to policies in DC I got policies like that when I was with congressman Foster's office I think I everyone in this race with the exception to me has a long career in business owners and lawyers and that's certainly to their credit well what I'm trying to do is politics it's trained to analyze policy to craft policy that is welcome back on us my master's degree in public policy I spent time in DC I know how to actually get things tough and beyond that more importantly than that is that I have a little political courage and independence to say this is what I believe that this is what right and this is what I'm going to fight for and we had an example of this recently the editorial board meeting where we were asked the question who would have voted to keep the government shut down until there was a deal on daca and I was the only one of the son of us who raised their hand this is just a hypothetical situation it's not asking for a lot of courage to be able to say that and I was the only one who suddenly said they would that's the kind of fight that he's got to have for what you believe in what about the health care a lot and I got to Dorne I met a woman who was recovering them a stroke when she told me her story she put her head down on the table and I saw her eyeglasses taped together on the table and when she came back up cried glasses she had on were taped together and I know how much health care means to the people in our district but for me the kitchen I was in this woman was surrounded by her daughter's and my sister and I were fortunate enough to take care of her mom when she was suffering I'm looking to represent the people in this district not because I've had the same experience but because I know we all share common experiences and we all share the same values my career as an attorney prepares me to do the job I'm determined to do the job for the actual people in our district which makes that's I'm afraid mr. piston oh I feel like they kind of answered this one of my last question so let me let me turn turn this around another question do you know the nature of this weird job application process because we all will talk to you in sound bites and you have to make decisions based on those sound bites engage with us ask us questions dig in and find out what we really mean call our offices Bend our ears because at the end of the day you're not going to really notice unless you find out do we which one of us best represents you if democracy works well we'll find out that which one is the best but I know I don't want to tell where he to pretend to be anything other than Who I am and I'm going to be totally honest with you about Who I am well I cast serves 18 years in local government in the Bering Sea area I favor builds trust to your plan commissioner and zoning commissioner and the one thing I have learned is how important it is to listen to the people that I'm representing and that I making decisions for in my community I also learned what it means to be a solution based leader and these are skills that I would take with me to Washington to make sure that I follow use that knowledge network then I will meet with you I will listen to you and I will come up with viable solutions and reach across the aisle something we just right now more bipartisan cooperation have someone's day then I will hold townhomes and this is something we really need in this community as well we haven't had we've only had one in the Lebanese leadership with Peter Roskam so I will have an open dialogue with all of you if I'm fortunate to be your Congressman it's time for closing statements I'd Yellen but that would just be rude so first of all thank you again for coming out tonight I believe that a representative in Congress should should look at issues with both their head and their heart the hurt is the district the head is Washington by Dumbo I'm the only candidate in this race who won't say just I will do that but you say I don't do that I think this experience is extremely important in this race because I've already made the government work for people in our community and I'll just give you a quick tangible example there was a Muslim woman who came up to me after Donald Trump was elected and her daughter was people did school this had never happened before and I listened to her story and we decided at my suggestion that we would have a town hall in congressman Foster's district and we had an event at the Islamic Center of Naperville this young girl told her story of bullying and actually their family someone wrote the word terrorist in Kachin on the windshield of their car 250 people attended that Town Hall it was fine we also had girl attend the president's joint address to make a show that we do not agree with the bigotry in this country the head and the heart the district and II see in the interplay between them I had the experience to bring focus to the constituents of the six district well thanks again tonight I talked a lot about my plans for a real progressive reform in this district and having the political courage to fight for those reforms the truth is I cannot do it alone especially given my strategy of fundraising that does not rely on spending every day every hour of the day on the phone with wealthy donors I need help from you guys so if you believe in this cause vote off with your Congress comm send us five or ten bucks sign up to volunteer to knock on doors for us check out our Facebook and Twitter page and we'll support Li tell all your friends and family about this campaign and what we're trying to do here in the 6th district the old way of politics is simply not working we don't have to be content with the system that expects us to spend half of my time in Congress raising money for our reelection that's not the way it should work we know it's not the way should work we need people who are willing to go to Congress and actually change it with let's try something different in this district let's be bold let's be courageous let's not send the same kinds of candidates we're gonna run the same kinds of campaigns let's send someone from the middle class not another millionaire let's send somebody who's so stubbornly committed to getting money out of politics that he's already defying party leaders who say the only way to run a successful campaign is to spend all day on the phone raising money let's send somebody who's gonna give voters something to vote for you honestly say if you don't have health cover to vote for me because I'm going to fight every day to make sure that you every other American s health coverage if you work 40 hours a week and can't afford to feed your family vote for me because I'm going to make sure that we raise your salary that's what I'm going to fight for for on behalf of this district I hope you get their support thank you thank you very much for being here tonight thank you for moderating to Belgian Democrats and the Dundee Democrats for putting on this event if you remember anything about me it's that I will put you first we know Peter Roskam doesn't put you first he but she absolutely last we know that he's that she who follow us Paul Ryan who follows Mitch McConnell who follows Donald Trump I know she I will stand up for you in Washington whether you get on the train every morning to go to work or whether you sit on that clocked expressway to get to your job I know what you're working for I know that we need tax reform that actually protects working families and our seniors that doesn't burden our children and our grandchildren what drives me is hardwork and honesty and I'm determined to get the job done because I know that the people in Illinois six want better government so I want to work to restore the progress we had made in America to move us forward again to listen to you and then be your voice in Washington I would be honored to have your vote and to serve as your representative in Congress thank you very much for being here tonight so I know everybody in this room feels like we're on this crazy carousel since the elections is faster and faster datings can fly for changes in a moment these these daily assaults on women minorities the environment kids the future all that is good and wholesome is hard to keep up with we are where we are right now because of the complete lack of backbone of the Republican Party to stand up for this dear roskam silence is acquiescence that he is complicit in every recent damage that gets coming along with the rest of the GOP we have got to get to a point or the quality of policies that we make is not a function of the party the person who wrote the policy there's not a function of the politics there's a function of the facts that should not be a high bar and is somehow become exceptional you can tell it's become exceptional because we're making some gross moral errors how is Robert and much less trouble every one of the halls of my house it's because we have counters to the Congress we're not in love how are we taking health care amazing people and killing me it's because we had Calvin's we will fix that with good people and when we get good people in we can improve Obamacare we can expand the coverage and we can bring more people in down tensions we will clean the air and air the economy and I know that because and we will once again be a place that the world Thank You Patrick for hosting it thank you for everybody else who's this wonderful forum together we are at a critical point with American politics this election is not only about Peter Roskam and Donald Trump it's about sending a message to Washington that our leaders our elected officials need to show leadership and need to represent their own constituents and when you decide to cast your vote there's only one question you should be asking yourself who is going to stand up and fight for me and all the other people in this district I have spent most of my adult life fighting against climate change I have been an advocate for health care I will absolutely stand up for you you deserve someone an elected official who will listen to all the families in our district who will listen to all of the people in this room who will listen to each one of you and if I'm fortunate to be here elected official your congresswoman I will fight for all of you in this room and I will fight for all the families in those districts who are working hard to build better lives every single day and I'm here tonight asking for your support and for your vote on March 20th so together we can all take down Peter Roskam thank you I just wanted to say if you guys could have beat me to the punch Oh Billie appreciate with these five people in this stage we're joined we know how hard it is to run another so [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music]

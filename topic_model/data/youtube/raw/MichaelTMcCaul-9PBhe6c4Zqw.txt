yeah committee will come to order first as a matter of business our mr. Keating is running late and I would ask unanimous consent that mr. Cuellar said as the ranking member of the subcommittee for this hearing seeing no objection that mr. Duncan you have no objection to that and now I recognize myself for an opening statement unmanned aerial systems commonly known as drones have been a game-changer for men and women serving in Iraq and Afghanistan these systems have provided our troops with much needed eyes in the skies and have taken the fight to the enemy eliminating some of most dangerous al-qaeda terrorists drones have also increased our capabilities and begin to secure our borders and our first responders US Customs and Border Protection began first looking at these drones back in two thousand four now CBP owns ten UAS aircraft these systems have been used to surveil drug smuggler tunnels video dams bridges levees riverbeds at risk of flooding and assist with the deployment of National Drug resources responding to local flooding CBP is also foreign missions and supported the Border Patrol Texas Rangers u.s. Forest Service FBI and others these systems have become a force multiplier for military operations and for border security however we are on the edge of a new horizon using unmanned aerial systems within the homeland currently there are 200 active certificates of authorization issued by the Federal Aviation Administration to over 100 different entities such as law enforcement departments and academic institutions to fly drones domestically this map on the monitor shows the locations of CoA or khoa recipients as of April 2012 the number of recipients since that time has in fact increased the FAA plans to select six test cities around the country even for the use of non-government drones this year and plans to allow the deployment of non-government drones nationwide by the year 2015 and while the FAA is responsible for ensuring these systems fly safely in US airspace with only two and a half short years until drones begin to dominate the skies in the US homeland no federal agency is taking the lead to deal with the full implications of using unmanned aerial systems and developing the relevant policies and guidelines for their users this is despite the fact that four years ago the Government Accountability Office recommended to the Secretary of Homeland Security that she direct the tsa administrator to examine the security implications of future non-military UAS operations in the National Airspace System and take any actions deemed appropriate Gio's recommendation he was well-founded because in 2004 TSA issued an advisory the described possible terrorist interest in using UAS UASs as weapons the Advisory noted the potential for you a esas to carry explosives or disperse chemical or biological weapons it discussed how the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia or FARC and Hezbollah were interested in acquiring these UASs and while the Advisory knowledge there was no credible evidence to suggest a terrorist organization planned to use these systems in the United States it did state that the United States government was sick it was concerned that these aerial vehicles could be modified and used to attack key assets and critical infrastructures within the United States and these concerns were validated just last week well last year when a Massachusetts man agreed to plead guilty to attempting to damage and destroy federal buildings the individual was arrested in September of 2011 after an undercover FBI investigation revealed that his plot to use multiple remote-controlled aircraft laden with explosives to collapse the Dome of the United States Capitol and attack the Pentagon using that you AV system as if this part wasn't frightening enough cutting-edge research out of the University of Texas at Austin has revealed you have more security vulnerabilities specifically researchers from the Cockrell School of Engineering led by dr. todd humphreys who is our first witness today prove that civilian unmanned aerial systems can be hacked into and hijacked with a relatively small investment of money and time these findings are alarming and have revealed a gaping hole in the security of using unmanned aerial systems domestically now's the time to ensure these vulnerabilities are mitigated to protect our aviation system as the use of unmanned aerial systems continues to grow the Department of Homeland Security's mission is to protect the homeland unfortunately DHS seems either disinterested or unprepared to step up to the plate to address the proliferation of unmanned aerial systems in US airspace the potential threats they pose to our national security and the concerns our citizens have of hell drones fly over cities will be used including protecting civil liberties of individuals under the Constitution for example in discussions with my subcommittee staff prior to this hearing Department officials repeatedly stated that the department does not see this function the domestic use of drones as part of their mission and has no role in the domestic unmanned aerial systems I strongly disagree I can't imagine how they would find that they have no role when there's a terror plot thwarted by the FBI attempting to hit the United States Capitol and the Pentagon what more homeland security interests could there possibly be DHS is lack of attention about this issue is truly incomprehensible it should not take a 911 Salla tagged by terrorist organization such as Hezbollah or a lone wolf inspired event to cause DHS to develop guidance addressing the security implications of domestic drones it should not take a hearing to force a DHS to develop policy when it comes to the security of our homeland what it should take is responsible leadership willing to recognize a potential threat and take the initiative DHS Laxus initiative and I'm concerned that DHS is reverting back to a pre 911 mindset which the 911 Commission described as a lack of imagination in identifying threats and protecting the homeland we have disappointed the DHS declined to testify here today this is simply another example of how DHS leadership is failing to get ahead of the curve on an issue which directly impacts the security of the United States I hope our witness's testimony will be a call to action for the department during today's testimony we look forward to learning more about the security issues related to the domestic use of drones and what DHS needs to do to prepare for their widespread use and with that the chair now recognizes the ranking member I guess Pro Tem mr.

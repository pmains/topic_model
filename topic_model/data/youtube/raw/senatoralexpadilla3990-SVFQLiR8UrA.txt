everybody Welcome to the fifth hearing of the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on immigration citizenship and Border safety this Congress we're here to talk today about the critical role that immigrant Health Care Professionals play in our nation's Health Care system and the opportunity and frankly the obligation we have to confront our nation's growing shortage of health care workers I want to thank all of our Witnesses who are here today both in person and we have one witness participating virtually who will speak about their personal experiences and our shared goal of improving care for millions of Americans for that same reason I want to thank chairman Durbin ranking member Gordon who will be joining us momentarily and all the committee staff who have worked so hard to organize today's hearing today we'll shed light on solutions to the challenges facing our health care System Solutions frankly that can save lives and we have a chance to improve our immigration laws in ways that better serve the needs of our population and our economy Americans facing obstacles to access to the standard of Health Care they deserve is nothing new but in recent years it has become even harder even before the covid-19 pandemic the United States was experiencing some concerning trends our population was aging with an increasing demand for care while retirements by physicians continued to rise daunting student loan debts were discouraging prospective Health Care Professionals from entering the field and hundreds of hospitals in rural or low-income communities were at risk of closing after struggling to recruit or retain Physicians the odd set of the covid-19 pandemic created an entirely new strain on our Workforce thrusting America's health care workers onto the front lines of a once in a century Global Health pandemic and accelerating burnout in an already fractured system tragically since the beginning of the pandemic to November 2021 so this was almost a year ago at least four thousand five hundred and forty seven health care workers including 458 nurses have died while caring for their patients as a result we're now facing an even more dangerous shortage of health care workers the association of American medical colleges projects the U.S is facing a shortage of up to 124 000 Physicians by the year 2034. that means a shortage of up to 40 000 primary care physicians and more than 77 000 non-primary care physicians in addition an estimated 1 million nurses are expected to retire in the next decade for over two and a half years of the pandemic Americans had to put doctor's appointments and life-saving screenings on hold but as covet becomes endemic and as you learn to better manage outbreaks Americans should not be forced to further delay life-saving care because we failed to invest in and grow our health care Workforce we have to protect our health care workers and ensure they're able to work reasonable hours have Better Staffing ratios and that they're paid adequately and have the equipment needed to keep them safe now Proud to be an original co-sponsor of the national nursing shortage reform and patient advocacy Act but that alone won't be enough to bridge our entire Health Care Workforce Gap the good news is there are some common sense Solutions right before us there are thousands of Highly capable Health Care Professionals living abroad with the desire to come to America to study train in their profession and work saving lives we know immigrant health care workers can help to fill the health care Workforce Gap and provide critical care because in community is throughout the United States they're already there they're already doing it one in every four physicians in the United States is an immigrant and one in every six nurses is an immigrant among them there are approximately thirty four thousand DACA recipients and eleven thousand six hundred TPS holders working in health care and with an aging population in increasing need of care immigrants make up over half of our physicians practicing geriatric medicine in nearly 38 percent of America's home health aids so think about this immigrant doctors write prescriptions immigrant nurses care for us at our bed sites immigrant Health Care Professionals perform highly skilled procedures each and every day and they're often the Cornerstone for Rural and low-income communities places where a single foreign-born physician can be tasked with treating an entire community they can and they want to be part of the solution to our health care Workforce crisis however even as we Face unprecedented shortages in our health care System the laws that limit the immigration of highly trained health care workers have gone largely unchanged since the 1990s there continues to be significant backlogs in processing green cards for critical healthcare workers there are annual caps to employment-based Visa categories that have not been met and per country caps that should be updated to meet the demand of today's healthcare industry and many of the federally recognized essential workers that we relied on at the peak of the covid-19 pandemic still risk uncertainty with their legal status in America in our hour of need the United States is effectively discouraging potential health care workers from trying to come to and work in the United States that needs to change the very first bill I introduced in the Senate co-sponsored by chairman Durbin and other members of this committee would start to protect many of those workers at risk by providing a pathway to citizenship for over 5 million essential workers without permanent status the citizenship for essential workers act would protect health care workers who risk their lives to keep our communities safe during the pandemic I'm also calling on the Senate to pass the Americans excuse me America's children Act and protect documented dreamers the children of long-term Visa holders who face deportation at the age of 21 without a green card or other immigration status many Healthcare professionals worry about their own children aging out of status or losing status completely if something were to happen to the primary Visa holder and as we'll hear today what we need are system-wide reforms that incentivize and welcome immigrants into our health care Workforce I'm looking forward to hearing from all of our Witnesses today about their experiences and their ideas for fixing this broken system I'll now uh recognize ranking member cornyn for his opening remarks well thank you Mr chairman um

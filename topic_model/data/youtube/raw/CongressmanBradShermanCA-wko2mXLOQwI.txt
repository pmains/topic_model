DAVID: THIS IS "BALANCE OF POWER" ON BLOOMBERG TELEVISION AND RADIO. WE ARE HAPPY TO WELCOME BACK BRAD SHERMAN. CONGRESSMAN, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING BACK WITH US. I HAVE A LOT OF FINANCIAL SERVICES QUESTIONS TO ASK YOU, BUT LET'S START WITH FOREIGN AFFAIRS. WE JUST HEARD FROM KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO SUPPORT UKRAINE. AS A MEMBER OF THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMISSION, WHAT DO YOU THINK WE NEED TO BE DOING? BRAD: I UNDERSTAND THAT GERMANY DOESN'T WANT TO TAKE THE LEAD. GERMANY DOES NOT HAVE ITS OWN NUCLEAR DETERRENT. I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THE PENTAGON SAYS THE ABRAMS TANK SHOULD NOT BE TRANSFERRED TO UKRAINE, BECAUSE IT IS TOO ADVANCED FOR THEM TO USE. IT CONSUMES TOO MUCH FUEL. THE SOLUTION, I THINK, IS FOR AMERICA TO BE WILLING TO TAKE THE LEAD BY ASKING POLAND TO TRANSFER LEOPARD TANKS TO THE UNITED STATES, GETTING GERMAN CONSENT FOR THAT. THEN, WE CAN TAKE THE LEAD AND BE THE PARTY TRANSFERRING THOSE TANKS TO UKRAINE. BUT UKRAINE NEEDS THE RIGHT TANK. THE LEOPARD IS THE RIGHT TANK. BUT AMERICA SHOULD BE TAKING THE LEAD. DAVID: I'M REALLY GLAD I ASKED THE QUESTION. I HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT POLAND TO THE UNITED STATES TO UKRAINE. IT'S TURNOUT TO THE FINANCIAL SERVICES PART OF IT. ONE THING ON EVERYBODY'S MIND IS THAT DEBT CEILING. WE TALKED WITH SENATOR JOE MANCHIN OF WEST VIRGINIA LAST WEEK OVER IN SWITZERLAND. THIS IS WHAT HE HAD TO SAY ABOUT POSSIBLE DEFAULTING ON U.S. DEBT. >> WE WILL PAY OUR DEBT SPIRIT WE ALWAYS HAVE, WE ALWAYS WILL. HOW ELSE ARE WE GOING TO GET FROM POINT A TO POINT B? I DON'T KNOW YET. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A COALITION OF THE BIPARTISAN, DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS, PUTTING A GROUP TOGETHER THAT SAYS WE WILL LOOK AT ALL THE TRUST FUNDS TO FIND THE DEFICIENCIES, WHEN THEY'RE GOING TO BE SOLVED, AND WHAT WE CAN DO TO PREVENT THAT. DAVID: SO, CONGRESSMAN, HOW ABOUT THAT? A BIPARTISAN APPROACH, MAY BE A COMMISSION, TO FIGURE OUT A WAY THROUGH THIS. BRAD: ABSOLUTELY, BUT NOT HOLDING THE DEBT LIMIT HOSTAGE. NOT THREATENING TO DEFAULT ON OUR DEBT. THOSE THINGS SHOULD BE SEPARATE. WE SHOULD PROBABLY NOT HAVE A DEBT LIMIT AT ALL. NO OTHER COUNTRY DOES. IN CORPORATE OR PERSONAL AFFAIRS, IF YOU NEED TO REIN IN SPENDING, YOU DO THAT WHEN YOU SPEND. IT IS NOT GOOD BUDGETING FOR A FAMILY TO SAY, "WELL WE SPENT TOO MUCH ON A FANCY DENT -- FANCY DINNER LAST WEEK, SO LET'S JUST NOT PAY THE CREDIT CARD BILL." THAT COULD BLOW YOUR 5 SCORE COMPLETELY OUT OF THE WATER. WE CANNOT ALLOW A DOWNGRADE IN THE U.S. DEBT AND CREDIT RATING. YES, WE NEED TO BE LOOKING AT THE OVERALL STRUCTURE. IT CANNOT JUST BE ON SPENDING, BUT ALSO ON TAXES. THE TRUMP TAX CUT CONTINUES TO HOBBLE OUR ABILITY TO COLLECT REVENUE, PARTICULARLY ON THE CORPORATE SIDE. DAVID: I HAVE MANAGED ENOUGH BUDGETS ON THE PRIVATE SECTOR SIDE TO TAKE A LOOK AT REVENUE AS MUCH AS COST. I UNDERSTAND TAKING HOSTAGES SOUNDS VERY NEGATIVE TO ME, BUT DO YOU UNDERSTAND SOME PEOPLE'S PERSPECTIVE UP ON CAPITOL HILL, MAY BE VOTERS AS WELL, WHO SAY THAT YOU TALK ABOUT DOING SOMETHING, BUT YOU DON'T. WE NEED SOME KIND OF CONCRETE ASSURANCE. DAVID: A LOT OF REPUBLICANS VOTED FOR THE MOST RECENT SPENDING BILL. THE NEXT SPENDING BILL, WE WON'T SPEND A SINGLE PENNY STARTING OCTOBER 1 OF THIS YEAR THAT A REPUBLICAN SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE DOESN'T BRING TO THE FLOOR. SO, THE PLACE TO LOOK AT SPENDING IS WHEN YOU ARE VOTING FOR SPENDING BILLS. THERE IS ALSO THE ENTITLEMENT OF SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE. DEMOCRATS HAVE PUT FORWARD A PROPOSAL THAT WOULD BRING MORE REVENUE INTO THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM. I THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT. WHAT WE NEED TO KEEP SOCIAL SECURITY SOLID. IN SOME AREAS, WE NEED TO SEE HIGHER SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS. REPUBLICANS HAVE NOT PROPOSED SPENDING CUTS. THEY HAVE PROPOSED THE CONCEPT OF SPENDING CUTS BECAUSE THEY CANNOT ACTUALLY FIND A SPENDING CUT THAT THEY UNIVERSALLY SUPPORT. DAVID: THUS FAR, I THINK WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM THE WHITE HOUSE IS WE ARE NOT GOING TO NEGOTIATE OVER THE DEBT CEILING. FOR YOUR RATIONALE, HOLDING IT HOSTAGE, IS THAT A SENSIBLE APPROACH AT THIS POINT? DON'T YOU HAVE TO NEGOTIATE IN WASHINGTON? BRAD: IF WE ARE GOING TO NEGOTIATE, WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THINGS THE REPUBLICANS HATE, IKE REVISING AN ELEMENT AIDING MUCH OF THE TRUMP TAX BILL. WE CAN GO IN WITH OUR DEMANDS, THEY CAN GO IN WITH THEIR DEMANDS, THAT THEY CANNOT WRITE THEM BECAUSE THEY CANNOT AGREE ON ANYTHING BUT THE CONCEPT. DEMOCRATS HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO CUT SPENDING. BUT ULTIMATELY, WE SHOULD AGREE TO A CLEAN SUSPENSION OF THE DEBT LIMIT. AND I AGREE WITH SENATOR MANCHIN, WE SHOULD BE HAVING A PARTISAN COMMISSION LOOKING AT SPENDING ON THE ENTITLEMENT SIDE, LOOKING AT SPENDING ON THE DISCRETIONARY SIDE, AND LOOKING AT REVENUE. THE DEFICITS WE HAVE BEEN RUNNING FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS CANNOT CONTINUE INTO THE FUTURE. DAVID: AS YOU KNOW SO WELL, WE HAVE THE 118TH CONGRESS. THE REPUBLICANS ARE IN A SLIM MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. ONE OF THE BEEN QUESTIONS -- ONE OF THE BIG QUESTIONS HAS BEEN CRYPTO REGULATIONS. WE SPOKE TO YOUR NEW CHAIRMAN, WHO SEEMS TO BE IN FAVOR OF THAT. IS THERE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR SOME SORT OF LEGISLATION TO DEAL WITH CRYPTOCURRENCIES? BRAD: THERE'S ALWAYS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR SOMETHING VERY VAGUE. THE FACT IS, WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THE FCC HAS ALL THE AUTHORITY THEY NEED TO REGULATE, BECAUSE THEY ARE THE MOST POWERFUL AND STRICTEST REGULATORS. IF THERE'S ANY TIME IN OUR ECONOMY WE NEED THE STRICTEST REGULATION, IT WOULD BE CRYPTO. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT BANNED FROM U.S. INVESTMENT, BUT I DON'T THINK I CAN GET THERE. MY GUESS IS, GIVEN ALL THE CRYPTO BILLIONAIRES, WE ARE MORE LIKELY TO PASS LAWS THAT HOBBLE REGULATION THAN PROVIDE REGULATION. I LOOK FORWARD TO PLAYING DEFENSE MORE THAN OFFENSE, BECAUSE WHILE OBVIOUSLY CRYPTO HAS TANK AND A DIVE BECAUSE OF SAM BANKMAN-FRIED, THE FACT IS THEY HAVE THE MONEY, THE POWER, THE LOBBYISTS. THOSE OF US WHO WANT TO SEE THE KNOW YOUR CUSTOMER ANTI-MONEY-LAUNDERING ENFORCEMENT, THOSE WHO WANT TO PREVENT A NEW TOOL FOR TAX EVASION, WHICH IS WHAT CRYPTO ASPIRES TO BE, THERE IS NO PACT, NO LOBBYISTS. THERE ISN'T THE POLITICAL POWER. IF ANYTHING, WE ARE GOING TO BE HAVING TO PLAY DEFENSE. WE HAVE TO PREVENT LAWS FROM REMOVING THE SEC'S CURRENT AUTHORITY. DAVID: GIVE US A SENSE OF THAT AUTHORITY. WE SPOKE TO SHARON BROWN FROM OHIO. HE SAID, I AM NOT SURE WHAT THE USE CASES FOR CRYPTOCURRENCY. HE SEEMS TO BE MORE ON YOUR SIDE OF IT. YOU SAY BANNING IT IS PROBABLY NOT DOABLE. WHAT CAN YOU DO SHORT OF THAT? BRAD: I THINK IT MAY ULTIMATELY BE DOABLE. BUT SHORT OF THAT, WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE, IS A STATUTE THAT CLARIFIES THE DEFINITION OF SECURITY AND MAKES IT PLAIN THAT ALL CRYPTOCURRENCY IS A SECURITY SUBJECT TO SEC REGULATION, AND CRYPTO EXTENT -- CRYPTO EXCHANGES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THAT AUTHORITY. IF NOT, WE HAVE TO PLAY DEFENSE AND GIVE THE SEC AUTHORITY OVER ALL CRYPTOCURRENCY, MAKE SURE IT STAYS ENFORCED. YOU ALSO HAVE COURTS APPLYING 1930'S LAW AND 1940'S COURT DECISIONS TO CRYPTOCURRENCIES. OBVIOUSLY, THAT IS A TOUGH JOB FOR THE COURTS. DAVID: I NOTICE YOU HAVE REFERRED TO THE SEC SEVERAL TIMES. SOME PEOPLE THINK IT SHOULD BE THE CFTC, OR AT LEAST BE SHARED. WHY NOT THE CFTC? BRAD: SAM BANKMAN-FRIED'S ENTIRE REASON FOR BEING INVOLVED IN POLITICS WAS TO TAKE THE SEC OUT OF CRYPTO AND PUT IN THE CFTC, A WEAKER ORGANIZATION THAT WILL PROVIDE A PATINA OF REGULATION WITHOUT REALLY EFFECTIVE REGULATION. AS I TOLD MY COLLEAGUES, YOU CANNOT TRASH SAM ECKMAN FREED IN ONE PART OF YOUR SPEECH, THEN TRY TO PASS HIS BILL ON THE SAME DAY OR IN THE SAME COMMITTEE. THE CFTC IS THE WEAKER ORGANIZATION AND A STATUTE THAT GAVE THE CFTC MORE AUTHORITY WOULD SIGNAL THE COURTS TO RESOLVE MATTERS TO GIVE THE SEC LESS AUTHORITY. AS LONG AS WE ARE IN THE VAGUE BUSINESS OF APPLYING 1930'S AND 1940'S LEGAL CONCEPT OF CRYPTO, WE CANNOT DO ANYTHING THAT PUSHES THE COURTS IN THE DIRECTION OF DISEMPOWERING THE SEC, WHICH IS A STRONG REGULATOR. DAVID: REALLY GOOD HEAVY BACK WITH US. THANK YOU. THA

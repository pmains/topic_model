all right joining us now is one of the few who questioned dr fauci's expertise and motives as early as we did kentucky senator rand paul senator you are now calling for the firing of anthony fauci uh what can you do in the senate to get more answers than the ones that we have from these emails which are still redacted well you know i think we've had a sea change of opinion everybody left of center was saying this was a conspiracy no way could it have happened in the wuhan lab now we've been dr falchi saying that we should investigate it but the emails paint a disturbing picture a disturbing picture of dr fauci from the very beginning worrying that he had been funding gain of function research and he knows it to this day but hasn't admitted we have to get democrat counterparts that will actually use the committee hearings to investigate this but so far it's been such a partisan support for dr fauci that he can do no wrong but really there's a lot of evidence that he has a great deal of conflict of interest and that if it turns out this virus came from the wuhan lab which it looks like it did that there's a great deal of culpability in that he was a big supporter of the funding but he also was a big supporter to this day of saying we can trust the chinese on this we can trust the chinese scientists and i think that's quite naive and really should preclude him from the position that he's in and referencing the point you just made senator the emails they show that fauci was scrambling in those early days of the pandemic to find out the links between the nih funded gain of function research and cova now here's how one of his nih underlings responded to this email about a 2015 gain of function study that was co-authored by the wuhan institute of virology's bat lady and he said the paper you sent me says the experiments were performed before the gain of function pause but have since been reviewed and approved by nih not sure what this means since emily's is sure that no coronavirus work has gone through the p3 framework explain that senator why is that so significant here here's laura what makes it worse two weeks ago in committee hearing he said they did not fund any gain of function research i quoted that specific paper right so the very paper that he puts in the email he says oh my goodness we need to read this paper because we looks like we are actually funding gain of function research which is where we juice up these viruses take them from animals and infect them into humans he's admitting that to his underling he's worried about this in february of last year but only two weeks ago he tells me oh it wasn't gain of function research but in his email in the subject line he says gain of function research he was admitting it to his private underlings seven eight nine months ago i mean could there be criminal culpability here given given the repeated uh failures of dr fauci who is basically in charge of our much of our messaging on this and and advice on this could there be criminal culpability here a fraud or ongoing collaboration with the chinese when when he was making excuses for them at the very least there's moral culpability in the research done by the bat scientist in wuhan she gives him credit she lists the exact nih grant with a 10 numeral disclaimer or id number listing the money and thanking the nih for the money it's clearly gained a function there are several scientists who are in this field cellular biologists they all say that taking a sars back a sars virus and adding an s protein to it to make it infect human cells that is the very definition of gain of function it's very dangerous we shouldn't be doing it here or there but dr fauci has denied it to this day but the private emails show that he was acknowledging that it was gain of function nobody was questioning it the scientific community needs to look at this because he hides behind this veil of the lab coat that nobody can question him yeah well i believe and by looking at the evidence that it absolutely was gain of function research and he was funding it and to this day he's still saying he would do it again because he trusts the chinese zionist well one of those emails obtained by buzzfeed senator was from peter dashok of the eco health alliance so he was the one pushing this and doing this research and that was funded by nih uh in wuhan so he wrote to fouch on april 18 2020 i just wanted to say a personal thank you for publicly standing up and stating that the scientific evidence supports a natural origin for coven 19. not a lab release from there it's unbelievable but here's the thing laura peter desanc is not a disinterested party he's not just looking for the truth he was the funder of the research in wuhan so he has a self-interest in not revealing this because it turns out the lab the virus came from the lab that's my point too this is a big deal so any investigation going forward it can't include peter tony fauci can't include peter desant because they were the ones who funded the lab they have a conflict of interest with coming to the truth uh we want to ask one more more question which is about the timing of the lift of the moratorium on this type of research senator in in january 9th of of 2017 uh the niad released this statement saying we have gone through the reviews basically we have all these recommendations as to why this type of research should be permitted it was 11 days before donald trump is inaugurated and it's it's like a four or five page uh memorandum do you find that timing to be interesting absolutely so the nih realized that gain of function was dangerous they ban it for three years and then right before donald trump becomes president they allow it again they start granting exemptions all approved by dr fauci the committee secret they won't let you know everybody on the committee but you know dr fauci knows who's on the committee and reviews this stuff but then they also allowed some of the research in wuhan not to go before the committee and when they were asked why was this not reviewed by this committee on safety they said well it wasn't gain of function research so they basically defined it out of the purview of the committee that was supposed to be assessing safety and preventing you know dangerous experiments from going on so yeah there's there's something rotten in denmark and somebody needs to get to the bottom of this but it can't include tony fauci investigating himself it's got to be an independent bipartisan commission senator do you have any faith that a bipartisan commission given the lies that have been put out there five hundred thousand dead and people are just looking the other way yeah we can't even get a hearing but realize what they were studying in that lab they've admitted to was 15 times more deadly than the virus we're dealing with covid 19 has about a one percent mortality and that's a lot of people but sars the one from 2004 has a 15 mortality and they were taking sars and juicing it up and making it more infectious to human airway cells that's a really scary thing to do particularly for the chinese communists who i don't think are the most trustworthy of partners yeah well and at least partly funded by the u.s taxpayers that is a scandal senator thank you so much for joining us tonight thanks lauren

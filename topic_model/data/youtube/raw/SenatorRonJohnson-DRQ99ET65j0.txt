our church slogan is if you're not perfect you've come to the right place I like found myself in prison for the third time just got out of prison doing three years for drug-related charges you know I have four kids you know and maybe not working right now I can't provide for them that much really their mom is doing it the population that we work with are individuals that are homeless people that are incarcerated people that have addiction and through the Joseph project individuals that need jobs because I just I just need somebody to give me a shot change is not easy it happens one day at a time and it happens one life at a time I just never knew that this was all going to happen just from getting a job I truly believe that the number one way for anybody to change their life around it is through having stable employment it'll give me a sense of accomplishment responsibility I'll feel like I can provide for my three girls so it's just really powerful to see that these students want to change their life around so when Pastor Yao Yang I'm the director of the Joseph project here in Wausau if I was born in poverty I was born in a refugee camp in Thailand and I lived in the refugee camp for seven years of my life we came here to America because this is the land of opportunity and freedom that we didn't have living in the Communist control area America is the land of opportunity and so with that opportunity you can take the bull by the horn and try to improve your life and living in poverty that's what I wanted to make sure that I was able to do you got to let it balance under how are you going to let it balance me they go through a week's long employment Workshop here at the Wasa program it's in the evenings and so they go through different classes on job skills such as teamwork communication Financial Mana management and so they just get all these Myriad of different classes so that they're going to be successful at the workplace but also we want them to be successful in the rest of their life you know bringing people from poverty to Prosperity the best way to do that is through a job sometimes students will have been broken so long that they need that confidence that they can do it some of us are hungry you know it's nice to come somewhere where they feed you with such I have taken many of them to the job site and gave them a little boost pep talk before they went in they come out with a job it's like a dream come true so today I am doing haircuts for the Joseph project it's my way of giving back to the community it gives them the confidence that feeling good looking good and able to walk in and get a job I see the difference from the start of class to the graduation those are different people they're not the same people congratulations good luck Jenny it's just been a great blessing to have Senator Ron Johnson to be a proponent of the Joseph project it's really good to have his support well the Joseph project it's not a handout it is us giving a helping hand for those that want to change their life around the number one thing it just gives them the Dignity of saying that I can't provide for myself I am an adult that I can be a good father that I'm taking care of my family I've been in the system my entire life okay like constant survival mode constant and now it's not not that way for the first time ever everything is falling into place since I've been here I know this is where I'm supposed to be seems like you want it I do absolutely you're ready to change your life I am so ready and I've been ready I can't go back to my childhood and make my childhood better I don't want to forget my humble beginnings of just having all these different challenges and through God's blessing if I can pay that forward and be able to be a helping hand to be able to help the residents of Central Wisconsin live a better life I feel that's the calling that God has given to me [Music]

Hi. Today the House of Representatives is voting
on the American Health Care Act. The Republican plan to repeal and replace
the Affordable Care Act. I'll be voting against this bill. In the office, I've received more than 2,500
phone calls, emails, and letters, 99 to 1 asking me to vote against the bill. Why? Because the Republican plan would leave 24
million fewer people with insurance. Raises the cost of insurance while providing
less care. And even puts a tax on people age 50 to 64
on their health care at a time when they need it the most - are most likely to be diagnosed
with life-threatening diseases. This is a bad bill made even worse last night
in the dark of night when the Republicans eliminated coverage for ten essential benefits
including mental health and addiction treatment, increasing the burden on communities already
struggling with these issues. I know we have to build on the successes of
the Affordable Care Act, fix the problems, and move our country's health care forward. The Republican plan shrinks the successes,
ignores the problems, and moves us backward. I'll be at the College of Lake County tomorrow
(Saturday) at 10:00am talking about these and other issues and I invite you to join
me. More importantly, I look forward to finding
a way with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to address our health care challenges,
to find bipartisan solutions, and move our nation forward with quality affordable health
care for all Americans. Thank you.

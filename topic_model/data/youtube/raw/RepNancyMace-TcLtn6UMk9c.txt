on that's where we begin tonight democrat socialists continue to attack the integrity of future elections as we just showed my my next guest decimated deranged socialist arguments against voting integrity at last week's oversight committee hearing joining me now south carolina congresswoman nancy mace great to have you back congresswoman you know great job in in bringing stats to combat left-wing hysterics we see from the socialists and the fake news press jake tapper at cnn claimed that gop state laws are making it harder to vote but as you just showed an overwhelming number of americans prize accuracy and integrity over the ease of voting and the ease of cheating isn't that the real debate here how do we have elections where we can rely on the accuracy of the results right and our american voting system is only as good as people's confidence in it and voting laws are put in place in different states to actually protect voter rights not oppress the vote and what was so astounding to me in this oversight hearing last week is that safrania thompson didn't know anything about black voters and black voter turnout in the state of texas a state that she's represented since 1972 and it's important i recognized her accomplishments coming out of the civil rights era in the 1960s a really troubling time for america but as you stated in your monologue we've come so far as a country and as a nation we're not a racist country our states are not racist and black voters turn out they vote they register to vote and vote just as much as white voters do texas actually has a problem with hispanic voters and getting them to turn out and women they in in texas they have a harder time getting women to vote than they do black voters and so it's really about protecting our election system and making sure that people have confidence in it and if everyone has to show an id to vote like you do to board a plane buy a beer buy a pack of cigarettes or rent an apartment this is absolutely no different it's a way of life for us and it verifies you're a citizen and that you have every right to vote well congresswoman you'll have to forgive sinfrania thompson for not knowing a damn thing about what her voters want or what her constituents want because as you heard she is a slave she's proclaimed a slave in the press of course allows her to get away with claiming she's a slave anyway uh let's move on moments ago joe biden called for new york governor covid cuomo to resign this is cuomo was denying all the claims made by the new york democrat attorney general that he sexually harassed multiple women breaking federal and state laws cuomo is saying those actions can be interpreted several different ways now let me just ask you one account from a woman in his security detail alleged that cuomo traced his finger from the woman's neck down her spine she also claimed cuomo placed his opened hand across her stomach now as a woman is there any way that you can justify those actions by mr cuomo as being platonic professional or innocent absolutely and the thing that astounds me is they're describing his actions as harassment and there was another account of one of the 11 women that said he put his hand under her shirt and felt her up i consider that assault and not harassment i called for governor cuomo's resignation 150 days ago and the fact that this guy is still in office making millions of dollars off a pandemic that he botched off his book and now all these allegations coming forward he needs to step aside be charged with a crime and resign cnn anchor in the meantime and brother of governor covett cuomo fredo cuomo he's alleged to have advised his brother on how to deal with the sexual assault allegations now when these revelations first surfaced cnn took absolutely no action against their their star host now what do you think about these revelations what they'll do to cnn's credibility with not only the republican party the republican caucus but what about its credibility with the nation well cnn already has a credibility issue with how they cover the administration or anything going on in congress if you have an r by your name good luck either getting on the network or getting a fair shake having been on the show on cnn multiple times i can tell you uh they are they go after republicans they don't want a fair shake they don't want to tell both sides of the story and from what i can tell and especially in their coverage and that's one of the frustrations with people in mainstream media is uh no matter what happens look at what happened last week with nancy pelosi telling the capitol hill police that you're going to be arrested if you don't wear a mask you then had mainstream media calling for people to be arrested if they weren't vaccinated so i think that we've got to be very careful with uh who we you know watch and get news from and that we deal in facts and not fiction and if that means you've gotta watch both sides from both different angles regardless of the news out watch them all because you'll get a store different story on each of the networks all right uh last thing here joe biden is secretly streaming thousands of illegal aliens infected with the china virus into the united states every month he and the unqualified ngos that he's using refused to tell the american citizens of the public health threat that mr biden himself is creating first how is this legal for biden to do this to our people and when do you think the gop will actually stand and defend our communities or can they it's crazy what's happening at the border in fact i was on the road today and i was reading different news articles about another surge in the border crisis just today and hospitalizations at the border if you're an american citizen visiting mexico on vacation you have to come back to the united states to go home you have to have a negative covert taste test to come back to the united states but if you go to the border it's a super spreader event they're not wearing masks they're not getting vaccinated and they sure as hell are not testing them for covid19 and we know that they're spreading the delta variant at the border and they were putting them on planes and sending them elsewhere around the country this is so anti-american not america first not american citizens first it's absolutely crazy i'll be at the border in a few weeks later this month i hope crossing my fingers to see what's truly going on and show the american people how we're treated versus how they're treated let's get we got to put a stop in fact it was good and out of texas you said when's the cdc gonna tell us and advise us to shut down the border because of covet well yeah the cdc is corrupt because of who's running the joint but look when you go down there keep us posted we'll make sure we cover your congressman because we know cnn won't thank you very much appreciate the time as always

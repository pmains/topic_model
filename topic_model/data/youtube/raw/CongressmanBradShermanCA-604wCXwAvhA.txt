which aid do we give to Burma particularly USAID do we know I don't know the precise figure out the top of my head I can certainly be arranged roughly about 80 million dollars a year right now fiscal now other so the first thing we could do is cut that is is much of that for democracy and human rights promotion or is it mostly economic development there's a combination of economic development promotion but also we have been a significant supporter of the peace process that's underway under the terms of what is called the National ceasefire agreement bear in mind only eight of the roughly 20 to 23 EA OS have signed that ceasefire agreement and I will throw in the slogan no justice no peace the idea that we'd be giving money to the Burmese government to help it achieve its objectives now human rights and democracy may not be its objectives but anything that is consistent whether that we'd be giving the money for that seems absurd especially when we're talking about thing doing things that would cost the US taxpayer money such as sanctions or or or humanitarian aid all of which may be warranted but we should first do the thing that reduces expenditures I'm gonna ask this question probably for the record unless somebody knows but I hope dr. Martin and his team at the CRS will get me an answer what's being done to publicize to the Muslim world China's support for this murderous regime and what's being done to publicize the fact that we are doing more to protect the RO hanga than any other state other other than those in the immediate neighborhood I don't see anyone anxious to answer that question right now so I'll ask that for the record now an uncomfortable question is arson gauging in some smaller atrocities and given our support for the ringer can we persuade them to limit their actions to those against the Burmese military mr. Lewman or anyone else there there are reports of varsity making and carrying out attacks and and and against civilians yes and of course and and and for the record they are a tiny in quantity compared to what the ring of people are facing at the same time they undermine arses whether the the the moral case that we are trying to make and they also undermine the ability of the Bernese government to change its policy and become more reasonable one atrocity against Buddhists in rakion state could make it difficult for those inside the Burmese government to to change its policy let's see is Voice of America carrying the message that it should to do the the average person in Burma know what the world thinks of what their government is doing mr. Lewman anybody know if we don't have an answer I'll ask for the record I can get you more information sir I know Radio Free Asia for example has regular stories about what's going on in Rakhine State and those in America there are those in the Burmese language yes there is a Voice of America Radio Free Asia Burmese broadcast one would hope that they would have the courage at the burmese service to push these stories not just in the I assume we have a that we also broadcast in the language of Bangladesh it's a lot easier for that service to cover to cover this message and I'll just throw this out here if the Burmese government disenfranchises some of its people I mean a government has a certain amount of territory for the benefit of its people they have disclaimed - over a million of their people if they permanently show that they're unwilling or unable to protect the Ron he is a long-term solution the transfer of territory to Bangladesh we obviously as a nation don't like to see sovereign borders changed but when a nation refuses to allow its own people to live on its territory it loses the right to control that territory mister dr. Martin real quick it seems she can bring that up because in the early days when there was a previous insurgent group among the reh√©n juh what they wanted at that time was to be part of what was Pakistan East Pakistan which is today Bangladesh which is today Bangladesh so I do not know if arts on its leadership or the rainfall in general obviously the first choice is the return of the refugees in pass citizenship protection and living in harmony with the other people Rakhine State but if that cannot be achieved then a a transfer of population has been achieved through this ethnic cleansing perhaps a transfer of territory would go along with it I for the record I want to point out that the ambassador for big Leticia is no coming Thank You mr. Sherman will now go to miss Amy

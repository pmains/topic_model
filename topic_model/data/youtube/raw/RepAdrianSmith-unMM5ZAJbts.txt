repealing the stepped-up basis and taxing capital gains at death will hurt nebraska farmers ranchers and small businesses hardest at the absolute worst possible time your recommended exemption won't help most working farms treasury and treasury liens would only stretch out the pain and we've seen in the past that exemptions for ag lane and small businesses simply are not workable i'm concerned about the president's proposal to raise corporate rates alongside shield and the g7 minimum tax agreements which would undermine the success of the tcja more competitive for investment and and job creation ending inversions and making american companies return profits from abroad and pay attacks on them obviously many concerns even president obama understood the importance of international corporate tax reform like we included in the 2017 tax law and i'm concerned that your proposals to expand irs enforcement through mandatory spending will harm the vast majority of americans who are law abiding taxpayers most and that your projections for the revenue it would collect are overly optimistic especially in light of much more pessimistic cbo projections at least your testimony is is straightforward about your goal for these changes making the tax code supposedly more fair but with no attempt to pretend these proposals are really about raising revenue or restoring economic growth to pre-covet levels because we have already had hearings on many of these proposals in the select revenue committee i would like to ask you about something you said recently that concerns me greatly i know it's a topic that a number of senators raised with you yesterday as well and i share those concerns on june 6 bloomberg reported that you had said that it said the following in an article quote we've been fighting inflation that's too low and interest rates that are too low now for a decade you went on to say and this is not out of context quote that's not a bad thing that's a good thing i would like to ask unanimous consent to submit the bloomberg article for the record so ordered secretary yellen we know that inflation hits hardest those who can least afford it already lower income folks retirees on fixed incomes and so forth has treasury done an analysis of what the impact of higher inflation would have on lower income americans and retirees and can you explain why higher inflation would actually be good for them i i'd like to explain what i meant by those remarks um the fed has established a goal of 2 inflation on average and um has done a great deal to justify why that's a sensible goal is there an analysis of what the impact on lower income americans and and retirees of what inflation impact would be is there an analysis the treasury has not done that analysis but i believe i have a strong basis for what i said um for most of the last decade inflation in the united states has run below is run under meaningfully under that two percent goal and um there are costs to inflation being too low as well as too high and one of the costs is that interest rates have been at zero levels and the fed has been forced to rely on asset purchases and other unconventional policies so very low inflation and low interest rates erode the ability to use monetary policy actively to support the economy so what i'm supportive of is inflation in line with the fed's targets and interest rates at slightly higher levels that would give the fed the ability to use monetary policy to address weakness in the economy thank you i thank the gentleman thank you

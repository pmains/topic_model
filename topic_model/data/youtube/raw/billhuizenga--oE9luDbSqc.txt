*AND* THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION. STAYING WITH THE SITUATION IN AFGHANISTAN--- REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN *BILL HUIZENGA* --- HAS HAD SOME PRETTY STRONG *REACTION* TO HOW THE "BIDEN ADMINISTRATION" IS HANDLING EVERYTHING... LISTEN. WE'RE LEAVING BEHIND, BUT AMERICAN CITIZENS, THEIR EXTENDED FAMILY, IMMEDIATE FAMILY, NOT TO MENTION, UH, THOSE SIVS, THOSE, UH, THOSE SPECIAL IMMIGRATION VISA FOLKS. THOSE ARE THE FOLKS THAT WERE THE INTERPRETERS. THEY WERE THE SUPPORT STAFF. UH, THEY WERE THE PEOPLE THAT HELPED THE COALITION, UH, TO SUCCEED AND TO, TO FUNCTION. UH, THERE IS, UH, I DON'T BELIEVE AT LEAST, UH, THAT THERE IS A. UNDERSTANDING THAT THE TALIBAN IS A DIFFERENT ORGANIZATION. THIS GO AROUND. DO I BELIEVE THAT THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN, UH, TRANSPARENT? ABSOLUTELY NOT. UH, I THINK THEY HAVE BEEN CONTRADICTORY IN THEIR MESSAGING. UH, YOU HEAR ONE THING OUT OF THE INTEL COMMUNITY AND DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AND STATE DEPARTMENT. IT SEEMS TO CONTRADICT THE WHITE HOUSE. UM, THEY ARE NOT ON THE SAME PAGE. AND, UH, LET ME SAY THIS. I DO THINK THAT, UH, THE INTENT. UH, HASN'T BEEN BAD, BUT THE DECISION-MAKING BASED ON THAT INTEL HAS BEEN, UH, THAT'S RIGHT. REALLY BEEN THE PROBLEM. UH, WHETHER IT'S BARBARA AIR FORCE BASE, WHETHER IT'S PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO HAD BEEN ENCOURAGING THIS ADMINISTRATION AND THE LAST ADMINISTRATION TO ACCELERATE THIS, UH, THIS SIV PROGRAM, YOU KNOW, THIS IS WHERE, UH, WHERE AGAIN, WE'RE, WE'RE HELPING. DOES WHERE ARE KEEPING THEM SAFE, THOSE INTERPRETERS AND OTHERS THAT, UH, THAT WERE PART OF THIS COALITION. UM, SO, UH, NO, I DON'T THINK THAT THEY HAVE BEEN TRANSPARENT ENOUGH. I DON'T THINK THAT THEY HAVE BEEN CLEAR ON WHAT THEY'RE DOING. IT LOOKS LIKE THE TALIBAN IS DICTATING OUR EXIT RATHER THAN CONDITIONS ON THE ROAD. AND THAT IS NOT A GOOD SITUATION. MILITARY AND LOGISTICS EXPERTS, UH, WHO SAY THAT AN AUGUST 31ST DATE ISN'T POSSIBLE. UM, YOU KNOW, WHETHER THAT'S EARLY SEPTEMBER, END OF SEPTEMBER, OR IT COULD BE A COUPLE OF MONTHS, UH, WHATEVER IT IS WE NEED TO REESTABLISH. I THINK THERE'S SOME THINGS THAT, UH, THAT COULD BE DONE TO ACCELERATE. LIKE GO GET BOGGED THEM BACK IN, UH, IN, UNDER OUR FOLD AND UNDER OUR CONTROL SO THAT WE HAVE TWO AIRPORTS IN TWO DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHIC AREAS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ABLE TO GET THOSE AMERICANS OUT AND TO, AND TO GET THOSE ALLIES OUT. SO GUYS, I MEAN, THINK OF THIS, IF YOU'RE DOWN EITHER A, IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE COUNTRY OR IN THE NORTHERN PART, YOU HAVE TO MAKE YOUR WAY TO COBBLE. ALL RIGHT. AND THERE'S FIGHTING GOING ON. THERE'S A THERE'S THERE'S OBVIOUSLY, UH, THE WEATHER IS GOING TO DICTATE SOME OF THAT AS WELL. THAT ALWAYS DOES IN AFGHANISTAN. UH, SO WHY NOT HAVE THESE TWO, UH, THESE

no we don't have a full compliment of members because the um republican members have not all been named so we've not yet been constituted um it's hard to argue i just want to if i could since since a lot of this was addressed to me mr chairman i'd just like to clarify a few things it's hard to argue that this should the committee doesn't have jurisdiction but this should nevertheless go before the committee but we can talk and i want to clear a few things up but then i want to talk just for a second about really the heart of the matter article 1 section 5 of the constitution that's the house with independent authority independent of the house ethics committee to discipline any of its members for disorderly behavior for which the appropriate sanction may include the limitation of any right power privilege or immunity of that member there is no doubt based on the language of the constitution that the house is well within its right to impose this sanction but i want to i want to just be clear we wouldn't be here in this position today and that's where i started i'm sorry that we're here i'm sorry ranking member olarsky that this is the first occasion that we've had to be together in a formal way like this but we wouldn't be here if representative greenian had not been seemingly and it is all and and i i appreciate your and and the ranking members words about how awful these statements are these actions are but we wouldn't be here if republican leadership hadn't rewarded representative greene with seats on the budget committee education and labor committee despite her behavior despite uh her actions we wouldn't be here if later mccarthy had been responsive to what i am quite confident uh in describing as the nation's collective outrage at representative greene's behavior um i i wonder if i can mr chairman just submit for the the record a letter from uh sandy hook promiser mark barton and uh and nicole hockley mark barton was uh is daniel's father daniel was killed at sandy hook nicole hockley dylan's mom and they say in their letter we have dedicated our lives since the murder of our sons to stopping school shootings and preventing more families from feeling the devastating loss we must endure every day representative greene has fueled conspiracy theories and supporters that claim that the sandy hook shooting and other violent murders of children never happened these vicious lies deny the deaths of our murdered children and bring death threats and constant harassment to our doors and our surviving children mr mr chairman this is this is not we can't hide behind process arguments which on their on the merits aren't accurate anyway this is about language and action that attacks the memory of those who have been killed in in by gun violence it is anti-semitic it is racist it islamophobic and to say that we should just simply spend time thinking about whether everything that we know that's been said is offensive enough to to warrant action uh is is just it's not a credible approach to this whole issue let me just say one last thing on this because you talked about the at the ethics committee the role of the ethics committee mr chairman and i take this as seriously as any member of the house and i know that ranking member wallarsky does as well the role of the ethics committee is to uphold the integrity of the house when this new member after this whole litany of words and actions and threats was rewarded with membership on these two committees that has done damage to the integrity of the house the constitution gives us the right to take this action it is appropriate for us to take this action and sadly it is necessary for us to take this action because no other action to respond to this has been taken by the leadership

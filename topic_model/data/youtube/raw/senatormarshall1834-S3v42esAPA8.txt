welcome back to wake up america i'm rachel roller today is president biden's 100th day in office and last night he addressed a joint session of congress here to talk about biden's speech and much more is kansas senator and dr roger marshall welcome to wake up america rachel good morning good morning to you now senator you are at president biden's speech with a much different perspective than the rest of us watching at home so if you will take us inside what was your overall reaction it was a very somber low energy evening you know perhaps he was it was almost like he was trying to bury american exceptionalism and i think for all the things he talked about it's what he didn't talk about that alarmed me there was no talk of the crisis of the border and there was no no talk of giving credit to the previous administration uh regarding the covet vaccine that really it was so hard for me to sit there and listen to him uh taking all the credit for the success against this plague when really all he had to do was drive the trump train that was full of the trump vaccine uh so just a very very somber night um you know he he lifted six trillion dollars from american wallets last night six trillion dollars now this president in a hundred days it is a world record six trillion dollars he wants to borrow from our grandchildren and raise your taxes so it was a tough pill to swallow last night i know that spending was something you mentioned in a tweet last night alluding to how history won't be favorable to the biden administration and anytime we have a new president we wonder what it will be that they are remembered for now president biden already has spent and plans on spending so much more this year alone how concerning is that for the economy and for the american people's wallet that you're talking about he lifted from well again we should call this legislation grab your wallet and kill your jobs because i think that's what it's going to do this is really more steps towards socialism the the total takeover of our lives by the federal government if you think about really what his theme was last night it was about how the government is going to take care of all of our lives that he's encouraging people to not work this country was founded on hard work we're already rewarding people more for not working than they would if they were working they were paying people 52 000 a year uh to stay at home and that's the number one problem back home for for people that own businesses we can't find people to work so this is just the tip of the iceberg this nanny's day taking away our freedoms think about what they did they traded us all in with a little bracelet on her on her wrist a mask on even though every person in the room has been vaccinated and they set a six foot apart it was did anyone feel comforted when the president of the united states walks into a room with the mask on we don't uh it makes us look gutless and powerless and really there's no science to support us wearing masks once we've had the vaccine so it couldn't have been a more horrible message last night for american exceptionalism definitely something i wanted to ask you about senator of course you are a doctor as well with the mask wearing i believe there were 200 attendees in the house chamber that can hold 600 people if i'm correct and everyone was mass as you mentioned vaccinated as well spaced out and told not to touch we saw the fist bumping when you came in some people even double masked do you think this was a missed opportunity to reduce vaccine hesitancy for people wondering maybe i shouldn't get the vaccine because what's the difference rachel you nailed it that is exactly right that's what we need the national media to be talking about people that are hesitant to take a vaccine need a reward they need a reward so that they can live as free as they did before this virus and instead we said just the opposite message out there last night we even though everyone's vaccinated in a perfectly controlled environment six foot apart all those things we're still wearing belts and suspenders a horrible message to send to the people that haven't been vaccinated yet so it's just a huge struggle right now to getting us to that hurt immunity we've kind of plateaued and and if i could just have one message to your public is i hope the doctors and the pharmacists that are listening out there today will reach out to their patients that's the last line of people that will be able to have influence on the people that have not had their vaccine yet and i think that's something people have been talking about a lot it's not necessarily elected leaders that are encouraging people to get the vaccine it's that personal relationship family friends and doctors that are having those conversations now senator biden preached bipartisanship last night we also know of course at his acceptance speech for the presidency he's preached about unity in his first 100 days alone his actions a bit saying otherwise as you pointed out zero mention to the former administration and operation warp speed wouldn't that just one mention have been a a touch of unity of bringing people together saying we can work together and move forward rachel you nailed it again in the president's inauguration speech he mentions nine times about unity he mentioned unity several times last night but it's all lip service we've been here 100 days and the white house has yet to reach out to anybody on the republican side for any type of meaningful legislation or input into how to spend the six trillion dollars or what we're going to do with taxes as well so he says one thing he does another this is a nanny state of socialism a radical socialist agenda please i just hope everyone listens to what their agenda looks like in totality that they not that they want to pack the supreme court they made it they want to make washington d.c a state they want to rig the elections open borders defund the police raise your taxes take your property this is a just not not a socials agenda this is a communist manifesto out there right now america's got to wake up 2022 we've got to flip things back around here senator real quickly we have less than a minute left the president briefly mentioned the crisis at the southern border but he did point out that vice president kamala harris was the right person for the job yet she hasn't visited so how exactly is she the right person you know she they don't want to square it uh she is scared to death to this they've unleashed a huge huge dragon right now it's a humanitarian crisis a national security crisis as well health crisis that unless they reimplement president trump's policies the back and uh remain in mexico programs they're not going to be able to fix it because trump trump got this one right with his policies but they wouldn't want to give him credit they want the problem they want the crisis down there they want to keep your eyes on it why they're picking your pocket right so there you have it quite the distraction all right senator roger marshall thank you so much for joining us all the time we have for right now it's rachel

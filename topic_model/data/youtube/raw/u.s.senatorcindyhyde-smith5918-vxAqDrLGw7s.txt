i also want to thank the panelists for being here today certainly appreciate that and my question is directed to mr keating in your testimony you stated that the disclose act would harm the rights of americans guaranteed by the first amendment to freak speak to freely speak publish organize into groups and petition how significant are the risk to our first amendment rights of free speech and association under the disclosure requirements in this legislation well i think they're very significant we would see a real atrophy of uh national organizations being able to influence policy i think there's actually a great deal of confusion about what is actually in this uh proposal uh just calling something a campaign-related disbursement doesn't make it a campaign-related disbursement we're talking about uh expenditures on uh communications to the public that could be even a year or more away from election that doesn't uh do anything to urge anyone to vote for or against any particular candidate and yet this bill would sweep that in it's really a form of not only campaign finance but it would be the first ever legislation to require disclosure for grassroots lobbying efforts and this was tried in the 1970s and it generated a huge amount of opposition across the political spectrum and i think if there was understanding about that today uh and in fact i think if there was a danger of this actually becoming law i think a lot of groups would emerge and say look we're all in favor of disclosure for actual campaigning for against candidates but we're not in favor of here is advocating on important public issues and whether you're on the left or on the right there are going to be causes that are minority viewpoints where people are simply not going to be willing to write a check or make a donation to support an unpopular cause it could be because where they live uh it's unpopular or could be unpopular throughout the country so i think i i really fear if if this bill becomes law over time over decades it will make it far more difficult for minority viewpoints to appeal to our fellow americans to say look rethink things um we need to make these changes nationally so i i would encourage the the supporters of this to take a look at the bill and to try to draw a better line between what's actually campaign related and what is actually pushing for improving our government thank you and also mr keatings what are the risks associated with publicly disclosing the names and all of this personal information on donors to super pacs considering the growing risk associated with the cancel culture in this country in which individuals businesses or organizations are targeted with protests or threats of positions that they might would take well look i think it's already a problem right now and i think there are many people who i mean look there are millions of people that give to candidates but i think there are millions more that don't and the reason why they don't is because they they are smart enough to know if they give over two hundred dollars or if they give through act blue or win red even like one dollar their name will be on the internet forever and associated with that candidate uh if that candidate becomes an elected official everything good or bad that candidate has ever done so i think we're already seeing some uh suppression i think a lot of small donors are simply not willing to step forward to support candidates and parties but i really fear that if we expand this to advocacy on issues as this proposal would do we're going to see it very difficult to push for legislation to improve our government over time over many years and many decades

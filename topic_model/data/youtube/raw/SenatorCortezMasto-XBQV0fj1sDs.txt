thank you for being here secretary interesting morning so let me start off just a comment I heard some of the conversation back and forth and I think in in response to one of of my colleagues you made the comment that it's been a great time for financial people that concerns me there are many people across this country who are still struggling and that's where we should be looking those working families the other thing I want to point out I'm from Nevada we had the worst recession we've ever seen we are still coming out of it and in fact there was a report that came out that shows that Nevada's economic forecast is doing very well experts are bullish on Nevada's overall economy this year anticipating continued recovery from the recession and growth they cite four key markers for that outlook wages because the average private weekly wage for Nevada workers peaked in October representing a 2.3 percent year-over-year construction activity construction now and a silver state's fastest growing is the fastest growing sector discouraged workers the number of discouraged workers those who left the labor force because they couldn't find a job has dropped and Nevada's GDP has shown significant continual growth over the past five years that is an incredible statistic considering leary were the hardest hit in 2007 because of the economy what I just cited to you was a report that came out in January 1st 2017 before you or President Trump or even in office so the comments that I hearing today that somehow this tax reform bill contributed to where we are today in Nevada to me is a misnomer and it doesn't give respect to the governor and every single legislator in every single leader both Republican and Democrat in the state who has worked hard for Nevada to come out of recovery with that said I'm hoping the actions that you take continue to benefit what we're doing in Nevada and I look forward to working there but I think that's it's questionable now where that's going to lead in the year to come the other area that is very difficult in the state of Nevada right now and we've been having this conversation is a housing one in four runners pays more than 30 percent of their income for rent and utilities half of renters pay more than half of their income for rent only about five million families live in public housing or benefit from section eight or other HUD or USDA assisted housing programs for every low-income family who gets some housing assistance for families receive no housing assistance at all so while I'm relieved that the low-income housing tax credit and private activity bonds remain they support 90% of all affordable housing built in our nation their value has gone down some say this could result in 200,000 fewer affordable units built in the next decade wages are stagnant or increasing modestly but the rent is going up when will the Treasury address the affordable rental housing crisis it's it's an important issue and we look forward to working with you on it okay that seems to be the standard answer for everything let me ask you this will the president's proposed infrastructure build include funding to invest in our affordable housing infrastructure I think that when the president releases it there will be the opportunities in affordable housing as in other things are you working with the president now to address that those needs I not specifically affordable housing but yes the the overall infrastructure and that can be part of it when will Treasury and HUD begin publishing the monthly housing scorecard again there apparently there hasn't been one issued in nearly two years I was not aware of that but I will I will look into that and get back to you okay and then let me just say I'm disappointed that the Treasury Department killed the my re program half of workers do not have access to a retirement account at work the national savings rate is going down how does the Treasury Department plan to help more people save for retirement again that's actually something I looked at very carefully and it really it has the the desire or the reason to get rid of it had nothing to do with our view on savings and we do want to it was just the cost of maintaining it there were very very few people who were using it with the staggering cost and we'd rather reallocate those that money to other ways that we helped people in in saving and retirement so do you have a program that you're looking at right now we there we moved those people into the private sector and we're looking at different programs to encourage private solutions yes okay I would like to know if you would in the future as you develop your programs and what you're looking at to make sure you're reaching out to my staff and working with us as well I noticed my time is all up there is basically up so I will submit the rest of my questions for the record thank you

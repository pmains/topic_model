a lot to discuss with my guest Democratic Senator Mark Warner the vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee leading the Russia probe a senator thanks so much for joining us so first let me start with this claim he said President Trump says he never asked Comey to stop investigating Flynn as you know better than I Comey testified under oath before your committee in June the president Trump did ask him to drop the investigation whom do you believe I believed FBI director Comey I think he was very credible in his testimony and his private meetings with us and it's not just Kony you've had clearly you've had an attorney generals had to recuse himself because of untold contacts with Russians you had the president United States trying to intervene as has been reported with other national intelligence leaders who he appointed saying could you back off we've had reports this week that he reached out to your dollar prize by this members of Congress saying back off this president has been obsessed with this investigation always saying there's nothing there but each week another shoe drops where we see more evidence of continuing outreach from Russians and some response from the Trump campaign when Trump individuals in the case of Flynn you have somebody who was his top security adviser then his national security adviser have a series of contacts with Russian officials beginning in early December with the president's son-in-law asking for back-channel connections to Russia then efforts to try to intervene in American politics before they take over in terms of backing Russia off from a UN vote over Israel then trying to get Russia to back off in terms of response to President Obama's sanctions and now the president somehow saying he didn't you fired as he knew Flynn was lying to pencil if he knew that then why didn't he act on it earlier it raises a whole series of additional question well let me ask you about that tweet I quote I had to fire general Flynn because he lied to the vice president and the FBI he has pled guilty to those lies it's a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful there was nothing to hide that would seem to suggest the president Trump knew that Michael Flynn had lied to the FBI which is of course a crime when he fired Flynn and also when he according to Comey asked homie to back off that seems to be in the territory of obstruction of justice and again that's why I think you're going to see much more coming from the special prosecutor clearly general Flynn and his son was in a great deal of legal jeopardy the fact that general Flynn was only charged with one account and a major account lying to the FBI I believe means that there's many more stories that general Flynn will have to tell about his time during the campaign and during the transition so I think there's there's more to come and what we see here is this president whenever any of his close associates again falls into problems he tries to disassociate so the other individual mr. Papadopoulos he tries to dismiss again somebody who's already pled guilty his campaign manager his deputy campaign manager mr. man afford mr. gates who've been indicted he tries to bet back them off now they're even trying to call general Flynn I hear the White House has said this former trumpet Obama Obama Obama appointee remember general Flynn was of someone who led the Republican convention in a very inappropriate you know lock her up kind of chant this chick guy Flynn was completely tied in to the Trump operation throughout the campaign and then was national security adviser how many people can this president continue to dismiss quickly particularly as the circle gets closer and closer even to family members President Trump did say this on Saturday when asked about the Trump I'm sorry without what when asked about the Flynn plea deal take a listen what has been shown is no collusion no collusion there's been absolutely there's been absolutely no illusion is there any evidence of collusion is there any evidence of the Trump campaign and the Russians having some sort of agreement on how Russia can help the Trump team during the campaign let's again just go through the facts we've had an FBI director who's been fired because of the president's intervention we had the Attorney General had to recuse himself because of his many contacts with Russians he didn't reveal we've had a series of these other individuals indicted or pleading guilty already we also have mounting evidence almost every week of additional contacts between the Russian government or Russian officials and officials connected to the Trump campaign under the guise of trying to improve relations but as we look back at that meeting in June that included Trump jr. Jared Kushner Paul Manafort where there were constant overtures from Russians to say hey we've got dirt on Hillary Clinton we want to share that with the Trump campaign now we've got more dots to connect we've got to finish our investigation show still certain dental no actual concrete proof yet I'm not going I'm going to reserve my final judgment until we have all these individuals in to see us but there is never there has never been in modern American history a political campaign that had this much outreach to a foreign government and a foreign adversary in this case throughout the campaign and throughout the transition I want to get to taxes in a second but I do want to ask you about this detail from a New York Times story in which Flynn's deputy katie mcfarland who was on the Trump transition team wrote in an email quote if there is a tit-for-tat escalation with Russia Trump will have difficulty improving relations with Russia which has just thrown us a election to him now the Trump team is saying she's just saying that's how Democrats are going to describe it that's just declaring it as a fact and again another reason why ms mcfarland needs to come in and not just testify in front of Muller but testify in front of a congressional committees we have an responsibility we've been trying to run this down the middle German BER and I and to get all the facts out to the American public so that not only can we figure out if there was collusion but the fact is Russia and other foreign adversaries are continuing to use misinformation disinformation and these type of overtures how do we prevent this from happening again let's talk about taxes the Senate passed the bill late Friday night and the Holy Saturday morning Saturday morning and and with the House and Senate now going to go to a conference committee to reconcile the differences in the tax bills is there any chance that this bill will not become law I think there still remains some chance and I was saying Friday was my single worst day as a u.s. senator because as somebody who wanted to be part of tax reform we realizes we need to have a more competitive corporate rate that realizes we need to bring back some of those American profits but three things about about this whole process that's just plain stunk one was this was swamp 101 the process on Friday night where the bill was being hand drafted lots of provisions were being included for special interest one got exposed already exempting a particular religious college in Michigan backed by the demas family for special tax breaks that it got exposed at least what I I will bet you we will see literally dozens more of these special provisions put in to help special interest secondly as somebody who's been passionate about not adding to our already twenty trillion dollars in debt this bill I believe will add over two trillion dollars to the debt even with whatever growth comes from these tax cuts that's not only because of the 1.5 trillion that's already been acknowledged but this tax bill is set up so that all of the goodies the things that are actually somewhat helpful to individuals are all set to expire within five years creating in what's called war fiscal cliffs and chances are those provisions will be extended driving up more debt and third on just plain substance for example I think they got some of the International provisions wrong so that unfortunately this bill may actually incent more companies to move businesses abroad where they will build a factory say in Germany and then put their intellectual property in some tax haven and because you can average your taxes have corporations still paying virtually no American tax and then if we were going to bring back this money at such cheap rates why not put a requirement in that these companies would actually invest some of that money in training their workforce giving them skills they need to compete as opposed to what I'm afraid is that we will see the vast majority of these funds come back and be used for share buyback and dividends rather than things like investing in human capital or investing in much-needed infrastructure all right Senator Mark Warner Democrat of the Commonwealth of Virginia

the house will be in order the chair lays before the house a communication from the speaker the speakers rooms washington dc january 2nd 2020 i hereby appoint the honorable karen bass to act as speaker pro temporary on this day signed nancy pelosi speaker of the house of representatives you're working now on a really interesting project and that is working on america's relationship with africa yes and specifically africa's image yes why is that important and what are you trying to it's so important to me to change the way our country views the continent of africa and i actually think that we kind of look at africa like we do inner city america you know all the problems you know uh needing help all the time and i joke and say that people in the united states think africa is a country the size of texas i mean so it's important to me to educate people that africa is a continent with 50 plus countries you can fit the united states in there three times and we need to view africa as a partner an opportunity the rest of the world does we need to do business with the continent of africa and not just look at africa from the point of view of foreign aid as a matter of fact i like the slogan that's used in africa trade not aid so we're going to be taking a delegation over to the opening of the african union uh in february and then in august uh speaker pelosi led a delegation with the congressional black caucus to go to ghana because you know last year was the 400th anniversary from our arrival we simply cannot continue to preach democracy freedom of speech and the freedom of religion when we ban people from our country and regardless of how my colleagues on the other side of the aisle think it is perceived it is perceived that we are banning people because they have the muslim faith today the house will pass the imminent emmett till anti-lynching act and designate lynching as a hate crime under federal law i am proud of house leadership and representative rush senator harris booker our chairman for their leadership but i do have to say that we must admit it is a bit of a travesty that it has taken 120 years for the u.s government to address this crime in fact the first bill to outlaw lynching was introduced in 1900. mr harris i had the incredible opportunity of visiting the prison where you were incarcerated yes and meeting with some of the individuals and i just wanted to know what takes place inside the prison to prepare people many of the people that we saw were there for life well i think that a lot of in a lot of incarcerated men driven programming is the thing that helps with the reentry process while you're inside so i just want to congratulate a new generation of youth a new generation of activists who i believe will take the lead in stopping the industry from doing what it has done before this must be our attitude now we who love justice truth and and righteousness we must see the possibility of this nation animal because if anybody fights you this damn hard you must be mighty powerful the under count has been something that we've had to deal with historically but seeing how it's going to be done this year makes gives us greater concern so the congressional black caucus was so concerned that we decided to form a specific task force to look at our districts and to make sure that we count everybody i rise today to strongly support hres 410 the purpose of this resolution is to encourage reunions of divided korean-american families last year i had the opportunity to meet kiyong julie a 90-year-old korean-american man from virginia mr lee has not seen his three older brothers and sisters since he fled north korea more than 70 years ago but he prays for them daily he has no idea if they are even still alive tears streamed down his face during that meeting as he held my hands and urged me to do what i can to help korean families to be reunited this resolution originated at a town hall meeting where a group of constituents called this issue to my attention as i learned more about these aging korean-americans who just want to be able to see their siblings and parents i knew that i in fact had to do all that we could do to raise this issue i know you were a congresswoman a physician's assistant and a clinical instructor at usc school of medicine i know doctors i know doctors in the bay area what do you make of this doctor's frustration well it hits me hard especially having worked in a county hospital where our supplies were often very low i feel her pain as having been a health care worker in the middle of the age crisis when we really didn't understand where the virus was coming from or how it was being transmitted so i know the fear that these health care workers much must have and i absolutely agree with her it is a crime it's unconscionable that we were not prepared when we knew that this was on the horizon and unfortunately the administration didn't take it seriously as we see the consequences the collateral consequences of how the virus is impacting communities we want to make sure that vulnerable populations don't fall through the cracks but there's a lot of people in those prisons in those people that are sick you have pregnant women you have different people they need to be thought about and um especially people that have haven't committed violent offenses or or short-timers or in there for things that are petty you know what if you're just in jail because you didn't have enough money to make bail exactly a few days after the last bill became law stories began to surface of an extreme disproportionate death rate among african americans in several cities seventy percent death rate while african americans are only twenty to thirty percent of the population some cite underlying health conditions as the reason for the extinct disproportionate death rate as though this is a reason that nothing can be done as though we have to just accept this for now this bill begins the process of addressing the disproportionate death rate but oversight and advocacy from congress and the public will still be needed the bill calls for a report to be issued in 21 days where we should have a better picture of what is happening and hopefully provide a road map the bill calls for reporting data on demographics including race on the number and rates of cases hospitalization and deaths from covet when the report is made public it will be clear that communities with large african-american populations will require focused and concentrated testing with rapid results the contact tracing and early and aggressive treatment will be required and that hospitals should reevaluate how they make decisions regarding who has access to ventilators using formulas that decide based on who they believe has a better chance of survival will undoubtedly hurt african americans and contribute to the disproportionate death rate the entertainment industry is a major source of jobs and economic impact in our communities people who work in the entertainment industry often have mixed income that is they receive income as w-2 employees on some gigs they work as independent contractors receiving 1099s on other jobs they say the pandemic unemployment assistance program has overlooked them is this being addressed congresswoman bass yes it absolutely is being addressed i mean if you think of my city los angeles i mean the entertainment industry is the uh center of our economy here so it is being addressed the congressional black caucus planning to take concrete measures to confront racial injustice by introducing new legislation directly addressing police brutality and criminal justice reform joining us now democratic congresswoman karen bass of california the woman in charge the chair of both the congressional black caucus and the judiciary subcommittee on crime i'm so glad you're here this morning you are leading shaping this bill what is specifically what are you proposing about police accountability well police accountability is the number one issue because right now the way the laws are both federally as well as statewide you can't sue a police officer it's difficult to fire a police officer and it's certainly difficult to prosecute a police officer the world is witnessing the birth of a new movement in our country democratic lawmakers rolled out a package of police reforms which karen bath chairwoman of the congressional black caucus calls historic that not only holds police accountable and increases transparency but assists police departments to change the culture the bills address a wide range of issues from police oversight to training to limiting lethal force and outright banning police choke holds with us is the honorable karen bass of the 37th district of california including culver city parts of west la south los angeles and exposition park she's also chair of the congressional black caucus and the point person on a list of police reforms introduced this week in the house of representatives congresswoman thanks for joining us let's talk about some of what is in this bill banning chokeholds a national database to track police misconduct all of which appears to have some bipartisan support but it would also make it easier for victims of police abuse to recover damages and make it easier for charges to be brought against officers regarding abuse that may be more problematic is this an all or nothing endeavor or are you open to compromise well you know i mean to have a big piece of legislation done we always know that at the end of the day there are going to be some compromises but i do think that there are some key features of this bill that are super important if we're really going to make a qualitative change congresswoman karen bass is the chair of the congressional black caucus she's helping lead the fight to pass police reform in the house today she laid out just what is at stake as congress considers this bill if this had been a law last year george floyd would be alive because chokeholds would be banned brianna taylor would be alive because no knock warrants for drugs would be banned tamir rice would have graduated high school this may because he the officer that killed him had been fired from a nearby department and he lied on his application i'd like to ask you about an issue that's really affecting folks the post office and the postmaster general has halted these plans to slow things down uh at the postal service uh can you tell us confidently that that folks will be able to cast their ballots by mail and and know that their votes are going to be counted and also just the everyday things so many folks rely on the mail for their you know prescriptions for their benefits all sorts of things what is the state of the post office well you know the state of the post office is under assault under assault by the trump administration i will tell you that he has been an enemy of the post office from day one he has attacked the post office pretty regularly but right now of course the concern is the election that's in less than 80 days away i do have confidence in especially la and in in our state but i do not have confidence around the country because i do think in certain states they are not concerned about making sure that everybody has a safe and a fair way to vote now consider james holmes who murdered 12 people and injured 70 others in a movie theater in aurora colorado the same town as elijah mclean where he was arrested james wore body armor had a knife semi-automatic weapons and an ar-15 yet he was calmly arrested by the same police department as elijah mcclain without a chokehold art injection academy first job of the commander-in-chief is to protect his people this commander-in-chief really doesn't care about us otherwise we wouldn't have 160 000 dead americans if it is true that what happened to brianna taylor does not warrant homicide charges under current law what does it say about how the law is written to you and that's exactly the point and that's exactly why we need to change the laws at other institutions we have heard stories of prisoners alleging that individuals were being grouped together to develop herd immunity another was concerned that he was being bunked with someone who had clear symptoms of covet 19 and yet another was concerned he was not receiving adequate medical care bop officers themselves did not have access to adequate on-site testing and the incarcerated men from this particular institute did not have the right ppe and other needed resources you chaired a hearing yesterday on covid in prison is the bureau of prisons doing enough at this point to protect those who are incarcerated from covet no they're not doing enough now one of the things that we were asking them what we need how can we be helpful i don't always like just bringing people before hearing and criticizing them i want to help them the president-elect told cnn he's concerned about the precedent uh it would set if if president trump does pardon let's say his children his lawyer rudy giuliani or even himself double down on his commitments that his department of justice will be independent i assume uh you see that as potentially a welcome shift well absolutely anything that will get us back to normalcy is absolutely welcome but you know i think when the study is done on this administration it's going to give us at least 100 things that should never happen again and i'm sure there's going to be some legislation that tightens up the checks and balances that clearly didn't work with this administration a pew research poll released this week found that only 42 percent of black americans said that they would definitely or probably get the coronavirus vaccine i want to ask you because not only are you an american leader but you're a former physician's assistant right what is your message to skeptics and what needs to be done specifically to ensure that minority communities that have been hit harder than white communities uh by this pandemic what's what needs to be done to make sure they do get vaccinated well first of all it's it's critical that african americans and other communities of color participate in the clinical trials the other things and i think that this applies to the country as a whole because of the lack of leadership we have had from day one on the virus there needs to be a serious public education campaign because the messages from the white house up until this day is diminishing the significance of the virus and so i think massive public education is needed but it's also important that trusted messenger speak and so one of the things that the congressional black caucus worked on with our other caucuses the latino the asian and the native american caucuses we want to have concentrated focused intervention in our communities because of the disproportionate impact and that involves testing tracing treatment and vaccine preparation and so we need to do everything we can to make sure we have state local funding but to make sure that we have all of the money that is needed for vaccine distribution and we need to think of our front line workers as being first and foremost in that line hr 8161 would provide much needed resources to communities with a dis especially communities with a disproportionate number of returning citizens the idea of the bill is to provide grants to establish a centralized process to assist individuals returning to their communities after incarceration let me get your reaction to talk of martial law seizing voting machines in this country and creating a special counsel on voter fraud what do you make about what we are hearing coming out of the white house well i think it's absolutely tragic i am very happy to be able to have this shot and i just want everyone to know that this nurse is great because i barely felt it and the idea that is going to keep me safe this is something that everyone needs to do as soon as it is available in your community thank you so much [Music] hello everyone

happy new year usually during this time of year we're all together fellowshipping taking selfies and catching up on different activities that happen throughout the year and so i don't have to remind you that this year is unlike any other but like most events we're going virtual but i'm so hopeful that with a new vaccine and with a new administration we'll be back together soon now in spite of all the closures this congressional office never closed in fact at the onset this office was responsible for ensuring that dozens of constituents who were stranded abroad returned home safely this office was also responsible for connecting small businesses faith-based organizations non-profit organizations with federal resources connecting those who are out of work with their state office as related to unemployment and most of all ensuring that you all receive your direct payments through the cares act now usually when i greet you all during this time of year it's full of themes of faith peace and love but this year i also feel a profound sense of gratitude i'm grateful for family i'm grateful for friends and health and for folks just like you and so that's why it's extremely important more now than ever that you stay connected to us please email us call us fill out website entries go on our socials we know that the best policy comes from folks who are affected by their policy and we convey all of those opinions and concerns directly to the congresswoman and so without further ado i would like to introduce you to the team that is responsible for doing it all your local district office thank you and happy new year i'm jacqueline hamilton senior counsel with congresswoman karen bass i've been with her for seven years this month and i handle issues like education environment health care and foreign affairs in the district office i also oversee our letters and certificates program the congressional art competition and nominations to the nation's elite service academies like west point and annapolis i look forward to serving you i'm claudia aragon casework supervisor and operations manager in my sixth year with team bass i make sure that office operations run smoothly and i oversee contacts when you have problems with federal agencies such as the irs social security the va and the postal armed service hi my name is kenneth on i'm the senior caseworker in our office i've been here for about five years now and in addition in the in addition to handling cases as claudia described i also help to manage the data meaning i figure out how best to reach our constituents and stay in touch with you and i look forward to serving you in 2021 thank you hello for those of you who don't know me my name is stan henderson i'm a congressional liaison this is my 19th year as a congressional staffer as i previously served with congresswoman diane watson i have been with congresswoman bass since 2009 my areas of responsibility are security transportation and logistics and other duties as a sign for the los angeles district office thank you good evening my name is dylan ewell i serve as senior field representative here in the office of congresswoman karen bass i've had the distinct honor of working on issues such as africa criminal justice transportation south los angeles housing jobs and the economy and amongst other things working with the people's advisory council after nearly half a decade i just want to say that my time here with the office has been nothing short of amazing just engaging with constituents by taking calls recording your comments meeting with you in person and at events has made my experience exceptional i'm officially transitioning but i do want you to know that the office is here and willing to serve you the constituents of the 37th congressional district thank you all so much [Music] every year i look forward to the congressional art competition an opportunity for high school artists to submit their work for recognition and for me to have the opportunity to meet young people and their families from the district while we celebrate their talents the winning artwork is hung in the u.s capitol for a year and the winner receives a pair of airline tickets and an invitation to attend the opening art reception in washington d.c hundreds of thousands of people view this artwork each year including my colleagues and i as we travel back and forth from our offices to the house floor in the capitol i'm sorry that unfortunately this year we didn't have the opportunity for our winner to come to the capitol but i'm going to make sure that in 2021 we have an opportunity for our winner to be able to visit washington d.c so seven years ago when jacqueline hamilton joined my staff we had a very small program but anybody that knows jacqueline knows that she can take something small and turned it into something grand and together with her husband who is an artist david valentine they turned the art competition into a chance to change young lives lisa vasquez agreed to co-chair the art competition committee and then other art educators and working artists joined as judges and volunteers and we now offer recognition to over a hundred talented students each year coming from dozens of art teachers at 12 to 15 different high schools i'm really sad to say though that david valentine passed away suddenly in june we've decided to recognize his contributions by naming the first place prize in his honor i'm so deeply grateful for his enormous contributions to art education and to the congressional art competition in my district and also the way he impacted the lives of so many people using art as a vehicle to communicate and build community and now without the pandemic our district would have had a professional art show in may with all of the entrants this year we had to move the contest online and you can view the virtual gallery on my website at the link below where you can also view the names of the winners and with that i'd like to introduce the first recipient of the david valentine congressional art competition prize isaiah levels of south los angeles who attends culver city high my name is isaiah lovells and i'm proud to be the winner of the 37th district 2020 art competition my involvement into this program was pretty progressive and challenging my piece that i chose first of all it's called the american dream so it's basically your choice your choice to do what you want to do the elements i chose were a little toy car or vehicle a wood piece or broken board and the background behind it is a map it's a creative map from my vision uh only because i'm you know interested in maps like cartography honestly this competition was harder than i expected especially with the times going on nowadays so yeah it was an honor and i just wanted to thank you uh you know for inviting me letting me participate in your competition [Music] when a constituent runs into problems with the federal agency like the irs social security immigration or the veterans administration or the post office they can turn to my office for help vietnam veteran renee talbot contacted our office this year about an unusual case of bravery that has gone unrecognized until now then sergeant talbot served honorably for four years in the u.s air force including two tours of duty in vietnam in 2018 mr talbot requested his service records from the national archive and discovered in an evaluation form from 1968 that his superior officer had recommended him for a bronze star medal no further action was taken at the time and he was not informed mr talbot deserves to have his actions acknowledged this year i made an entry into the congressional record the official proceedings from the congress of the call to attention to the strength and courage he displayed during his active duty service shown in this excerpt from his evaluation about an incident in 1968 his self-control under fire showed his good discipline and outstanding ability to react under adverse conditions for his action in this incident our airman talbot was recommended for the bronze star well i had the pleasure of speaking to mr tao but recently after he was presented with the congressional record i want to thank mr talbot for your service and if you have any problems any of the constituents have problems with the va please contact me it is an honor to serve veterans as they have served our country now let's take a look back at our legislative accomplishments and what has happened in washington dc in 2020 what a year this has been for all of us not just in the 37th district not just in the united states but actually in the entire world well everyone i always enjoy this part of our annual legislative review but what a year 2020 was you know we actually were only in session four two and a half months before the pandemic hit and then we really didn't know what to do i mean you remember back to march we all were told to shelter in place and i think most people thought okay we'll be home for a little while and then life will get back to normal well it never did in the capitol until this day and it probably won't for a good part of next year so that meant that our work in a way had to continue but we had to learn new ways of doing our work but basically the context for this year was set in november 2018 when democrats took control of the house and you know at the beginning of this year we had 232 democrats 197 republicans and so the house had changed over in 2019 just when we got our sea legs then the pandemic hit but in the senate you know of course the senate was in the hands of mitch mcconnell who enjoyed the idea that he was called the grim reaper because you know that to this day over 200 bills sit on his desk 200 bills that were voted out of the house with bipartisan support now we have another 200 bills that are sitting over there that were just voted along party lines but the point is mitch mcconnell really didn't pay attention to doing much this year except for confirming judges so 2020 was an interesting year trying to figure out how to respond to something that none of us had ever experienced before but let me just tell you a little bit one of the first things we had to do when it was very clear that this pandemic was going to be devastating to us economically is we had to pass legislation that provided support to the country and to the people who were suffering and so when it comes to the 37th district i did want you to know that millions and millions of dollars came into our district we had over 340 000 district residents that received support from the federal government we personally helped over 1800 especially with the post office and i'm sure you guys remember in cover city at one of our public housing developments they decided arbitrarily just to stop delivering mail and told people they had to drive to the post office to pick up their mail now they were told to drive to the post office and pick up their mail at the same time during when we were told to stay at home and shelter in place so how did that make sense so we definitely had to do what we needed to do to make sure that those residents were able to have their mail delivered we had over 130 district residents that were stranded around the world because you remember when the pandemic hit and countries around the world were scrambling trying to figure out what to do well we had over 137 district residents that wanted to come back home wanted to figure out how to get home and so claudia and ken and dylan and darren worked very hard to make sure that our people were able to come back home and in this time we did over 35 virtual town halls because we wanted to constantly keep people informed as to what we needed to do and so legislatively we passed the cares act and you know the cares act was where the first uh aid came to our community and just a couple of examples four billion dollars were available for state and local government and then there was the paycheck protection program that was used to support small businesses and so a lot of support that has gone into delivering for the people of the country has been held up i mean we passed another bill six months ago and the republicans again would not bring it up for uh for a vote in the senate you know uh there are several residents that ask questions to sega from culver city wants to know why the stimulus check is so small it'll only last a family of four for one month so if the republicans want to give two thousand dollars why is there pushback is there a hidden agenda that she's not understanding yeah the hidden agenda is the republicans have no problem giving away the store to people who are extremely rich but for whatever reason feel if they give ordinary people working families a check that then they're not going to want to go back to work i think that is so offensive so out of the house we passed the 2 000 um stimulus check that the president wanted remember he was going to veto the bill unless we raised the amount now you know we had proposed way more than 600 dollars six months ago and that's the bill that they wouldn't take up so we voted on what the president wanted and let's see what happens in the senate by the time you're watching this recording i am very hopeful that the senate did what they should do and that they passed one the stimulus bill but also the additional bill that raises the amount that people get to two thousand dollars so i'm hoping that people will be getting their checks in the next in the next few days actually the next two weeks at the most and basically if you qualified for a check before you will get another check and there's nothing that you need to do amy from south robertson wants to know what's going to happen with our unemployment well that was extended so unemployment will be extended for a few more months now when we passed the bill this week we were really just concerned about getting us to the inauguration so that our four-year nightmare will be over we will have a decent administration who i know will actually care and really want to support the american people and so this is just a down payment uh shea with craft wheelchair repair and mid wilshire is asking about small business grants and how to apply for them well you can always call our office 323-965-1422 and we can give you the information you need but if you were a small business that received the loan before you can go back to that financial institution and hopefully receive another loan and by the way you know those loans are supposed to be forgivable so the point of the loan was to allow you to maintain your workforce now if you're the only employee well you are still eligible if you are a non-profit you are eligible if you are a faith community institution you are eligible so if you don't lay off your staff then that loan will turn into a grant and again if you have any problems with this at all please call my office so i did want to talk about other legislative accomplishments that we did this year and again you have to look at this year in context because of the pandemic we haven't been in washington very much as a matter of fact we were really only functioning the first two and a half months of the year and then after that we have been trying to figure out how to function remotely periodically coming back to dc but the whole year has been very confusing now in spite of that i did this year introduced 21 pieces of legislation that cover several different areas and i'll explain to you a couple of those six of the bills that i introduce past the house and are languishing in the senate needless to say and of course most notable was the george floyd justice and policing act and that was the first transformative police reform bill that was passed out of the house of representatives as far as anybody knows i think the first ever and as part of the george floyd justice and policing act we banned chokeholds which is how george floyd died we banned no knock warrants which is how brianna taylor died we call for a national registry of bad cops which is how 12-year-old tamir rice was killed by a police officer who had been fired from another police department for instability and what we learned in this process is a lot of times when officers get into trouble and they have you know either violence abuse a racial profiling they just go to another department and so part of the george floyd justice and policing act was to stop that so that wouldn't happen now we'll be back at it first thing next year so i believe with president biden vice president harris we'll be able to get police reform legislation done we'll also past legislation something that is very near and dear to my heart that i feel very passionate about is criminal justice reform period and one of the things that we have done in california very admirably is we've reduced our prison population but i worry about what happens to the men and women and children when they get released so i pass legislation out of the house that will be taken up again in january and also it will be taken up in the senate to call for a program that would be run by people who were formally incarcerated to help new folks who were released essentially reintegrate and readjust to life on the outside and so it's a one-stop shop for a re-entry program now we're fortunate in our district we have a program that is run by the county it was actually started by county supervisor mark ridley thomas this is a program that would be that would function more on a grassroots level so one of the things that i think about criminal justice reform and i'm so glad that finally there is a national movement around it but usually when people talk about criminal justice reform they're really only talking about men they're not talking about women and they're not talking about children and so i had developed a piece of legislation that focuses on women who are pregnant and in custody and this is bipartisan legislation that passed out of the house and i look forward to introducing it in the new congress with my senate partner amy klobuchar and i'm sure that we'll be able to get this bill on president biden's desk because it is a very bipartisan piece of legislation a lot of my colleagues didn't realize that pregnant women were incarcerated and some of the treatment and some of the stories are just absolutely heartbreaking so what this bill does is this bill says we have to pay attention to the health and well-being of the mother and the baby so for example you know of course that a pregnant woman has additional nutritional needs some prisons adjust for those additional needs by giving a woman a peanut an extra peanut butter sandwich at the end of the day well that's just completely inappropriate and so looking at the health and well-being of pregnant inmates is the basis of this bill and i have another bill that i'm going to introduce in the next congress that takes a comprehensive look at women who are involved in the justice system why they get arrested what happens when they're incarcerated and then also what happens after they get out on an entirely different subject you know when i look at this slide it definitely brings back a lot of emotion because this gentleman a korean gentleman is in his 90s and he came and he talked to me about his situation in the united states we don't allow people to go to north korea but there are a lot of korean families here who have relatives in the north some of whom haven't seen their relatives since the country was divided in the 1950s and this gentleman is an example of that he hasn't seen his siblings and he's very concerned that he might not live long enough to see them and so when i heard about this issue in los angeles as a matter of fact our kenneth on brought it to our attention as a young leader in koreatown i he organized a meeting and i met with korean residents in los angeles they brought this issue to my attention and then i met this gentleman in my office in dc and we passed this bill out of the house this is another bill that will be reintroduced and i'm sure we'll make it to president biden's desk in the next congress another bill that is so important that i'm also doing with another senate partner senator gillibrand is called build local hire local because all of us complain about the need for jobs in our district and you can see these major projects being undertaken but you look at the people working in the projects and not many of them are from especially the south la part of the 37th district and so this is a pretty comprehensive bill that really focuses on people on hiring people that live in the area where these big public sector projects are being built and there's also a training and a recruitment element component to this legislation so i will look forward to reintroducing that legislation with senator gillibrand and the other work involving committees and caucuses i had a lot of responsibility this year i chaired the congressional black caucus i continue to chair the congressional caucus on foster youth which is a caucus that i started a bipartisan caucus that i started when i arrived in congress 10 years ago i also chair the subcommittee in the house foreign affairs committee the subcommittee covers africa global health global human rights and international organizations like the u.n or the world health organization i was asked to chair the committee a subcommittee and judiciary that covers crime terrorism and homeland security and it's from this committee that i have been able to do the criminal justice reform legislation and so the congressional black caucus ironically at the beginning of the year we said that 2020 was going to be a critical year for two reasons one the census most important we knew the trump administration was devising plans to make sure that certain communities were not counted you remember that one of the first things he wanted to do was to put a question on the census about your citizenship well our constitution calls for counting all people period there's nothing in our constitution that says the only people that exist are people who are us citizens and so putting the senses online also was going to further disenfranchise folks because we know a lot of people either don't have access to broadband they might not be able to afford it or they might not know how to get online and so we felt that the census was going to be absolutely critical and then of course we knew this election was going to define our country for the next two generations it's very clear that the only things my republican colleagues were interested in was to confirm judges now why do they focus on that well there's three branches of government there's the executive which is the white house the presidency there's the legislative which is the two houses of congress the senate and the house of representatives and then there's the judiciary well out of these three branches of government only the judiciary has lifetime appointments and so if they can populate the judiciary with extremely conservative young judges they can essentially assure the reshaping of our country and so with those two things in mind we thought 2020 was going to be a critical year so we called for an emergency summit we had over a thousand african-american leaders who attended the conference that lasted over a two-day period and on the second day of the conference happened to be when speaker pelosi allowed president trump to do his state of the union if you remember there was a lot of back and forth over the beginning of the year president trump didn't realize that he couldn't just walk into the house of representatives but that he had to be invited by speaker pelosi and she was going to be the one to decide when and where he was going to give his state of the union you might have remembered that she actually had offered or suggested that he just give it in the oval office i will tell you when i watched the state of the union i was absolutely shocked when he finished speaking and she stood up and tore up his speech because it was just filled with lie after lie after lie but anyway the congressional black caucus held this emergency summit it was really exciting and inspiring and we had planned to take the summit on the road we had planned to go around the country and have regional summits especially in those areas that president trump had targeted that he was going to go into black communities to try to shave off five to ten percent of the black vote and as soon as we left what within days our lives dramatically changed because of the pandemic so chairing the congressional black call because i was also asked by speaker pelosi to do the george floyd justice and policing act because the bill had several component parts and the majority of the bill had been written by members of the congressional black caucus who had tried to pass legislation over the years and were never able to get it done and so uh at her desire for the black caucus to take the lead and since i was chairing the caucus and chairing the subcommittee where the bill was heard i was given that leadership responsibility but at the same time we also work lock step with the hispanic caucus the asian pacific islander caucus and we called ourselves the tri-caucus plus two because for the first time in u.s history we had native american women who were members of congress so the tri caucus plus two worked on a variety of issues together most notably we have focused on covid because covet has disproportionately impacted each of our communities and we have been advocating for and we've been winning bits and pieces but it's going to take a new president frankly to actually do the right thing we feel there needs to be a targeted concentrated intervention in communities where there's a disproportionate death rate and what does that mean well if you have a specific community where it's very disproportionate you need to go in in massive numbers with concentrated testing with cut with contact tracing with aggressive treatment and now thank goodness with a vaccine and you know we're going to have to do very specific education with each of our populations so that they won't be fearful of the vaccine in the congressional caucus on foster youth once again we had to focus on covid now you know over the years we recruit young people to come to the capitol we have over a hundred of them that come to the capitol every year for what we call our annual shadow day and very sad of course we recruited all 100 young people but they couldn't come to the capitol this year well one of our young leaders who's worked with us for several years unfortunately was one of the first victims to covet a young man he was in his early 20s and he passed away and so the young folks got together and they developed a piece of legislation that they named in his honor and essentially what the legislation is calling for is don't forget the foster youth the foster youth have fallen through the cracks because of covet and many of them have been left to fend for themselves because social workers haven't been able to go out and work as they normally do and so the congressional caucus on foster youth this time and we have over 100 members it's a bipartisan a caucus has really focused on covet because covet has taken over our lives and the house foreign affairs committee on africa we held numerous hearings one of our first hearings was about covet but it was also about democratic backsliding because what we have seen in our country especially during the election leading up to the election and after the election we have a president who is literally trying to overturn the election well in the african countries we saw an increase in that as well we saw presidents and prime ministers decide to postpone their election to crack down on dissent and protest and essentially to use covid as an excuse to close and shrink democratic space and then of course we have the crisis that's happening in cameroon and in ethiopia and those are examples of issues that we addressed in the uh committee on um on africa and as i mentioned uh previously the subcommittee on crime not only did we deal with george floyd but we also dealt with the re-entry issues we focused on the opioid epidemic and we also focused on women and as a matter of fact the woman that wrote orange is the new black who actually had been incarcerated herself as she came she was one of the witnesses that gave testimony and also gave validity to what we were trying to do there was an episode of the orange of the new black that we actually showed that was about a woman who was pregnant and what happened to her after she delivered her baby so because of the pandemic i've not had any town halls this year and so i have definitely missed our in-person interaction and can't wait until we can get back to doing that but one thing is is that you know there's always a good side to it and so all of us have gotten adjusted to zooming and doing things virtually and i have to say that when the pandemic subsides and we have uh people being vaccinated and it's safe again i think we're still going to maintain some of what we uh became adjusted to with covid and so we held virtual town halls talking about everything under the sun especially after the first stimulus bills were passed we wanted to make sure that people understood how to access them with when covet testing became available so we did many many many town halls to reach out to people in the district but also around the country and so i just want you to know my office will always help you with case work and if you have issues the irs small business administration the post office please feel free to call our office 323-965-1422 so looking ahead to the upcoming congress what do we have we have president biden and vice president harris and all of us are counting the days i have to tell you speaker pelosi she counts the hours every time we have a conference call with our democratic caucus she holds up a sheet and tells us how many hours we have until the inauguration all of us i know are actually a little frightened right now because this guy has decompensated so badly we really don't know what he's going to do over the next 20 days and i will tell you that janice from baldwin hills she's concerned about the legislative process on january 6 which is just in a couple of days regarding validation of the electoral college and so she asked is there a possibility that the election results can be overturned jerry from palms is also asking what if anything are democrats planning to do to ensure biden harris get the 270 electoral votes so i will tell you that all of us are going to watch some shenanigans in a few days but understand they will just be shenanigans president biden vice president harris will get their 270 electoral votes we are not doing anything special the question that uh jerry is asking is what are democrats doing we're just going to follow the constitution that's all we'll be okay but there will be drama there will be shenanigans and frankly i'm worried that there's going to be violence because the president is calling all of his white supremacist supporters and not all of them are white supremacists but he is calling them the proud boys and and the other folks he's telling people to come to dc and demonstrate the last time they came to dc which was just a couple of weeks ago four people were stabbed at the at the rally so i am definitely worried on january 6 and you can be sure i'm not going to be walking down the streets in washington dc on january 6. i'll be here in the capitol but i'll be sure not to go outside but but it will be okay uh phillip phillip and venice asked how can we make combating climate change a priority in washington i have no doubt that one of the first things that president biden is going to do is to reverse a number of the executive orders that trump put in that hurts every aspect of our environment from water to air to drilling i mean every aspect and so i know that that will be a very important part of his administration remember he brought on john kerry just to focus on the climate and also put him on the cabinet so i think that's a very significant demonstration of the administration's commitment around climate change so dorothy from palms asked under the new administration what safety measures are being taken to ensure trump and his followers won't continue to harm the american people well i'm going to tell you none of us really know what this guy's gonna do i mean all of us i know are hoping that he goes to mar-a-lago well actually they don't want him to go there and they're trying to organize that he can't move there because the he was his property mar-a-lago was zoned to be a resort not a residence and so they don't want him there i don't know where he's gonna go but all of us would really like for him to be off the stage i do fear a little bit that he's gonna travel around the country having rallies seven million people voted for him so there is the potential that he will continue to do harm to the american people but as long as he stays within the law he will be okay but if he violates the law he's a former president and so he might have thought he had blanket immunity uh before but on january 20th at about three o'clock all that goes away a clyde from south la says what are the plans for student loan debts i know that the incoming administration plans to have a student loan forgiveness program so we'll have to wait and see student loan forgiveness is something i've worked on for a number of years and i will continue to work on that issue so i want everybody to know that the vaccine when you have an opportunity to get the vaccine please get it now i will tell you i was honestly very leery of the vaccine because i associated it with this administration and i know that vaccine development takes a long time well you remember before the election he kept talking about the vaccine was going to be ready by election day so things like that really worried me because i felt that it was being rushed but then when i did a little research i found out the development of this vaccine actually started 17 years ago so this is called covet 19 because it was discovered in 2019 but coronaviruses have been around for 17 years this is the third coronavirus so we could say it's a cousin of the last two the first one that showed up showed up in 2003 and they started to develop a vaccine and then it kind of went away and so that stopped and then in 2012 another cousin of coronavirus was found and so they started to continue the vaccine development and then that went away so they had the foundation already developed when coveted 19 hit and what the scientists did is is that they just kept their head down and they just did their work they didn't pay any attention to trump and so when i realized that this vaccine really wasn't rushed is safe then the first opportunity i had to take it i got it and i want you to know that i had absolutely no side effects my arm was a little sore the next day but every time you get a flu shot your arms sore every time you get any kind of shot your arm is sore that is it no headaches no nothing and so i would just strongly encourage you because the only way we're gonna get our lives back to normal is if we are vaccinated and we're going to need up to 90 of the u.s population to be vaccinated before it becomes like measles where you don't hear about people getting measles anymore so uh lori from south robertson asked when and how will covet 19 vaccine be rolled out in los angeles and i will tell you that it's actually already being rolled out now so first responders residents in nursing homes are able to get it so just pay attention to the local news and they will let you know when it becomes available to the general public the thought is it'll become available to the general public probably at the end of spring going into summer now one thing that i feel very excited and confident about i know one of the first things that president biden is going to do is he's going to call for the military he's going to call for massive involvement to make sure that we can mass produce and mass distribute the vaccine there will be national leadership one of the reasons why so many americans have died is because we have not had the leadership in our country that treated this as though it was an invasion of a foreign army and brought together all of the resources of the richest country in the history of the world to deal with this pandemic that did not happen under president trump i am confident it will happen under president biden and i'm also very confident that by the time we are in december 2021 and really even the fall of 2021 that our lives will be back to normal and i look forward to seeing all of you in a town hall and i look forward to next year's annual legislative review being in person thank you so much you should know that you can always contact my office i am extremely fortunate to have the district staff that work every day and i want you to know they've been in the office every day a lot of offices and businesses have been closed down but they have been at work every day and i just want to take the opportunity to thank them to thank all of the constituents in the 37th district and to tell you i know 2021 is going to be a much better year thank you and happy new year

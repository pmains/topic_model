Thank you Mr. Speaker, last week torrential
rains caused record flooding in many parts of Illinois and in particular in my district. I had the chance to visit some of the affected
areas over the weekend, joined by my colleagues from Illinois, Mr. Hultgren and Mr. Roskam,
as well as Senator Durbin, Fox Lake Mayor Donny Schmitt and Lake County Chair Aaron
Lawlor. We spoke with residents and saw first hand
some of the many challenges these communities are facing. I rise today, however, to recognize the many
unsung heroes who have stepped up to help their neighbors, and often help total strangers,
in the wake of this disaster. This includes our first responders, dedicated
government workers, and volunteers, many coming from towns far away and unaffected by the
floods. As the rains fell, and then in the days after,
these people worked tirelessly around the clock to lend a hand and try to hold off the
rising waters. Weâ€™re not out of the woods yet, and the
people who serve our communities day in and day out, in our local governments, our police
and fire departments, and our emergency agencies are continuing to work with professionalism
and quick coordination. So Mr. Speaker, I am please to use my time
today to say thank you to these people working behind the scenes without due recognition. They represent the very best of our communities
and our nation and make us all very proud. And with that I yield back the balance of
my time.

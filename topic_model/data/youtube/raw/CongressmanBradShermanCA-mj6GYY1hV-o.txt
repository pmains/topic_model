for five years I've been trying to ban American investments in crypto I'm the only member of the house to get an F from the only crypto promoting organization that rates members of Congress my fear is that we'll view Sam bankman freed as just one big snake in a crypto Garden of Eden the fact is crypto is a garden of snakes now from the outside crypto just looks like a non-fungible token in electronic pet rock for the 21st century something that might be good to invest in even though it has no apparent value because you might get somebody else to buy it from you for even more but in reality the hope of crypto is to be a currency to compete with the U.S dollar and to announce its advantage over the U.S dollar in that competition it puts the advantage right in the name crypto hidden currency well what is there a big market for that is there a big advantage that crypto has over the US dollar if it actually became a currency which it's not yet well there are drug dealers human traffickers sanctions Invaders who will find that to be a good feature NSM bankman freed would tell you there's a hell of a market for bankruptcy court evasion but the big Market is tax evasion and I know there are some on the other side who cheer every time a billionaire uh escapes taxes um the other purpose the other announced purpose of crypto is to compete with the US dollar as a world Reserve currency thereby enriching the corporate uh billionaire Bros and taking thousands of dollars of the advantage away from Every American family uh because we benefit from being a reserve currency now Sam bankman freed or should I say inmate 14 372 um had one purpose in all of his efforts here in Congress was well-known figure uh only one wearing shorts his one purpose was to keep the SEC out of crypto to provide a patina of Regulation baby regulation from the cftc and I'll have one comment from my colleagues don't trash Sam bankman freed and then pass his bill I fear that could happen because Sam was not the only crypto bro with Pax and lobbyists and there is no Pac or lobbyist here to work for efficient tax enforcement or sanctions enforcement now I've heard from uh some on the other side criticizing the SEC in July in this room I criticized the head of the SEC for not going out the head of enforcement of the SEC for not going after a crypto exchanges but the fact is that I without objection I'd like to put on the record a letter signed by 19 Republican members designed to push back on the SEC a brushback pitch if you're familiar with baseball uh without action such as the order thank you um attacking the SEC for paying attention to and I'll quote the purported risks of digital assets and I'd like to put on the record without objection comments from eight members uh uh made in this room that were designed to attack the SEC as being a lud-eyed and anti um anti-innovation for their efforts um Mr Ray um you're going to be looking at FTX we know that Sam bankmanfried is already uh in faces criminal charges but he did have help will uh you be looking for and turning over to U.S law enforcement authorities uh information about the possible criminal actions by Ryan Salome Carolyn Olsen and the uh the other folks in the uh in the fancy apartment uh we are doing a thorough investigation and uh we will of course we have been cooperating with the U.S regulators and law enforcement agencies so we will cooperate to turn over any information that would be relevant to them thank you and I'll point out in particular that uh one of the counts count eight in the complaint or indictment uh is violation of campaign Finance laws and I hope that what you will turn over is a list of the major uh bonuses and or loans it's reported that to Ryan solomay got a 55 million dollar loan so that a law enforcement can piece together when those loans and bonuses were made and whether they immediately preceded uh illegal campaign disguised campaign contributions so can we counter you do that yes I can confirm that my time is expired

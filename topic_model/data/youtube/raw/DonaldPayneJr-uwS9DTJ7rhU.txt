thank you mr speaker and first let me thank the gentlelady from connecticut ms este for allowing me this time to engage the american people in a subject that is crucial to the economy of this nation and for the citizens that use transportation throughout this country i think mr garamendi started out really gave us a bang in terms of looking at the rail situation and that is an area that i am also going to speak on let me say that with every date it passes the need for federal infrastructure investment grows more and more urgent robust and reliable infrastructure is the foundation for economic success and security but for too long the united states has under-invested in our infrastructure and this once vibrant foundation has crumbled i yesterday in my district took a visit with amtrak to the 107 year old portal bridge it carries about 450 trains and thousands of passengers over the hackensack river in new jersey every weekday it is a major bottleneck along the northeast corridor the nation's busiest rail line and this rail line goes uh through new jersey um well actually starts here in washington and will travel to boston and so it travels through connecticut as well but we have a major bottleneck in new jersey this old infrastructure this 107 year old bridge is uh really outdated um outdated um machinery because you see this bridge over the river has to spin on a turret when there is um when there is um barges i'm sorry barge is coming through and normally it gets stuck the replacement of the bridge is a key component of the 23.9 billion dollar gateway program a comprehensive rail investment program to double rail capacity between new jersey and new york city according to a recent study released by amtrak the program could generate three dollars and 87 cents worth of economic benefit for every one dollar investment new jersey new york have agreed to contribute 750 million award towards the estimated 1.5 billion costs for the portal bridge project but the program will not be able to move forward without federal investment president trump's proposal to zero out the the new starts programs threatens to derail the overall gateway program and the portal bridge project along with it america's infrastructure is failing now is the time to build the infrastructure that we need to grow our economy and keep america safe and become more competitive every dollar of infrastructure investment means another three dollars of economic growth america's infrastructure needs could be met and then some for a fraction of the cost of the president's tax plan which is estimated to increase the deficit by 3 trillion to 7 trillion dollars over the next decade while contributing immensely to economic growth mr speaker we see what is happening across this nation we've seen what has happened with bridges crumbling um poor infrastructure and tunnels and it is time for this nation to invest once again if it's in its infrastructure if it wants to remain the beacon in the world for economic growth and i would like to thank the gentlelady once again for allowing me this opportunity to talk about a critical critical topic if no one hears this call we are doomed in terms of our infrastructure and i yield back

thank you all for being here I'm going to try to get through a lot as efficiently as possible I want to begin Mr Scharf by talking about housing Supply and affordable housing I recently wrote to you and several other mortgage lenders about accessory dwelling units so basement or backyard Apartments in-law suites there's some regulatory changes at the fhfa related agencies that may allow more lending to capitalize the construction of accessory dwelling units just like your commitment that you're going to respond to my letter thoughtfully and consider how you can capitalize more of that construction to bring more housing Supply online and help more families afford housing absolutely Senator we will thank you Mr Scharf

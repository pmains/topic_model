joining us now January 6 Committee Member and house intelligence committee chairman Adam Schiff congressmanship a lot to talk about with you I want to start though with January 6 because two big things came out this week I want to talk about the evidence that your committee found that leads to the fact that President Trump may have in fact broke the law also a subpoena request came out this week for Donald Trump Jr's fiancee Kimberly Guilfoyle what is significant about these two findings well first uh we did a brief in a case involving an attorney named John Eastman uh who claims to have represented Donald Trump uh and claims that his Communications therefore are protected by attorney-client privilege um the judge in that case asked us whether we thought the exception the crime fraud exception applied that is an attorney can't protect the communications with a client if those Communications have evidence of crime or fraud and here we believe they do uh that the president at his campaign may have been in violation of a number of federal laws including a law that prohibits corruptly interfering with an official proceeding and of course the joint session of Congress that the president sought to interfere with was nothing if not an official proceeding uh and uh and he had a correct intent to do it knowing as he had been advised that the vice president had no basis for refusing to accept these electors but more than that we think there's also evidence that the president and his campaign may have been trying to perpetrate a fraud on the American people with these bogus claims of election fraud so that's the context in which this came up it's not a criminal referral but rather uh the case that we're making in court to obtain documents that we believe are very relevant to our investigation all right so you mentioned criminal referral do you believe obviously the January 6 committee is issuing subpoenas finding out information following the money in your opinion is there enough evidence out there is there enough information out there for Merrick Garland in the Justice Department to be doing its own investigation you know I can stay quite separate apart from what we're doing and the evidence that we revealed in this we're pleading that the tape recorded conversation for example of Donald Trump on the phone with the Secretary of State in Georgia trying to get the Secretary of State to find 11 780 votes that didn't exist but the exact number he would need to overtake Biden's lead I think that tape recorded conversation would have most people under investigation uh and the former president should be treated no differently so I do think there's evidence that departments should be investigating I am concerned that I don't see that happening but it's a different question about whether our committee will ultimately make a criminal referral we haven't made a decision on that and we will probably make that decision when we conclude our investigation I want to move now to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and during President Biden's State of the Union Address he put out a tweet and you said tonight against the backdrop of Putin's invasion of Ukraine President Biden sent equivocal message America stands with Ukraine and with democracies around the world we will not Bend or break in the face of an authoritarian bully there is simply too much at stake daily it seems like we're seeing more sanctions levied against Vladimir Putin and the oligarchs but it really doesn't seem to be phasing him right now is there more that we could be doing well first of all I think that the sanctions are far more brutal uh brutal than what Putin was expecting I don't think he thought Europe would cohese together the way that it has behind you know some really crippling sanctions that will um and I have already caused the ruble to crash so I think that's been a bitter shot for him uh will we do more uh I think we will and every day it seems that we're imposing new sanctions these sanctions were not going to stop him from doing what he's doing immediately but over time they're going to take a real toll on the Russian economy and the Russian people I think will come to see the Folly of what their leader is doing so they're very important steps to put the squeeze on Putin we don't want to send American soldiers into Ukraine to fight the Russians but this is a way that we can make this really costly in addition to economic uh sanctions we're also providing military supports Ukraine and a lot of Russians are already going home in body bags so the sooner this conflict ends the better for all concern all concerned

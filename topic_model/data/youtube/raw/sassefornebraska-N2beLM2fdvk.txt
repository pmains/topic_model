and so we are the most exceptional nation in the history of the world because the Constitution is the best political document that's ever been written and it is a negative document the Constitution is just a list of powers that we decided to give the government and when that list ends the government has no further powers the Constitution is not some list of the limited rights that the people have because in our system the government is limited and the people's rights are limitless and the founders back in Philadelphia in 1787 and 1789 they had a big long debate about this and they said well this is tough because people are always used to having the rights listed shouldn't we list them and they said no we will not list them we will not put the rights in the document because if we put the rights in the document at some point the list will end and people will assume that is the end of their rights and so there was a picture that they had in their mind imagine a tiny little island surrounded by a giant ocean throughout human history people have believed that the island is your rights and the ocean is the powers of government and the American founders said this pictures exactly backwards because the island is the little set of enumerated powers that we the people give the government and the ocean is the limitless rights of people who were created with dignity and yet they said wait a minute if we don't list them at all might people get confused let's list a few and so as a compromise they said well outside the document let's add the Bill of Rights so think about this the first ten amendments are not in the Constitution proper the Constitution is just enumerated powers for the government but then in the Bill of Rights they said let's list a few rights just so no one's confused in fact we'll start with the most important one what will rank order them okay what should we list first let's this the most important thing what's listed first religion and speech and press and assembly and the right of redress of grievances it's a dog's breakfast it's a laundry list they couldn't list just one thing first because again they wanted to scream and the structure of their document screams all the rights are the people's and so that when you go through the Second Amendment near and dear to all of our hearts here when you get to the ninth and tenth Amendment what do they conclude by saying there's no end to this list the ninth and tenth Amendment say any rate not listed here is still a right for the people and any power not given to the federal government here is still a power that the federal government doesn't have

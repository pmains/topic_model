POLICY OF JANUARY 6, 2015, THE   GENTLEMAN FROM ARKANSAS, MR.   WESTERMAN IS RECOGNIZED FOR 60   MINUTES AS THE DESIGNEE OF THE   MAJORITY LEADER. MR. WESTERMAN: BEFORE I BEGIN, I ASK THAT ALL MEMBERS HAVE FIVE   LEGISLATIVE DAYS TO REVISE AND   EXTEND THEIR REMARKS AND INCLUDE EXTRANEOUS MATERIAL ON THE   SUBJECT OF THIS SPECIAL ORDER. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: WITHOUT OBJECTION. MR. WESTERMAN: THANK YOU, MR.  SPEAKER. MR. SPEAKER, I WAS TRAINED AS AN ENGINEER.  AND IN MY ENGINEERING TRAINING,  WE WERE TAUGHT THAT BEFORE YOU   CAN SOLVE A PROBLEM, YOU HAVE TO IDENTIFY AND DEFINE THE PROBLEM. IF YOU SOLVE THE WRONG PROBLEM,  YOU ACCOMPLISH VERY LITTLE.  I SERVE ON THE BUDGET COMMITTEE  AND ON THE BUDGET COMMITTEE, WE  TAKE AN IN DEPTH LOOK AT ALL OF  GOVERNMENT.  AND AS WE EXAMINE THE PROGRAMS   AND AS WE EXAMINE REVENUES AND   EXPENDITURES OF THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT, WE SEE MANY ISSUES   THAT ARE OF GREAT CONCERN TO THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY. WE SEE THREATS TO OUR SAFETY AND SECURITY.  WE SEE HASSLES CREATED BY THE  VERY GOVERNMENT THAT'S HERE TO   SERVE. BUT MR. SPEAKER, THERE'S A GARR  GANT YUAN ISSUE FACING OUR   COUNTRY THAT THREATENS ALL OUR   FUTURES. OUR GROSS NATIONAL DEBT, FUELED  BY -- FUELED BY OUT OF CONTROL   SPENDING, CONTINUES TO GROW AND  HAS PASSED $19 TRILLION WHICH  EXCEEDS OUR GROSS DOMESTIC   PRODUCT. TODAY, WHILE MUCH OF THE COUNTRY FOCUSES ON PRIMARY ELECTIONS,  SEVERAL OF MY COLLEAGUES FROM  THE BUDGET COMMITTEE, INCLUDING  CHAIRMAN PRICE, WISH TO HAVE AN  OPEN AND HONEST CONVERSATION   ABOUT THIS ISSUE OF DEBT AND   SPENDING THAT YOU'RE PROBABLY  NOT GOING TO HEAR MUCH ABOUT   ANYWHERE ELSE. WE NOT ONLY HOPE TO BRING  ATTENTION TO THIS ISSUE BY   DEFINING THE PROBLEM, WE WILL  PROPOSE REAL SOLUTIONS TO  RESTORE FISCAL ORDER SO THAT   AMERICANS CAN THRIVE AND   AMERICANS, NOT THE GOVERNMENT OR ANY ONE PERSON, BUT AMERICANS  CAN MAKE AMERICA ALL THAT SHE  CAN BE.  AS WE DELVE INTO THE MAJOR   FISCAL ISSUES FACING OUR   COUNTRY, IT BECOMES OBVIOUS THAT WE HAVE AN ENORMOUS SPENDING   PROBLEM. I HAVE A CHART HERE AND THIS   CHART SHOWS US WHERE WE'VE BEEN, WHERE WE WERE IN 1965. IT SHOWS WHERE WE ARE TODAY WITH THE NUMBERS THROUGH 2015.  AND IT ALSO PREDICTS WHERE WE  WILL BE IN THE FUTURE IN 2026. THE SPENDING REPRESENTED BY THE  RED ON THESE PIE CHARTS IS WHAT  IS CALLED MANDATORY SPENDING.  IF YOU WANT TO THINK OF IT THIS  WAY THIS SPENDING IS ON CRUISE   CONTROL. THIS SPENDING ON -- IT'S   SPENDING ON PROGRAMS PUT IN  PLACE BY PREVIOUS CONGRESSES.  REALY IF WE DIDN'T EVEN MEET   ANYMORE, SPENDING IN THE RED   WOULD CONTINUE TO GO ON. THE SPENDING IN THE BLUE IS THE  DISCRETIONARY SPENDING.  THAT'S THE MONEY THAT IS SPENT   BY APPROPRIATIONS THAT ARE DONE  IN CONGRESS EVERY YEAR.  THE 12 APPROPRIATION BILLS THAT  WE HOPE TO GET BACK TO REGULAR   ORDER THIS YEAR AND PASS EACH OF THOSE 12 BILLS OUT OF THE HOUSE  AND OUT OF THE SENATE AND PUT  THEM ON THE PRESIDENT'S DESK,  THOSE BILLS RELATE TO THE  SPENDING THAT IS HIGHLIGHTED IN  BLUE ON THESE PIE CHARTS.  THE OMNIBUS BILL FROM LAST YEAR. THAT AFFECTED WHAT'S IN THE  BLUE.  IT DIDN'T AFFECT WHAT'S IN THE   RED. AS YOU LOOK AT THESE CHARTS, YOU CAN SEE THAT IN 50 YEARS, WE'VE  HAD A LITTLE BIT OF A FLIP-FLOP. IN 1965, WE WERE RIGHT AT 2/3 OF OUR SPENDING WAS DISCRETIONARY,  WHICH WAS CONTROLLED BY THE  APPROPRIATION PROCESS. AND RIGHT AROUND ONE THIRD OF  OUR SPENDING WAS MANDATORY.  BUT OVER THAT 50 YEAR PERIOD,  WE'VE SEEN TREMENDOUS GROWTH IN  SPENDING.  WE'VE SEEN THAT NOW, OVER 2/3 OF OUR SPENDING IS MANDATORY, AND   LESS THAN ONE THIRD OF OUR   SPENDING IS DISCRETIONARY. SO WHEN CONGRESS MEETS AND WE  DEBATE THESE APPROPRIATION BILLS , WE'RE ONLY DEBATING ABOUT ONE  THIRD OF THE SPENDING THAT TAKES PLACE BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THE THE REAL STORY IS WHAT'S   PROJECTED TO HAPPEN IN 2026,   JUST 10 YEARS INTEREST NOW.  OVER 50 YEARS, WE SAW $17.   TRILLION OF INCREASED SPENDING   -- $17.8 TRILLION OF INCREASED   SPENDING IN OUR GROSS DEBT.  THAT'S $356 BILLION A YEAR.  BUT IN JUST 10 SHORT YEARS FROM  TODAY, THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET  OFFICE PROJECTS THAT OUR GROSS   DEBT WILL BE $29.3 TRILLION. THAT WILL BE A GROWTH OF OVER  $11.2 TRILLION IN A 10-YEAR  PERIOD.  THAT'S OVER $1 TRILLION PER YEAR THAT WE WILL SEE IN SPENDING   GROWTH BETWEEN NOW AND 2026, IF  WE STAY ON THE PATH THAT WE'RE   CURRENTLY ON.  MR. SPEAKER, I HOPE TO EXPLAIN   TODAY WHY WE CAN'T STAY ON THIS  PATH AND THERE'S A LOT OF ISSUES TO LOOK AT.  AND MY COLLEAGUES ON THE BUDGET  COMMITTEE WILL LOOK AT THE PATH  THAT WE'RE ON AND THEY'LL LOOK   AT DIFFERENT AREAS OF THIS   SPENDING AND WE WILL PROVIDE   SOLUTIONS TO HOW TO AVOID THE  FUTURE FINANCIAL CRISIS THAT'S   ONLY GETTING WORSE.  WE'RE ALREADY IN A FINANCIAL   CRISIS.  WHEN WE LOOK AT WHAT CONTRIBUTES TO OUR NATIONAL DEBT, TO OUR   GROSS DEBT, $645 BILLION THIS  YEAR WILL GO TO DEBT, ALL  BECAUSE OF MANDATORY SPENDING. OUR NATIONAL DEBT, OUR GROSS   DEBT, WILL INCREASE TO $1.1  TRILLION OR $1.1 TRILLION MORE   TO ABOUT $19.3 TRILLION THIS   FISCAL YEAR. ONLY PART OF THAT CAN BE   CONTROLLED THROUGH DISCRETIONARY SPENDING.  WE HAVE TO START ADDRESSING THE  ISSUES WITH MANDATORY SPENDING.  IF WE TRULY WANT TO ADDRESS THE  FISCAL CONDITION OF OUR COUNTRY. THIS NEXT SLIDE BREAKS IT DOWN   IN A LITTLE MORE DETAIL. REMEMBER, RED IS MANDATORY   SPENDING AND BLUE IS   DISCRETIONARY SPENDING.  WE SEE THAT UNDER THE  DISCRETIONARY SPENDING, THE PART THAT WE DEBATE SO VIGOROUSLY IN  THIS CHAMBER, THE PART THAT  MAKES ALL THE HEADLINES, MOST OF THAT OR ABOUT HALF OF THAT IS IN DEFENSE AND THEN THE REST OF   IT'S NONDEFENSE DISCRETIONARY  SPENDING.  THERE ARE FIVE AREAS, JUST FIVE  AREAS, THAT OVER 2/3 OF  EVERYTHING SPENT IN THIS COUNTRY GO TO. AND AS WE SAW IN THE PREVIOUS  CHART, BY 2026, THOSE FIVE AREAS WILL MAKE UP OVER 3/4, WILL MAKE UP 78% OF EVERY DOLLAR SPENT BY  THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.  THOSE FIVE AREAS ARE SOCIAL  SECURITY, MEDICARE, MEDICAID,  INTEREST ON THE DEBT AND, KIND   OF A LUMP CATEGORY OF OTHER  MANDATORY SPENDING.  RIGHT NOW SOCIAL SECURITY IS THE LARGEST EXPENDITURE OF THE   FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.  AT $882 BILLION PER YEAR.  IF WE LOOK AT SOCIAL SECURITY  AND MEDICARE, THESE ARE PROGRAMS THAT WORKING AMERICANS HAVE  INVESTED IN THAT ARE VERY  IMPORTANT BUT ARE HEADED TO  INSOLVENCY.  WE HAVE TO FIX THEM TO PRESERVE  THEM FOR ALL OF US WHO HAVE  CONTRIBUTED TO THEM. THE PEOPLE WHO PROJECT THE   NUMBERS SHOW THAT BY 2030, ON  THE COURSE WE'RE ON, MEDICARE  WILL BE INSOLVENT. BY 2034, SOCIAL SECURITY WILL BE INSOLVENT. MR. SPEAKER, THE YOUNG PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY SHOULD BE ALARMED AT THIS.  BY 2034 AND 2030RK THESE   PROGRAMS THAT WE'VE -- 2030,   THESE PROGRAMS THAT WE'VE ALL  CONTRIBUTED TO, IF WE DON'T  CHANGE COURSE, THEY'RE PROJECTED TO BE INSOLVENT. IF WE LOOK AT MEDICAID, IT GREW  BY DOUBLE-DIGIT PERCENTAGE   POINTS LAST YEAR.  A LOT OF THAT BECAUSE OF THE   AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. IF WE LOOK AT OTHER MANDATORY  SPENDING, THESE ARE OUR SOCIAL   WELFARE PROGRAMS, THESE WERE   PROGRAMS THAT WERE PUT IN PLACE  WITH GOOD INTENTIONS, BUT ARE  GETTING POOR RESULTS.  AND FINALLY, THE ONE THAT  PROBABLY SHOULD CONCERN US ALL   THE MOST IS OUR INTEREST ON THE  DEBT.  THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE  TELLS US THAT BY 2025, IF WE   DON'T CHANGE COURSE, INTEREST ON THE DEBT WILL BE A LARGER  EXPENDITURE THAN SOCIAL SECURITY .  AS OUR DEBT CONTINUES TO BALLOON AND GROW, THE INTEREST THAT WE   MUST PAY ON THAT DEBT WILL ALSO  BALLOON AND GROW AND THAT'S WHY  MANDATORY SPENDING WILL BECOME   SUCH A LARGE PART OF ALL THE   SPENDING AND REALLY MAKE OUR   DISCRETIONARY SPENDING SOMEWHAT  MINISCULE COMPARED TO THE SIZE   OF MANDATORY SPENDING. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT JUST A  COUPLE OF THESE AREAS. SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES WILL TALK  ABOUT OTHER AREAS AS WE MOVE   FORWARD. BUT IF WE LOOK AT SOME OF OUR  SOCIAL WELFARE PROGRAMS AND OUR  MEDICAID PROGRAM, AGAIN, THESE   PROGRAMS WERE PUT IN PLACE FOR   PEOPLE WHO WERE TRULY IN NEED,   THEY WERE PUT IN PLACE FOR A   HAND-UP INSTEAD OF A HAND-OUT. BUT OFTENTIMES THEY'VE BECOME  JUST THE OPPOSITE OF THAT. SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS, INSTEAD  OF HELPING PEOPLE OUT OF   POVERTY, THEY TRAP PEOPLE IN   POVERTY. MEDICAID IS A UNIQUE ISSUE   BECAUSE IT WAS PUT IN PLACE FOR  AGED PEOPLE, FOR DISABLED  PEOPLE, FOR BLIND PEOPLE.  PEOPLE THAT WE WOULD ALL AGREE   WE NEED TO HELP OUT AND LEND A   HELPING HAND.  BUT NOW THERE ARE A LOT OF   ABLE-BODIED WORKING-AGE ADULTS,  THESE ARE PEOPLE 18 TO 65 YEARS  OLD WHO ARE NOT DISABLED, WHO  ARE RECEIVING MEDICAID BENEFITS. AND WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF  INCREASE IN COST THERE.  WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF INCREASE   IN COST IN MANDATORY PROGRAMS OR SOCIAL WELFARE PROGRAMS SUCH AS  SNAP.  AND ONE AREA WHERE WE CAN  ADDRESS OUR BUDGET, WHERE WE CAN ADDRESS THIS LOOMING FISCAL  CRISIS, IS IN OUR SOCIAL WELFARE PROGRAMS.  LET'S LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENED  JUST IN THE SNAP PROGRAM.  SINCE 2000, INCREASE ENROLLMENT  IN SNAP PROGRAMS HAS GROWN 171%. TO SAY THAT ANOTHER WAY, FOR   EVERY NEW JOB ADDED SINCE 2000,  AND THAT'S 4 DWP 3 MILLION OF  THEM -- 4.3 MILLION OF THEM,   30.4 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE BEEN  ADDED TO FOOD STAMPS.  THAT'S SEVEN PEOPLE BEING ADDED  TO THE FOOD STAMP PROGRAM FOR  EVERY NEW JOB THAT'S BEING   CREATED IN THIS COUNTRY --   THAT'S BEEN CREATED IN THIS  COUNTRY SINCE 2000.  INSTEAD OF LIFTING PEOPLE OUT OF POVERTY, MANY OF OUR WELFARE   PROGRAMS ARE TRAPPING PEOPLE IN  POVERTY. IF WE LOOK AT SOME OF THE  NUMBERS ON SNAP, 57% OF  ABLE-BODIED ADULT HOUSEHOLDS   HAVE NO EARNED INCOME. THESE ARE PEOPLE RECEIVING FOOD  STAMP -- THE FOOD STAMP BENEFITS .  WHAT'S EVEN MAYBE MORE ALARMING  IS 75% OF THE PEOPLE RECEIVING   SNAP BENEFITS, 75% OF CHILDLESS  ADULT HOUSEHOLDS HAVE NO EARNED  INCOME.  THAT'S 17.3 MILLION PEOPLE,  THAT'S A 252% INCREASE SINCE   2000 IN THIS ONE DEMOGRAPHIC OF  CHILDLESS ADULT HOUSEHOLDS WHO   HAVE ZERO INCOME, WHO ARE  RECEIVING SNAP BENEFITS. ONLY 50% OF PARENT HOUSEHOLDS  HAVE EARNED INCOME.  SO, WHAT HAPPENS?  WHAT HAPPENS IF WE CHANGE THE  SCENARIO?  WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU MOVE   PEOPLE FROM WELFARE TO WORK? KANSAS TRIED A PROGRAM.  THEY TRIED A PROGRAM TO RESTORE  WORK REQUIREMENTS FOR  ABLE-BODIED CHILDLESS ADULTS IN  2013.  AND THEY SAW FANTASTIC RESULTS   FROM THAT. THEY SAW A 50% IMMEDIATE DECLINE IN ENROLLMENT WHEN THEY ENACTED  WORK REQUIREMENTS FOR  ABLE-BODIED WORKING-AGE ADULTS   ON THIS PROGRAM. THEY SAW A 68% LONG-TERM DECLINE IN ENROLLMENT AND THEY SAW A   168% INCREASE IN WORK  PARTICIPATION RATES AMONG THE  ENROLLEES. THEY SAW A 133% INCREASE IN  AVERAGE INCOME OF ABLE-BODIED  CHILDLESS ADULT ENROLLEES. THEY SAW A 55% INCREASE IN   AVERAGE INCOME OF ABLE-BODIED  CHILDLESS ADULT ENROLLEES. MR. SPEAKER, A NUMBER THAT WE  CAN'T EVER FORGET IS THAT ONLY   2.9% OF FULL-TIME WORKERS LIVE   IN POVERTY.  IF WE WANT TO PULL PEOPLE OUT OF POVERTY, WE NEED TO CREATE AN  ENVIRONMENT WHERE PEOPLE CAN   WORK, WHERE THEY CAN PULL  THEMSELVES OUT OF POVERTY. WE'VE ALSO FOUND THAT IN THESE   SOCIAL WELFARE PROGRAMS LIKE THE SNAP PROGRAM AND LIKE MEDICAID,  WHERE YOU'VE GOT ABLE-BODIED   WORKING-AGE ADULTS ON THOSE  PROGRAMS, THE POPULATIONS  OVERLAP. SO IF YOU ARE ABLE TO GET PEOPLE BACK INTO THE WORK FORCE AND   HELP THE SNAP PROGRAM, YOU'RE  ALSO GOING TO CUT COSTS OUT OF   THE MEDICAID PROGRAM.  YOU GET A DOUBLE BANG FOR YOUR   BUCK WHEN YOU GET PEOPLE BACK IN THE WORK FORCE.  WE NEED TO TRAIN PEOPLE, WE NEED TO ASSIST PEOPLE TO GET BACK TO  WORK.  THAT'S WHAT THESE PROGRAMS WERE  ORIGINALLY PUT IN PLACE FOR. AND WE'VE GOT TO GET BACK TO   THAT.  IT'S BEEN SAID MANY TIMES  BEFORE, BUT I THINK IT'S WORTH   REMINDING, THAT THE BEST SOCIAL  PROGRAM IS STILL A JOB.  AGAIN, ONLY 2.9% OF FULL-TIME  WORKERS LIVE IN POVERTY IN THIS  COUNTRY. IF WE IMPLEMENT WORK   REQUIREMENTS FOR PROGRAMS LIKE   SNAP, FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE   RECEIVING MEDICAID BENEFITS, WHO ARE ABLE-BODIED, WORKING-AGE   ADULTS, WE'RE NOT GOING TO PUT   THIS REQUIREMENT ON DISABLED   PEOPLE, WE'RE NOT GOING TO PUT   THIS REQUIREMENT ON ELDERLY  PEOPLE IN NURSING HOMES OR WHO   ARE DEPENDENT ON MEDICAID, WE'RE NOT GOING TO PUT IT ON CHILDREN  OR BLIND PEOPLE. THIS IS FOR ABLE-BODIED,   WORKING-AGE ADULTS.  WE CAN SAVE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS  IN THE MEDICAID PROGRAM BY DOING THIS.  WE CAN START TO ADDRESS THESE  FISCAL ISSUES WITH ONE SOLUTION, OF REQUIRING WORK FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE RECEIVING BENEFITS THAT WERE PUT IN PLACE TO HELP THEM GET  BACK TO WORK.  IT WORKED IN KANSAS, IT'S WORKED IN MAINE, IT'S WORKED IN OTHER   STATES, AND IT CAN WORK ALL  ACROSS OUR COUNTRY.  WITH THAT, MR. SPEAKER, I WOULD  LIKE TO YIELD TO THE VERY  CAPABLE AND WELL MEANING AND   WELL SERVING INDIVIDUAL FROM THE GREAT STATE OF VIRGINIA, MR.   BRAT.  MR. BRAT: THANK YOU VERY MUCH,   MR. WESTERMAN. I THANK THE CHAIR. I THANK THE GENTLEMAN FROM   ARKANSAS FOR YIELDING TIME AND   FORSETTING UP THIS SPECIAL   SESSION. IT IS THE MOST -- AND FOR  SETTING UP THIS SPECIAL SESSION. IT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT   ECONOMIC ISSUE OF OUR TIMES. I TAUGHT ECONOMICS FOR 20 YEARS  OR SO AND WENT TO SEMINARY   BEFORE THAT. I RAN ON BRINGING ECONOMICS AND  ETHICS TO CONGRESS.  AND THAT WAS USUALLY KIND OF A   JOKE IN THE STUMP SPEECH.  BUT MOST PEOPLE CATCH IT.  IT MATTERS.  LINKING ECONOMICS AND ETHICS   TOGETHER.  THERE'S NO BETTER ISSUE FROM   WHICH TO VIEW THIS CHALLENGE AS  THE ISSUE BEFORE US TODAY,   DEALING WITH THE MONUMENTAL  INCREASE IN MANDATORY SPENDING.  CONGRESS HAS BEEN MONUMENTALLY   IRRESPONSIBLE. PROMISES WERE MADE THAT CAN'T BE KEPT.  POLITICIANS SOLD OUT THE FUTURE  IN FAVOR OF IMMEDIATE  GRATIFICATION AND THAT FUTURE IS NOW. WE SEE HEADLINES EVERY DAY IN  THE NEWSPAPERS ABOUT PROMISING   MORE AND MAKING PROMISES AND NOT KEEPING THEM.  BUT TODAY THE EVIDENCE IS  OVERWHELMING.  THE MAJOR PROMISE THAT HAS BEEN  MADE THAT HAS NOT BEEN KEPT IS   BALANCING OUR BUDGET.  WE PROMISED PROGRAM AFTER  PROGRAM AFTER PROGRAM THAT WE  CANNOT PAY FOR, AND WE HAVE NOT  KEPT OUR WORD. AS WE WILL SHOW, THE FOLKS WHO   WILL PAY FOR THIS ARE THE ONLY   FOLKS WHO DON'T HAVE A LOBBYIST  IN THIS CITY AND THAT'S OUR  KIDS.  AND THE NEXT GENERATION. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS $19  TRILLION RIGHT NOW IN TOTAL  PUBLIC DEBT OUTSTANDING. DEBT PER CITIZEN CURRENTLY   STANDS AT $60,000. THAT IS SEPARATE FROM THE CHART  HERE.  I WILL GET TO THIS IN A MINUTE.  THE GAP BETWEEN FEDERAL REVENUE  AND FEDERAL SPENDING OVER THE  NEXT 75 YEARS IS ABOUT $118  TRILLION, ACCORDING TO HARVARD   ECONOMICS PROFESSOR, JEFFREY   MIREN. THAT NUMBER, $118 TRILLION, IS   ROUGHLY $368,000 PER PERSON IN   AMERICA TODAY. $400,000, IF YOU ROUND UP, PER   PERSON IN AMERICA TODAY. THE DEFICIT IS INCREASING AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN SEE.  TODAY IS SUPER TUESDAY AND MANY  PEOPLE FROM ACROSS THE NATION  ARE GOING TO THE POLLS AND THEY  ARE RIGHTLY UPSET WITH THE   FISCAL MISMANAGEMENT IN THIS   CITY OVER THE LAST COUPLE  DECADES. WHAT ARE THEY UPSET ABOUT? HERE'S A FEW NUMBERS.  THE DEFICIT IS INCREASING AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN SEE, IT'S $439  BILLION IN 2015, GOING UP $105   BILLION INCREASE TO $544 BILLION IN 2016. THAT'S JUST THE DEFICIT. THAT'S THE AMOUNT WE ADD TO THE  DEBT EACH AND EVERY YEAR.  BY  BY 2022, C.B.O., THE FOLKS WHO   FORECAST THE ECONOMIC FIGURERS   IN COUNTRY, THE AMOUNT WE ADD TO THE DEBT IN ONE YEAR WILL BE $1  TRILLION AND BY 2026 IT WILL BE  $1.3 TRILLION SYSTEM OF IN TOTAL I BY 2026, NOT THAT FAR OFF, 10  YEARS OFF, YOUR HIGH SCHOOL  FWRADGE WATTS RIGHT NOW WILL BE  28 YEARS OLD, THE DEBT WILL  REACH NEARLY $30 TRILLION. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HANDING TO THE NEXT GENERATION. WE'RE HAVING THE PIZZA PARTY AND WE'RE GOING TO GIVE THE NEXT   GENERATION THE TAB.  MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE DEBT, OR AT LEAST A BIGGER ECONOMIC   NUMBER, AUTO PILOT SPENDING IS   EXPLODING. THIS IS COMPLEX. NOT MANY FOLKS KNOW ABOUT THIS   ISSUE. MANY TERMS ARE LINKED, AUTOPILOT SPEND, ENTITLEMENT SPENDING,   MANDATORY SPENDING.  SOMETIMES THESE TERMS CAN BE   USED INTERCHANGEABLY, SOMETIMES  THEY CAN'T.  YOU'VE GOT TO GET DOWN IN THE  WEEDS AND WE WILL DO THAT TODAY. BUT IN GENERAL, AUTOPILOT  SPENDING GETS AT WHAT THE  GENTLEMAN JUST REFERRED TO   BEFORE I GOT UP, NET INTEREST  PAYMENTS, SOCIAL SECURITY  PAYMENTS, FEDERAL HEALTH   PROGRAMS, MEDICARE, MEDICAID,  OBAMACARE, FEDERAL CIVILIAN  MILITARY PENSIONS, AND WELFARE   PROGRAMS.  IN 1966, THESE MADE UP 33% OF  FEDERAL SPENDING, AND 5.6% OF  G.D.P., THE ECONOMY. IN 2027, THESE PROGRAMS WILL   MAKE UP 78% OF FEDERAL SPENDING, AND 18% OF G.D.P. AS CONGRESSMAN WESTERMAN'S GRAPH SHOWED.  THAT'S ASSUMING THAT WE WILL BE  ABLE TO BORROW IN THE FUTURE.  ANOTHER WAY TO LOOK AT AUTOPILOT SPENDING ON THE GRAPH RIGHT HERE IN 1966, AUTOPILOT SPENDING MADE UP 33.9% OF FEDERAL REVENUE. BUT BY 2027, IT WILL EAT UP 100% OF FEDERAL REVENUE.  SO YOU SEE, THE PAC-MAN HERE,  GETTING HUNGRIER BY THE MINUTE.  THE AUTOPILOT SPENDING, 34% IN   1966, 68% IN 2006, AND   AUTOPILOTS WILL CONSUME ALL  FEDERAL REVENUES IN 2027.  AGAIN, NOT THAT FAR OUT. AND AGAIN, YOU CAN GO TO C.B.O., THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE, AND THIS IS ONE OF THE PRIMARY   GRAPHS YOU'LL SEE IN THE FIRST   FEW PAGES AT THE CONGRESSIONAL   BUDGET OFFICE. SO IN RESTATEMENT, IN JUST 11  YEARS , IN 2027, ONE YEAR BEYOND THE 10-YEAR BUDGET WINDOW, THAT  MATTERS UP HERE, AUTOPILOT   PROGRAMS WILL CONSUME ALL  FEDERAL REVENUE INCOMING.  IF YOU'RE PAYING ATTENTION, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?  THAT MEANS THERE'LL BE ZERO  REVENUES LEFT FOR LAW  ENFORCEMENT, MEDICAL RESEARCH,   NATIONAL DEFENSE, EDUCATION,   TRANSPORTATION, OR EVEN  INTELLIGENCE.  THE GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE TO  BORROW 100% TO FINANCE ITSELF  STARTING IN 2027.  MORE AND MORE AUTOPILOT SPENDING WILL BE DEBT FINANCED AS WELL. IS THIS SUSTAINABLE? OUR FRIENDS ON THE OTHER SIDE  ARE ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT   ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY.  AND THAT'S A GREAT THING.  BUT WHAT ABOUT FINANCIAL   SUSTAINABILITY?  WHAT ABOUT THE SUSTAINABILITY OF OUR NATION?  WHAT ABOUT THE SUSTAINABILITY OF WESTERN CIV. FOR AN ANSWER TO THAT, YOU MAY   LOOK AT THE CRADLE OF WESTERN  CIV AND YOU CAN LOOK TO GREECE.  HOW IS GREECE DOING WHEN IT  COMES TO FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY?  WHAT HAPPENS TO YOUR COUNTRY   WHEN YOUR DEBT LOAD BECOMES TOO  HEAVY? SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS EMERGE AND  IT'S VERY HARD TO RETURN TO A  NORMAL FUNCTIONING ECONOMY.  THIS IS ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL TO  THE SUSTAINABILITY OF AMERICAN   CIVILIZATION.  IT IS CRITICAL WE ADDRESS THIS   PROBLEM FOR OUR CHILDREN'S SAKE. WE CANNOT DO THIS WITHOUT  REFORMING FEDERAL PROGRAMS AND   BOOSTING GROWTH BY CREATING  OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE TO  SUPPORT THEMSELVES.  WE NEED TO RESTORE CIVIL   SOCIETY. AFTER ALL, WE'RE NOT JUST  FISCALLY BANKRUPT. THIS GOVERNMENT ALSO HAS A   MORAL, ETHICAL, AND SPIRITUAL  DEFICIT. WHY IS THAT? HOW CAN YOU SEE THE ETHICAL  DEFICIT? MANY GOVERNMENT POLICIES WEAKEN  FAMILIES, AS CONGRESSMAN   WESTERMAN JUST SHOWED YOU  GRAPHICALLY. WE WEAKEN COMMUNITIES. CHURCHES AND OTHER FAITH   ORGANIZATIONS, CLUBS,  ASSOCIATIONS AND EVEN  BUSINESSES, SMALL STARTUPS ARE   NOT STARTING UP. THIS IS A TRAGEDY. THE ONLY HOPE FOR YOUNG KIDS IS  TO ENTER BUSINESS. THERE'S NO OTHER WAY TO MAKE   MONEY. AND WE'RE CAPPING THEIR FUTURES. THESE CRITICAL INSTITUTIONS JUST DON'T PROVIDE RESOURCES AND HELP OUR COMMUNITIES. THEY ALSO FOSTER RESPONSIBILITY. MUTUAL ACCOUNTABILITY. FELLOWSHIP AND A SENSE OF  PURPOSE IN OUR SOCIETY.  HOW DO YOU SEE THE ETHICAL   DEFICIT IN OTHER WAYS? IT'S PRETTY EASY TO SEE THE TWO  MAJOR PROGRAMS, THE TWO MAJOR  MANDATORY SPENDING PROGRAMS,   MEDICARE AND SOCIAL SECURITY,  WILL BOTH BE INSOLVENT IN 2034.  THAT'S ABOUT 18 YEARS OUT SYSTEM OF OUR 18-YEAR-OLDS WILL BE 36   YEARS OLD. THE MAJOR PROGRAMS THAT SENIORS  RELY ON TODAY WILL BE INSOLVENT  IN 2034 AND BY THE TIME OUR KIDS RETIRE, NOTHING IS CERTAIN.  THAT IS A DEFICIT IN ETHICS. IT'S INTERESTING THAT PRESIDENT  JOHNSON'S WAR ON POVERTY HASN'T  REALLY ELIMINATED POVERTY. AT LEAST AS THE GOVERNMENT   MEASURES IT. IT'S STRIKING THAT THE MASSIVE   INCREASE IN GOVERNMENT SPENDING  TRACKS MORE CLOSELY WITH FAMILY  BREAKDOWN AND OTHER CONCERNING   TRENDS.  BEFORE THE WAR ON POVERTY, AND   THIS IS FAIRLY WELL KNOWN,   BEFORE THE WAR ON POVERTY BEGAN  IN THE 1960'S, SELF-SUFFICIENCY  WAS GOING UP, UP, UP.  THE PERCENTAGE OF THOSE IN   POVERTY WAS GOING DOWN, DOWN,  DOWN, DOWN, DOWN.  AND THEN AFTER THE WAR ON  POVERTY BEGINS AND ALL THE   FEDERAL PROGRAMS GO, THAT LINE   FLATTENS OUT AND OUR PROGRESS ON SELF-SUFFICIENCY COMES TO AN   END. WE NEED TO EXPAND OPPORTUNITIES  FOR PRODUCTIVE WORK AND FIX  WELFARE SO EARNING INCOME ALWAYS MAKES PEOPLE BETTER OFF. NOW WE SPEND A HALF A TRILLION   DOLLARS ON WELFARE PROGRAMS AND  WHAT DO WE GET?  WE GET A FLAT LINE WITH NO   MEASURABLE PROGRESS TOWARD   SELF-SUFFICIENCY WHERE PEOPLE  CAN BE PROUD OF THEIR WORK   PRODUCT AND THE INCOMES THEY   BRING HOME AND THE PROGRESS OF   THEIR KIDS.  CONGRESS IS MANAGING TOO MANY  PROGRAMS AND STATES NEED THE   FLEXIBILITY SO THAT THEY CAN   TAKE ON THESE RESPONSIBILITIES.  THAT IS THE WAY OUR FOUNDERS   INTENDED THINGS TO BE SET UP.  ALL OF HUMAN HISTORY WAS RULED   FROM THE TOP DOWN. UNTIL ABOUT 1800.  ALL OF HUMAN HISTORY WAS ALSO  MARKED BY SUBSISTENCE LIVING.  FOR ALL OF HUMAN HISTORY, THE  AVERAGE PERSON MADE $500 PER   YEAR TO LIVE ON. WE NEED TO BREAK AWAY FROM THIS  TOP DOWN APPROACH BEFORE IT'S  TOO LATE.  THE FREE MARKET SYSTEM HAS   LIFTED US UP FROM $500 A YEAR,   CLOSER TO $50,000 PER PERSON PER YEAR.  MORE RECENTLY, THE CHINESE AND   INDIANS HAVE MOVED THEIR WAY OUT OF TOP-DOWN GOVERNMENT TOWARD  FREE MARKETS.  CHINESE INCOMES IN THE PAST 20   YEARS HAVE GONE FROM $1,000 A  YEAR TO $9,000 A YEAR. IF YOU ADD UP TOE CHINESE  POPULATION AND THE INDIAN  POPULATION, WE HAVE 2.5 BILLION  PEOPLE ON THIS PLANET THAT HAVE  SEEN THE MOST MASSIVE INCREASE   IN HUMAN WELFARE IMAGINABLE. THAT CAME ABOUT BECAUSE THEY GOT RID OF TOP DOWN, CENTRAL   GOVERNMENT PLANNING AND THEY   MOVED TOWARD THE FREE MARKET   SYSTEM.  THE FREE MARKET SYSTEM IS NOT  PERFECT BECAUSE HUMAN BEINGS ARE NOT PERFECT. BUT THERE IS NO DEBATE IN THE  EVIDENCE, IN THE ECONOMIC  TEXTBOOK, ABOUT ALL OF HUMAN   HISTORY VERSUS THE MOVE TOWARD   HUMAN FREEDOM. WE ALL KNOW THAT HUMAN FREEDOM   IS A GREAT VIRTUE AND SOMETHING  WE NEED TO AIM AT. EVEN MORE IMPORTANT IN THE   POLITICS THESE DAYS, ASK   YOURSELF THIS QUESTION.  DOES THIS CITY, DOES WASHINGTON, D.C., SERVE THE POWERFUL OR DOES WASHINGTON, D.C. TRULY SERVE THE POOR?  LOOK AT THE TOWERS GOING UP. LOOK AT THE CONSULTING CLASS.  LOOK AT THE SPECIAL INTERESTS. LOOK AT THE MILLIONS AND   MILLIONS OF $S THAT POUR INTO  THIS CITY. DOES THIS CITY SERVE THE   POWERFUL OR THE POOR?  TONIGHT IN ELECTIONS ACROSS THE  NATION, I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO  SEE A RESOUNDING ANSWER TO SOME  OF THESE QUESTIONS.  LET'S MOVE GOVERNMENT BACK TO  THE PEOPLE SO THAT WE CAN SOLVE  OUR SIGNIFICANT DEBT PROBLEMS,   OUR MANDATORY SPENDING PROBLEMS, AND SO THAT WE CAN GIVE OUR KIDS HOPE FOR THEIR OWN FUTURES.  THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MR.   CHAIRMAN.  THANK YOU, CONGRESSMAN WESTERMAN FOR THIS TIME. THANK YOU. MR. WESTERMAN: I THANK THE   GENTLEMAN FOR VIRGINIA FOR HIS   INSIGHTFUL INPUT, FOR HIS  TRAINING AND HIS EXPERTISE AND   THIS IS THE KIND OF EXPERTISE  THAT WE NEED TO RELY ON HERE IN  THIS BODY. NEXT, IS CONGRESSMAN -- AS   CONGRESSMAN BRAT TALKED ABOUT  THE STATES BEING THE LABORATORY  OF DEMOCRACY, I'M PLEASED TO   YIELD TO THE GENTLEMAN FROM  ALABAMA, MR. PALMER, WHO SPENT A CAREER WORKING WITH STATES ALL   ACROSS THIS COUNTRY AND MAY  POSSIBLY HAVE A BETTER   UNDERSTANDING OF MORE STATE  POLICY AND MORE REGIONS OF THE   COUNTRY THAN ANYBODY ELSE,   CERTAINLY THAN I KNOW. MR. PALMER: THANK YOU, MR.   SPEAKER. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK MY   COLLEAGUE FROM ARKANSAS FOR  PUTTING TOGETHER THIS SPECIAL  ORDER AND FOR THOSE EXCESSIVELY  KIND COMPLIMENTS.  THE BUDGET SHOULD PRESENT A  VISION TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE  AND IT SHOULD REFLECT HOW THE  AMERICAN PEOPLE APPROACH THEIR   OWN FINANCES.  AS OF LATE, WE SIMPLY HAVE NOT   GOVERNED ACCORDING TO THE  STANDARDS THAT THE AVERAGE   AMERICAN GOVERNS BY. WHILE WE HAVE REDUCED DEFICIT  SPENDING OVER THE LAST FEW YEAR  THE FACT IS, WE CONTINUE TO  SPEND MORE THAN WE TAKE IN,  ADDING MILLIONS -- BILLIONS MORE TO OUR BURGEONING DEBT.  THIS BUDGET PROVIDES US WITH AN  OPPORTUNITY TO NOT REPEAT THE  MISTAKES OF THE PAST.  DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS CAN  FIND COMMON GROUND AND GET OUR   FISCAL HOUSE IN ORDER. I WANT TO POINT OUT THREE  COMMONSENSE SOLUTIONS TO THE   FINANCIAL CRISIS THAT WE FACE. FIRST, WE CAN REFORM THE   MEDICARE PAYMENT SYSTEM. MEDICARE CURRENTLY USES MORE   THAN A DOZEN DIFFERENT PAYMENT   SYSTEMS TO SET PAYMENT RATES FOR THE MEDICAL ITEMS AND SERVICES   THE PROGRAM COVERS FOR   BENEFICIARIES. THE LOCATION WHERE SOMEONE   RECEIVES SERVICE DETERMINES  WHICH PAYMENT SYSTEM APPLIES.  REPUBLICANS AND THE PRESIDENT  BELIEVE THIS SHOULD BE   CORRECTED. ACCORDING TO THE PRESIDENT'S OWN BUDGET, A SITE-NEUTRAL SYSTEM  WOULD SAVE $10 BILLION OVER 10   YEARS. SECOND, THE GENERAL  ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE HAS  IDENTIFIED $125 BILLION IN   IMPROPER PAYMENTS MADE IN 2014.  THIS IS WHERE THE GOVERNMENT   SENDS A CHECK TO SOMEONE, NOT  ENTITLED TO IT.  THE G.A.O. ATTRIBUTES ABOUT 65%  OF THIS TO THREE PROGRAMS, TO  JUST THREE PROGRAMS. HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES  MEDICARE FEE FOR SERVICE,  MEDICAID, AND THE TREASURY'S   EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT.  JUST THREE PROGRAMS ACCOUNT FOR  ALMOST $81 BILLION PER YEAR IN   IMPROPER PAYMENTS. COMBINED, IF WE'RE AVERAGING   ABOUT $100 BILLION A YEAR IN   IMPROPER PAYMENTS OVER THIS  10-YEAR WINDOW WE ALWAYS TALK  ABOUT WITH THE BUDGET, THAT'S $1 TRILLION.  SOME OF THESE PAYMENTS ARE BEING SENT TO DEAD PEOPLE. CERTAINLY, NO ONE SHOULD BE  OPPOSED TO CORRECTING THIS   PROBLEM. THE G.A.O. POINTS OUT THAT   INTERAGENCY COMMUNICATION IS NOT AT ITS FINEST. BUT ALSO THAT THERE ARE MAJOR  ERRORS WITHIN THE SOCIAL   SECURITY ADMINISTRATION'S DEATH  DATA.  SOME FILES SHOW A PERSON'S DEATH PRECEDING THEIR RECORDED BIRTH   DATE.  OTHERS SHOW AGE OF DEATH BETWEEN 150 AND 195. ACCORDING TO THE GUINESS WORLD   BOOK OF RECORDS, IN THE MODERN   AGE, THE OLDEST PERSON WHO EVER  LIVED, LIVED TO THE AGE OF 122.  IF SOCIAL SECURITY'S RECORDS ARE CORRECT, THEY NEED TO INFORM THE GUINESS WORLD RECORDS THAT   SOMEONE OUTLIVED MS. JEANINE   LEWIS CALMET BY 73 YEARS.  IF WE CAN ELIMINATE THESE  ERRONEOUS PAMES BASE ON WHAT WAS PAID OUT IN 2014, THAT'S OVER $1 TRILLION IN 24 YEARS.  I THINK WE CAN AGREE THAT WOULD  BE A GREAT START TOWARD GETTING  OUR FISCAL HOUSE IN ORDER. FINALLY, MR. SPEAKER, I'M NOT AN ADVOCATE OF MORE TAXES BUT WE  CAN DO A BETTER JOB OF   COLLECTING THOSE THAT ARE  ACTUALLY DUE.  AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2014, THE  INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE'S TOTAL TAX DEBT INVENTORY WAS $380  BILLION. WHICH IS A 23% INCREASE SINCE  2009.  THIS IS $380 BILLION IN  UNCORRECTED TAXES. I THINK IT'S SAFE TO ASSUME THAT WE WOULD PREFER NOT TO HAVE OUR  HARD-EARNED DOLLARS TAKEN FROM   US, BUT I ALSO THINK IT'S SAFE   TO ASSUME THAT THE AVERAGE   PERSON WOULD BE DISGUSTED TO   HEAR THAT WHILE THEY'RE PAYING   TAXES, OTHERS ARE FAILING TO PAY THEIRS.  ONE OTHER THING WE COULD DO IS   IN THE AREA OF TAX REFORM, SINCE I'VE BROUGHT THAT UP, IS   CORPORATE INCOME TAX.  IT IS ESTIMATED THAT THERE'S   MORE THAN $2 TRILLION IN   REVENUES THAT ARE BEING HELD   OFFSHORE THAT COULD BE REPAY   TRAY IT -- REPATRIATED TO THIS   COUNTRY IF WE LOWERED OUR  CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE WHICH  COULD PROVIDE A FLOW OF REVENUE  TO HELP US ADDRESS OUR DEFICITS  AND PAY DOWN OUR BUDGET. ALL THIS IS TO SAY WE NEED TORE  MORE EFFICIENT IN COLLECTING   WHAT WE OWE AND SPENDING WHAT WE COLLECT. THE BUDGET PROCESS IS WHERE WE   CAN BEGIN TO GET OUR FISCAL  HOUSE IN ORDER.  JUST IN THESE EXAMPLES, THERE  ARE OVER $1 TRILLION IN SAVINGS  FROM ELIMINATING WASTE, FRAUD,   AND ABUSE AN MAKING SENSIBLE   REFORMS. NOT ONLY CAN WE BALANCE THE  BUDGET WITHOUT INCREASING  SPENDING, WE CAN HAVE A SURPLUS. LET'S WORK TOGETHER AND USE  THESE COMMONSENSE SPLUTIONS TO   RESTORE OUR FISCAL HOUSE.  I THANK YOU AND I YIELD BACK.  .  MR. WESTERLY: I'D LIKE TO THANK  THE GENTLEMAN FROM ALABAMA FOR   HIS --   MR. WESTERMAN: I'D LIKE TO THANK THE GENTLEMAN FROM ALABAMA FOR   HIS COMMEBLETS.  YOU HEARD FROM THREE FRESH --  COMMENTS.  YOU HEARD FROM THREE FRESHMEN  MEMBERS TODAY. NEXT I YIELD TOO MANY TO -- TIME TO MR. WOODALL FROM GEORGIA. MR. WOODALL: I THANK THE   GENTLEMAN FOR YIELDING.  I THANK HIM FOR HIS LEADERSHIP   ON THIS ISSUE. SAY WHAT YOU WANT TO ABOUT   FRESHMEN IN THIS INSTITUTION, I  WAS ELECTED WITH THE VICE  CHAIRMAN OF THE BUDGET COMMITTEE BACK IN 2010.  LARGEST FRESHMEN CLASS IN  HISTORY. IT CHANGED THIS PLACE. CHANGED THIS PLACE.  LARGEST CLASS IN REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS IN HISTORY.  YOU NEED NEW FACES AND NEW IDEAS AND WHAT YOU ALL HAVE DONE IN  TERMS OF BUDGET COMMITTEE WORK   HAS JUST BEEN -- HAS JUST BEEN   AMAZING. WHAT I HAVE HERE TO CONTRIBUTE   IS A CHART OF C.B.O.'S   PROJECTIONS OF G.D.P. GROWTH.  WE HAVE SOME OF OUR DEMOCRATIC   COLLEAGUES HERE ON THE FLOOR, I  JUST WANT TO SAY, AND HOPE FOLKS HOLD ME ACCOUNTABLE TO IT, WE  CAN'T CUT OUR WAY TO PROSPERITY. CUTTING OUR WAY INTO PROS TERT   ISN'T GOING IT HAPPEN --   PROSPERITY ISN'T GOING TO  HAPPEN.  YOU CUT BUDGETS BECAUSE THERE'S  BAD SPENDING.  YOU DON'T CUT BUDGETS BECAUSE  CUTTING IS AN END IN AND OF  ITSELF.  YOU CUT THINGS THAT ARE BAD. SO MUCH OF THE CHALLENGE WE HAVE BALANCING THIS BUDGET, WE'VE   DONE AMAZING THINGS IN TERMS OF  REDUCING WASTEFUL SPENDING IN  THE FIVE YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN IN THIS BODY. BUT THE ECONOMY KEEPS DECLINING. THE REGULATION NATION THAT IS  THE NEW UNITED STATES OF AMERICA , DRAINING PRODUCTIVITY. WHEN I ARRIVED THE C.B.O.  PROJECTED WE'D BE GROWING AT   ABOUT 3% A YEAR AS A NATION. THE NEXT YEAR THEY REVISED IT  DOWN TO 2.9%.  THE NEXT YEAR, $2.5%, THE NEXT   YEAR, $2.-- 2.5%, THE NEXT YEAR, 2.3%.  NOW 2.1% GROWTH. THAT LOOKS LIKE A DOWNWARD   TREND. BUT EVERY .1% OF ECONOMIC GROWTH THAT IS LOST TRANSLATES INTO   ABOUT 300 -- $300 BILLION OF   ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. PEOPLE DON'T HAVE JOBS, THEY   DON'T PAY TAXES. IF PEOPLE DON'T HAVE JOBS, THEY  CAN'T CONTRIBUTE TO THE SYSTEM.  IF PEOPLE CAN'T CONTRIBUTE TO  THE SYSTEM, REVENUES GO DOWN.  IF REVENUES GO DOWN, BUDGETS   DON'T BALANCE. WE'VE GOT A -- WE'VE GOT TO GROW OUR WAY OUT OF THIS. THAT'S A BIPARTISAN CHALLENGE. THERE'S NOT A MAN OR WOMAN IN  THIS ROOM THAT DOESN'T WANT TO   SEE MORE AMERICAN JOBS IN THIS   COUNTRY. NOT ONE. THERE'S NOT A MAN OR WOMAN IN  THIS ROOM THAT DOESN'T WANT TO   SEE OUR ENTREPRENEURS BE THE   MOST COMPETITIVE ON THE PLANET.  NOT ONE. THERE'S NOT A MAN OR WOMAN IN  THIS ROOM THAT DOESN'T BELIEVE   THAT AMERICA'S BEST DAYS ARE   STILL GOING TO BE TOMORROW.  WE CANNOT BALANCE BUDGETS BY   CUTTING DISCRETIONARY SPENDING.  IN FACT, IF WE ZEROED OUT  DISCRETIONARY SPENDING, ZEROED   OUT THE COURTS, ZEROED OUT THE   PARKS, ZEROED OUT THE MILITARY,  ZEROED OUT EVERYTHING,   ENVIRONMENT, EVERYTHING PEOPLE   THINK OF AS GOVERNMENT, AND WE   ONLY PAID OUR MEDICARE BILLS,  OUR MEDICAID BILLS, OUR INTEREST ON THE NATIONAL DEBT, OUR  MANDSTORY SPENDING PROGRAMS,   SOCIAL SECURITY PROGRAMS, THAT   WOULD CONSUME VIRTUALLY THE  ENTIRE REVENUE STREAM OF THE   UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.  WE'VE GOT TO GROW OUR WAY OUT OF THIS.  AND THAT'S A PARTNERSHIP ISSUE   THAT WE CAN DO TOGETHER. WHAT MR. WESTERMAN IS DOING WITH HIS LEADERSHIP ON THE BUDGET   PROVIDES THAT FOUNDATION.  IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU'RE   GOING, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET   THERE. WE'VE GOT TO HAVE FOLKS WHO ARE  PROVIDING THAT VISION OF WHERE   WE'RE GOING, THAT'S WHAT OUR   BUDGET IS. IT'S OUR ONE OPPORTUNITY AS A  CONGRESS TO COME TOGETHER AND  TALK ABOUT OUR COLLECTIVE  VISION.  NOT THE REPUBLICAN VISION, NOT   THE DEMOCRATIC VISION. OUR VISION.  AMERICA'S VISION.  UNLESS WE'RE LOOKING AT  UNEMPLOYMENT SLIDES, A DOWNWARD  SLOPE IS NOT OUR VISION. OUR VISION IS MORE GROWTH, MORE  JOBS, MORE ECONOMIC ACTIVITY.  AND THE KIND OF DISCIPLINED  BUDGET THAT MR. WESTERMAN'S  TALKING ABOUT TODAY WILL MAKE  ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD. I THANK HIM FOR HIS LEADERSHIP.  I THANK HIM FOR THE TIME.  IT'S A REAL HONOR TO SERVE WITH  HIM. I YIELD BACK.  MR. WESTERMAN: I THANK THE   GENTLEMAN FROM GEORGIA FOR HIS   COMMENTS.  THIS IS AN AMERICAN PROBLEM. IT'S NOT A REPUBLICAN PROBLEM OR A DEMOCRATIC PROBLEM.  IT'S A BIPARTISAN DEBT THAT WE   ALL CREATED. AND IT'S GOING TO TAKE   BIPARTISAN SOLUTIONS TO FIX THIS DEBT.  AT THIS TIME I WOULD LIKE TO   YIELD TO MR. BURGESS.  THE GENTLEMAN FROM TEXAS.  MR. BURGESS: MR. SPEAKER, I SEND TO THE DESK A PRIVILEGED REPORT  FROM THE COMMITTEE ON RULES FOR  FILING UNDER THE RULE. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE   CLERK WILL REPORT THE TITLE. THE CLERK: REPORT TO ACCOMPANY   HOUSE RESOLUTION 632, RESOLUTION PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF   THE BILL, H.R. 3716, TO AMEND  TITLE 19 OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY  ACT, TO REQUIRE STATES TO  PROVIDE TO THE SECRETARY OF  HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES  CERTAIN INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO PROVIDER TERMINATIONS AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES.  THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE:   REFERRED TO THE HOUSE CALENDAR   AND ORDERED PRINTED. THE GENTLEMAN FROM ARKANSAS IS   RECOGNIZED.  MR. WESTERMAN: MR. SPEAKER, AT   THIS TIME I WOULD LIKE TO YIELD  TO THE VICE CHAIR OF THE BUDGET  COMMITTEE FROM INDIANA, MR.  ROKITA.  MR. ROKITA: I THANK THE  GENTLEMAN. LET ME JUST SAY, ON THE RECORD,  MR. SPEAKER, THAT I GREATLY  APPRECIATE THE LEADERSHIP OF OUR NEWER MEMBERS ON THE BUDGET  COMMITTEE, ESPECIALLY THE MEMBER FROM ARKANSAS. I THINK PEOPLE OF ARKANSAS WERE  RIGHT TO SEND HIM TO CONGRESS. NOT ONLY DOES HE COME READY TO   IDENTIFY THE SPENDING PROBLEMS   THAT THIS COUNTRY HAS, BUT HE  COMES READY WITH SOLUTIONS TOO.  AND I THINK THAT IS IN ESSENCE,  MR. SPEAKER, THE DEFINITION OF   LEADERSHIP.  I THANK THE GENTLEMAN. I ALSO THANK THE GENTLEMAN FROM  GEORGIA WHO JUST SPOKE.  HE SPEAKS SO ELOQUENTLY ON SO  MANY SUBJECTS, MEMBER OF THE   RULES COMMITTEE. I'M ALSO VERY APPRECIATIVE OF  HIS CONTRIBUTION TO THE BUDGET   COMMITTEE. HE, OF COURSE, AS WE ALL ARE   TODAY AND ALMOST EVERY DAY,  UNFORTUNATELY, WAS TALKING ABOUT THE DEBT.  LET ME JUST PUT IT IN PICTURE  FORM.  THIS IS THE NEW RED MENACE, MR.  SPEAKER. LOOK AT THAT TRAJECTORY. IT GOES NEARLY VERTICAL. SO THE QUESTION IS, HOW DO YOU   TURN THAT BIG SHIP, THAT   TITANIC, IF YOU WILL, SO, NUMBER ONE, IT DOESN'T SINK THIS ENTIRE COUNTRY, AND NUMBER TWO, IT GETS ON A MORE MEANING -- MORE  MEANINGFUL, MORE PRODUCTIVE  COURSE, SO WE CAN CONTINUE TO BE THE WORLD'S BEST HOPE IN A 21ST  CENTURY WORLD? NOW, SOME, ESPECIALLY THOSE ON   THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE,   WILL IMMEDIATELY TURN TO THE   FACT THAT THERE ARE TWO WAYS TO  IN FACT SOLVE THIS PROBLEM.  ONE IS TO CONTROL SPENDING.  THE OTHER IS TO GROW REVENUE.  LET ME TALK ABOUT THE LATTER FOR JUST A SECOND. THE LATTER IS A FALSE CHOICE.  BECAUSE AT 10,000 PEOPLE A DAY   RETIRING INTO UNREFORMED SOCIAL  PROGRAMS, THAT TRAJECTORY WILL   NOT TURN AROUND, IT WILL NOT   PLATEAU, NO MATTER HOW MUCH  PROPERTY UCONN FISS KATE FROM  THE AMERICAN PEOPLE -- YOU   CONFISCATE FROM THE AMERICAN   PEOPLE, MR. SPEAKER, NO MATTER   HOW MUCH YOU TAKE IN THE FORM OF TAXES, WITH 10,000 A DAY --  10,000 PEOPLE A DAY RETIRING,  WILL YOU GET THAT TO GO DOWN.  LET'S LOOK AT THAT MORE CLOSELY. THIS IS WHAT THE FEDERAL   GOVERNMENT CONFISCATES FROM THE  AMERICAN PEOPLE TO RUN ITSELF. IN FISCAL YEAR 2015, IT WAS  $3.25 TRILLION.  REVENUE WE TOOK IN TO RUN THE  OPERATIONS OF JUST THE FEDERAL   GOVERNMENT.  MR. SPEAKER, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE KNOW WE DON'T HAVE A REVENUE   PROBLEM, WE HAVE A SPENDING  PROBLEM. THE QUESTION SHOULD BE, WHAT   CAN'T YOU DO, WHAT CAN'T YOU DO, MR. SPEAKER, WITH $3.25 TRILLION OF PROPERTY CONFISCATED? MORE REVENUE IS NOT THE ANSWER.  THANKFULLY THE MAJORITY HERE IN  THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES   DON'T THINK IT'S THE ANSWER  EITHER.  WE KNOW WE CAN DO BETTER.  WE KNOW WE HAVE TO DO BETTER FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WE KNOW WE HAVE TO CONTROL THE   SPENDING.  AND THAT'S WHY I'M VERY PROUD TO BE PART OF A COMMITTEE, THE  BUDGET COMMITTEE, AND PART OF A  NEW CREW THAT CAME STARTING IN   2011, THAT EVERY YEAR WE HAVE  PUT IN THE BUDGET A NARRATIVE. SOMETHING THAT WE DON'T LEGALLY  HAVE TO DO AS PART OF THE BUDGET PROCESS. BUT WE TOOK THE EXTRA STEP TO  PUT A NARRATIVE IN OUR BUDGET,   TO GIVE THE SOLUTIONS THAT ARE   NEEDED TO CORRECT THIS DEBT  PROBLEM. REFORMING MEDICARE.  REFORMING MEDICAID.  PUTTING US ON A TRACK THAT WILL  REDUCE THAT RED MENACE, THAT   WILL PLATEAU IT AND START  POINTING IT DOWNWARD OVER THE  NEXT GENERATION. WE TOOK THE POLITICAL RISK TO  HAVE THAT CONVERSATION WITH THE  AMERICAN PEOPLE AND WE'VE DONE   IT EVERY YEAR SINCE 2011.  SOME PEOPLE HAVE CALLED IT A   THIRD RAIL OF POLITICS.  TOUCH IT AND YOU'LL BE   POLITICALLY ELECTROCUTED.  WELL, WE TOUCHED IT, MR.   SPEAKER, AND WE TOUCHED THE NEXT YEAR AND THE NEXT YEAR AND THE   YEAR AFTER THAT. AND MY HOPE AND MY PLEDGE ON   THIS HOUSE FLOOR IS WE WILL  CONTINUE TO HAVE THAT  CONVERSATION WITH THE AMERICAN   PEOPLE.  BACKED UP WITH VOTES THAT SHOW   REALLY HOW TO SOLVE THIS   PROBLEM. WITH THAT, MR. SPEAKER, I WILL   REFER US TO THE SPENDING THAT  I'M TALKING ABOUT. THIS CHART WAS USED BEFORE BY  THE GENTLEMAN FROM ARKANSAS,   REFERRED TO -- I'LL REFER TO IT  AGAIN. HERE'S WHAT'S ON AUTO PILOT,   HERE'S WHAT'S -- HERE'S WHAT   NEEDS TO BE REFORMED.  IF YOU LOOK AT ONE PIECE OF THE  PIE THERE, MEDICAID, A SOLUTION  FOR THAT HAS BEEN IN OUR BUDGET  FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS. THE REMINDING TIME I HAVE, MR.   SPEAKER, I WANT TO TALK ABOUT  THAT SOLUTION. A STATE FLEXIBILITY GRANT. BLOCK GRANT, IF WILL YOU.  WE'VE HAD THAT IDEA IN OUR   BUDGET FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS,  IT'S THE IDEA THAT WE IN THE   FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, WE'RE GOING  TO GET OUT OF THE BUSINESS OF  MEDICAID.  WE'RE GOING TO GET OUT OF THE  BUSINESS OF DECIDING WHO IS POOR IN TERMS OF HEALTH CARE, WHAT  THE POOR NEED IN TERMS OF HEALTH CARE, OR HOW THE POOR GET IT.  THAT HEALTH CARE SERVICE.  AND WE'RE GOING TO GET IT TO THE STATES.  TO INDIVIDUALS, TO LOCALLY   ELECTED OFFICIALS, PEOPLE WHO  KNOW THEIR COMMUNITIES BETTER IN FACT THAN ANY FEDERAL BUREAUCRAT DOES.  PEOPLE WHO CAN DETERMINE, GIVEN  A FINITE AMOUNT OF MONEY FROM  US, THEIR MONEY BACK IN FACT,  WHAT THE POOR NEED.  WHO THE POOR REALLY ARE. WHO THE DISABLED REALLY ARE. WHAT THEY SHOULD GET IN TERMS OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES.  AND HOW THEY SHOULD GET IT.  AND MAYBE, LIKE THE GENTLEMAN  FROM ARKANSAS ALLUDED TO   EARLIER, MAYBE THERE OUGHT TO BE A WORK REQUIREMENT FOR THE   ABLE-BODIED ONES OF THEM.  MAYBE THERE OUGHT TO BE OTHER  CONDITIONS.  BUT LET THE STATES DECIDE WHAT   THAT WOULD BE. PRESSURED IN A GOOD WAY BY THE   FACT THAT THERE WOULD ONLY BE A  FINITE AMOUNT OF MONEY COMING  FROM OUR BUDGET, THAT WOULD  ALLOW US TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT  WE'RE IN FOR AS A FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT, EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE   GIVING OUT AND NOT A CENT MORE,  AND WOULD NATURALLY INCENTIVIZE  THE STATES TO INNOVATE, TO COME  UP WITH BETTER WAYS TO SERVE US, TO COME UP TO SERVE THOSE WHO  REALLY NEED HEALTH CARE, WHO   CAN'T GET IT ANY OTHER WAY.  AND THOSE THAT IN FACT ARE   GAMING THE SYSTEM WILL BE  NATURALLY FORCED OFF.  THE STATES ARE IN THE BEST   POSITION TO PROVIDE THAT, WHEN   THEY'RE PROPERLY INCENTIVIZED  WITH A FINITE. A MONEY THAT DOESN'T GROW OVER   TIME -- AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT   DOESN'T GROW OVER TIME.  YOUR REPUBLICAN BUDGET FOR THE   LAST FIVE YEARS, THE ONE THAT'S  PASSED THIS HOUSE OF   REPRESENTATIVES, HAS DONE THAT   VERY THING.  WE ARE ON THE RIGHT TRACK, WE  NEED TO CONTINUE THESE VOTES, WE NEED CONTINUE TO HAVE A BUDGET,  WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO HAVE  STAND-ALONE VOTES ON THESE   REFORMS TO TAKE THIS ISSUE TO  THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. ESPECIALLY IN A PRESIDENTIAL   ELECTION YEAR, WHEN FRANKLY THE  CANDIDATES, I HAVEN'T SEEN THEM  TALK ENOUGH ABOUT WHAT IS REALLY ON THE PEOPLE'S MIND, AND THAT   IS HOW THEY'RE GOING TO LEAVE  THEIR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN WITH A BETTER LIFE THAN THEY   HAVE.  WHEN WE ARE KNOWINGLY SADDLED  WITH $19 TRILLION IN DEBT. A VERY HARD THING TO DO. IN FACT, I THINK THIS IS THE   FIRST GENERATION IN AMERICAN   HISTORY, MR. SPEAKER, THAT IS  GOING TO -- THAT IS POISED TO  LEAVE THE NEXT GENERATION WORSE  OFF. I REFUSE TO LET THAT HAPPEN ON   THIS BUDGET COMMITTEE'S WATCH. AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY. THAT'S WHY WE'RE PROVIDING THE   LEADERSHIP.  I THANK THE GENTLEMAN VERY MUCH. I YIELD BACK TO THE GENTLEMAN. I THANK HIM FOR HIS LEADERSHIP.  MR. WESTERMAN: I THANK THE   GENTLEMAN FROM INDIANA FOR HIS   REMARK.  I THANK HIM ALSO FOR HIS   LEADERSHIP ON THE BUDGET   COMMITTEE. I THANK HIM FOR HIS PASSION TO   SEE A BETTER FUTURE FOR OUR KIDS AND FOUR OR -- AND FOR OUR   GRANDCHILDREN. MR. SPEAKER, HAVING SERVED IN A  STATE LEGISLATURE BEFORE COMING  TO CONGRESS, I SERVED IN ONE   WHERE WE HAD TO BALANCE OUR  BUDGET AND OUR STATE   LEGISLATURE, OUR SINGLE LARGEST  EXPENDITURE WAS BY FAR MEDICAID. MEDICAID EXCEEDED ALL THE MONEY  THAT WE SPENT ON PUBLIC  EDUCATION, HIGHER EDUCATION AND  THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS  COMBINED.  WE SPENT MORE MONEY ON THIS ONE  FEDERAL-STATE PROGRAM THAN WE  SPENT ON ALL OF EDUCATION, THAN  WE SPENT ON OUR PRISON PROGRAMS. MR. SPEAKER, THERE'S AN INVERSE  INCENTIVE FOR STATES TO BE GOOD  STEWARDS OF MEDICAID MONEY.  IN MY STATE, WE RECEIVED $2.37   OF FEDERAL MONEY FOR EVERY $1 OF STATE MONEY THAT WE SPENT. WHAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM INDIANA   IS TALKING ABOUT IS GIVING   STATES INCENTIVES TO MANAGE  THESE PROGRAMS.  IF THE STATES HAD INCENTIVES TO  MANAGE THE PROGRAMS IN A BETTER  WAY RIGHT NOW, THEIR HANDS WOULD BE TIED BY C.M.S., THE FEDERAL   GOVERNMENT WON'T ALLOW THE   STATES TO CREATE PROGRAMS AND  MANAGE THEIR MEDICAID POPULATION THE WAY THAT THE STATES COULD IF THEY HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO   THAT.  IF WE GIVE THESE LABORATORIES OF DEMOCRACY ACROSS THE COUNTRY THE ABILITY TO INNOVATE, THE ABILITY TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE  THAT THEY SERVE, THEN THEY WILL  DO THAT. GOVERNMENT HAS ALWAYS BEEN MOST  EFFECTIVE WHEN IT'S CLOSEST TO   THE PEOPLE.  I SERVED ON A SCHOOL BOARD, I  KNOW THAT I HAD A LOT MORE   INTERACTION WITH MY CONSTITUENTS ON THE SCHOOL BOARD BECAUSE I  LIVED IN THE SAME COMMUNITY WITH THEM, THAN I DID AS A STATE  LEGISLATURE OR EVEN AS I DO AS A MEMBER OF CONGRESS.  . WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO GIVE   STATES MORE FLEXIBILITY AND LET  THEM INNOVATE AND LEGALITY THEM  LEARN FROM ONE ANOTHER, TO USE   IDEAS THAT WORK ONE PLACE AND  ADAPT IN ANOTHER PLACE.  THAT'S HOW WE BRING FISCAL   STABILITY TO OUR FEDERAL BUDGET  BY ALLOWING STATES TO MANAGE   THEIR STATES' BUDGETS BETTER.  AS WE LOOK AT THESE MANDATORY  SPENDING PROGRAMS, AS THE  GENTLEMAN FROM INDIANA   MENTIONED, A LARGE PART OF THE   MANDATORY SPENDING, NEARLY HALF  OF IT, IS ALL ASSOCIATED WITH  HEALTH CARE. THAT'S MEDICARE, WHICH IS $634   BILLION IN 2015, MEDICAID, $315  BILLION IN 2015 AND OTHER  PROGRAMS THAT MAKE UP ABOUT $47  BILLION. THOSE COMBINED ARE GREATER THAN  THE ONE LARGEST SINGLE   EXPENDITURE WHICH IS SOCIAL  SECURITY WHICH WE OBVIOUSLY NEED TO REFORM, NOT TO PUNISH PEOPLE  BUT MAKE IT SUSTAINABLE AND MAKE IT LAST FOR THOSE WHO NEED THE   PROGRAM, MAKE IT LAST FOR ALL  AMERICANS THAT INVESTED IN THAT  PROGRAM. SAME THING FOR MEDICARE. IF WE REFUSE TO MAKE CHANGES AND CONTINUE TO LET THE STATUS QUO   BE THE CURRENT REALITY, THEN WE  WILL SEE ALL OF THESE PROGRAMS   SHRINK AND BECOME INSOLVENT OVER TIME.  AND AT THE SAME TIME, WE WILL  SEE OUR FEDERAL DEBT CONTINUE TO BLOOM. WE'LL SEE THE AMOUNT OF INTEREST THAT WE PAY ON THE DEBT CONTINUE TO GROW. NOW'S THE TIME FOR US TO TAKE  ACTION, NOW'S THE TIME FOR US TO PRODUCE A BUDGET BUT TO ENACT  THAT BUDGET AND FOLLOW THAT  BUDGET.  I WOULD LIKE TO THANK ALL THE  MEMBERS OF THE BUDGET COMMITTEE  WHO SPOKE ON THESE ISSUES TODAY. WE WILL BE SPEAKING ON THEM MORE AS WE MOVE FORWARD.  AND WITH THAT, MR. SPEAKER, I  YIELD BACK.

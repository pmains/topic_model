THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE:  THE GENTLEMAN FROM TEXAS IS RECOGNIZED FOR TWO MINUTES. MR. GONZALEZ: I RISE TO SPEAK ON THE HUMANITARIAN AND NATIONAL SECURITY CRISIS HAPPENING AS WE SPEAK IN MY DISTRICT. THE FLOOD OF MIGRANTS AT THE INTERNATIONAL BRIDGE IN DEL RIO HAS HIGHLIGHTED THE VULNERABILITIES WE HAVE IN BOTH OUR IMMIGRATION SYSTEM AND AS A NATION. THAT IS WHY I RISE TODAY TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF THE PREVIOUS QUESTION. WE NEED MUCH-NEEDED, COMMONSENSE REFORMS TO PROVIDE BORDER PATROL WITH MORE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY, SUPPLEMENTAL BOOTS ON GROUND AND ADDITIONAL SUPPORT TO SECURE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER THROUGH INFRASTRUCTURE. IN ORDER TO PREVENT AN EVENT LIKE THIS HAPPENING AGAIN, THERE NEEDS TO BE SUBSTANTIAL POLICY CHANGES. I URGE MY COLLEAGUES

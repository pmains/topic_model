top government official in Iran making a landmark statement that the country's morality police has been abolished but the status of the morality police remains unclear tonight it's been the focus of months of protests in that country after a 22-year-old woman died in its custody in September I want to welcome in Democratic Congressman Jim cost of California also a member of the House Foreign Affairs committee Congressman thank you for being here well thank you it's nice to be on news Nation thank you do you believe that Iran actually will be shutting down its morality police we'll see I mean uh anything that comes out of that Iranian government in terms of official spokes persons uh clearly uh uh is to be questioned but what's most important is the brave uh Iranian women and those who have supported them in what is the longest protest uh census the hypocrisy has taken over and we should do everything we possibly can to support them this is a very uh whether or not Afghanistan whether or not Iran is at a Tipping Point remains to be seen but uh we just met with a group of European parliamentarians and we all agree that we should do everything we can to support um over 30 percent of the over half the population of Iran is under 30 years of age and this is the I think possibly a pivotal time in Iran I hear you if the morality police is shut down what does that practically mean for the freedoms for the people and for the women in that country does it automatically mean that women can have freedom of dress or have their hair uncovered well we hope so but it remains to be seen uh this is uh obviously a a new step if they follow through with it the morality police has been in effect since the uh theocracy of the uh Ayatollah took over with their uh with their uh this government so it would be a big change do you believe that the government is likely to make more concessions well I think it really is dependent upon the continuation of the protests I think there are other factors in play as well uh clearly uh the health of the Ayatollah we are told is not good uh there is a uh successionist uh watch that is going on as to who may succeed him and who's competing for power within that uh government uh but I think we should remind ourselves the current president of Iran uh is one of the uh in his previous uh position it's one of the bloodiest rulers in in in post uh uh um uh Iran history so uh I I have little confidence in the president to to make the necessary changes to restore um a democratic rule in Iraq and meanwhile in China I do want to ask you about the situation there there have been pretty unprecedented protests in recent weeks sparked by their rigid coveted restrictions we are hearing some of the rules are now being eased there is this a moment in time where we're also seeing another government making concessions to protesters it may be uh I mean clearly uh China's covered policy has failed and uh these uh protests that have been taking place have been uh with uh I think a a a a long uh impact of every city and and uh in in straight within China and I think the she government uh with uh the uh impacts that have taken place there and you looked at the economy uh that has suffered uh and uh the uh impacts of the lack of stability uh caused in part by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and uh I think notwithstanding the 20th party Congress in China and she's ability to waive uh the two term limits uh the world has changed from China it's changed in Iran and certainly the world has changed as a result of Russia's Invasion uh of Ukraine in a ways that none of us could have thought about uh 10 months ago and and I do want to ask you about the situation in Ukraine I know you recently traveled to see the situation on the ground firsthand can you share with us what did you witness there well uh I was there in September and uh the at the uh Yalta European strategic conference and uh what we clearly uh understood and I think continued today is the will of the European people remain strong that they are fighting not only for their sovereignty and their democracy uh and Russia is losing on the battlefield so much so that Russia now has taken uh the tactic of attempting to to bomb uh civilians uh Apartments schools hospitals to try to break the will of the Ukrainian people by depriving them of electricity and and of course water and all the other impacts but uh the Russian army is is on its back feet and uh Ukraine continues to move forward uh this is going to be a tough uh difficult winter for the people of Ukraine make no doubt about it we are trying when the Europeans should do everything we possibly can to allow the civilian public to be able to uh to hang in there during this next winter this six month period I appreciate it Russia Russia is on its back feet to be sure and Ukraine has the advantage on that

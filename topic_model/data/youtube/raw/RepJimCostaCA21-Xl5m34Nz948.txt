ladies and gentlemen the Subcommittee on livestock and foreign agriculture will now come to to order as we said on the outset we're attempting to to try to hold at least two subcommittee hearings a month and I think we're so far pretty much keeping on track both the ranking member mr. Rosner and I and working with other committee members are trying to make sure that we have a thorough vetting of the issues affecting the livestock industry and foreign agriculture around the country and the regional impacts that we see taking place we know that they're not all evenly placed and of course these trade tariffs wars are having an impact as it relates to commodity to commodity group and therefore we think it's sufficient and appropriate that we have the poultry industry today give as a state of how they are doing and not only with regards to poultry economics but also us livestock in general so the title of this morning searing the state of US livestock and poultry economies will come to order we're pleased to have a good cross representative of industry leaders or goal today is to hear from on-the-ground stakeholders in various segments of the livestock and poultry industry so we know in Congress what's going on for the men and women who are involved in this very important part of animal agriculture in our country that provides protein for all Americans and enough so that we can export livestock and poultry producers have big impacts on rural economies in my district alone sales of livestock and poultry and related products add up to over two billion dollars a year nationwide that is nearly in excess of 200 billion dollars annually so it's it's it has significant broad reaching effects throughout the country today's hearing builds on the previous work of the subcommittee included in hearing we had two months ago with the United States Department of Agriculture undersecretary greyguy Bach on the ability to prevent respond a new suite of animal health programs that was enacted as part of the new through 2018 farm bill effective administration of animal pests and disease prevention programs were dealt with and how we mitigate and and eradicate with these new changes is crucial especially now with the threats of virtual and Newcastle disease cattle fever ticks African swine fever that threaten farmers ranchers across the country so it's hard to talk about the state of the livestock industry and poultry economies without talking about trade as I noted in the outset access to foreign markets and fluctuations and foreign demand continue to be a major major concern as livestock and poultry farmers need to export markets and the American terror first attitude hasn't been helping the long-standing issues for for poultry access into places like China needed to be addressed I mean I think we all know certainly I grew up on our family's farm with the notion that farmers ranchers and dairymen are price takers not price makers that means for the for the first persons who are not familiar with life on the farm they put all the input costs throughout the year and at the end of the year farmers ranchers terminar take what the world market price is and they may have X into that product over a period of months but need Y to have a profit but if the markets not why they're going to get X and that's the challenge farmers ranchers and dairymen are price takers not price makers so these tariffs are very troubling and we see that combined with climate conditions of floods and taking place in parts of the country they add further exacerbation to the challenges our folks are facing we also know the need to work workable immigration system for all the rhetoric and emotion that surrounds the immigration debate livestock and poultry producers know that they depend upon a reliable year-round labor workforce to keep both the farms and the packing sheds running and what we have seen and I know in California is a continuing decline of available workforce reliable workforce in our fields and in our packing operations and it is very troubling and there is fear out in farm country I can tell you in the communities that I represent I just saw it last week about potential of raids and the impacts of people being deported when some families and households are documented and they're illegally and some are not that fear is real and other issues we have included with federal Meat Inspection food safety meat and poultry labeling across new technologies and the Packers and stockyards act functions are all major issues concerning this subcommittee and we will delve into that at a later date today's hearing though is just one more step and an ongoing conversation on these important issues the new farm bill requires the USDA to complete several studies that will provide Congress with the necessary information on important issues including the analysts of the possible livestock dealer trust and the effectiveness of the food safety inspection service outreach to small livestock processors that information is going to help guide our work in these important she's moving forward we look forward to getting these studies back and scheduling a hearing appropriately where we can discuss the results with you as the livestock mandatory price reporting expires in 2020 this subcommittee is interested in learning farmer priorities in advance so that we can deal with reauthorization

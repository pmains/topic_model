as public and political will push of state and federal governments towards reducing the prison population Louisiana stanza partnered steadfast resistance against this trend it has the highest incarceration rate of any state in the country according to data from the prison policy initiative as incarceration rates remained steady in most all other states and even decline in some Louisiana's rate has only risen approaching nine hundred inmates for every 100,000 people in the state and no City Louisiana houses a larger proportion by population as those inmates then New Orleans which have the highest incarceration rate not only in the state but of any city in the United States for most of those prisoners the responsibility for ensuring their right to a robust defense while squarely on the shoulders of the Orleans public defenders in a recent editorial for the Washington Post one of those lawyers says the small organization represents eighty-five percent charged with crimes in Orleans Parish on an annual budget a third the size of the district attorneys and now facing a million dollar deficit because of statewide budget cuts the already overburdened office will have to do even more with even less for the attorneys avoiding layoffs will mean four weeks of unpaid furloughs a heavier caseload a hiring freeze and for many of their clients the denial of their constitutional right to representation joining us now from New Orleans Louisiana is Derwin button who is chief district defender for Orleans Parish what in the world of going on Emma C well thank you for having me on the show one of the things that's going on in the city is we are illustrating what has become a growing trend across the country and that is a user paid criminal justice system that is inadequate unpredictable and unreliable when it comes to resources and so that has come home to roost as we've seen state budgets decline in our own revenues go down explain the user pay piece folks may not understand where the money for the public defender's office comes from there well statewide two-thirds of public defender budgets rely on what costs fines and fees that is what is paid by our clients the people going through the system so the system depends in an inordinate way on the fines and fees from people moving through it for its operation and that yields some wild results and when you have a system that is aimed at the most vulnerable and poorest in a community to depend on those poor and vulnerable to actually fund its operation provides the results that we are decrying right now so one more people because I find whatever we do work around prisons in criminal justice the responses sometimes are like well why should I care aren't these people criminals what's the constitutional issue at stake here well a constitutional issue at stake here is the system everyone has a right to a lawyer everyone has a right to a defense when the government is prosecuting you and what we have right now is a system here in New Orleans and across the country that is so disparate and so overwhelming if you're looking at criminal justice reform then you're wondering why we have so many people in prison you need only look at public defense and then you know you have to reform that as part of this system we have checks and balances in our government we don't have checks and balances in our criminal justice system that is the role of public defenders and it has gone gone lacking over these past few years we have a budget a third the size of our da they have 30 investigators we have eight they have 90 lawyers we have 40 and they have a hundred and thirty-five million dollar police force investigating their their cases for them and when you look at that you understand that there's just in Louisiana about one to two percent of the funding goes to make sure someone is represented that they are represented appropriately and their rights are protected the rest is to catch secure and convict during 60 doesn't go away but you know EJ I wanted to give you a chance to weigh in both on this and the other issues we talking about yeah well a couple of things one is just to go back to ban the Box getting rid of that box where people have to say whether they have a criminal record enormous difference in at least opening the first round of possibility for people and it's very important the federal government encourage everybody to do that secondly on this issue of bipartisanship on criminal justice reform up to this point there have been a lot of promising signs and there are a bunch of conservatives groups like right on crime who have come to criminal justice reform because they don't like the government to spend a lot of money and they realize the government spend a lot of money I'm present some of them are libertarians who actually care about this I am very worried that we may be entering another and more destructive face where a lot of the constructive work that's gone on for the last several years to try to get us to the point where we can reform this system may get caught right back up into 1960s early 70's style politics you have Donald Trump talking about the salad majority talking about law and order in some cities you're seeing an increase in the murder rate I'm worried you're the low crime rates relative to the mass have opened up this opportunity and if we don't lose it what city is it even if you're talking about the economic piece I want to come to mark because you know Derwin saying here okay fine spend less money on prisons but maybe we should spend more on criminal defense also of the indigent of weather systems just start for resources and just shameful the way we process cases through the court is if it's an assembly line or so so it just reinforces why we need to end mass incarceration there are other legitimate needs in the criminal justice has been certainly legitimate needs and the communities that those prisoners come from and one of the main ways we can deal with that is to cut back on the 80 billion dollars we're spending on Corrections every year we're not going to balash prisons tomorrow nobody's calling for that but we could have a substantial reduction that that would ensure that when people are charged with a crime they would get a real defense and have a chance you present their case in court not just be one of a number of people really want to come back to you just real quick on this before we head out because the other thing going on in Orleans I just don't want to miss this is it sheriff Gusman who just opened his new prison this week has also moved more than 200 inmates to far-flung parishes making it harder for you will even harder for you all to even represent your clients we have like no time but I just at least wanted to also get that on the on the table here that's another thing you guys are dealing with absolutely what that what that did essentially is make our client incommunicado that made it impossible for them to affect their constitutional rights access to courts and right to counsel it also increased costs I think what people don't understand there's been studies by the justice policy institute and others that shows us criminal justice system with a well-funded public defender's office actually reduces costs we can control the length of stay by properly presenting cases to the courts and arguing for release yet and the appropriate amount of time for the appropriate crime I gotta tell you Darwin button in New Orleans it is hmmm just keep keep fighting the good fight down there here in Washington or fake thank you to EJ Dionne and to Marc Maurer congressman congresswoman barbara Lee and Wayne Henderson are going to be back with us but still to come Batman

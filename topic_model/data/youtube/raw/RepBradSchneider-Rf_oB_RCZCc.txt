i want to give a chance for people to join thanks for joining us everybody tommy you want to start you want me to start uh congressman i think uh you should start but let's give it just another minute for folks you tell me you guys give me to go ahead welcome everybody once the um participant starts to level off uh we can give it a go congressman i got a good crowd yeah i think you can probably get started all right well welcome everybody thanks thanks for joining us for today's uh webinar and i'm glad to be with you uh we're joined with folks from my team uh tommy brown who's gonna lead the conversation this morning uh but also off-camera uh robert perez who uh you probably got the invitation from and they helped organizing it uh matt freed my communications director and calling in from vacation uh greg claus thank you for joining us my deputy chief and district director you all know well um so we're here to talk about community budget project funding this was a process that was initiated last year and it gives all members of congress including me the chance to advocate for the the highest priority projects within our district and uh it was something that i think most of my colleagues found uh you know very much a challenging process but also a process that uh gave us the chance to do what we do uh people like to say speaker blossie says our job description our job title are the same single word representative and nobody knows the 10th district of illinois in congress or should know the 10th district illinois in congress or the federal government then i and my team so that's what this process is about last year when we kicked it off we had more than 60 applications submitted uh we were allowed to um advocate on behalf of 10 uh which we did we wanted to make sure we got as many as we could uh and i know the team worked tires tirelessly to collect information for those projects last spring we presented them to the appropriations process and over the course of um well it should have been six months or less the goal was to have the appropriations bills completed and signed into law before the beginning of the fiscal year which is october 1st of last year uh this year the process took a bit longer and it wasn't until this month that the senate and house finally were able to get there but the good news is and in all seriousness to our pleasant surprise we got funding for all ten of our projects that we advocated for uh we were very proud of that and among these were an expansion of uh or resources for the northern illinois food bank to expand and add a distribution center a workforce development program at the college of lake county expansion mental health facilities resources for this with lake county health department projects for economic development in in in mundelein infrastructure on prospect heights emergency services across the county across lake county uh flood control flood prevention in zion north chicago and keegan and economic development in downtown waukegan so like i said we're very pleased that uh we were able to get at least some funding for all these projects uh the good news is that um the process was deemed uh successful enough in general that this year we're allowed to advocate for 15 and our intention is to try to identify 15 projects on which we'll advocate um as we said last year the expectation was not to get all 15 or last year all 10 funded we were thrilled that we were able to do it and knock wood maybe we can do that again but that's uh that's uh my goal is to do what we can to advocate for the projects within the community let me talk about a little bit about the process from a high level and then tommy will go into it in much more detail but at the highest level uh it is a process and there are rules um appropriately so because uh uh we should have transparency and people seeing what we're doing and um as part of the appropriations process there's 12 bills in theory normally it's omnibus but but there are categories it's critically important and i can't overstate this that any application or project submitted for consideration is eligible for an account within the process which which you're applying tommy's going to explain more detail what that means and there's guidance on our website and more guidance will be coming but uh our our challenge is to always make sure that we are um putting round pegs into round holes square pegs into square holes and um not letting it uh not not uh having an issue because we didn't uh follow the the process itself um bottom line is you're not eligible for an account or you're asking for money in an ineligible expense uh the process is going to kick it out and [Music] affect our abilities to advocate so unless gregor or tommy tells me that i've missed anything i think that covers it and i'm going to turn it over to you guys i'm in a bit of due to the group thank you you're in good hands i actually have a hearing uh here in washington so i'm going to return to my hearing but i am excited about this process um i'm excited about the success success we had with fiscal year 2022 and the impact we're having on our community i look forward to talking to you all soon thanks so much thanks congressman great so we are going to get started robert if you want to cue up the powerpoint excellent so um a couple things that i want to say on the front end um first of all um we learned a lot from the process last year and we hope uh that we can make our process for taking in cpf requests and helping all of you in applying uh we hope that that process uh can improve uh the second time around um second of all there's a lot that we know but there's also at the stage in the process a lot that we don't know um and so uh today we are hoping to provide you all the information that we have right now and then over the next few days uh we will have um some updates about some of the new accounts that will be available for fiscal year 2023 um and the last thing i'll say is um if you have questions uh don't feel like this is the only opportunity um to address them all the information that i'm going to be covering today during the webinar is on our website schneider.house.gov appropriations and that link will be throughout the powerpoint so don't feel compelled to write it down now all of that information is on the website um and at the end of the presentation we'll give you our contact information our goal here is to help you all as much as possible to provide a compelling projects that help the community um and uh so we are your resource uh throughout this process um but as i said um there's a lot of stuff we do know uh but there's also a lot of stuff we don't know of this process so we we um appreciate your patience as we navigate this before diving into specifics on the community project funding process i think it's helpful to give a broad overview of the two major things that congress does in the appropriations process so appropriations direct all federal spending every penny that the federal government spends is through direct appropriation by congress when you hear the phrase congress holds the purse strings that's what that means um appropriations are generally comprised of mandatory funding things like social security medicare payment on the national debt uh and discretionary funding and we pass bills annually that divides up how that discretionary funding is spent last year as the congressman noted was the first year for the community funding project funding process in years past this has been referred to earmarks but that process was put on pause for about a decade and we're really excited to have it back because i think as as you heard the projects we funded last year it can have a great impact on our community um next slide so um in terms of those two different parts of the appropriations process i want to briefly talk about account specific um but that's not really the topic of uh the presentation today we're going to be focusing on project specific funding under the community project funding process but i do briefly want to talk about um account specific uh requests because some stakeholders do submit those requests uh throughout the year um each fiscal year members of congress will solicit um input and priorities from folks back in the district on what federal programs they use the most these are again not project specific this is arguing for the top line funding amount for a given account so a couple examples from our community one would be impact aid which is a department of defense program that helps schools like forestall elementary in north chicago that are connected with a military base so advocating for more funding for impact aid or tfap the emergency food assistance program helps food banks around the country and so we often hear from food banks in our area advocating for more funding for that program because it helps them fulfill their mission when they're advocating for that funding it's not specific amount for them it's the top number for how much that account has um afg and safer grants are used by fire departments around the district and so we hear from fire chiefs about how important that funding is as well as glri the great lakes restoration initiative all accounts that we advocate for more funding but again this is just about how much money is in that pot and that is not the community project funding process if you do have next slide please if you do have an account specific request we will email all of the participants in this webinar the form we use for processing those and it includes my contact information so if you do have questions please let me know but again that is separate from the cpf process but i did want to make sure to cover it since a lot of our stakeholders back in the district do have questions on that next slide please so what we're going to focus on today is project specific requests as i said last year was the first year of the community project funding the cpf process last year each member submitted to the house appropriations committee a maximum of 10 projects we received greg correct me if i'm wrong i think somewhere north of 60 submissions and worked with stakeholders in the district on vetting those and whittling it down to 10 that we submitted to the house appropriations committee um and i'll say this multiple times but each cpf submission has to fit the eligibility requirements of the account to which they're applying um just like the congressman said we need to make sure we're putting our round pegs in round holes um if your submission does not fit the eligibility requirements of the account you're applying to um we're not in a position to help uh advance that project because each of those accounts have specific eligibility criteria uh next slide please um the congressman walked through the different projects that we secured but here's a a list of those things like flood mitigation in high need communities things like economic development workforce development and training um helping resources in our community like the northern illinois food bank and all of these projects have uh something in common they are uh they fit the eligibility criteria of the account but they also benefit our community um and they have a significant community-wide uh benefit and uh mission um and uh so as we go well we'll talk about what makes for a compelling project a little bit later but if we can go to the next slide and again all this information is on the website and so if you do need to refer back to it that's your place to go but here i think are the most important dates um in our process and you'll notice unfortunately it is a very quick turnaround um and uh unfortunately that is uh a product of um how this process works but uh on april 4th um the new cpf accounts are going to be posted on our website we have already listed the accounts from last year most of which we expect uh to be eligible this year so that gives you some guidance on um the different eligible accounts for funding but we will have the full list up uh by monday on tuesday our applications uh will open uh we're also gonna hold a second webinar um where we'll walk through all this stuff that we're talking about today uh but also the new accounts that are eligible um you'll have eight days to submit your applications um and uh obviously that is a breakneck turnaround um but as you'll see as we um go through more of the presentation um the cpf process is not really an opportunity for new ideas it is an opportunity for projects that you have already fleshed out that are part of your strategic plan or that are so called shovel ready um and so ideally you are not building your application completely from scratch um but also the timeline is a reflection on um uh just the process overall and how it fits into the broader appropriations timeline so we regret that it is such a quick turnaround but hopefully you already have most of the information you need on hand for your application after the 13th when all of these are due we will have about two weeks where um the office staff will interview with the applicants follow up on different questions uh flesh out different answers make sure that you guys fit the eligibility criteria make sure that you guys have things like letters of support to demonstrate community support um and then our aim is april 29th we will be announcing all the finalists and non-finalists um april 29th is not when that process ends though that is just when we submit those projects to the house appropriations committee the appropriations committee will have its own vetting process after the 29th and will include the projects that it has vetted and approved in the final funding legislation then it needs to vote that legislation out of committee then we need to pass it on the floor of the house and then that legislation needs to pass the senate and get signed by the president so even once we hit submit to all of our projects um later in april that is only step say four of a 27 step process and so i think one of the biggest things we ask of those finalists who did secure a submission just patience because so much of this process is outside of our control and subject to other um steps um next slide please and if i could just chime in unfortunately just to echo uh what tommy said this is not a timeline that's decided by us we understand how tight this is and we would love for it to be longer because i know it's a huge burden on communities and organizations to put the application together so quickly but it is part of the appropriations process which is dc set so this is a deadline basically everyone in the country all the members in the country are following um and unfortunately just again to echo what tommy said this is a bit of a hurry up in weight we submitted our applications last year and it you know we found out rather quickly you know within a month or two that they were included in the bill but it took a full year for that bill to make its way through the house and then the senate and then to the president's desk with many ups and downs and nail-biting moments along the way so unfortunately that is also what's in store for us this year the one bit of good news this year though is uh last year we were uncertain if this process would actually come to fruition and if we would actually be able to pass all of these projects and our hope is since we were able to do that last year that sets the precedent for um continuing to do this process annually we don't know of the 15 projects that we will submit for this fiscal year we do not know if they will fund all of them two of them seven of them that is completely outside of our control but our hope is that the process will continue uh set by the precedent uh from last year um all right so as i said your one stop shop as you have questions is on our website schneider.house.gov appropriations all the information that we're covering today is on that website um that includes your timelines and deadlines that everyone will need to be following uh that includes a full list of the um awardees from last year to give you some sense of what types of projects um uh we found compelling and we prioritized um it also gives a walk through uh best practices which i'll go over in a little bit uh for what uh makes a very compelling um uh submission chris to your question will these slides be posted as well we'll make sure to get those on the website as well um and then it will the website also includes information about what accounts were funded last year we know that there will be more accounts than that um funded this year but it's a good place for you all to start uh as you look for which initiatives uh fit your projects um and then as i said uh once it's released by the house appropriations committee we will also have guidance on all of the accounts for next year and all the details on on their respective eligibility next slide please you'll hear this theme time and time again but eligibility is i think number one variable to keep in mind as you're looking at your projects only government entities and non-profit organizations located in our congressional district are eligible um for-profit organizations are not eligible for cpf funding and um if you're a 501c3 organization you are absolutely eligible and you'll probably need to provide your ein there is some eligibility for other forms of nonprofits um for instance uh 501c6 organizations like local chambers of commerce are eligible but other types of 501c6s like a professional sports team are not necessarily eligible so if you have a question about your nonprofit's eligibility feel free to just give me a call i might not know the answer but i can promise you that i'll get you an answer local match for a lot of these accounts but not all of them a lot of them require some level of local match um and so as part of the process making sure that you know whether or not there is a local match requirement and making sure you can demonstrate that local match is an important part of the process the next bullet multi-year funding is not eligible all projects must be one-year funding what that means is let's say you are applying in order to fund a new program at a community college the funding you're receiving is going to go towards one fiscal year's worth of funding you're not going to be able to come back year after year after year to secure ongoing long-term funding for that program the best way to think of it is think of it as a lump sum that you will receive this fiscal year it is not a continual source of funding um this makes a lot of sense with capital projects um obviously it's a one-time fund but with programming um it can get a little bit more confusing but think of this as one year funded and if you have questions about that um we can address those uh towards the end um and the last part is all final submissions um are going to be publicly disclosed um and so just knowing that um we will always be leaning towards uh transparency and disclosure throughout this process and so please keep that in mind next slide please this touches on a lot of what i said earlier but again for-profit organizations are not eligible for cpf funding um this year we are also limiting the number of submissions different entities uh can submit multi-jurisdictional governments can submit six projects and all other entities whether local governments law enforcement agencies non-profits school districts all other entities can submit three projects um applicants who submit multiple projects are we're going to ask that you prioritize your submissions so that we have a good idea of which are most important to you it's also worth noting that cpf funding is not fungible and it has to go towards the application's expense you cannot take federal funding from away from the capital expense that you applied for and apply it to some programming or servicing of debt or you know salaries or what have you the funds have to go towards their designated purpose um and um there's going to be um auditing and transparency throughout this process um and so uh it just it we need to make that point very upfront um with two exceptions most accounts do not allow for capital expenditures or facility renovation those exceptions are listed below there's one account within health and human services and there's one account within housing and urban development so there are opportunities for capital expenditures most of the funding goes towards programming but all that is to say depending on the type of project you're submitting um please make sure that the funds you are asking for are towards an eligible expense um so if it is a capital expense make sure that the account you're applying to allows for capital expenditures next slide please and one more thing tommy it's also not the we cannot use these funds for reimbursement so no expenses can be incurred on the project it has to be waiting until it gets funded and then once it's funded there's a process for drawing down those funds and then you can enact that but um none of this can be for reimbursement exactly thanks for pointing that out great because that's a really important point um so we learned a lot from our cpf process last year and we wanted to relay what we learned um so that you guys can put together the most compelling applications possible um and i think those best practices fell into kind of four different buckets the first is you need to demonstrate both the impact of the project and its readiness so as you saw with the projects that we funded last year most of them had a community-wide impact or they served a high-need population or they addressed a long-recognized local priority and that is a story that all of you are going to need to tell succinctly and demonstrate why that project is needed but what's also helpful to keep in mind is while you guys live your mission every single day within your organizations it is helpful to us if you put that project into context into content into the context of your needs in your organization's history your organization's mission help tell us the story about why the project is needed and where it fits into your broader picture um like i said it helps to demonstrate how the project fits within your long-term planning so a couple examples of where you can demonstrate that if you have a strategic plan uh that you have um that lists you know this project and makes clear that you've been thinking about this need for a long time uh for local governments pursuing things like infrastructure investment uh demonstrating that you already have an inter-governmental agreement or um that you know this city council passed a resolution in support of the project anything you can do to demonstrate the level of depth of thought you put into the project is helpful and as i said earlier on cpf uh proposals it's it's not the best opportunity for new ideas uh the best applications again are for well-established projects um so uh item number two is uh and we'll say this 17 more times um applications must be an eligible entity and they must fulfill the account specific eligibility requirements all of those are spelled out on the website and you'll get more information as we get more information but two brief examples one of the most popular uh submissions we got last year was a department of homeland security program called pre-disaster mitigation grants these generally help with storm water management and prevent flooding and what have you that one program required that the applicant had to be a government entity it required a local match and it also required a letter of support from the illinois emergency management agency so those are just examples of the uh specific account specific requirements you might have to be thinking about another was the department of transportation accounts uh for local transportation priorities uh another area where we successfully funded some projects the applicant had to be a government entity and it had to be included in the state transportation improvement plan or cmap's transportation improvement plan that is to say you had to demonstrate that this project had already been vetted and verified by the relevant uh state government agency uh next slide please the next item that you really need to be thinking about is how you demonstrate community support um and so you need to demonstrate among relevant stakeholders like impacted organizations you need to show on the history of the project or that it is listed in planning documents or has support from a city council resolution or what have you a good example here is one of the projects we funded last year was a flood mitigation project in an area called deity slo and they uh in their application lake county provided letters of support from park city from the illinois emergency management agency from the east skokie drainage district from crystal ray uh preparatory academy uh which would would uh benefit from the lack of flooding in that area so you don't need to do it now in your process but if as you go through your application start developing a list of who you think can speak in support of the project either through a letter of support or or if there are press articles highlighting the need for the project but we want you thinking about how you can demonstrate again that the proposal you're submitting has strong community support because that is a really important variable um and then the last bit as i mentioned some accounts require a local match some don't so definitely be aware of whether or not there is a requirement if there is a local match requirement you don't have to have the funding on hand right now but you do need to demonstrate how you would be able to fulfill that match and there's definitely a wariness among the appropriations committee of approving projects that will require regular funding renewed funding each and every year so we really should be thinking about these proposals as one-year funding a lump sum that goes towards one specific purpose not a continual renewal fund next slide please so as i said at the beginning we have a lot of information but we don't have all the information so until our application process opens on tuesday of next week the things you can be doing now um to prepare your application one um is get yourself uh familiar with the different available accounts again all that information is on our website schneider.house.gov appropriations this walks you through the different opportunities for funding and what those eligibility requirements are um once we release the new information on the new accounts which i hope uh it will definitely be posted by monday my hope is to get it posted by the end of the day tomorrow um definitely spend some time looking at those new accounts and see where those opportunities are where it fits within your planning um identify good shovel ready projects don't try and reinvent the wheel with your proposal and we included on the website links to pdfs of all the different applications from last year um the different forms not the not what people submitted um and so that helps you understand the types of questions we'll be asking and the types of information we'll need you to provide uh in order to put forth a compelling submission and then as i said also just start thinking about a list of supporters and how you're going to demonstrate that community support as i said the application portal will open on april 5th which is next tuesday next slide once the application portal is open obviously review all the accounts including the new ones for fy 23 and determine which account makes the most sense for your submission um item two uh confirm that the project you're applying for is eligible for the funds you're looking to uh get again this is about finding round pegs for round holes um and then the last thing i'd say uh is prepare your submission in a separate document um like a word doc or or even an email um just so that you have it uh housed in uh a space that isn't the application portal um the last thing we want you to do is spend an hour plugging in all the information um and then have to hit back or or um something happens with the submission portal um i think building your application in a separate document make sure that um you can get uh all of your questions answered before you start plugging in uh that information hope that makes sense um all submissions are going to be due april 13th which is not this coming wednesday but the following next slide after you hit submit on your cpf requests hopefully before the 13th but certainly by the 13th um we will spend the next two weeks reviewing applications interviewing with applicants doing our due diligence and vetting uh those different projects um in that we expect to have a conversation with every single applicant uh and so in those conversations um you should be prepared to talk through your project why it's needed how it fits within the eligibility parameters the history of the project again try and put it into a context that helps us understand why it's needed um we will be getting final answers to folks uh for what we will submit uh by april 29th um we then submit those projects to the house appropriations committee the committee spends the next two weeks after that vetting those projects on their own and then puts them into the legislation that the committee then marks up and sends to the house floor the house passes the senate passes and then hopefully the president signs um but again remember that um even once we hit submit on our submissions to the house appropriations committee there's still a long timeline of things that have to uh happen before we're able to secure your funding i think in terms of expectations if you are a finalist and it is included in what the house appropriations committee passes and that eventually gets signed into law i think you can probably expect to see federal funding uh sometime around next summer so summer 2023 um our hope is that that timeline works a little faster but again so many of these parts of the process are outside of control last slide please so additional questions this is my contact information and greg's contact information um i think as you have questions again our hope is that first step is to check out the website um we have a lot of information on there that you guys can make use of um and uh we have about 25 minutes now to address your questions so what i think i'd like to do is just go through the questions in the chat once we go through all of those if you can use the raised hand feature and we'll go through each question as they have uh so to chris this question we will be posting the slides on the website um to michael's question on whether or not school districts are illegal yep school districts are eligible to submit cpfs um to kevin's question i did not see non-profit organizations get grants last year um is there a higher bar for non-profits or did not many apply so there were several non-profits that secured funding uh the one that comes to mind is um northern illinois food bank but um the non-profits don't have any higher bar but there are some accounts that require government entities um to apply um but uh we are processing submissions from nonprofits in the same exact manner as we are others and i'm telling you i want to go back to kevin harvey i don't know you answered this one are the accounts for the fy 2023 funded already determined and fixed yes so they they have been determined and fixed and they're being released by the appropriations committee um um shortly and so um unfortunately that is not something uh that we have a role in determining um but that information should be coming out um and as i said my hope is to post that information on the website uh tomorrow at the latest monday to provide you information about what new accounts are eligible kenneth robinson asks about park districts being eligible for the cpf funds yes park districts are eligible entities and just to reiterate tommy's earlier point you do have to figure out exactly which account you're looking to get your funds from so if for example there's a major flooding issue um you can get it through that disaster pre-disaster mitigation fund through fema and you can do um water restoration initiatives um there's you know that could be park related um there could be some transportation alternatives if you're looking to do bike path or um you know jogging trail for the parks it you do have to look exactly at which account it is and figure out your project that's going to fit with that account i know we keep reiterating this a lot because the problem is there's a lot of really great project ideas but it has to fit in one of the accounts that's already there and if it is a great idea but it doesn't fit with one of the project accounts then it's fortunately we can't move the project forward and yeah that's the the eligibility criteria is not something we determine and uh the committee is only going to consider proposals that fit within the criteria of that uh the eligibility um for each account so again unfortunately that's just out of our hands marcia asks can government-funded money for the same project be allowed as a match yes so the local match um it doesn't necessarily matter where that funding is coming from so let's say a local government is using state funds to provide for the local match that is allowable but if that is something that you plan on doing let's have a conversation about it during the application process because we want to make clear that you will have funding aside for the local match even if the applying entity is not the one providing that funding catherine asked if project funds are not for reimbursement when would the funds be released again our hope is that you'll have access to the funds by next summer but because so many steps in that process are undetermined or outside of our control it's difficult for us to predict exactly um but i think as the fy 22 money gets dispersed i think that'll give us a sense of what timeline to expect for next year um we signed the omnibus legislation that included these projects in mid-march um and our hope is that that funding uh will be made available sometime this summer and so if we follow that same timeline um fy23 projects will have access to their funding by next summer but again there is a certain degree of uncertainty in determining that mike brown asked our fire station is fire station remodeling eligible um it is possible that fire stations can apply for those sorts of funds under one of the new accounts but under the existing accounts from fy 22 that would not be an eligible expense but mike let's have a conversation offline and we can talk through what opportunities there are for fire stations and i think we've heard from a variety of um first responder organizations tommy could you talk about the lake county emergency 9-1-1 center that was funded last time and how that worked yeah so lake county is working to create a consolidated emergency operations center and um emergency operation center funding is an eligible account under the department of homeland security and so we were able to secure them greg i think about a million dollars towards that construction um and so uh we didn't get them all the funds that they asked for um and it had to go towards that um construction of the emergency operations center but we were able to offset some of the costs um and so uh it's an important point to hammer home is even if you're asking for a specific amount most of our projects were funded at the requested amount but not all of them and so um i think just be prepared for if you are able to secure funding it might not be every every bit of fun you need um but our hope is uh most of them will be fully funded yeah i think we tried to get 10 million for that project and then they cut it down to 1 million they told us that that's the most they could do yep every eoc grant from um the that process was capped at a million um and uh the accounts this year we expect there will be a funding cap um but a lot of that information is still forthcoming all right nicole asked is funding direct from federal government or through an illinois agency that's a great question yeah so for um for the cpf process it is directly from the federal government um there are other obvious obviously grant programs that flow through the state that is part of the broader appropriations process but for the purpose of this discussion for cpf projects it will be coming directly from the federal government michael asked no money can be spent until after appropriations correct if it is spent before appropriations no reimbursement correct correct for both of those that's right yep yep mike asked fire apparatus acquisition is that eligible so um there are two grant programs that fire departments have access to um afg assistance for firefighter grants and safer which uh uh afg goes towards equipment safe or goes towards training um i believe that those grants will be an eligible account this year and so mike let's have a conversation about uh how we can uh have you guys apply to those accounts as i get more information i'll be posting it on the website but let's definitely set aside some time to talk through where those opportunities are brooke asks are each accounts required also included on your website or is there a separate piece we need to visit to view the requirements so all the requirements for the accounts are listed on the website and um there will be more information forthcoming but they should give you an idea of um what is required for each account nicole asked does federal qbs apply for consultation selection to be eligible for grant reimbursement so nicole unfortunately i'm not familiar with qbs but i encourage you to shoot me an email and we can talk through um the question you have qbs actually i don't know that one consultant selection sorry i said that wrong um can you help us liz asks can you help us understand the ideal budget and staffing requirement on the nonprofit side as an applicant most of the items i saw last year were almost a million dollars is that not appropriate for small organizations and budgets so feel free to apply for [Music] smaller amounts than a million and uh our goal here is to help all applicants at every step of the process as they prepare their submissions um and so if you have a smaller project that is well under a million i strongly encourage you to apply don't do not look at the funding amounts from last year as the only uh way forward um so smaller organizations strongly encourage you to apply for whatever funding amount fits your project obviously as we get towards the higher end of things there are caps on uh larger amounts but don't be discouraged from requesting smaller amounts father corey asked are the accounts posted on on the website yet or are they not so the accounts that we used last year are all posted on the website i believe all but one of those accounts will be eligible this year in addition to those accounts we will soon be posting uh the new accounts for this year um and so you'll see some additions hopefully not any subtractions uh to what is listed on the website um but what is on there currently are accounts from last year that we expect uh to be made eligible this year and it gives you a good place to start we're again we only have so much of the information and guidance so we're trying to give you as much uh guidance as we have on hand but uh father corey i encourage you to reach out if you have questions about specific accounts john asked would in addition to promote provide accessibility to an existing structure such as a playground be allowed so um yes yeah no definitely um understand the question i think uh we'll need to look at the requirements for specific accounts uh but john uh definitely take a look at what we have listed so far and as we get more information about the new accounts um i think we can talk through uh where those opportunities are i don't know offhand um but i think we can probably find a place where that would be eligible but let's start by looking at the accounts that are listed and just to reiterate once the accounts are announced next week april 1st and our application is live we will again be blasting it out on our grant newsletter list which is where probably most everyone got this invitation today and we'll say exactly what the accounts are and that the application's live um so you'll hear from us by email sadaf asked if the funds are expected to be released by next summer is there a timeline to spend these funds since it is for fiscal year 2023 so the phrase one one-year funding is um definitely confusing you don't have to spend it within a year um but it comes from one fiscal year's appropriation bill so uh to your question is there timeline to spend those funds uh yes but it's a long timeline and so i think uh those will depend on the accounts uh and i can try and get you more information off um but i don't think you feel the need to spend it within a very short period of time it it's obviously gonna depend on what the project is um but um yeah i understand how the phrase one year fund can be a little confusing in terms of the constraints and spending that money catherine asks do you anticipate seeing any cultural history or art accounts um short answers i don't know um i certainly hope so um i think uh for cultural history art projects the degree to which you can connect those to local economic development i think really helps for making a compelling application one of the projects we funded last year was a renovation of the waukegan carnegie library which is definitely a cultural space but they applied through the economic development initiative account because of um the economic impacts that uh library renovation would have in downtown waukegan um and so the degree to which you can uh connect um uh that story to things like economic development i think is helpful pastor robertson asks are building construction projects eligible so there are um capital expenditures um like construction eligible within certain accounts but not every account allows for construction funding so as you're looking at the different accounts it should be clear which allow for capital expenditures and which don't but if you have any questions please feel free to be in touch debbie asked if we have a portion of the funding for a project saved in our account will that impact our ability to request for the full quote uh no i i think um if you already have some funding set aside for a project um and uh we're able to secure the full amount for the project um i think you're certainly allowed to use that savings elsewhere but it's obviously going to really depend on a case-by-case basis and joan asks this and i know carmen has also asked me this as well are library expansion projects eligible so again um certain accounts allow for capital expenditures one of those is the economic development initiative um some of the new accounts might and so i think as you look at the different accounts seeing whether or not capital expenditures are an allowable use of funds is something you should be looking at okay nicole responded back about does federal qbs apply for uh consultant selection to be eligible for grant reimbursement so i think she's asking can grant selection uh grant consultant selection be part of the project costs and would that be um you know getting the application develop the pre-qualification stuff does that count for the actual project if i'm understanding the question correctly i don't think so um because as with all expenses um these funds cannot be used to reimburse and so if you use a consultant to develop an application i don't believe the payment towards that consultant is an eligible expense because you've already spent it and it would thus be a reimbursement but nicole feel free to give me a call we can talk this through uh michael asked a great clarifying question is appropriation when the project is approved or is appropriation when money is released um great question um i would say appropriation is when uh the bill is signed into law because that locks in the process for disbursing the funds and where the funds can be used um and uh so the disbursement of money is a separate step in the process i think the appropriation is when the bill the funding bill spending bill was signed into law robert asks could money be used for a local incident command center at a police department i believe so yes that should be an eligible expense under the emergency operations center uh grant program which is capped at a million dollars um but we were successful at securing some of those funds last time and so um uh robert if you have any questions uh please feel free to reach out and definitely check out the application that lake county submitted last year for the 911 center that's on our website and it would be a great starting place for developing a strong application and jro asked would the construction of a new water well and well house in a community be eligible i believe so um uh but um jarrow let's let's talk um once the new accounts are released uh to make sure before you start to put together your application we received some water wells uh applications last time and i i need to refresh my memory on which account they applied under but the short answer is i i'm pretty sure but let's talk offline once the new accounts are released and we can get you a firm answer i think and don't quote me on this but i believe it was epa there's a few accounts there for water and then also yes i think that's right yeah i think that's right there's a lot of water issues in our district both drinking water and storm water for storm water definitely check out fema and hazard mitigation um next question peggy any ideas if any of the new accounts will be added we'll be supporting broadband programs um the short answer is yes there's a usda program called reconnect which supports rural broadband and so there is funding for broadband broadband programs the challenge is in order to be eligible the entity has to be in what is classified as a rural area and the usda has specific criteria on what constitutes a rural area and what doesn't and so i know that the illinois 10th district has more rural areas with our new district so it's possible there are eligible entities but there is that big restriction on how those funds can be used uh because they have to be used in a rural area so peggy i hope that answers your question but i i anticipate most of the 10th district would not be eligible for that program all right and we had a couple questions on that one-year spending um if you could clarify it basically the project timeline even though you're asking for money only in fiscal year 2023 is a timeline eligible to be multiple years or does it only have to be that one year spent yeah so you're only going to get one year's worth of appropriations uh which is to say you're only going to get funding for that project in one bill passed for a given fiscal year but if you spend that money over the course of several years on your end that's fine um there uh there are some constraints and um i can try and make sure that it's posted on our website but the short answer is if you use the funds over several years that's 100 fine um michael asked are you oh sorry and you expect the bill to be signed into law around october michael i um i kind of laughed because we certainly hope it to be but one of the challenges here in congress is that there's always a lot of uncertainty around the appropriations process um and so um if uh congress and the house and senate get their act together then all of our appropriation bills should be passed by september 30th and signed into law but unfortunately if you look at the past two decades that doesn't always happen so um the last fiscal year the omnibus was not signed until march about halfway through that fiscal year um and so all that is to say uh that's how the process is supposed to work in terms of getting things signed uh before october um but if uh past is precedent um there's a lot of uncertainty about whether or not we'll actually follow that timeline so sorry to give you an uncertain answer uh but it's unfortunately an uncertain process yeah anytime you read in the news that we passed another continuing resolution it means we're kicking the can down the road and that everything is just on hold yeah as as greg said there's a lot of hurry up and wait in this process uh which is frustrating for you all having already uh you know at that point submitted your projects um but um there's a lot of the legislative process that is outside of our control and kevin clarified his question my question about multi-year spending was about the proposal can the proposal be a multi-year one yes so a good example is the college of lake county's workforce development program that we funded last fiscal year we expect that to continue uh beyond one year but we provided them with one uh with one fiscal year's worth of funding so again the best way to think about this kevin is um you're not going to get a series of funding over the course of several years you're not going to get federal funding over a longer timeline you're going to get one lump sum but if you opt to use that lump sum over the course of a multi-year timeline that's fine so the proposal can be multi-year but you need to know that you can only rely on a lump sum i know that that can get a little uh tricky and confusing so i'll try and post some more clarified information on the website so that you can look back on that as a reference all right and i think that's the end of the questions in the chat if anyone wants to raise their hand and answer question live we've got a few more minutes left as we wait i'll just remind everyone we will post these slides on our website again at schneider.house.gov appropriations and then also we'll do another we'll announce our application we'll go live on our website next week and then we're going to do a follow-up webinar we'll cover a lot of the same information but by that time we will know the accounts so right now we're saying hypothetically we believe these accounts are going to be there but next week on our conference call we will know the actual accounts and we can address those specifically peggy to your question about the best way to get some time on the calendar to address any questions you have uh just shoot me an email shoot greg an email and we can carve out a couple minutes um i think i definitely encourage everyone to read uh the full page on our website uh before coming to us with questions our hope was to provide uh the answers to a lot of your questions there but we also want to be a resource and so feel free to shoot us an email we can set up some time but thanks everyone for tuning in um uh and i think uh as i said there's a lot of this information that we have there's some that we don't but as you have questions please feel free to reach out great thank you tommy and thanks everyone for attending thanks greg take care everyone you

Thank You Sal secretaries for being here today i would suggest just before we close this hearing that there as you know there are differences of opinion obviously on the wildland designation of it's meant to reduce loss at lawsuits i think it's going to increase lawsuits because i think every decision you make on wild lands whether you're going to allow for oil and gas drilling or wind turbines or recreation or whatever you will be seated a suit over it that's a concern to me and i would like at some point in time to get into a broader discussion of how much of your budget is actually meant is is set to try to try to defend your decisions in court how much money are we spend it in court rather than managing the lands between interior and the Forest Service I think it's a huge amounts of money and yet on the other hand we don't want to take away people's rights to have a say in how we manage our public lands how do we do that we can find some compromise where we can maintain people's rights to have a say in management of lands but not spend so darn much money in court and instead spend it on the on managing our public lands so i'll be happy to work with you on the wildlands issue i know that there i'm tempted to a since mr. Moran a good friend came back how many proposals are acres in upstate New York or Alexandria is BLM looking at the designated while answer but I'm not going to ask that so there are many other questions that we have but most of them will be for the bureau heads whether it's wild horse and burro burrows and the amount of money we're spending on trying to maintain that herd and and what we're doing there I think to request this year is something like 78 million dollars or something like that and whether it's the Idaho bull trout will ask Fish and Wildlife Service about about that and its impact on that but I do appreciate you being here today and taking your time and answering the questions of the committee

I rise today to speak in support of s 151 the traced act in 2018 alone phone numbers with 507 & 734 area codes in my district received over two hundred twenty three million robo calls I know I received a bunch of them not only are these calls bothersome and unwelcome but they often lead to scams that prey on the most vulnerable one such scam is the One Ring scam which attempts to trick consumers into paying huge fees for return phone calls s 151 includes important legislation that I work to have included which will end the harmful practice of One Ring scams mr. speaker robo calls are not only a nuisance but they pose a threat to individual's privacy and security s 151 the traced act will help put a stop to these harmful practices by empowering phone carriers to implement call authentication technologies so consumers can trust their caller ID with no additional cost it will also expand and streamline the FCC's enforcement authority to take strong a quick action when it tracks down robo calls and levies fines against those bad actors in the end mr. speaker this legislation will put a stop to these predatory actors behind harmful robo calls and put consumers back in charge of their phones with that I yield back

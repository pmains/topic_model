we're back with Democratic Center Tim Kaine of Virginia I know you have dealt with a number of mass shootings as governor and senator in the state of Virginia I wonder your thoughts on Monterey Park this morning Margaret it's uh it's just like scar tissue that keeps getting reopened every time these things happen we're reminded in Virginia of the shooting at Virginia Tech in April of 2007. my heart goes out to this community I'm worried that the perpetrator is still at large so let's first make sure that the law enforcement has the support to catch them and then we need to support those survivors and all who've been affected all right Senator we have to take a quick break and I want to talk to you more on the other side of it we'll be right back welcome back to Face the Nation and we continue our conversation with Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia uh Senator yesterday for the fifth time we learned about this other tranche of classified information being kept at the president's um personal uh residence how does it Senator accidentally take classified material home um Margaret I don't really know the answer to that question um because I I review classified material as a senator on the armed services and Foreign Relations committees but when I do it it's always in a classified facility where I don't have access to the materials other than to sit there and read them so that's why there needs to be this independent investigation and independent prosecutor how many documents are we talking about dozens a handful or hundreds how serious are they um why were they taken did anyone have access to them and then is the president being cooperative and I think by all accounts it suggests that yes of course he's being cooperative as as anyone should be but these are the reasons why this independent prosecutor and an investigation is necessary you're one of the few Senate Democrats who've said you know that you have concern about this issue um I wonder how concerned you are and politically doesn't this damage the White House and the president in terms of trust and credibility well again those questions do depend on the answer to the uh that we'll get in this investigation I mean Margaret you you know this government has a tendency to over classify if they are looking at a document and they have to analyze to decide whether to classify sometimes they just Market classified I'll read it in the Skip and say Margaret was reporting on that a month ago or the Washington Post has been telling me this for the last six months so you do have to see what's the scope how serious did anyone have access and those questions have to be answered before you know we decide is this how significant an issue is this right and that may take some time I want to ask you about some of the the business that Congress will have to get to soon as you know the White House wants a clean lift to the debt limit with no strings attached Center Mansion said it's a mistake for the White House to refuse to negotiate with Republicans do you think that position is changing is it a mistake well first we should we should have a clean lift of the debt ceiling because the 14th Amendment to the Constitution says nobody should question the credit worthiness of the United States this is about whether the U.S pays a credit card or not and I don't think anyone should flirt with not paying the the US's credit card which is what Republicans are doing so the White House position is correct we should raise the debt ceiling but if Republicans are saying they won't do it and they're threatening our credit worthiness because they want Cuts let them put cuts on the table is it the cutting Social Security and Medicare that Rick Scott wanted to do is it cutting Aid to Ukraine in the middle of a war between a a democracy and an illegally invading dictator let them put on the table what they want to cut so that the American public can see what their priorities are speaker McCarthy has said the president has invited him to speak you have a conversation and discuss a responsible lift to the debt ceiling so what does that mean how does this politically get dressed up so we avoid the cliff well um at first that's a good thing I'm I'm very very happy that the president and speaker McCarthy are talking that's really positive um how do we fix this um Jeff Merkley and I have a bill that's based upon an earlier fix that Senator McConnell LED during the Obama Administration when there was a similar brinksmanship around the debt ceiling and Senator McConnell said look we will allow the president to raise it subject to a congressional disapproval and that was done and we think that should be the norm anyway so we have a bill called the protect our credit act that would basically say the president has got to cover the debts of the United States and if that includes raising the debt ceiling the president can do that but if Congress disapproves then you can have an expedited up or down vote in Congress and I think that's the right solution to this uh before I let you go you're on armed services How concerned are you that Secretary of Defense Austin left Germany with no agreement among Western allies to provide tanks to Ukraine Margaret there are there are some differences about exactly what and What's the timing in terms of providing equipment but we have assembled a global coalition to support Ukraine the unity has been very strong and the support bipartisan and bicameral and Congress has been very strong and I think that will continue Senator Kane thank you for your time today

the chair recognizes mr. Posey Thank You Madame chair for holding this hearing and I thank the witnesses for coming and sharing with us today previous IG and Gao reports have indicated there have been some issues with the XYZ ground system software I wonder if you could update me on the status that mr. Bowersox first the latest I'm hearing is that we're getting through those issues and we should be on track to meet whatever earliest Artemus one date we can get when we can get the stage they're the ground systems gonna be ready is what I'm here anyone else want to come in say just generally the delays being experienced on the hardware side has given the software side more time to work out through their issues the the hardest part is always on the ground system side that is at Kennedy because they have to respond to any changing requirements for Orion and SLS so the extent that there's still some changes going on they'll always be some changes going on on the software side okay thank you following up on a question of mr. crisp previously asked about the second mobile launch platform why did it take so long to issue a contract for that I'll get back to you on details on that one sir I'm not exactly sure that was a little before my time but I know we're underway right now and planning to start construction at the end of the year you know has the delay of construction prevent SLS from complying with the NASA authorization requirements to reach a thurid 30 tonne launch capacity I wouldn't say that that delay is going to interfere with reaching that particular goal there's probably other complexities that might delay us from getting to that goal but it is still our eventual goal at around Artemis 9 or 10 okay how confident are you that we'll have boots on the moon by 2024 how confident well I wouldn't bet my oldest child's upcoming birthday present or anything like that but what I'll tell you is having that aggressive goal is really good for us it is helping us focus it's helping us keep track of what's important inside our agency and so we're working towards it as as hard as we can and I think it's healthy for our whole our whole organization do you think I think we'll make it um well we're gonna do our best to make it but like I said what's important is that we launch when we're ready that we have a successful mission when it launches and and I'm not going to sit here and tell you that just arbitrarily we're going to make it we have to have a lot of things come together to make it happen we have to get our funding we have to balance our resources with our requirements and then we've got to execute it really well and so there's a lot of risk to making the date but we want to try to do it okay mr. cook what do you think are you placing your bets I I wouldn't I would agree with with Ken on what he said I I think it's important to have the urgency in the program to get things done these programs require constant problem-solving and and it's a it's a there there's a way to go to get to the moon based on the things that have to be done but the sense of urgency is important in programs so it's not business as usual you're working off problems but I support getting to the moon as soon as possible I I don't have insight into the exact program schedules and details but so I couldn't honestly I couldn't honestly say but but I support getting there as quickly as possible okay miss chaplain yeah I also agree that having aspirational goals is good it's still a lot of risk in getting there you're you're having to manage a lot of programs that need a lot of new development within a short period of time but to manage things like that there are some things you can do like having a very detailed architecture to help you manage all that overlap that you're going to be experiencing having good configuration management so changes are introduced people can really weigh the cost of those changes and the effects they have and understand the implications that they have having good visibility and the progress and being very open and transparent is very necessary so that you guys understand what's ahead maybe what more resources are needed and then having very good communication lines within the agency and with contractors is important what do you think the ads our commercial will beat you mr. barrows Lux odds the commercial will beat us to the moon yeah I'd still bet on us all right but they might be part of our program that's cooked I agree with that answer I'd I believe that the program that that was laid out for going to the moon is is the best chance of getting there and to do it as simply as possible will will get us there the quickest there is a role for commercial in this I don't I don't know that anybody can beat the government program because of its capabilities I see my time is expired I yield back thank you

it's been two years since this pandemic started and we still have limited access to therapeutics again as we all know the biden administration's approach to this is to put all their eggs in one basket they believed in a one-size-fits-all approach vaccine mandates mask and testing was there a prescription to get us through this pandemic and all those have had a place and all of them have had some successes but when a million people in one day are testing positive it's not surprising we can't keep up with the testing and that's why we need therapeutics in fact the federal government has allocated over 80 billion dollars for testing 80 billion dollars for testing and only 15 billion dollars for therapeutics this is simply unacceptable two years into this pandemic and we've only spent 15 billion dollars on therapeutics the biden administration should have already established established an operation warp speed approach to the development manufacturing and distribution of therapeutics it just always seems like this administration has been a day late and a dollar short for example in mid-2021 we saw the delta wave coming we all knew it was coming and we had real world evidence in the summer of 2021 to suggest that a booster shot would be helpful for seniors and at-risk individuals and it was in june of 2020 that i asked the cdc and the fda to consider letting physicians meet with their patients and prescribe a booster ahead of the delta wave again summer of 2020. unfortunately the fda waited until september the 22nd to approve the booster between june and september more than 11 000 seniors died from breakthrough infections why more than 230 000 people tested positive no doubt a booster and or therapeutics could have made a big difference in these seniors lives it's easy to talk about the mistakes we've made with this virus i want to spend a moment talking about solutions though we need to unleash our community health centers and our county health departments in this cova 19 fight they've been the backbone of vaccination and treatment for communicable diseases for decades once the byte administration agrees to prioritize therapeutics we need community health centers and county health departments to take over the telemedicine visits with trained nurses and implement treatment protocols across the united states in kansas alone we have over 200 community health centers and clinics funded with federal dollars along with over 100 local health departments that are accustomed to dealing with infectious diseases on a daily basis these folks can implement these protocols based upon triaging at-risk individuals and starting early treatment this will prevent many trips to the yard as well as hospitalization early treatment is what works and finally just goes without saying that i trust these nurses to make necessary referrals to the emergency room they can do this how do i know it i've worked with these nurses for 30 years i helped sponsor was the medical director for three county health departments for almost 30 years they do an incredible job they're well equipped to handle this effort but they need the biden administration to move on therapeutics and move fast the medicines you could get for less than a hundred dollars can oftentimes prevent hospitalizations and icu visits we need to give doctors the options of using therapeutics along with steroids anti-inflammatories and other standard protocols that have developed by these physicians who have treated literally thousands of copa 19 patients certainly if we had better access to monoclonal antibodies where these numerical antiviral agents were available we could use them as well but please let's empower physicians and these health departments and community health centers these experienced nurses to do their job time is precious we cannot afford additional delays we can't afford more confusion more mis-messaging and more mismanagement the biden administration must let patients and physicians decide what's best in their unique health care situation not somebody who's sitting on the throne in washington dc who seldom sees patients in the real world thank you madam president i yield back

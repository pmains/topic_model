can you assure us of reliability or that we would not be a blackout or brownout how is that worded again could you share with me how that question came and you said no you could not assure but gina you said miss mccarthy she you said yes you could so what was the question absolutely assured that we could not prevent yes are you yielding and i i thank the gentleman for his courtesy can you assure us that reliability will not be in jeopardy during this time period please okay yes or no okay thank you thank you so having there was a yes or there's a no and a yes so mr mueller do you do you agree with the epa that they can give us that assurance well i never make any assurances on reliability so between two of you you heard her just testify that she could well my question to you from your position you're not miss mccarthy i'll get back to you okay so mr mueller we're working hard to make sure that we have a process with the epa that deals with the timing issues we haven't resolved that yet it's of great concern to me that we have the proper process that that allows our reliability experts to weigh in on the individual load pocket situations where a major plant or maybe even a minor plant is shut down but because of where it is in the grid it's necessary perhaps to maintain voltage support for that if i could take from the excuse former chairman the answer is a yes or no do you agree do you agree that she could make that statement uh that she can assure it i did not make that statement you did not i did not i'm sorry i misunderstood i thought you said yes you could place to address those issues i'm sorry i assured the gentleman could you speak a little closer to your mic you oh sorry i'm sorry to interrupt but i did not make assurances and epa is not in the reliability business and i understand that well that's for sure it was yeah there are processes in place to address reliability concerns as they arise okay i just thought your answer back to chairman dingle was uh was yes i think i made it very clear that i assured him that there were processes in place to address issues related to reliability now at the last time ms mccarthy you were here you there was a discussion between you and the doe and it was uh about some of the the new regs that were out and especially with the discharge and you seemed taken back by the fact that the doe had just reduced spending you were saying how carbon capture and the like but doe had just cut the funding for research on that have you found out have you done have you raised a question about why did they cut back on on carbon capture i'm sorry i don't i do recollect that issue coming up and i know it was related to the greenhouse gas news source performance standard but i i do not uh have any further information at this point to share with you i hesitate with all due respect i hesitate to ask you to eventually get back to us because i'm still waiting since last january for information from your office but if you could please i'd like to understand your position if you're if you're pushing for carbon capture but yet doe is cutting funding in research i i think it's it's it's a contradiction here uh that the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing and something that affects us on energy policy congressman if there is something that we owe you at any length in time in terms of response i i will take care of that immediately but i but i will say that the rule that that you're referencing is based on technologies that we believe is available today and that was one of the questions we asked yes show me where one plant that has that commercially available when mit is doing the mit's carbon capture initiative right now is underway to to try to to try to get to a point but you're representing that it's a commercially you said that you was commercially available and we asked name one plant in america that has a facility like this and you said you get back to us i apologize pardon me i'm still waiting away can you name one now i'm terrible with names they all sound so nice when you name utilities um oh no i didn't say oh we're over you you you gentlemen's times you beat the bell thank you very much chair recognized gentleman from oregon mr walden for five minutes thank the gentleman uh i know when the president was running for office president obama said that you know his his idea on coal was to end up with uh did the gentleman yield yes i i didn't see my colleague from uh the neighboring state here so you're recognizing starbucks for five minutes i would yield back and start over at a later date yeah you need to rework your statement anyway your helmet around so thank you mr chairman i appreciate it um i'm i'm still getting my head around the issues here but i certainly understand why a power plant or a company that is exercising its best efforts to try to make transitions and take steps to meet environmental standards if something occurs that forces them to exceed to a reliability requirement and therefore they are put into conflict with some of these standards that they would under those circumstances expect to get some protection from liability and other exposure because they are exercising all the best

that's thank you Mr Speaker I rise today in strong support of HR 2 the moving forward act at home we've seen firsthand the effects of our nation's aging and overburdened infrastructure and crumbling roads and that in adequate public transit and more frequent floods but today's package is not simply about rebuilding our roads bridges and rail though it does all that the moving forward act is about making smart transformative investments in our future investing in rebuilding school infrastructure to help them safely reopen expanding Internet access to underserved communities to close the digital divide and creating millions of good-paying jobs in the process lifting up entire communities I am particularly proud this legislation has been designed with addressing that climate crisis as a top priority climate change is an existential threat we see it in rising lake levels a record level in Lake Michigan we see it across the country and stronger storms and longer hurricane seasons in longer fire seasons in disrupted growing seasons we have to act now we have to reduce emissions we have to build resiliency and to that end I am proud that this act includes two clean energy provisions I've previously introduced to promote electric vehicle charging stations and incentivized wastes to heat power projects the comprehensive package is transformative legislation that will ensure our nation's infrastructure is built to ensure our success in the 21st century I urge my college colleagues to join us in support of this important legislation I yield back

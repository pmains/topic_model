listen it is it is nice to be here on the floor on a Monday evening and to hear final passage by unanimous consent of a bill to recognize and honor the life of our former Congressman Don young Don passed in in March unexpectedly after 49 years in service and it's always hard to to figure out appropriate ways to recognize the life of a true public servant as as Congressman young truly was and so the Alaska delegation Senator Sullivan and and myself at the time really reached out to to try to find those ways that might be appropriate means of recognition and we can name buildings as we are doing in this legislation renaming a federal courthouse in in Fairbanks after Congressman young we can rename institutions as we are doing in this bill and in recognizing the Alaska Job Corps Center now as the Don young Alaska Job Corps Center and you can also do it through naming of monuments and we have certainly a fair number of mountains lakes rivers in in the state of Alaska that are pretty extraordinary but it just didn't seem appropriate and fitting that a regular Mountain should be renamed after the the congressman um I had an opportunity to serve with him for many years he uh for really all of my life I think he has been my congressman I've known his uh I've known him in his softer side and certainly in his Gruff and more explosive side and so as we were looking for something that might be fitting we look not only mountains but we looked at mountains that continue to blow their top to this very day and selected a a volcano on the Aleutian Islands that is is currently named I believe it's pronounced Mount cerebus and we have through this this designation um designated this volcano in the Eastern aleutians after our former Congressman fitting tributes to a giant of a man and one that I think of every day I know alaskans think of the contributions that he has made so in this in this simple res resolution recognizing and honoring the congressman whether it is institutions buildings or volcanoes Don Young's name will live for quite some period of time so I'm pleased to actually be here on the floor with my friend and colleague Senator Sullivan to to to recognize this evening

so briefly you think there's common ground on a green new deal in medical you think you can get Republican votes for that yes the largest modern Republican can I tell you why because I believe it so the green New Deal is three things these are not new ideas it is infrastructure which is widely bipartisan more money for mass transit more money for electric grids more money for rural water supplies roads bridges everything the second piece of the green New Deal is jobs it's all about training people to do wind solar geothermal hydro power biofuels and we do that in New York we have amazing SUNY schools where 98% of the graduates have three or more job offers and all they teach is green energy LED certified building materials it works and the third part of the green New Deal is clean air and clean water and I can't think of a more universal issue when you go to upstate New York they have pollution because of pfoa and PTFE the same things chew in in New Hampshire you go to a place like Iowa they have nitrates in their water because of farming no matter where you go you go to Michigan they have horrible pollution in their water it doesn't matter if it's an inner city or a rural area it's something that binds us and and being a mother back to the whole point of this week we're in it's the thing that we all have in common we love our children we don't want our children to be poisoned by the water they drink or the air that they breathe

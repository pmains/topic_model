in washington democratic lawmakers are trying to codify the right to contraception into federal law but that bill appears to be stalled in the senate and a new poll by morning consult in politico found that three out of four registered voters support federal protections for birth control and joining us now is nevada senator jackie rosen senator we appreciate you making time to be with us you helped introduce this legislation to codify the right to contraception as we noted it is stalled right now why is that well first of all thank you for having me this morning and thank you for bringing up this really important topic because since the 1960s the 1960s women have had the right to have access to birth control and we can't go back and we can no longer stand on stand unprecedent we know the supreme court and their recent rulings will not respect president so it's really important that we pass this bill the right to contraception to give women the right to plan their families particularly as maga extreme back of republicans want to introduce possibly a nationwide abortion ban the ability for women to plan their families to make their reproductive health choices couldn't be more important so we're hoping to move it forward uh did pass overwhelmingly in the house with bipartisan support hoping that we can get those 10 votes here in the senate so just for clarity for people we recognize your desire for this to happen but what's your confidence level that this is something that can be passed before the august recess well we've been talking within our caucus and of course with leader schumer about getting this on the calendar we've been talking with our colleagues i think that everyone understands this is a right for women we've had this since the 1960s why would we want to go back it's important that we put into law that women should be able to make their own choices for birth control like i said we're just going to do everything we can to find those 10 votes but really the most important votes are going to come in november where we need to protect and expand our democratic majority to be sure that women have the right to protect their own reproductive health care choices make them for themselves and that appears to be the big takeaway here as it relates let me ask you a quick question the president has said he'd be open to eliminating the filibuster rule as it relates to reproductive rights the right to an abortion you support that would you also support that as it relates to contraception well i think it's important that we explore all options i will absolutely take a look at carving it out for those things like i said women we make up fifty percent of the population maybe even more and it's important that we have the ability to make the choices that are right for us and i can tell you that the maga extreme republicans in state after state as they try to impose these cruel bans on women's health care for no no exceptions for rape or incest or life of the mother and so women will die women are showing up to the emergency rooms unable to get critical health care so i'm interested i'll explore all options to make that happen women's lives are on the line and we have to take care of women across this nation senator quick final thought here obviously this effort is sort of a preemptive one given what we saw with the reversal of roe v wade there's been frustration among some democrats at the white house wasn't perhaps more prepared for that decision from the nation's highest court hasn't done more uh in the time since are you satisfied with what you're seeing from from the white house on that issue and what more do you want to see happen right now well i urge the president to do ever take every executive action that he can in order to protect women's health care reproductive health care what specifically would you like him to do in addition to what he's already done well i can tell you that they're exploring all options that they have an administrative level and so whether it's thinking about using federal lands using other types of things that that they can do i can tell you that they need to look at this in a legal context so what is going to pass muster for executive action and so in the meantime we here in the senate can muster up the votes for the right to contraception act of course we surely want to pass the respect for marriage act that's also really important we have a lot of bills on the floor these next few weeks for health care to lower health care prices to bring the computer chip manufacturing so we're working on positive responses to all of this we're going to let the administration their legal team see what is feasible and we're going to hear in the senate try to do what we can senator jackie rosen of nevada we appreciate you making time to be with us thank you so much

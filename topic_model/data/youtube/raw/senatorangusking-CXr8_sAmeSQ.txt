well from where I'm joined by senator angus King of Maine he's a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee and an independent member of the Senate well would it just lay this out for the average person what what what went wrong here what were the Russians involved with putting ads in facebook to create trouble politically apparently for the Democrats well they're two paths that are being used that we that we know if one is a good old ad your Facebook page comes up and sometimes a little ad comes up that says buy some boots from LL Bean but in this case an ad came up and said Hillary Clinton wants to read your emails or you know something we don't know what the content Facebook hasn't said that but they have said that they were highly provocative ads to sort of get people upset in the early parts of the tooth of 2007 the kind of gender in sex issues we sexual issues that do stir people's emotions yeah and and but then the other I think even more insidious is the creation we know that these folks and in Russia they're getting good at this create a fake identity so that you have a comment from what you think is a person a real person that says hey check out the DC leaks website and you'll see some amazing stuff about Hillary well DC leaks was set up by Russia and it was a source of a lot of the leaked emails so this is a very insidious manipulation using social media like Facebook and Twitter and I think what we're what we've seen this week is probably just the beginning well how can someone the president included say the Russians weren't involved in trying to mess with our elections well they were I mean you can't say that I mean the the evidence is absolutely overwhelming now the evident where not the the Trump campaign cooperated or work with the Russians that's an open question we don't know the answer to that and that's what my committee the Senate Intelligence Committee House Intelligence mr. Muller they're all looking at that but the underlying question which I think is really important Chris but people are missing to some extent is the Russians really tried to screw up our election not only things like leaked emails fake news and that kind of thing but also by getting into state election system voter registrations and what worries me as this wasn't a one-off they're gonna be back in 2018 and 2020 so you think they might be down the road trying to create another Florida mm weather is it just mass chaos in some state absolutely they can they can go in one of two directions or both at the same time I think in 2016 they started out simply wanting to sow distrust they wanted to undermine the system and frankly they did a pretty good job of it but then they got in all the intelligence is that they decided at some point in 2016 they were going to try to help Donald Trump get elected whether they liked him or didn't like Hillary that son they were ahead of a lot of us well he knew he could win and they were saying that Gary but but what we have to focus on is how do we prevent this from happening again keep on it thank you much senator angus King

thank you madam speaker i rise in recognition of a rochester new york legend and beloved veteran gary baikirk who sadly passed away december 26th at the age of 74. with little regard for his own safety sergeant baiker's conspicuous gallantry in intrepidity in action at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty earned him the prestigious medal of honor in 1973. his story of selfless valor is so revered in rochester that our vietnam veterans memorial at highland park bears his name sergeant by kirk went on to become a pastor and beloved school counselor whose presence empathy and service will impact our community for generations to come i close with the words of general george patton it is foolish and wrong to mourn the men who died rather we should thank god that such men lived i thank god for the life of gary baikirk thank you madam speaker

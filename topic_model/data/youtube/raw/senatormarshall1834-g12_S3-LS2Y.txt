mr president senator from kansas i rise today in support of sj resolution 38 a resolution to terminate the covet 19 national emergency declaration after nearly two years of living under this state of emergency the american people are worn out and yearning to breathe free they long for their god-given freedoms and for leaders to take their side we as a nation must begin to learn to live with covet the robust powers this emergency declaration provides the federal government are no longer necessary and congress must debate and ultimately repeal them in order to begin the process of unwinding the powers the government took hold up during the peak of the crisis as we contemplate what returning to normal means most americans accept that kobut will likely never be entirely behind us and setting zero covet cases as a victory condition is more harmful than good that being said of course we have to respect the virus and protect the vulnerable but we also must accept that personal responsibility not government mandates and restrictions must govern our approach to the virus going forward we must repeal this emergency declaration today to deliver a symbolic victory to our citizens that normalcy is around the corner and that limited government and our constitutional rights still reign supreme it's high time to stop talking about restrictions in the unknown we must chart a new course to victory today that respects the virus and our freedoms let's look back on the recent history of this national emergency declaration on march 13 2020 president trump first declared the national emergency concerning the novel coronavirus disease outbreak two days prior following an alarming rate of transmission the world health organization had declared covet 19 as a global pandemic little was known about the rapidly spreading virus at the time but president trump's declaration was intended to grant himself as chief executive additional authorities to bolster the federal government's efforts to control the virus and ease the burden on her health care system less than a week later california became the first state to issue a statewide stay-at-home order and lockdowns mass mandates school closures and capacity limits commenced all across the nation these were the earliest and most frightening days of the pandemic when are understanding of the virus was minimal and all measures were needed to react to a global contagion unlike anything seen in nearly a century almost a year later in just over a month after his inauguration in february 2021 president biden justifiably went on to extend the covet 19 national emergency declaration for another year a requirement under the national emergencies act that had not been acted on would have resulted in the automatic termination of the declaration at the time of president biden's initial extension only 50 million doses of the vaccine had been administered and eligibility was largely limited to health care workers first responders and the most vulnerable populations it would still be weeks or months before all adults would be eligible in all 50 states bio treatments and therapeutics were scarcely available to the public all the while the potentially more severe and contagious delta variant was brewing in other regions of the world before it was detected and became the dominant variant here at home the situation on the ground in the united states has changed drastically since those early stages of the pandemic thanks to american innovation and operation warm speed the united states has now multiple vaccines available to all americans over the age of five everyone ages 12 and older is eligible for a booster shot if they want that inoculation in fact more than 550 million shots have been administered in the united states with 215 million people fully vaccinated including 89 percent of individuals 65 and older additionally the fda has authorized two oral antivirals and monoclonal antibody treatments are available for those at high risk of becoming seriously ill well done well done omicron is now the dominant variant in the united states accounting for 97 percent of the cases while more contagious omicron tends to result in more mild symptoms than infected individuals in kansas the daily case average in recent weeks has decreased 99 let me say that again the daily case average has decreased 99 hospitalizations are down about 80 percent and deaths are down 98 percent nationally we are seeing drastic decreases in these same three categories as well but perhaps even more importantly today at least 94 percent of americans have some level of immunization states in every corner of the nation are repealing indoor mass mandates including blue states who have who have most adamantly enforced them yes indeed freedom-loving americans who are worn out by the draconian lockdowns and mandates are giving a sigh of relief despite all these advances in our possession of a much greater understanding of the virus president biden stealthily extended the national emergency declaration once again on a late friday afternoon two weeks ago next let us lay some of the effects these policies have had on the american people and why we must abandon this approach shrink the federal response and move towards a more nimble and effectively locally based community strategy that allows individual citizens and local health officials to exercise and promote old-fashioned self-responsibility and individual choice mr president the first coven 19 wave in the spring of 2020 took the world by surprise the spread of the cases globally and in the united states was met with government ordered lockdowns abroad and here at home in just a few weeks lockdown spent more than 10 million americans out of work with 6.6 million people applying for unemployment benefits in the last week of march alone these lockdowns some of which extended for months in certain states and the subsequent mandates and requirements that still remain in place have had dramatically negative impacts on our quality of life and have been mentally beneficial a recent study from john hopkins university found lockdowns only reduced the coba 19 death rate by 0.2 percent 0.2 percent two out of a thousand these researchers noted that while lockdowns have had little to no public health effects they've imposed enormous economic and social cost where they've been adopted these costs have been felt at an alarming rate in a number of aspects of american life drug overdose deaths rose by 30 percent in 2020 hitting the highest number ever recorded symptoms of anxiety or depressive disorder and the use of mental health care among adults increased by 36 percent from august 2020 to february of 2021. the numbers for our children are even more troubling our children our grandchildren the cdc found between march and october 2020 emergency department visits for mental health emergencies rose by 24 for children's ages 5 through 11 and 31 for children ages 12 to 17 years in addition emergency department visits were suspected suicide attempts increased nearly 51 among girls ages 12 through 17. 51 in early 2021 compared to the same period in 2019 school closures in the 2020 2020-2021 academic year left students on average five months behind on mathematics and four months behind in reading disadvantaged and low-income schools disproportionately disproportionately of course felt that impact these societal ills have been compounded by mass mandates vaccine mandates and isolation orders keeping this emergency declaration in place will cause will cause public health officials and governments at all levels to maintain the possibility of allowing them to remain or resurrecting them and much like america's alcohol prohibition a century ago these mandates will make criminals out of all of us as we all are guilty of disregarding them at one time or another this only creates more disrespect for the law and order we can't allow this to happen and i have to add this the mortality rate from covid for the united states is 75 higher than sweden's 75 percent higher than sweden's despite sweden issuing no shutdowns or mass mandates not surprisingly the sweden economy is humming ahead of ours at five percent rate above pre-pandemic levels all this being said once again i beg this administration and the national media to stop fear-mongering to share all the science and please let our people go the democrats covet obsession has also resulted in out of control spending and massive debt congress has appropriated six trillion dollars that's six times ten to the twelve six with twelve zeros after it six trillion dollars to respond to this crisis this means federal spending to combat the pandemic has well surpassed the 4.1 trillion the us doll u.s spent waging world war ii throw in the roughly one and a half trillion dollars on world war one the korean war vietnam and the gulf war combined and it still would not exceed what's been spent on covet relief let me say that another way we borrowed from my children my grandchildren your children and grandchildren we've borrowed and spent more money on cova than all the major wars combined from the 20th century why the 2.2 trillion dollar cares act passed with nearly unanimous consent of both this body and the house president biden and the democrats in congress insisted more was needed despite warnings from economists on all ends of the political spectrum that it would harm our economy democrats ran through a highly partisan 1.9 trillion dollars more of a spending package that has overheated our economy this bill was a response to a problem that was already fixing itself shockingly i have to point out only nine percent of this funding was related to health care and less than one percent was dedicated to vaccines instead the funding like the drawn out unnecessary heavy-handed health restrictions was meant to implement drastic changes in our way of life and systems of governance and expand big government socialism not to mention has resulted in the highest level of inflation we've seen in this country in 40 years as one economist put it the u.s stimulus has been in a category of its own and has resulted in more inflation than almost any other advanced economy in the world with hundreds of billions of dollars of funds for schools and state governments unspent the president announced during the state of the union that he plans to spend a supplemental coveted relief funding request to congress our nation's emergency posture this virus is driving out of control spending fueling inflation and strapping our children and again our grandchildren with more than 30 trillion dollars in debt indeed at this time our national debt is a greater threat to our nation than covet this alone is another reason to end this declaration now let me turn to the executives emergency authority the executive branch's emergency authority and congress's role in delegating those powers since article two of the constitution does not grant the president emergency powers all such authority is granted by congress many of these authorities are provided through three laws the national emergency act which is what we're focused on today the stafford act and the public health service act all three have been applied by this administration to the coveted response but the national emergencies act grants congressional oversight over a declaration by the president before i get in the need to exercise that congressional authority let me quickly discuss what repealing this emergency declaration will not do let's talk about what it won't do first terminating this emergency declaration will not impact the title 42 order currently in place and being exercised at our southern border that allows border officials to expel illegal aliens again this will not impact title 42. the crisis at the u.s mexico border has been fueled by this administration's decision to resume catch and release halt construction the border wall and promise half a million dollars to immigrant families who broke our laws as a result the number of illegal ailings crossing our southern borders at the highest level in more than 20 years under president biden i can assure you republicans intention is not to take away the only tool being utilized at our southern border to stem the tide of illegal immigrants pouring in the authority for this order lies within the secretary of health and human services public health emergency declaration made on january 31st 2020 under the public health service act the most recent internal review of the title 42 submitted by the cdc director wallinsky on february 2nd found that the order needed to remain in place republicans agree we agree that the external threat of covid coming across the border unchecked from other nations preserves the need for this order to remain in place and for us to pass legislation outside of these emergency declarations to further secure our poorest border second terminating the emergency declaration would not impact the waivers issued by the hhs secretary let me say that again terminating the emergency declaration would not impact the waivers issued by the hhs secretary these critical flexibilities including increased access to care via telehealth has been crucial to our ability to combat the virus the telehealth waivers will not be impacted by removing the nea in fact i'm a co-sponsor of legislation to make many of these successful telehealth waivers permanent and we must do so after the public health emergency expires and return to normal until today congress has failed to fulfill our duty and oversight responsibilities laid out in the national emergencies act seating immense unchecked power to the executive branch we must as democrat representative from the great state of kentucky romano mazzelli stated when this bill was being debated in 1975 i'll quote representative maseli a democrat from kentucky consciously and deliberately we must force ourselves to come to grips periodically and ultimately deal with the vexing problems of national emergency the blame as well as the glory will be on the shoulders of the congress but that is as it's supposed to be that is the responsible court of course end quote the blame of the glory should remain on the shoulders of congress and that's why we're here today we're here today to debate this responsible course moving forward while the copa 19 emergency declaration has not utilized all powers provided to the president major actions have been taken as a direct result of the declaration our ready reserve remains active our coast guard is stretched and the staggeringly expensive student loan relief remains in place more importantly though this declaration drives our federal government to maintain its massive emergency response infrastructure and drives left-wing politicians in congress to push harmful mandates and unrestained spending these powers are no longer needed we have tools to minimize the impact of this virus and truly live with it this idea living with covet is not a fringe position held by republicans democrat new jersey governor phil murphy recently said it was time to and i'll quote him learn how to live with it democratic governors in nevada rhode island new york california i must say california again connecticut delaware illinois and oregon have announced they're lifting certain mass mandates and easing other restrictions internationally the united kingdom australia and new zealand are working towards living with coveted phases just last week the british prime minister announced his part of his quote living with covet plan would even include the repeal of legislation of legal requirements for those who test positive for covet to self-isolate and why president biden claimed during a state of the union address that we are in i'll quote him we are moving forward safely back to normal routines end quote his actions don't match his words his call for a reset and claims to be loosening government intrusions into our lives by way of coped restrictions are only half truths we know this because all these next items are true despite being presented with devastating effects of lockdowns school and indoor mask mandates and other restrictions the president renewed the federal government's national emergency declaration again in fact the president just hours ago issued a veto threat of this resolution should it make it to his desk the president promising a veto before we even have this vote on the senate floor the cdc continues to hide data points they believe would be misinterpreted by those outside of the swamp they view as ignorant oh the people the people are so much smarter than they're given credit for this data includes information on who is receiving booster shots the effectiveness of vaccines for certain age groups and figures related to re-infections this allows the federal government to suppress information that contradicts their one-size-fits-all policy and approach and preserve intrusive government policies next despite the president patting himself on the back for relaxing mass mandates we still have in place the cdc order that requires mask on airplanes in ubers and on your children's school buses the administration has only withdrawn one of their vaccine mandates the osha mandate on employers with more than 100 employees after only after the supreme court struck it down three mandates are thankfully enjoined by the courts but deadlines for cms mandates on health care workers are beginning to be enforced just yesterday on this floor 44 senate democrats voted to keep the mandate in place despite its constitutional violation of state police powers harm to an already weak healthcare workforce and outdated science that guided the promulgation of the rule next the president's national coven 19 preparedness plan asked congress to approve funding that would expand the production of vaccines to one billion doses a year that equates to three doses for every person in america three doses per american do they plan to mandate these dr fauci recently led us to believe that that indeed might be the case when he said and i'll quote dr fauci the potential future requirements for an additional boost is being carefully monitored in real time end of quote and why we've prevented separate separated members of the military from receiving dishonorable discharges for choosing not to get the vaccine the defense department has kicked out hundreds of our bravest service men and women how can the president downplay the progress we made in our ability to combat the virus and more importantly how he can continue to pursue an invasive and coercive federal response that has eroded our freedoms and spread misery throughout this nation does he not hear the cry of the people who given the power to be president as the united states enters the third year of coba 19 70 percent of americans agree that it's time we accept that covet is here to stay and that we just need to get on with our lives 70 percent of americans we can't get americans to decide where to go to lunch together let alone an issue this big 70 percent of americans maintaining these policies is no longer about science or about public health or the will of the people that's all the guys this is about power and using a global pandemic to grow government and lurch our nation towards socialism the suffering caused by the government's actions has had an immense impact on the daily lives of americans in ways that will take years to correct if ever we know we now know that these actions were wrong the same people who argued to keep this emergency declaration in place are the same people who were wrong in their advocacy for these government actions they were wrong when they told you not to be afraid to go to chinese new year celebrations when the first cases were detected in the united states they were wrong when they said it was racist to suspend inbound travel from china they were wrong when they called you a conspiracy theorist for believing it was possible for this virus to have developed in nature or have leaked from a laboratory they were wrong when they told you lockdowns must remain in place they were wrong when they told you masking your children was the only way they could attend in person classes safely they were wrong when they told you massive stimulus spending was necessary and would not lead to inflation they were wrong when they told you that inflation would be transitory and they were wrong when they denied that natural immunity provided a strong defense against coveted infection and severe symptoms they were wrong when they denied that natural immunity provided a strong defense against covet infection and severe symptoms they've been wrong nearly every step of the way during the response to this pandemic always a day late and a dollar spent in the wrong direction yet here they are the same individuals who now reside in the white house and hold majorities in congress telling us it would be detrimental to our own health to repeal the president's national emergency declaration their motivation is not genuine it's a blatant effort to further extend the massive accumulation of power the federal government has extended across america for the last two years today yes today the senate has the opportunity to act to rein in this control and reassert our article one authorities the constitution demands it the authors of the national emergencies act demanded the protection of american liberties demands it we have the tools to protect the vulnerable and are populous in their full herd immunity at 94. 94 of americans have some level of immunity now let's not listen to those who have wrongness that have been proven incorrect countless times before throughout this pandemic let's listen to common sense and reason let's listen to science let's listen to the people let's abandon the covet obsession and groupthink that has infiltrated the highest ranks of our federal government and lift this emergency declaration today let's return the ability to make decisions related to the virus back to the american people thank you mr president i yield back

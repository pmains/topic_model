i thank the chairman for yielding and let me thank you for all the hard work that you've done on this appropriation bill and bringing it to the floor i know it's been a tough task mr speaker the budget year the budget for fiscal year 2011 is now six months and two weeks overdue it's time to finish this budget through this legislation chairman rogers and the appropriations committee achieved what some thought would be impossible we have succeeded in cutting 40 billion dollars that's 40 billion dollars from current spending levels no other single bill in history has cut more spending think about that for just a minute well the 40 billion dollar reduction in spending and it is 40 billion dollars contrary to some of the reports that have been out there that it is 300 and some odd million or something like this this is 40 billion dollars in real reductions in spending while this is 40 billion dollars it is just a step but it is a step in the right direction we should also think about how the nature of this national conversation has on spending has changed for several years we debated in congress how much we were going to increase spending each year our debate today centers not on whether we should cut spending but how much spending should be cut that is a sea change in the debate both in congress and in the nation and it's a change in the right direction the interior subcommittee which i'm privileged to chair is cut spending by 8.1 or 2.62 billion below the fyo 10 enacted level virtually every agency within the budget has been cut the cr cuts epa funding by 1.6 billion or 16 percent below the fy 10 enacted level funding levels for land acquisition programs are reduced by 149 million or 33 percent and on and on even with these deep cuts funding levels for operational accounts are sustained to prevent employee furloughs and the closure of national parks and forests wildlife refuges smithsonian museums and other sites let me just say for a minute about the energy and water appropriation although no funds were included in the energy and water appropriation to continue and proceed to build yucca mountain i don't want anyone and i'm speaking particularly to the nrc in the department of energy to misinterpret this vote congress has voted and spoke many times on the issue of yucca mountain do not misinterpret this vote that this is a vote against yucca mountain what we are saying is to the nrc is proceed with yucca mountain and nrc do your job which they have failed to do as i close my remarks i want to echo what both chairman rogers and ranking member dick said about the staff unless you've been on this committee or on any of the committees the public generally doesn't know the hard work that goes on behind the scenes to make this all possible and i want to thank the staff of both the appropriations committee and really the staff of the house the staff that sits up here on the dyess they do a tremendous job for us for which this congress would not be able to operate as effectively as we do some people think that's not too effectively but actually we wouldn't be able to do our job and most people don't understand that when we went home last friday after extending the government funding for a week we went home they were here all day saturday until well into sunday morning and then all day sunday until well into monday morning in order to get the job done so that we could do this for the american people so i want you to vote for this budget i urge an eye vote so that we can get on with debating what the minority whip mentioned the important priorities for the fy 12 budget in the ryan republican budget we appreciate that and i yield back the balance of my time gentlemen

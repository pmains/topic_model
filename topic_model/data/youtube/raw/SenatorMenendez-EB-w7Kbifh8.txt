happy to yield to my colleague from virginia since he needed to go crypto scams have real impacts on hard-working americans in my state of new jersey a retired police officer lost 15 thousand dollars of his savings in a long and complex crypto mining scam according to the washington post blockchain records reveal that the scammer conned over 5 000 people for over 66 million dollars and that's just one scam operation the ftc estimates 750 million dollars were lost to scammers in all of last year victims have tried to contact law enforcement but many have yet to receive the help they need there's a real concern that these scams are not being adequately investigated leaving the victims with no recourse so miss logan if someone falls victim to a crypto scam who should they contact to seek justice thank you for that question senator um it is really important and sometimes it takes investors a little while to figure out who they should call to get some help we strongly recommend that you start with your state securities division we are the local cops on the beat as we like to say if you're mugged you're not going to call the fbi you're going to call your local police department so if somebody has a securities issue or an investment issue they should call their local securities divisions and they can find us by checking on the nasa website we do work with our federal counterparts we have jurisdiction over um and all the states work this way we have jurisdiction over securities whether they're sold from our state or they're sold into our state so we have very broad jurisdiction and we frequently have to work with our federal counterparts because things might be national and things might be international what is it about cryptocurrency that is causing difficulties in prosecuting crypto scams another very good question i think what's difficult is first of all it's a new area so people need to and people are gathering their expertise and understanding what's going on it also takes a little bit of time for the investor complaints to catch up with um to actually be reported to the appropriate regulators and the appropriate prosecutors so there there's this ability and we see this in cases all the time for investors to be lulled into believing the money is going to come the money is going to come and they they are worried to file a complaint because that might interfere with their ability to collect so you will see some of the cases trailing behind when the fraud happened because the promoters and the scam artists can convince the investors that they shouldn't go to regulators well this is an area that we because it's happening and it's happening you know police officers not the typical person in terms you know his antenna would normally be up he's be someone who's trained and yet uh he fell victim to it and that's just a reality of so many let me ask you both for years now i've been calling out social media giants such as facebook instagram what's that for their failure to curb the spread of misinformation on their apps and study after study uh for example in the spanish-speaking community 66 percent of spanish-speaking respondents receive wrong or harmful information about the cobin vaccine but that's true about so many other things how does the spread of misinformation on social media magnify the problem with crypto scams thank you senator for that question um social media is a powerful medium that has wide reach um and there are a lot of individuals who are using it um to promote either their own brands or products you know so it is widely used and widely accepted and very available to the american public and we do see i know that state securities regulators have listed as one of their top scams the rise of social media as a mechanism for fraud and while much of this fraud is happening outside of broker-dealer spaces so that it's beyond finra's regulation finra's jurisdiction finra is monitoring social media for crypto and other scams and we recently launched a finfluencer sweep to try to better analyze how broker dealers to the extent that they're using social media to acquire customers um what is happening in that space so this is an area that we take very very seriously you do my instagram account all the time uh and uh you know i just say to myself how easy it is if you don't know which which brings me to the my final question of the time i have digital assets are relatively new and unfortunately scammers can take advantage of the novelty to mislead investors it's clear that the technical knowledge required to really understand crypto can be a challenge for an average investor miss walsh do you think that the lack of education on digital assets is a contributing factor in their rising use and scams senator i agree 100 with you that we need more education on digital assets so that people understand how they work they know what disclosures to look for and in the absence of those disclosures to exercise caution it's very important that people understand how a particular investment works how they could lose money in that investment what they pay for that investment and what recourse they have because since most of the digital asset transactions are happening outside of the broker dealer space protections that come from finra's regulatory regime don't apply and and that's the concern for all regulators is that when this is happening outside of the space of regulation the recourse for investors can be difficult yeah according to the ftc reported losses in 2021 due to crypto scans were nearly 60 times what they were in 2018. so it just speaks volumes i understand that senator loomis is next thank you mr chairman

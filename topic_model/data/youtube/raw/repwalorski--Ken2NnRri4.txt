the most egregious federal takeover of elections ever attempted that's what the house will be voting on later today and i'll be voting no if passed into law speaker pelosi's hr one would impose a one-size-fits-all election system from washington to all 50 states it would overrule state voter id laws like indiana has and prohibit signature verification requirements for mail-in ballots it would force states to adopt universal vote-by-mail and legalize ballot harvesting and it would put the federal government in the business of funding politicians funneling corporate money through the u.s treasury into campaign coffers even worse hr 1 would empower the fec to restrict first amendment rights and weaponize the irs to go after conservative groups we need bipartisan reforms to assure the american people their votes are counted fully fairly and accurately but h.r 1 won't restore confidence in our elections it will only so further division and doubt speaker pelhosi indiana is not california hoosiers don't want your state's chaotic elections forced on us we don't want our voices silenced we don't want this radical bill you

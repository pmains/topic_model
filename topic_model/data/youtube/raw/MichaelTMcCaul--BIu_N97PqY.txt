the question that I never hear answered by these senators I'm not asking you to defend a Senator Paul and in question if he was asked was okay we get we get immigration reform what do you do first it's the way you secure the border so what do you mean about it what's your metric I mean what do you what do you what do you use to decide that the border is secure esis where we got to talk about that okay well let's let's talk about that first and then we'll talk about everything else in this is this is what frustrates manner without he's a great Republican he's going to be the leader of the Republican Party I don't know if he is or if he is it but he's dodging questions again so I'm going to present this question to eat your chairman of Homeland Security what is the metric that should be used for the American people to say okay our border is secure now let's talk about what we're going to do with those that are in this country illegally already what's the metric well and that's exactly the bill that i intend to introduce the border security bill which we haven't had in probably six years will come out and then what we focus on is exactly what you're talking about metrics and outcomes if you can't measure have metrics you can't judge whether you're successful the other thing is a definition of operational control the department has basically thrown that out the window and so well we can't really define it so we're not going to talk about that anymore we just got throw randomly some assets you know around the Tucson Sector maybe san diego and and then you know it's never been more secure so therefore secure that that's not the right strategy i mean we have to have metrics week in our bill and i can talk more about it when we mark it up introduce it but we will provide a system of metrics that were designed by idaho national labs and the GAO it will review these metrics and force the department's come up with a comprehensive national strategy game operational control in that they haven't had a plan that's why they come back and they fed so we can you get well with the board of these tutorials don't tell me ten years that's just that's unacceptable bill will require them in three years to get an operational control at the border you can't discuss immigration reform until you have that control piece what's operation control knowing is coming in the country and leaving the country with a high degree of probability we don't have that right now and I don't see as you can trigger immigration reform so you get to that point and so that's what we're going to be focused on and then you know once they come back with a plan then we're going to say okay how you implement that plan and that's what we did to the strategic resources whether we bring stuff in Afghanistan Iraq back to the southwest border or you know the existing technologies that are available today that we can put down there and that's when we have that discussion but if you really you know again you can say you're all for immigration reform that it doesn't work until you get the operational control the border how can you have a guest worker program for instance if you don't know with a high degree of certainty who's coming in the country and his one I don't know doesn't work I would agree what most Americans realize that you're right how do you have this guest worker programs heed to me when I hear things in many cases from you know politicians from lawmakers it sounds like can during to me I know there's a lot of fans of Rand Paul and Marco Rubio and others and that's fine and they may and they may turn out to be far smarter than I am but I want you to tell me how you were going to secure the border first don't you say well we got to talk about that I know that's what I want you to talk about you're doing that and I appreciate it let me before I going to let you go on the mandate I have from my leadership is lame and you need to go forward this this border bill because that's the that's the carrot right I mean they're not going to get any seller set that unless our members are confident enough that my bill is going to achieve that result otherwise they're not going to go down that road and so the roller plans is very critical this is silver all debate

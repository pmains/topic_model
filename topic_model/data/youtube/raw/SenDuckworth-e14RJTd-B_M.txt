as I understand it under it's hard organization the air force does not have a good track record of being able to effectively manage the prioritization of its missions in both air and space and so space frequently falls to a lower priority or lacks a consistent seat at the table I contrast this with the US Navy which has successfully managed to prioritize its own air surface and submarine missions to include the establishment of separate training acquisitions and doctrinal development centers across these very different Dee main domains why has this been such a problem for the Air Force under its current structure and what role does a new us-based Command play in helping prioritize space across departments and how does that differ or duplicate that intent of the proposed base force when i'm secretary or general do you want to address that happy to center the biggest shift that we are seeing is the shift from an uncontested domain to a contested domain over the last three years including right including the budget that you have before you this president the President's budget has include double-digit percentage increases in the budget that are driven by an analysis of the threat the strategy to meet that threat the concepts of operations and the programs to support it so I think what you're seeing in the difference between what you described with the Navy is that the Navy has been operating in a contested domain for hundreds of years the Air Force in space has been operating in a contested domain for a much shorter period of time we have set up and the national space defense center we have school houses and and specific focus on space most of which have been set up in the last decade so you're seeing you're seeing in in the Air Force that that focus and I would also say that for the missions and the requirements of the combatant commander the United States Air Force has provided what the combatant commanders needed in an uncontested environment so you know the Air Force built a glass house for the invention of stones we now have the invention of stones and as J Raymond said just yesterday to a very large audience he said a year ago that the air force was in a 9g turn towards space superiority and he was wrong it's a 12 G turn and so I'm proud of the force that we're presenting so so how will the US Space Command help prioritize across department and in will it and and and how does that differ from intent or duplication in terms of the proposed space force I mean you've got this very complex system you're saying you're standing up a new training and it you think you're capable just this will be just as capable in Air Force two doing multiple things at once the way the Navy can do it so how this is different between you know Space Command and space force center I was trying to explain why I thought the Navy structures were different from the way the Air Force about evolved with respect to space but in the proposal that's before you one of the elements that's before you in addition to there's there's the the additive personnel that's in the proposal some of it is to support the four-star who will be a member of the Joint Chiefs the other large number of people is to set up a training and Doctrine Center specifically focused on the challenges of space as a contested domain so then the Air Force will send your people to their training programs is that what you're saying or how does that work that training and Doctrine Center would be primarily for members of the space force and other officers to get joint experience and honestly also are allied officers the Air Force has already opened up its space 100 200 and 300 programs to our allied officers and we have opened up and created a combined space operation center this last year that includes our allies in California okay thank you I also serve in the community on Commerce science and transportation so I want to talk a bit about the intersection of military and commercial space assets as you're all aware this is an area where we don't yet widely except except at Norm's and we've had that discussion here today already the motor proposal we have here would likely increase complications even further in the realm of great power competition see countries like China who are rapidly expanding their space presence but they don't have issues of deconfliction because their military and commercial assets are intermingled and they operate almost as a single unit so how does DoD in the proposed space force plan to work with other federal agencies and our commercial sector to deconflict with these issues before and while they are arising sir let me take take that one on the space development agency in in its design is intended to do really four undertake four different activities the the first is consolidation so that we can take all the requirements of the department and then to do fundamental systems engineering so that we can take advantage of a space ecosystem so everything from you know launch to sustainment and then by design tap into the commercial space industry where significant innovation has occurred but for us to actually be able to incorporate that technology we have to accommodate or make corrections to our acquisition system our rules and regulations won't allow us to leverage that new innovation and the space development agency which is modeled after the missile defense agency allows us to be able to take advantage of all of those things and I think that's what allow us to be able to develop capability more quickly and at a lower cost but I'm also concerned about security and how do you force the civilians to work closely with you and security and share information you got people selling tickets for tourism into space for crying out loud how do you deacon figure out ways the Chinese don't have these problems because they have total control over their commercial sector you know we have we have procedures protocols we've worked with commercial segments you know we have a long long history of doing that that's really intent of standing up an organization like this so we can really leverage that commercial space I'd love to explore this for the right amount of time Thank You mr. chairman

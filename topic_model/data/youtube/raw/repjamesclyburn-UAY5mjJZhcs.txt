south carolina he's joining us from Columbia right now congressman thanks so much for joining us so what's the impact of the president's comments well first of all thank you so much for having me wolf I think the impact has been dramatic I think that the president has really stepped into it here I think that the Congressional Black Caucus has solidified around some efforts that I think will take place next week one of which is the pursuit of a central resolution and I am hopeful that we will do that and get bipartisan support for it the president is a commander in chief and this is kind of it will be called conduct of unbecoming of an officer and if a general or some other line officer in the military were to say something like this he would be censored or see I think that it occurred here with the commander in chief at a minimum and then of course when we get back next week I think that the Congress or the sit down in a bipartisan way define what it is we're trying to do on behalf of dreamers get darker done let's look at what we should do with border security and let's take this discussion about immigration off of this issue it should not be in here said to my colleagues on yesterday and last evening this is a smokescreen I think the president is doing what he does so often he's going to stick it to daca recipient he is going to give the back hand to dreamers and using this discussion as a camouflage for doing that so we ought to step out of these discussions about the immigration policy put it in something where it ought to be get back to discussing a budget resolution getting a continuing resolution to go forward or put a budget in place tired all to the that's wishes on border security our wishes on behalf of dreamers and let's go forward and stop this discussion this is a camouflage on Twitter the president denied making sort of denied I should say the vulgar comments are making denigrating comments about Haitians a Democratic congressman though who says that the who was there a Democratic senator I should point out the says the President did in fact make those remarks dick Durbin of Illinois what do you make when you first heard those comments coming the day before and the president this weekend is going to be together with all of us remembering dr. Martin Luther King he signed this declaration today what went through your mind when you when you when you analyzed all of this well I'll tell you we went through mine I thought about dr. King's letter from the Birmingham city jail you may recall when dr. King wrote his letter he was responding to another that he received from eight white clergymen now the clergyman said to dr. King in the letter that they believed that his cause was right they just thought that this timing was wrong dr. King in his letter said to them time is neutral time is never right time is never wrong time as always what we make it and then he said something I think is critical he said that he was coming to the conclusion that the people of ill will in our society make a much better use of time than the people of goodwill I will call upon my Republican colleagues and say to them that if they are in fact people of goodwill as I think they are let's break our silence on this let's not be quiet pretend you didn't hear you didn't recall it the fact of the matter is Senator Scott I'm told this morning that the posting chorus said that he says that Senator his fellow senator the Lindsey Alinta Graham confirmed that it was said and I believe Senator Durbin said that Senator Graham responded to it when it was said yeah so let's stop this foolishness and because dr. King closed his thought on this subject when he said that we are going to be meant to repent in this generation not just for the vitriolic words and deeds of had bad people but for the appalling silence of good people let's break our silence congressman Clyburn thanks so much for joining us

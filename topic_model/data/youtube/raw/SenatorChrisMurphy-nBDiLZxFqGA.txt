thank you very much mr. president on July 9th the Trump administration will be in court defending the Texas versus United state lawsuit let me rephrase that they won't be defending the lawsuit they will be arguing on the side of the plaintiff in that lawsuit this is a virtually unprecedented move administration's traditionally defend the statutes of the United States no matter what they feel about the politics of the underlying statute but the Trump administration has made the decision to join with 22 Republican attorneys general to argue that the entirety of the Affordable Care Act should be dismantled with nothing to replace it those of us who believe that it would not be wise policy to kick 20 million people off of insurance get rid of all of the insurance protections in the Affordable Care Act with no idea as to what comes next we have begged our Republican colleagues to join us in telling the Trump administration demanding the Trump administration argue against the attorneys general in this case because I've listened to my Republican friends I've listened to the President himself over and over again say that though they don't like the Affordable Care Act they want to replace it with something else something that ensures more people something that continues to protect people with pre-existing conditions and so if that is your position then it stands to reason that you would oppose a lawsuit which seeks to invalidate the entire to the Affordable Care Act with nothing to replace it but the witching hour is upon us the oral arguments are the week after next and this lawsuit was successful at the district court level and so there is no reason not to believe that there is a substantial possibility that it could be successful at the appellate court level as well and so I wanted to come down to the floor as we head into this week well we'll be back in our districts to just make sure that everybody understands what the stakes are on July 9th when the Trump administration will argue in court to get rid of insurance for 20 to 30 Americans what the stakes are for this Senate and in particular Senate Republicans refusing to stand up to the president in his perpetuation of this lawsuit if the Affordable Care Act is struck down there are a hundred and thirty million Americans with pre-existing conditions who could see insurance rates of up to fifty to sixty percent others will have their insurance withdrawn when they go through open enrollment next because no insurer will cover someone with serious very expensive pre-existing conditions that was the way things worked before the Affordable Care Act was passed gone is Medicaid expansion which today covers seventeen million people across the country and I've been happy to see more and more states with Republican governors or Republican state legislatures adopt the Medicaid expansions becoming a source of bipartisan agreement that more people should have access to Medicaid and so those seventeen people lose their coverage twelve million seniors will pay more immediately for prescription drugs because the Affordable Care Act gets rid of overtime essentially the entirety of the Medicare Part D doughnut hole 2.3 million adult children who are on their parent's insurance up until they become 26 would potentially lose access to that insurance the Affordable Care Act requires insurance companies to cover those kids many insurers without that requirement would no longer cover those children and then many of the other protections in the marketplace like bans on lifetime caps or annual caps can return insurers would once again be back in the practice of saying to a very sick childhood cancer patient you only get X amount of insurance coverage from us and once you go beyond that number then it's on your dime again before the Affordable Care Act was passed there were a million and a half families every single year in this country who declared bankruptcy today there are half as many families that declare bankruptcy in this country and it is not coincidence that studies told us that of those 1.5 million half of them were declaring bankruptcy because of medical costs when you don't go bankrupt any longer because of medical cost because you have access to affordable insurance and your insurance company can't kick you off because you get sick you don't face that kind of destitution like families faced before and so I think it does make sense to you know just run through the lineup of who has weighed in in favor of this court case to invalidate the entirety of the Affordable Care Act and knock twenty to thirty million people off of insurance to jack up rates for millions more and whose weighed in against it well the president wants this lawsuit to succeed attorneys generals want this lawsuits to succeed and by the silence of my Republican colleagues you would infer that many Republicans may want this lawsuit to succeed but here's who hates this lawsuit I'm not gonna run through the whole list here but this is essentially anybody who knows anything about health care this is essentially every organization that represents people who have serious diseases every association that represents doctors every association that represents hospitals and you don't really find all of those groups aligned on much at all because when you're moving around pieces in the health care system often you'll do something to benefit patients that insurers won't like your benefits something that hospitals that single practice offices won't like this is pretty much everybody who says if you kick 20 million people off insurance like that and you had no plan to replace it that's a humanitarian catastrophe here's what the AARP says in their filing opposing this lawsuit if this Court finds the ACA is invalid millions of older adults will lose the health care coverage and consumer protections that they've relied on for years it will also throw the Medicare and Medicaid programs into fiscal and administrative chaos which will disrupt the nation's health care system and economy it will plunge the more than one hundred million people with praises and conditions into the abyss of uncertainty over whether they can obtain coverage that's the AARP here's the American Medical Association says the decision below if affirmed would have devastating effects on the quality cost and availability of such care families USA says among those whose coverage rates increased due to Medicaid expansion our young adults people with HIV veterans rural residents racial and ethnic minorities many of our most vulnerable citizens who are covered by Medicaid and eliminating the expansion would leave them without health care I mentioned the insurance companies are against this lawsuit they say this invalidation of the ACA irrespective of the continued operation of the so called individual mandate would wreak havoc on the health care system and finally Americans with disabilities they say the result is a cruel irony the population that needs health care the most has the hardest time obtaining it for the last nine years the ACA has helped change that stripping away its protections now we'll reverse the positive gains that people with disabilities have realized and will return this community to the same grim reality as before the ACA if not place people with disabilities in even worse position and so let's not forget where we were before the Affordable Care Act was passed I'm not saying that it's perfect I'm not saying that we shouldn't do work together to try to improve it we just finished a debate in the Health Committee in which we passed a whole bunch of reforms to our health care system that Republicans and Democrats agree on but the American Cancer Society and they're filing reminds the court that a 2009 Harvard medical study Harvard Medical School study found that approximately 45,000 deaths annually could be attributed to the lack of health insurance the Heart Association says this even during a heart attack uninsured patients were more likely to delay seeking medical care because of the financial limitations and I could go on and on reading from these filings are reading from the testimony that all of these groups have submitted again that's not to say that these groups don't want changes in our health care system nobody on this list as far as I know is arguing for the status quo just as no one in this body is arguing for the status quo but to rip away Medicaid expansion to rip out from the roots of the health care system the exchanges and the tax credits to get rid of all of the insurance protections to reverse the gains we've made on lowering prescription drug costs for seniors to do all of that with nothing to replace it is to invite misery destitution and chaos and let's just be honest we're not ready to ride to the rescue I offered an amendment in the help committee today just asking for the Department of Health and Human Services to provide us with a report about what the landscape would look like in the health care system if Texas v United States was successful I didn't get a single Republican vote for that all I was asking was that we just get a report on how bad it's gonna be so that we can start doing a little bit of advance planning and not a single Republican was willing to vote for that in committee today and so we are deliberately boxing our eyes and ears about what could be the effect on our constituents if this lawsuit is successful we are not in a position to ride to the rescue there is no chance that this Congress is going to pass a new health care reform proposal that will restore health care to everybody that lost it not happening and I know that's not a surprise to anyone here he also shouldn't delude yourself into thinking that this lawsuit won't be successful there are lots of very smart legal scholars who suggest that this argument that the plaintiffs are making that the Trump administration is endorsed it's nonsense I tend to agree with them the argument is that because you got rid of one section of the Affordable Care Act then the court needs to invalidate the rest well Congress made its intent pretty clear Republicans decided to get rid of the individual mandate or the penalty that's assessed if you don't have insurance and deliberately did not choose to get rid of the rest of it I think that's not a our decision but the intent of Congress is pretty clear that's my belief that this argument doesn't hold water that's the belief of many smart legal scholars but the district court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs so you already have a federal judge who has invalidated the entire to the Affordable Care Act since then the Trump administration has upped the ante the district court finding in favor of the plaintiffs which invalidates the entire to the Affordable Care Act that didn't convince the President to say hey let's pull back the reins a little bit here let's you know maybe maybe we change our position this this feels a little bit too real let's see if we can hedge our bets now after the district court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs the administration changed their position to go all in on the plaintiffs side their initial filing only backed up some of the plaintiffs claims so the district court ruled that the affordable care act has to disappear overnight the Trump administration has changed their position to weigh in as to support the entirety of the lawsuit and we're not having a serious conversation about what happens if the fate that all of these groups are deeply fearful of comes to pass and finally this is not about numbers this isn't about statistics this is about real people Michael from New Fairfield Connecticut says to me this is personal to me the ACA literally saved my life in 2016 I have a pre-existing recurrent skull based disease had it for most of my adult life I underwent an 11-hour skull base neurosurgeon to remove a benign tumor that involved my brain arteries nasal passages jaw and a total reconstruction of my middle and outer ear canals my surgeon said I was a month away from a much more debilitating surgical outcome as it is my recovery and rehabilitation period has been 2 years my spouse and I both run our own business and the ACA is still our family's only healthcare option without the operations and the ACA coverage the disease would have continued to progress I would have eventually died and my family would have had to sell the house and or go bankrupt to manage the medical expenses David from Southport says in July 2011 I was diagnosed with colon cancer at the time I was covered under an individual policy with Blue Cross Blue Shield it was a very comprehensive policy and after my deductible was satisfied it covered all my doctor's visits my hospital expenses however after a couple years I was advised that due to my pre-existing condition I would not be able to renew my policy at the time I enrolled in the Affordable Care Act access health Connecticut and without this policy through access health Connecticut I would not be able to be insured and would face prohibitive costs for even basic care David's story can be told thousands of times over diagnosis followed by denial of coverage from an insurance company because of a pre-existing condition there is no free market response when it comes to very sick people who want insurance because the free market tells the insurance company do not insure somebody who's going to cost you a lot of money the free market would tell the insurance company to keep that person on the outside of insurance and so there has to be a public sector response we provided that response with the affordable care act and now in a matter of weeks or months it could all be gone so I come down to the floor this afternoon to once again engaged my colleagues and asking them to work together let's try to find a common ground here it least behind the premise that you shouldn't rip out the foundation of the modern health care system without a plan for what goes next I assume we will continue to offer unanimous consent requests to try to withhold funding for the Trump administration's perpetuation of this lawsuit and I would hope that we can get Republican support for that motion not because Republicans support the Affordable Care Act I get it I'm not going to get Republicans to support the Affordable Care Act but because I think my Republican friends need to make good on what they have said for years that they want the Affordable Care Act but they really want something else to replace it that will ensure the same number of people protect folks who are sick that can't happen if this lawsuit succeeds and as we head back to our districts for this recess period I want to make sure everybody knew how many groups that know something or anything about health care our standing against Texas versus the United States I yield the floor

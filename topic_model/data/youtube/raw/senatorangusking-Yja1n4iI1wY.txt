madam chair just briefly uh this this is I have great deal of respect for you and for Senator Sullivan I've met with your governor your Commissioner of Natural Resources I've really tried hard to dig in and understand this issue reluctantly however I'm going to have to vote no going back to something senator Heinrich mentioned the word words wildlife refuge means something it seems to me and as I look back the the 1980 law does not designate 10,000 to for drilling it does say exploration is allowed but 1003 expressly says Congress has to act in order to allow drilling the development is not limited to 2,000 acres and I must say my consideration of this has been influenced by that number which I find inappropriate I did a little calculation these chairs only covered under the definition in this law to square feet of the area of this room because it's only a square inch for each leg of the chair that's on the ground but most of us would say that's a pretty good coverage of the room by the chairs we're talking about a lot of coverage of this of this area in multiple wells a minimum of 400,000 acres being being leased Alaska's 375 million acres the state owns a hundred and five million acres the National Petroleum Reserve is 23 million acres and it just strikes me that the case hasn't been made for opening up this particular small relatively small area of the state for drilling particularly when we're now projecting in the news just yesterday of record oil production in the United States next year if almost 10 million barrels a day rivaling that of Saudi Arabia I just I find it hard to vote to open this up given the questions about wildlife and and the the as I say I just don't think the case has been made that there is a necessity national security or other necessity for doing this so given the respect that I have for the chair and for her colleague from Alaska Senator Sullivan it's it's not easy for me to take this position but the data compels me I believe and I just wanted to get that statement on the record thank you

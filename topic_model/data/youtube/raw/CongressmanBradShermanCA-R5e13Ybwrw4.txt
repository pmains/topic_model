  MR. SHERMAN. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE  GENTLEMAN FROM CALIFORNIA IS  RECOGNIZED. MR. SHERMAN:  I THANK THE  GENTLEMAN FOR YIELDING. I RISE TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF S.  178, THE UIGHUR ACT. THIS BILL HAS THE BEST OF BOTH  WORLDS. IT HAS A SENATE BILL NUMBER AND  HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  CONTENT. THE BILL CAME OVER FROM THE  SENATE AND THEN WE UNANIMOUSLY  ADOPTED IT IN THE FOREIGN  AFFAIRS COMMITTEE. MY AMENDMENT IN THE NATURE OF A  SUBSTITUTE, WHICH PUT TOGETHER  THREE BILLS FOCUSED ON THE  UIGHUR ISSUE. IT INCLUDED THE WORK OF SENATORS MARCO RUBIO AND ROBERT MENENDEZ  FOUNDED IN S. 178. THE WORK FOUND IN H.R. 649 OF  CHRIS SMITH AND TOM SUOZZI OF  THIS HOUSE. AND THE LEGISLATION THAT I  REINTRODUCED WITH THE RANKING  MEMBER OF THE ASIA SUBCOMMITTEE, TED YOHO, H.R. 1025. SO THIS BILL REPRESENTS PUTTING  TOGETHER THOSE THREE BILLS TO  DEAL WITH THE DETENTION OF OVER  ONE MILLION UIGHURS AND OTHER  MUSLIM MINORITIES IN XINJIANG  AND OTHER CHINESE REPRESSION OF  ITS MUSLIM MINORITY POPULATION. THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT HAS  SOUGHT TO ERASE THE DISTINCT  UIGHUR MUSLIM CULTURE THROUGH  MASS DETENTIONS, RE-EDUCATION  CAMPS, AND A COORDINATED  CAMPAIGN UNDER A BANNER, STRIKE  HARD AGAINST VIOLENT EXTREMISM,  LAUNCHED IN 2014. THANKS TO RECENTLY LEAKED  CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY  DOCUMENTS, WE NOW KNOW THAT THE  IMPETUS FOR THIS CAMPAIGN CAME  FROM THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF THE  CHINESE PARTY. IN APRIL, 2014, GENERAL  SECRETARY XI ORDERED THE PARTY  OFFICIALS TO -- AND THESE ARE  THE WORDS -- SHOW ABSOLUTELY NO  MERCY IN USING ORGANS OF  DICTATORSHIP. ANOTHER QUOTED PHRASE. TO SUPPRESS MUSLIM MINORITIES. MORE THAN A MILLION UIGHURS WERE THEN IMPRISONED IN CAMPS. IN A COUNTRY WITH THE RULE OF  LAW, YOU'RE INCARCERATED BY THE  STATE BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN  CONVICTED OF A DEFINED STATUTORY OFFENSE. WHY ARE ONE MILLION PEOPLE  BEHIND BARBED WIRE IN XINJIANG  PROVINCE OF CHINA? THE CHARGE AGAINST THEM IS THEIR THINKING HAS BEEN INFECTED BY  UNHEALTHY THOUGHTS. WHERE IN THE WORLD WOULD ANYONE  BE FREE IF A MILLION PEOPLE CAN  BE INCARCERATED BECAUSE THE  GOVERNMENT HAS DETERMINED THAT  THEIR THOUGHTS ARE UNHEALTHY? ALONG WITH RE-EDUCATION CAMPS,  THE STRIKE HARD CAMPAIGN HAS  ALSO INVOLVED HIGH-TECH  SURVEILLANCE AND MONITORING OF  UIGHURS, MONITORING OF AND  SUPPRESSING MUSLIM RELIGIOUS  PRACTICES, INCLUDING FUNERAL  PRACTICES, AND SUPPRESSION OF  UIGHUR LANGUAGE. BEYOND ITS BORDERS, THE PARTY  HAS TRIED TO INTIMIDATE CHINESE  MUSLIM MINORITIES LIVING ABROAD. AND IN CHINA, SOME INDIVIDUALS  WITH PERMANENTLY -- PERMANENT  RESIDENCY STATUS IN THE UNITED  STATES HAVE BEEN PROHIBITED FROM LEAVING THE REGION. IN XINJIANG, THE PARTY HAS  FORCED UIGHUR FAMILIES HAVE  POLICE LIVE IN THEIR HOMES. THIS IS STAGGERING. THE LEGISLATION BEFORE US IS AN  IMPORTANT START, BUT IT'S ONLY A START. IN OUR EFFORTS TO COUNTER  CHINESE REPRESSION OF ITS MUSLIM MINORITIES. AND WE WILL HAVE HEARINGS IN THE ASIA SUBCOMMITTEE TO DEVELOP  ADDITIONAL STEPS THAT AMERICA  COULD TAKE. I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT TWO PARTS OF THIS LEGISLATION. FIRST, THE BILL REQUIRES THE  PRESIDENT TO IMPOSE THE GLOBAL  MAGNITSKY SANCTIONS AGAINST ALL  CHINESE OFFICIALS WHO ARE  RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REPRESSION  OF THE UIGHURS. WE ARE LONG PAST THE POINT WHEN  THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE, AND  IT SHOULD NOT BE LINKED TO  ONGOING NEGOTIATIONS ON TRADE OR ANY OTHER ISSUE. SECOND, THE BILL REQUIRES THE  COMMERCE DEPARTMENT TO UPDATE  OUR EXPORT CONTROLS TO ENSURE  THAT THE COMMERCE CONTROL LIST,  WHICH GOVERNS DUO USE ITEMS, IS  UPDATED TO CREATE A SPECIAL  REGIME FOR CHINA. COMMERCE WILL BE REQUIRED TO  IDENTIFY ITEMS THAT ASSIST IN  THE MONITORING, SURVEILLANCE,  MASS DETENTION, AND FORCED LABOR WE SEE GOING ON IN CHINA TODAY. AND DENY LICENSES FOR THE EXPORT OR REEXPORT OF THOSE ITEMS --  RE-EXPORT OF THOSE ITEMS TO  CHINA. IT SHOULD BE USED TO FURTHER ONE OF THE MOST EGREGIOUS HUMAN  RIGHTS VIOLATIONS OF OUR TIME  AND REWRITING THIS LEGISLATION  AND THE NATURE OF A SUBSTITUTE  COMING OUT OF THE FOREIGN  AFFAIRS COMMITTEE, WE ENSURED WE DID NOT HINDER BENEFICIAL  COMMERCE. THIS INCLUDED THOROUGH  DISCUSSIONS WITH THE TECH  INDUSTRY. SO I THANK CHAIRMAN ENGEL AND  RANKING MEMBER MCCAUL, OF  COURSE, OUR SPEAKER, NANCY  PELOSI, WHO WAS HERE. I THANK SENATORS RUBIO AND  MENENDEZ, CHRIS SMITH AND TOM  SUOZZI. I THANK JIM McGOVERN FOR HIS  BORK -- HIS WORK, AND I THAT I  MO

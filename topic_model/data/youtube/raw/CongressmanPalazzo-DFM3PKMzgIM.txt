just recently in an interview the president defending his Isis strategy saying quote anything we could be doing we are doing on that point though critics are challenging him since the atrocities continue as we've witnessed with the murder of hostages and innocent civilians also this week a chilling report from the United Nations stating that right now Isis is routinely abducting young boys and girls in Iraq who are being tortured raped and sold as sex slaves non-islamic children are being crucified and even buried alive and the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child are urging that much more needs to be done many Americans are asking that same question why we're not urgently doing more to stop this brutal reign of terror joining us now to marine veterans now in Congress Arizona Democratic congressman Ruben Gallegos serving in Iraq with the third Battalion 25th Marine Corps combat unit along with Mississippi Republican Congressman Steve Palazzo who was also on the front lines serving in the persian gulf war with the Marine Corps Reserve and he's still a member of the National Guard before we begin I want to say that both of you are on the Armed Services Committee and want to thank you for your service and making a difference to keeping our country safe gentlemen welcome nice to have you here today congressman Diego lady begin with you we are hearing that the president will be asking Congress to authorize the use of force against Isis within days but few expect that to include ground forces the world looks to the United States to organize and lead this effort while we're still waiting to see what develops people are dying and I said just pointed out so many atrocities are being committed against helpless children the depravity of Isis knows no bounds the longer we wait the worse it gets we've watched for months that limited airstrikes are not getting the job done and we don't appear to have a defined strategy do you expect that we will have one I do expect one and we need to demand one before we actually give any authority whether we're Democrats or Republicans the reason there is hesitancy among many of us especially many of us have serve in combat our experience in Iraq will tell you that if we go in there and take care of this problem we can quickly take care of this problem the yes that's a great military capability you know you bring a couple of Marines and we could you know clear the problem but the problem is just like what happened Iraq every time I clear the town as soon as I left that town the surgeons would come back in because fundamentally the Iraqi government is not ready and has not from the coalition governess essere e to be able to stand up against Isis and that's the last thing we want to do is again come in as a savior for the Iraqi government when they haven't formed a good coalition with the Kurds or with the cities we want them to succeed but we're not here to always to be there back stuff because we will find ourselves coming back into Iraq every couple years to clean up their mess well Congress Palazzo both you and Connor Franta llego are among those who met with jordan's king abdullah this week and it's a pivotal moment for the Jordanians with the brutal fiery death of their Air Force pilot at the hands of Isis the king is vowing in his words a relentless war with Isis and is asking for the u.s. to help out more with military resources the president has sought to attract a broad coalition including middle east countries Jordan is ready to go the distance the president promising full support yet it's been reported that he's already denied the King's request for a Predator drone why deny him at this important moment well I don't know but going back to the AUMF Congress is looking forward to the debate on that it's something that needs to happen and it doesn't need to be limited in scope in the the President of the United States who has shown that the world that we do not have a strategy on confronting this crisis this threat Isis within their barbarism in the you know just the brutal acts of horror that they're committing against children and women Muslim and non-muslim Christians he shouldn't be telling the world what we're not going to do and he shouldn't be limited to you know the military basically tying their hands I think our military commanders have a way in a plan to confront this threat and to eliminate it like the congressman said you send in a handful of Marines will get the thread under control but the problem is that you know jordans not asking for much they'd want parts they'd want fuel they want munitions they want the tools to be able to defeat this crisis and we should be joining in with the Jordanians and providing them with every thing that the United States of America can provide because this is just not a threat to Jordan and to the region this is a global threat one that we need to destroy in eliminate no they're also asking for a Predator drones obviously right now the president doesn't want to give it to them congressman Gallego shouldn't Jordan get the resources it needs to fight Isis right now well clearly wouldn't we spoke to King Abdullah and the congressman are from Mississippi was also there with me he expressed that he wants to take the fight to Jordan and we obviously should do everything we can I don't know what the holdup is with these drones there may be some kind of national security issue where we're not allowed to pass on certain sensitive equipment to people without equipping them correctly so they don't get hacked but obviously anything we can to help out Jordan talk about any Ally they wants to fight especially an Arab a like to fight Isis we should help out and we should give as soon as possible as a veteran congressman Gallego you have been on the front lines and understand military strategy those are there are those who believe that the president by not showing a willingness though to define the terrorists as being part of radical Islam it's a problem because as several military commanders have said unless you define the enemy you can never win as a veteran do you believe this to be true no the only thing that really mattered in when i was going door to door or you know fighting insurgents the definition they really matter was whether they ended up dead or alive it doesn't really matter you know what I called it before or after you know I think the people are the most important thing that people are missing is that we are fighting with a coalition the Jordanians are one hundred percent N and we shouldn't make it any more difficult for them to by trying to somehow make this an Islam versus the US a fight it really is and King Abdullah kind of mentioned this when he was speaking to us is it is civilization versus pure barbarism but it's not it's not Islam against all its radical Islam that people are taking issue with that's what people are saying is the crux of this problem congressman Palazzo what do you say about this well you know going back to what we're saying you providing Jordanian with the tools it sounds like the the government of Jordan is confronting federal bureaucracies in the United States I mean they can't cut through the red tape to get them the tools in the equipment that they need to defeat this threat we have willing partners in the region that are ready to get there get there you know hands bloodied protecting their families and their communities and taking this fight to the enemy in their backyard so it doesn't come to our backyard here in the United States or in the jordans backyard and it's not like we're equipping the Syrians I mean no one knows who the good Syrians are an emotion it's bad ground forces ultimately Ken airstrikes alone do it well I think that's up to the present we've seen the airstrikes we've launched over 2200 airstrikes and Isis seems to be as strong as ever I think you know the at the end of the day we have to listen to our men and women in uniform the people that are actually on the ground the trained and the profession of arms to defend our country and our allies around the world let the generals come in and tell us exactly what we need and as commander-in-chief the president needs to take counsel with these these men and women and make sure that we're protecting American protecting our friends around the world all right gentlemen thank you so much for joining us with your insights really appreciate it and again thank you so much for your service thank you thank you for your time

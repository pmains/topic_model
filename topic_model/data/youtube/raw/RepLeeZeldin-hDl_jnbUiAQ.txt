that easy Lee mr. president thank you for coming back again this is your second time in less than a year that you're on Long Island for this purpose and the message that gets sent to the victims of ms-13 is certainly being heard and felt by them the message is being heard and felt by the law enforcement officers here on Long Island who ms-13 has been threatening it sends a strong message not only to Long Islanders who care about our community and our public safety but it also sends a strong message all throughout our entire country it's really important when you run for office that you're able to keep your promises and the effort that you have been showing to ensure the defeat of ms-13 is incredibly important and it's recognized I was last week in Jerusalem where we were moving an embassy and a promise was being kept as in the Middle East last Christmas visiting our troops where Isis is almost completely wiped off the map in Iraq and Syria it's so important for us to keep our promises the message is being sent not just to Long Islanders but all throughout the entire country you have to when wanting to eliminate a threat be willing to identify it and what we saw with the reaction to it was a the California sheriff asked you about ms-13 and you responded immediately to that remark and called them animals and as our acting ice director said that was a nice way of putting it but if you're not willing to even identify the threat you have no chance of eliminating it same thing if you want to get rid of the heroin and opioid abuse epidemic another promise that you're keeping locally we have seen many indictments coming down from a great local US Attorney's Office there is a US attorney here rich Donohue who a little biased towards using a former 82nd Airborne Division paratrooper but we're seeing indictment after indictment come down here in the Eastern District and it's a product of all of the people who are here at this table who work for them working at every level of government we're about to hear from miss Hart our new police commissioner and Suffolk everyone working together to ensure that this is accomplished is critical this issue should transcend partisan politics and unfortunately it's not right now in Congress Nancy Pelosi recently took nine hours on the House floor to celebrates the humanity and the behavior that encompasses what has torn apart the hearts of our families who are here as far as sending messages it's also an important message to send to congressional Democrats you have shown a willingness to compromise on this issue and uncomfortable you've put your neck way out there and you're in a way you end up negotiating against yourself when the congressional Democrats just refuse to work with you it's obstructionism there are people who are in Congress who have pledged to oppose and obstruct everything and anything saying they cannot work with you because if they work with you the legitimize your presidency you were elected president of the United States they were elected to serve in Congress they took an oath they need to protect our constituents here they need to protect their own they need to work with you because you're putting your neck out there on the line they need to do it as well even if they're taking a tough vote from their constituents as far as policy issues we stand with you for stronger border security anterior enforcement we agree that there is a need to end catch and release to end this use of visa lottery beyond just the worst offenses that we've heard a lot about or all of the other fences that aren't the high-profile incidents that we hear about in the national media it's the drug trafficking that takes place here on Long Island and elsewhere it's the sex trafficking that takes place on Long Island and everywhere all throughout our entire country so all these policy issues are really important securing entryways is important not just to keep out people who shouldn't be entering our country legally but also keeping things out of our country that should not be entering our country illegally and as you know well and I appreciate your leadership on the heroin opioid abuse epidemic that is something that has been a huge impact on Long Island as well finally we discussed it once before when you also and I like to report back to my constituents this isn't just something that we're talking about while you're able to come here to Long Island but also meetings that have taken place at the White House and other efforts that are underway but there is a need to have a tool given to our Justice Department in my opinion to be able to end our homeland security to be able to revoke the naturalization of someone who it turns out that they were engaged in gang violence before they receive their naturalization or if it's six months later or two years later they engage in gang violence they should have their naturalization revoked I introduced after our last meeting the protecting our communities from gang violence act HR 5065 I look forward to working with you on all of this and I just really want to thank all of the fine distinguished people who are here at this table and also to everyone watching at home who's standing with our president it's an important message to send whether you vote for a president or not his success is our success as Americans and as Americans you should this man to be successful personally thank you

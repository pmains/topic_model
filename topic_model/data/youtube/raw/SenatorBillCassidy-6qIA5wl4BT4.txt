i'm a former or still consider myself a hepatologist which means you treat liver disease so it kind of warms my heart to hear them talk about liver disease um but it doesn't warm the heart of my constituents to talk about inflation one of my constituents said that president biden should come live where real people live if their prescription for high fuel prices is that someone drives an electric vehicle they have no understanding of the lives of those people who might represent folks don't drive 15 year old pickup trucks because they don't want a new car they can't drive 50 they don't drive new cars because they can't afford a new car and high gas prices has made it even worse high utility prices high grocery prices so inflation has hit them so when the title comes out the inflation reduction act of course everybody's encouraged except as previously noted the wharton school of business says that it actually increases inflation for the couple couple of years the cbo says it has a negligible effect one way or the other on inflation bottom line it does not decrease inflation in fact i go back to that current inflation state we're in i remember the american rescue plan passed on a partisan basis i now call that the american recession plan and this could be the american recession plan 2.0 and if it does drive us into a recession it will decrease inflation because people won't have the income by which to pay for that with their that which they have to buy now by the way why do i say that well 50 of the book value tax is on manufacturers we are in a international jobs war countries around the world particularly china are subsidizing manufacturers to move there and they subsidize them in a variety of ways i would love to be pure free market my gosh let's get government out of everything and we're losing the jobs war and congress saw that we were losing the jobs war and began giving credits like we did in the chips bill for manufacturers to return now the left is looking at this and saying hmm those manufacturers we've had an increased number of manufacturing jobs it's been going pretty well they've been taking care of that which congress has used to incentivize them to come back and to hire more americans but we don't like that we're going to pay more we're going to make them pay more now the national association of manufacturers says that it will kill two hundred thousand jobs here in the us cbo says it will decrease investment in manufacturing if you want to lose a manufacturing war this is what you do but if you want to win you don't do it and i would say that republicans want to win that and this bill shows that democrats wish to lose let me mention one more thing not commented on yet the the climate impact now the bill says that they are going to reduce emissions since 2005 by 40 percent now what they don't tell you now that has not been independently verified one organization said it's more like 35 percent what they don't tell you is that we've already reduced emissions since 2005 by 17 percent we're halfway to their goal under current law we're scheduled to reduce emissions to 34 percent by 2030. so we're almost there and the improvement is marginal but they're only speaking about u s emissions not global emissions and so since initially at least they're going to be driving manufacturing in asia particularly china to be producing the batteries and other things that come here for their evs we could have global greenhouse gas emissions get worse now if they really want to tout the climate benefits then they should come clean as to what their analysis is and why are they not also including the increased emissions that will occur in other countries because of this policy there's more we could talk about but perhaps you have questions as i yield thank you yes ma'am some democrats should vote for this package if they care about deficit reduction republicans support this package if it didn't have any new government spending and it just addressed deficit reduction i'm sure others would have comments but let me point out that they say they were reduced by 200 to 300 000 200 billion dollars okay our economy uh that's about point eight to point one point two of our nation's gdp every year they're going to reduce that over 10 years it's going to be less than a fraction of 0.04 0.4 percent of our 0.04 roughly 0.08 of our nation's gdp what's that if things go perfect if things go perfectly um now and then the debt and deficit this will be a total rounding error so if that's what they're using to justify and if that's their strongest argument it's a pretty weak strong argument do you think democrats truly care about reducing the deficit or this is a way to justify billions in new government spending for things that they want i don't think they care and i think they're only trying to get a fig leaf to justify billions of new spending

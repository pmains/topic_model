joining us tonight a congressman with new legislation to deal with the border crisis Republican Lance Gooden of Texas joining us tonight let's start with the legislation that you've introduced and how important do you think it will be in this fight against the cartels open borders and illegal immigration sure the reason for this legislation is we have a problem right now with traffickers bringing children over because by having a child you can claim that you're a family unit and you get preferential treatment you can only be detained for up to 20 days and so child traffickers are snatching up these children south of the border and using them and then sending them back across the border after they have shuttled a group across and recycling these children what this bill does is it requires a DNA test to be performed it's just a mouth swab at the border that determines if there really is a familial relationship if you can't pass a DNA test then you've got to provide documentation that says that these children are supposed to be in your care custody and control and if you can't provide that then your child trafficker and we don't want you we're going to lock you up and then we're gonna take care of those children we're hoping to discourage trafficking across our southern border absolutely and the number somewhere around a third of all children traveling with adults turned out not to be related to those to those other adult illegal immigrants this goes back to the Obama administration when DNA testing the foundation for it had been put into action and for whatever reason the administration decided not to pursue it your thoughts on both their reasons and why it's taken so long to bring this to the forefront you know I'll go I'll go back to that third number you cited that's just what we know that we don't even know about what we're not catching at the border and so what this aims to accomplish is discouraging child trafficking I don't know why the Obama administration got away from stopping this before it festered into the problem that we have today but I know that Republicans and I believe Democrats also stand with me against child trafficking surely this concept would be bipartisan surely Democrats would come to the table and say this is a solution to end child trafficking this is not an immigration hot-button debate issue as much as it is a humanitarian issue that everyone should rally behind congressman border security as you know illegal immigration they are humanitarian issues they are humanitarian issues 70,000 deaths in this country from overdoses most of those as a result of opioids that have crossed that border from Mexico this primary source of methamphetamines marijuana heroin cocaine Mexico all of that money flowing by the tens of billions to the drug cartels of Mexico some twenty of them seven major cartels this is a war with those cartels and the money they're making off illegal immigration it's unconscionable and the radical DIMMs the the Schumer's and the policies have refused to step up and close loopholes and to help this president enforce the security of that border and end illegal immigration it's a shame that it's come to this point there's any good that comes out of any of this it's the Donald Trump's going to be reelected but until then why make these children suffer why do we even have to deal with this why have Democrats allowed it to get to be as bad as it is and I believe this bill will address that I look forward to a debate in Congress and I really do challenge my Democrats to come across the aisle put aside their partisan politics put aside their leftist agenda and say you know what if we're serious about child child trafficking let's come together and actually solve it

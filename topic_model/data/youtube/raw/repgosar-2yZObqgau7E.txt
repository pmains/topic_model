thank you madam chair from my heart i feel the pain of my fellow americans on both sides of the eye this issue we will all answer for our sins all of us fall short of the glory of god i'm no exception i've lived at times in rebellion against god and for every sinful act i will kneel before our lord and savior over the course of my 60 years i've failed and fallen in ways that bring shame upon my heart and soul i've been callous and uncaring i've lacked compassion and i've broken promises i've been at times a bad son an unworthy brother a poor father and a failed husband i've lived and thus i've sinned america is an anointed nation and as such our republic will move forward according to god's will and our nation will evolve in our savior's own time i stand in judgment of no man judgment is of the lord as a child of god now in my life obedient to his path i will fight to protect the innocent with every fiber of my being and every power of my spirit ultimately god's will will imbue itself into american society deep from our heart as has been mentioned here today america's laws ultimately will reflect god's love for his unborn children until that time some of us will never rest in our battle to protect the most vulnerable amongst us the precious and innocent children of the womb this has been a meaningful and insightful hearing i i am moved by the testimony of our witnesses today and i have faith and confidence in the future of our nation divided though we be on this issue i believe ultimately my brothers and sisters that we're in god's hands and we'll move forward according to his will madam chair i yield

now by mississippi senator roger wicker senator thanks for taking the time this morning hey jim thank you for calling attention to these problems well i want to ask you because of course you've been paying a lot of attention to this problem as well and you visited the area during the flooding first question is is there relief in sight well this has been a long-term problem and permanent relief is is going to take a while i i will say this we need to realize there's a flooding problem that's been going on for decades and then there's the water and sewer problem that has also been a problem this city has been under an emergency order from the epa on safe drinking water for two years this is the tenth year now under a consent decree about water and sewer about the sewage treatment system so it's been a long time getting here we have solutions to the flooding problem they're really on the five yard line right now we had the court of engineers in last week it happened that they were here during the flooding time but they see the problem and we can get that approved by epa and the corps of engineers uh say within five months that would be part of the solution okay as you mentioned this has been going on for for years decades even some residents say they're who failed these people it's remarkable to see this taking place in in the year 2022 in america is it is it the city is it the county is it the state is it the federal government or all of the above well i really like to look forward but needless to say there have been tax-based problems uh with uh with population decline there are there are some businesses that have moved out but but the fact remains we have money in the pipeline the bipartisan infrastructure bill provided mississippi 429 million dollars for uh water and sewer treatment so this is this is part of it a large portion of that will be available in this coming fiscal year so there's help on the way but but i'll tell you this is an emergency and and the american people are seeing this they're being very responsive and we're going to need additional federal help to uh to salvage the lives um and um and homes and futures of our major city i have six grandchildren that live inside the city limits in jackson so this is personal to me but it's also my capital city you're among the republicans who voted for that bipartisan infrastructure plan just i think it's often hard for people to understand how long that will take to make a difference can you give folks who are watching perhaps from the area and now is census okay when will there be a longer-term fix here well there's going to be a short-term fix in terms of of this rented pump and then i think within a matter of of months we could get this one fixed but but we've we've known for a while that the problem goes much deeper we have uh pipes under the city that are crumbling after decades and decades so it will be a long-term fix but we need to get those fixes approved by washington d.c by the epa and the people who have the ability to say yes to solutions that come up that have been arrived at on a bipartisan basis locally

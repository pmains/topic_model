Thank You mr. Speaker I thank the gentlelady for yielding I commend her for her tremendous leadership and with great pride we point to her as our ranking member on the Appropriations Committee thank you for yielding and for your leadership Thank You mr. Rogers for your leadership as an appropriate and a years I know the hard work that goes into putting an appropriations bill together there was a day when we did them individually it seems lately we just keep putting them on a bus and on omnibus that's too bad but in any event I appreciate the work that you have done to bring this bill to the floor and that's why I was so really heartbroken I don't think I've ever said that word on the floor the house heartbroken to see the taint that was placed on this valuable appropriations bill from on high I'm sorry that you cannot have a full homeland security bill that's for sure we knew that was possible the speaker says in January we will vote on a full homeland security bill I hope that that is the case but the taint I refer to is what the president described in his letter today as a rider that would amend the dog's dodd-frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and weaken a critical component a financial system reform aimed at reducing taxpayer risk so when people are talking to you about what's in the bill and this or that I would say to you what you are putting your name next to if you choose to vote for this bill and why I'm so appalled well I'll tell you why it was September 2008 things were happening and the financial services industry Lehman Brothers down Merrill Lynch down AIG whatever all happened within a matter of days I called the Secretary of the Treasury and I say how can we be helpful what is going on and he said it's terrible I said was one of the measure so institutions going down and so it's bigger than that we're in a serious meltdown why am i calling you mister secretary Paulson well the White House wasn't ready for Congress to know about this but you're the PERT speaker at the time I was Undersecretary of the Treasury you're asking me I'm telling you we're in a terrible situation so they came to my office that night the speaker's office House and Senate Democrats and Republicans we came together and we heard an appalling meltdown of our financial institutions and I said to the SEC the chairman of the Fed mr. Bernanke who was there mr. Bernanke what do you think about what the secretary said and he said if we do not act immediately we will not have an economy by Monday we will not have an economy by Monday by the policies that were in place at that time we were taken to a place where we wouldn't have an economy no commercial paper no economy by Monday and here we are 2014 going down the same path earlier today the Republicans put a bill on the floor that would make certain tax incentives permanent and unpaid for we should be doing a revenue reform but not that way because that the revenue policy of the Bush administration contributed to the Great Recession taking us close to a depression so their tax policy jeopardized our economy and then their lay sale a sale a stay fair attitudes of no regulation that took us to a meltdown of our financial institutions to the point where we the taxpayers had to rescue the financial institutions to the tune of 700 billion dollars that's twice as much that isn't a domestic distress discretionary spending of the bill that will come before us two years worth of non-defense discretionary domestic spending we put preserve provisions in the bill that the American taxpayer would be paid back but that didn't get wasn't enough for the Republicans to vote for it they voted against it by and large it was the Democrats who voted for the tarp the most harmful I mean difficult vote for members to vote for and the most politically harmful to them so here we are in the house being blackmailed being blackmailed to vote for an appropriations bill I'm not asking anybody to vote one way or another I'm just telling you why I would not put the name of my constituents in my district next to a bill that does as the president says weaken a critical component of financial system reform aimed at reducing taxpayer risk at that time if used us of bailing out Wall Street at the expense of Main Street the public still doesn't understand fully why everybody would benefit from what we had to do but we shouldn't have to do that 700 billion dollars because of lace they fear attitudes and and trickle-down tax policies of the Bush administration which got us to that place and because of initiatives taken by President Obama when he became president working with the Democratic Congress with our initial a Recovery Act we were able to reverse some of that pull ourselves out of the ditch Republicans took us in so our today this should be a day where we say isn't it too bad we can't do more for the American people but in the interest of bipartisanship we have put together a bill on the Appropriations Committee that helps meet the needs of the American people when that been just fine except popping out of the Wilmers come two things one one this provision this provision that as I described that the president described and then another one to make matters worse to make matters worse a bill that lifts political contributions to such a height but it's really unimaginable as to why those who put this in there thought that that was a good idea they told me it was ninety million dollars for the convention it turns out to be millions of dollars from a donor or from the family in that regard so was it weren't even on the level on how it was portrayed but be that as it may what's important is what is in the bill and as congressman sarbanes said it's quid pro quo you have quid give Wall Street what they want relax the responsibilities that have this this is a moral hazard we're being asked to vote for a moral hazard why is this in an appropriations bill because it was the price to pay to get an appropriations bill I was told we couldn't get all these other things that have been described here so loving beautifully unless we gave Wall Street this gift and on top of that that we gave their donors high-end donors all the opportunity world to pour money into the process now maybe the people the public is right about Washington DC I heard this funny line about about Lily Tomlin when she was interesting the operator when she said am i communicating with the people that I'm speaking to are we communicating with the people we are speaking to when we say to them it is an important priority and we have to put it in our our budget bill that we give donors the opportunities then n money undermining the confidence the American people have in our political system at the same time at the same time as we say to Wall Street you can engage in risky activity with your derivatives and the FDIC will ensure your action it's just plain wrong under this bill under the dodd-frank act if a bank wanted to engage in those risky activities they had to be pushed out to another entity and that entity could engage in those activities but they were not insured by the American taxpayer with this bill now we are saying the exposure the recourse is with the US taxpayer just plain wrong and what is it doing on an appropriations bill except to be that have this bill be taken hostage this is a ransom this is blackmail you don't get a bill unless Wall Street gets it some taxpayer coverage so it's really so sad that something as I which I respect enormous Lee the appropriation process because it's hard there's so many competing calls on resources so much that we have to try to invest in in their health or education the economic stability of their families the air they breathe the water they drink and how we fund all of that and I have some questions about some of that in this bill but the fact is it's all a compromise and it could have been a good compromise so whatever members choose to do and I'm enormous ly disappointed that the White House feels that the only way they can get a bill is to go along with this and that would be the only reason I think they would say they would sign such a bill that would weaken a critical component of financial system reform aimed at reducing taxpayer risk those are the words and the administration's own statement I feel sad for the American people today because we're saying in order for us to invest in the education of your children and all of the responsibilities we have to American people we have to pay off Wall Street and then do an in addition to that and you know I don't regret Wall Street and I don't paint everybody there with the same brush but Rimes am saying is the taxpayer should not assume the risk it's back to the same old Republican ritas formula privatize the gain nationalize the risk you succeed it's in your pocket you fail the taxpayer pays the bill it's just not right so I think we have a missed opportunity today to have some strong bipartisanship and there will be bipartisan support for this bill but the fact is my colleagues you are being asked to put your name next to privatizing the game and nationalizing the risk you are put it as to put your name next to practically unlimited contributions political campaigns that's at a time when we're trying for reform to reduce the role of politics and money increase the voice of the American people and so again its opportunity but you know I respect decisions that members will make because there are equities to be weighed here but the biggest equity we have is our responsibility to the American people to do the right thing and what was added to this bill which may be a good bill what was added to this bill is not the right thing and that is why it has my partisanship it has good things in it but it will not have my support

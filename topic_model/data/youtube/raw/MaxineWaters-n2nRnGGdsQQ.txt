those are headlines this our CNN presents New Orleans rising continues right now and you press play we sit down with Audrey and melding woods in the house they rebuilt to show them footage of Pontchartrain Park after the Katrina flooding they were joined by their children grandchildren they are stunned by what they see for the very first time they're seeing their own house under water oh wow you know you thought you knew it was high but we never actually saw it and to see it so I hope that it was away I think about how close we came to losing our parents I don't see how we're sitting here I don't say I was sitting in the same house that's our house so every child viewers is literally sobbing at me too and your grandchildren rhyme and you're not crying no why not because we made within a year 74 year-old Audrey and 81 year old Melton were gutting their house they had on these white suits with white masks and they're hauling out pieces of sheet rock my father with a cane carrying a piece of sheet rock out and I remember song and Riaan saying do you know what your parents are doing they're gutting the house by themselves that's like okay we can't anymore let's just go ahead on find someone today I'll own clothes and statement a record of the woods initial down payment four hundred and sixty five dollars was one of the few things in the house to survive the flooding but when it came time to rebuild and refurnish their home the projected price tag was staggering over three hundred thousand dollars the woods were forced to take out a loan for more than a hundred and twenty thousand dollars and it still took wondering how I'm going to repay that loan because I know that I want in my lifetime it's a common tale in New Orleans as damnable and criminal that people who pay premiums for decades like my parents we're giving no relief in their darkest hour I mean that's what insurance is all about that in your time of need you will be made whole and we weren't made whole by 2006 still only a third of the residents had found their way back this compared to middle-class white neighborhoods where the return rates were at least twice that he called it a chocolate city some people took great umbrage at that I felt that african-americans in this city were getting signals that they weren't welcome back and I wanted to try and overcome that hold a chocolate city black people know what that means oh they know they got the message even so ray nagin who was mayor of New Orleans when Katrina hit says that in its aftermath there was talk of changing the face of the city do you think there were people literally who would try to keep black people out of the city I think that people were looking at economics and I think they were looking at once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to kind of recasting wallets differently and some openly said you know we don't want poor black people back but I think that message was also bleeding over into our black middle class in January 2006 The Times Picayune printed this map on its front page it was a plan for redeveloping the city putting parks in areas that before Katrina were largely residential when they started talking about all the areas that were gonna be green space those are all of your black neighborhoods after the uproar over green dots the city eventually released its current recovery plan Troy Henry had worked on earlier plans they decided to create 17 recovery zones and Punk's train park didn't make the list of the 17 so literally we in the community was viewing it as we're left out that the areas deemed recovery zones covered predominantly white neighborhoods caught the attention of California congresswoman Maxine Waters and the Congressional Black Caucus if you don't put any money into rebuilding you don't have the people to return you don't have to rehab these houses you would think that our neighborhood like Pontchartrain Park with the history that it has of a determined people would be honored by trying to preserve it but it was not why is it always come down to race I mean maybe it's just economics maybe it's just the elderly population here you'd like to say no that's not what it is let's let's try and see this through a different lens and unfortunately it comes back too often in so many ways Herbie Aubry points to bureaucratic red tape as a major stumbling block two years after the flooding a mail carrier was still unable to tear down his ravaged home so he could start to build a new one back in 2007 he vented his frustration on the local news they told me that they had a stop demolish order on it because this area had been deemed a historic area I said well nobody informed me of this it didn't help that Herbie now back working in Pontchartrain Park was in perpetual transit he and his family were still camped 70 miles away with relatives the hose needs to go out with the city the road home insurance companies traveling back and forth from Baton Rouge and traffic every day it's stressful my reaction was to work I'm here I'm working because this is where Jack needs to be and he just support him here did you have a fight over the return or not to return we've sometimes he would just get so aggravated that he would just get this far leave I'm gonna let you know I'm done I don't go and then I go to the window even as Herbie's marriage struggled he stood by Wendell and in November 2008 finally welcomed news the city of New Orleans signed a deal with the Pontchartrain Park Development Corporation accidental developer Wendell Pierce had earned his wings we were part of a bidding process let me say Wendell aspired to deliver on a grand scale 400 new homes if you go around this city they have one than Tuesdays we call him all over god bless him I'm trying to rebuild a neighborhood man but by early 2010 more than a year after the deal was signed the state had turned over only four plots of land give them up then some welcome news

hello i'm dina Titus your representative from Nevada's first congressional district I'm sorry I can't be at today's event in person but it's an honor to participate with a VA during Pride Month even from afar every June we reflect on and celebrate the LGBT civil rights movement and while we've made great strides towards equality the tragedy in Orlando serves as a stark reminder of the work that remains to be done across the country we must continue to root out hatred and discrimination wherever it remains the VA has worked to ensure that all our veterans and their families receive equal treatment regardless of sexual orientation and gender identity and we must continue to build on that promise as the Department of Defense prepares to allow transgender servicemembers to proudly serve their nation openly our VA must be ready to address their needs after they take off the uniform and separate from service second just like any other workplace the VA must be a place where LGBT employees and veterans can feel welcome so I support legislation that would prohibit businesses that contract with the VA from discriminating against their LGBT employees third ensuring that those rights and the federal benefits that come with marriage are accessible to every citizen is also very important to me even though the United States Supreme Court issued a ruling bringing marriage equality to every state in the Union we are still working to ensure that the rights and federal benefits that come with marriage are always accessible to every citizen toward that end I offered the veterans spouses equal treatment Act its legislation that removes discriminatory language and the VA law that defines spouse as a person of the opposite sex it's time to update that antiquated language so as we continue to celebrate Pride Month you can be assured I will not give up the fight for equal protections for Americans regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity so please consider me and advocate for all our veterans and call on my office anytime if you have questions or concerns thank you very much

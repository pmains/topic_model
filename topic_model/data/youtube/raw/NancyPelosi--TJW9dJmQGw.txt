[Music] well I would think that if they were honest about it this sort of major investigation into the bike it's a very simple action [Music] would you agree that the president has the same obligation as the mayor as the governor as the member of Congress cannot withhold aid unless he gets an investigation into a political rival yes sir I would agree with that hypothetically I would agree isn't the principle that no person including the president is above the law absolutely essential yes yeah sir the rule of law is central to our democracy ambassador Taylor I want to draw on your experience finally as a West Point cadet and as an infantry commander in Vietnam in a battlefield situation is a commanding officer allowed to hold up action placing his troops at risk until someone provides him a personal benefit no sir is that because of commanding officers did that they would be betraying their responsibilities to the nation and the men and women under their command yes sir could that type of conduct trigger a court-martial yes sir [Music] the day after that Donald Trump is back on the phone asking another nation to involve itself in another US election that says to me this president believes he is above the law beyond accountability and in my view there is nothing more dangerous than an unethical president who believes there are above the law and I would just say to people watching here at home and around the world in the words of my great colleague we are better than that adjourned [Music]

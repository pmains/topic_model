thank you mr speaker yield two minutes the gentleman from wisconsin mr fitzgerald gentleman from wisconsin is recognized for two minutes mr speaker i thank the ranking member um there is a motion to recommit that i would like to offer if we adopt a motion recommit we will instruct the house committee on judiciary consider the amendment to h.r 1808 which excludes active duty and retired military from the ban on assault weapons i therefore ask unanimous consent to include the text of the amendment the record immediately prior to the vote on the motion to recommit without objection mr speaker just imagine you're a 17 year old who makes a decision to enlist in the army the marine corps the navy and then that 17 year old goes through eight weeks of basic combat training bct at one of the one of the basic training centers in fort jackson or fort knox or fort benning and then they're given a service weapon an m16 typically and taught to assemble disassemble that weapon down to the bolt they'll go through the draining with the drill sergeant they'll be on a range on a live fire range with this service weapon and then the 17 year old to go to ait to be taught their specialty and continue to be on active duty or in the reserves or in the national guard and then potentially deployed what this bill seeks to do is prevent this member of the military who comes home either to the reserving or national guard unit or on active duty from purchasing a rifle that they can use on their own my colleagues who support the bill are saying we trusted you to join the service we encouraged you to join the service but now when it comes down to it we really don't trust you to go out and purchase that weapon it makes no sense if the majority is going to snub every veteran in this country by saying we don't trust you how can the u.s government ask someone to enlist when they don't trust them to have the same responsibility with their own personal weapon mr speaker if we adopt a motion to recommit we will instruct the committee on judiciary to consider my amendment to h.r 1808 to ensure that the nation's active duty members and veterans will be gentlemen's time has expired 30 seconds gentlemen is uh recognized for another 30 seconds mr speaker it's still amazing to me that the majority rejected this in the judiciary committee they talk a good game when it comes to veterans but when it comes right down to it they don't trust them and i yield back

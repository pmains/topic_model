thank you mr chairman and i've submitted a document for the record is it has it been approved let me check has has the document been approved we can review it they're reviewing it as we speak and we'll uh we'll okay okay the document fairly okay we're going to address all the documents at the end of the uh here okay the document is fairly simple it's just a document indicating that uh that this from the united steelworkers uh that we're just showing that over the last uh recent years numbers of years uh that they have not worked with us in unity and by part of 99.6 of their have gone to contributions democrats so i i appreciate their remarks because i agree coming from a steel area i can relate to the steelworkers but let me let me just let me get to my primary remarks in their question uh because what i was hearing mr chairman was that biden's transition from fossil fuels uh uh is gonna check is gonna we've got to have alternative employment uh if we're gonna do that and and uh but we look at what john kerry said president he says president biden wants workers to have alternatives he goes on to say to make solar panels gina mccarthy says workers from coal communities will be quote put to work making solar panels and even vice president o'hara said displaced workers uh coal miners can work quote reclaiming abandoned land mines i'm not sure she meant to say that but nevertheless that's what was said so i'm saying that mr chairman let's be fundamental there are no solar panel or wind man wind turbine manufacturing plants in gillette wyoming hazard kentucky caddus ohio or welsh west virginia these are communities that are based on fossil fuels with downstream jobs and steel fabricating concrete plants machine shops so i i just i don't understand what these alternatives since these towns and these workers don't have other alternatives you understand these are small towns they don't have choices so i guess they have three choices if they have any one is be underemployed go from eighty five thousand dollar job to twenty they could commute hundreds of miles to find some other job someplace else and leave their families or the third option i guess is relocate so i if i could to the steel worker uh you can use are these the best options we have anna thank you for the question sorry it took me a moment to come off mute um i think we see this slightly differently i mean there certainly historically has been a discrepancy between where renewable jobs have been created and and some of the devastation we've seen particularly in coal communities this may happen over a period of time but but i'm saying that where was the where is this transition plan for the workers at the keystone pipeline or the atlantic coast pipeline or the mountain valley pipeline their jobs are cut overnight they don't have a transition so i'm very concerned about our idea of having a transition plan so now if i could go to uh back to uh uh was with mr um with the manhattan institute uh wouldn't it be better to be investing in innovation and research like you know dealing with carbon capture rather than importing and relying on other countries like china or for rare reverse and critical materials i like the heirs comment mr mills well let me first go on record with saying as i said before i i'm uh fully supportive of building more factories in america that can make solar panels and batteries i'm in support and have asked many times in the past for congress to think about encouraging more mining in my mineral processing in america and more steel production in america i'm i'm a i'm an uh unabashed endorser of more of all these jobs in america it's a practical matter that takes time as you said and over the coming years as we accelerate the incentives and requirements for wind solar batteries it necessarily means exporting jobs it just does because as i said on my opening remarks 90 of solar panels are now imported we can't build factories fast enough we certainly can't open minds fast enough to get the critical minerals for batteries so as a practical matter in the coming decade it's you know it's arithmetically and scientifically and economically impossible to have any other consequence but exporting the environmental consequences of those activities to other countries and exporting the primary jobs for those machines another country so it's i think it's a very thorny problem for congress to deal with i i fully endorse the idea of of uh you know encouraging more production in america this is this is uh we have to be honest about what it will mean right now if i could mark just jump in but what happens to gillette wyoming that hazard kentucky caddis or wealth what happens to those in the meantime there are no other alternatives i i well we know that you laid out the three answers there are no other answers if jobs disappear overnight which they can when when bands are enacted or things are canceled obviously but i'm slightly more optimistic about the ability to do retraining in the modern era than we were in the last 30 years but i i that takes time too right you can you can quote repurpose skilled workers to other things but that doesn't they have to have a factory we don't we don't make solar panels in any significant quantity in america so there's no place to go you could install more of them but those are as everybody knows important jobs but they're very low wage jobs the gentleman yields back

hi i'm byron donald's candidate for congress it's been a long campaign and you have nine people running but the number one question most of us really haven't answered is why are we running you see i believe in two very important things number one southwest florida needs a proven conservative to represent you in congress i got started in a tea party movement 10 years ago in the florida legislature i have one of the most conservative voting records in our state the last four years i stood against the republican party my own party to protect your constitutional rights so i have proven to be the conservative you can trust but there's also something going on in america there is the political culture war that we face and we have to have a member of congress who cannot just be around to cast votes but who can actually be a leader for the cause of liberty for the cause of our constitution and for the cause of having america continue to be the greatest nation man has ever known it requires leadership that can take our message of conservatism to all voters i'm byron donald's so if you wanted to know why i'm running this is why we have the greatest nation in the world we have to fight to keep it and i'm the leader in southwest florida that can get it done god bless you and i hope to have your [Music] vote you

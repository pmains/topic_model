my ancestors arrived in 1790 so we've operated the same farm it's been in the same family never out of the family for eight generations my dad did a really good job he started taking me the farm when I was you know two three years old and and by the time I was four or five he had me painting gates and and cutting thistles and things like that on the farm and living off the land my young son guy will be the ninth generation hopefully my life now be able to instill a desire in him to keep the legacy going that work ethic and those values and that self-reliance is deeply instilled in the values of Tennessee and the values of our people but what I sense in Tennesseans is that they want to take care of themselves they don't want to be reliant on someone else they're kind of fiercely independent we're taught that it's our responsibility to take the blessings that God gives us and use them to make things better and so we don't think it's acceptable that our generation leave this country in worse shape than our parents left it to us the founding fathers ideal was a citizen legislature I think we'd all agree that the less time that the Congress is in session probably the better off we all are I plan to advocate for getting our work done in a timely way and a journey and coming home if we're going to keep it a great country if we're going to hand over a great country to our to our children we've got to work hard to to get back on track and to make sure that we instill in the next generation the values that our parents instilled in us [Music]

I rise today in opposition to HR 3115 the Superior National Forest land exchange act of 2017 this bill mandates an exchange of more than 6,600 acres in the Superior National Forest for the construction of a massive open pit sulphide ore copper nickel mine this project is conover shil with a majority of Minnesotans who oppose the toxic sulphide mine or mining because it is a threat to our water quality public lands and outdoor recreation in our state this legislation also raises serious due process concerns there are four pending lawsuits challenging the land exchange based on existing vyr mental laws and concerns about the appropriate appraisal values federal courts are still considering these suits but this legislation undermines the proper judicial review to expedite the construction of the polyMet mind finally this bill ignores the treaty rights of the Fond du Lac band of Lake Superior Chippewa a federally recognized tribal nation the Fond du Lac reservation is downstream from the proposed mine site and the tribal chairman has told Congress this mind will and I quote the tribal chairman posed a direct threat to the water and the fish the game and the wild rice on which the tribe depends the National Congress of American Indians also strongly opposes this legislation HR 31:15 undermines legal due process environmental safeguards and the treaty rights of our Native American brothers and sisters and I urge my colleagues to vote no on HR 35 15 and I yield back

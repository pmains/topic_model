American exceptionalism is not some sort of ethnic claim that because of something we received in the bloodstream Americans are better than other people American exceptionalism is a claim about history American exceptionalism is a claim about what happened in the American Founding and if we don't understand why the American Founding was extraordinary you can be sure that our kids won't understand why America is extraordinary and we live in that kind of time of cultural amnesia at one level this has been going on since the 1960s but this president in a much more aggressive way has decided to attack the exceptional nature of American history and so we should pause and go back to our founding moment because our founding moment is truly extraordinary our founders were making a claim about human dignity our founders were saying that everybody everywhere not just people like us who've been blessed to be born in this place but everybody everywhere is ordained with natural rights everyone everywhere is created in the image of God with natural rights and government is just our shared project to secure those rights government is not the author or the sorts of any of our rights

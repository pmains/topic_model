ourselves to our notes good morning everyone thank you all for being here it's an honor it's really an honor to be here with members and honored guests of brookings institution thank you ej for your kind words of introduction for your leadership in so many ways and congratulations as a senior fellow at brookings with a chair named for w april harriman how lovely for almost 100 years brookings has been the first name in looking forward public policy can hear for over 100 years brookings has been the first word in forward-looking public policy the this institution and your president strobe talbot and your fellows have been a strong and steady intellectual resource to public private and non-profit policy makers across the country together we can reach towards greater possibilities for all americans in our discussion an america where every working family has opportunity prosperity and security beginning this year this new year in a new congress we have both an opportunity and a responsibility uh to reflect on our progress toward that america and refocus and renew our efforts for it reflecting on our progress six years ago in january president obama stood on the steps of the capitol as he took the oath of office and issued a call for swift bold action now not only to create new jobs but to lay a foundation for growth one week and one day later house democrats passed the american reinvestment and re recovery act one of the biggest public investments in our nation's history the recovery act saved or created 3.5 to 4 million new job rebuilding our infrastructure and reinvesting in energy innovation reducing taxes for working families turning a tide of the worst economic recession since the great depression 64 days later on the same day in the house and the senate quite remarkable the democratic congress followed up by passing the president's budget a plan for growth and opportunity based on three pillars investments in health care in education and innovation and in energy our aims were clear great jobs great jobs here we go great job can't say it enough jobs reduce the deficit invest in a stronger future for every american family believing that health care must be a right for all americans not just a privilege for a few we passed the affordable care act even if if there were no other reason to pass the affordable care act if every american were happy with his or her own health insurance and health care we still would have had to pass the bill because the cost of health care in america was unsustainable unsustainable to individuals to families to businesses large and small to governments local the national level importantly as documented by the council of economic advisors the affordable care act is helping to drive down health care cost growth in his two historic lows today the affordable care act has delivered newfound health security to 16 million americans and extended the life of the medicare trust fund by 13 years education and innovation maybe this is so i can't get a drink of water in between is it on yes usually now i revert to my mother five voice to project across the room recognizing that education has been the indispensable ladder to achieve the american dream the democratic caucus acted to strengthen early childhood education deepen our commitment to vulnerable students and dramatically expand access to affordable college education we pass the gi bill for the 21st century for our veterans and their families as part of the largest increase in veterans funding in our history making historic investments in education healthcare and economic opportunities in terms of american innovation we substantially bolstered our investments fueling basic research and driving forward innovative energy technologies i'll expand on this in a moment maybe more than a moment i don't know knowing that our reliance on foreign fossil fuels was unhealthy for our economy our national security and the air our children breathe democrats acted to make america energy independent by increasing domestic energy production and we increased energy efficiency and more than doubled clean energy production solar power is up by tenfold and wind is up by threefold in terms of wind america is number one in the world this progress is critically important as we address the climate crisis knowing that the only way for the economy to fully recover we must recognize that the middle class was the real job are the real job creators in america in a consumer economy when workers have the wages and confidence to spend they generate demand and it in turn creates jobs it's about bigger paychecks this is an if there is an important connection i said i'd talk about three connections this is an important connection about america's economy the success of the middle class is the most important engine of economic growth and of meaningful deficit reduction this understanding is consistent with middle class economics which the president articulated in his state of the union address last month and the budget he released yesterday democrats commitment to middle class economics stands in sharp contrast to the republicans relentless trickle-down agenda the agenda that drove our economy into a ditch republicans economic agenda included massive unpaid tax for tax cuts for the rich two unpaid four wars and a doctrine of no regulation no supervision of wall street it is this radical agenda that precipitated the financial meltdown and shattered our economy how bad was it on the night of thursday september 18 2008 the secretary of the treasury came to the capitol for an emergency meeting with congressional leaders to inform us of the severity of the meltdown when i asked the chairman of the fed ben burnett at the time ben bernanke what he thought of what the treasury secretary was telling us he told the leaders if we do not act immediately we will not have an economy by monday this is thursday evening that's where we were september 18 2008. in order to stop the meltdown of america's financial institutions it was necessary for us to pass the troubled assets release program tarp supported largely by democrats and later we enacted historic consumer wall street reforms with dodd-frank regulations far from creating growth republican priorities drove an economic catastrophe that destroyed jobs destroyed the jobs the savings and the security of millions of the millions of america's working families and now republicans want to take us back to the same failed policies of trickle down and they say they say here they say they say they say they say they say laissez faire including repealing dodd-frank in their obsession with trickle-down economics republicans failed to see the connection between the purchasing power of the middle class and the success of america's economy six years after the deepest recession since the great depression the fruits of democratic efforts on the economy are clear 11.2 million new private sector jobs created in 58 months the longest uninterrupted stretch of private sector growth in our history we provided a lifeline to save the auto industry and more than a million jobs as part of that unemployment rate down from around 10 percent to 5.6 percent deficit cut by two-thirds from 1.4 trillion dollars to 483 billion this year excuse me stock market has gone from under 7 000 to over 17 000. manufacturing exports are rising we've seen reading scores go up high school graduation rates go up more young people attending college than ever 16 million previously uninsured americans now have affordable dependable health care and again we extended the life of the medicare trust fund by 13 years to name a few accomplishments however even with all of this progress working families are still being squeezed the reason our economy has not had a full recovery is because of stagnant wages it bears repeating that a consumer economy in a consumer economy the middle class are the job creators we must expand the purchasing power of families ensure that working men and women enjoy the bounty of their unprecedented productivity bigger paychecks better infrastructure more manufacturing in the united states we must focus like a laser on strengthening the financial security of america's working families once again there is a need for swift bold action to reignite the middle class engine of our prosperity in order to succeed we must have a healthy respect for another connection the connection between the public and private sectors private enterprise is the heart of the economy generating wealth and jobs however in order for the private sector to succeed the public sector must act to secure the conditions in which the private sector can continue to flourish when the public sector is doing its job investing in strong education building infrastructure maintaining the courts ensuring public safety etc it performs tasks that the private sector cannot perform itself public sector accomplishments however that leave the private sector in infinitely better shape better equipped to deliver jobs and opportunity for all americans must happen congress must grasp again the importance of ambitious goals built into a budget for the future which is the budget which should be a statement of our values of what is important to us should be how we allocate our resources this is the third connection i want to highlight the undeniable connection between the investments we make today and the success of our country tomorrow today i believe we must make big bold commitments in four areas research and innovation back to that education infrastructure and investments in working families through the tax code innovation is the invigorator of our economy research creates jobs launches entire new industries and gives us the miraculous power to cure however according to the american academy of arts and sciences the report they just put out within the past couple of weeks the united states has dropped to 10th place 10th place in national r d investment as a percentage of gdp 10 place the united states of america as the report makes clear unless basic research becomes a higher government priority than it has been in recent decades the potential for fundamental scientific breakthroughs and future technological advances will be severely constrained the report calls for increasing our nation's total research investment to at least 3.3 percent of gdp we must meet that need to reduce the deficit of innovation the president and congress must work together to establish a sustainable growth rate in federal basic research in terms of education we know that to we we know to achieve equality of opportunity we must have equality of education we will always have an opportunity gap so long as we have an education gap today it is clear that one of the most important ways to address the education gap at education inequality from early childhood all the way to lifetime learning is with the power of technology especially broadband broadband access has more energy benefits than just enhanced computer skills it opens the door to a whole new host of new teaching applications and tools enriching the student and supporting the teacher as recently as 2012 only 37 percent of our nation's schools had enough broadband for digital learning placing 40 million kids on the wrong side of the digital divide totally unacceptable we must meet the need to reduce the deficit of opportunity ensuring that every child in every zip code has the high speed broadband they need to learn to explore and to thrive we must act to close the opportunity gap in education because we cannot afford to leave anyone behind and by the way nothing returns more money to the treasury than investments in education in terms of infrastructure the american society of civil engineers last assessment of our nation's infrastructure rated america d plus d plus after years of disrespect disrepair and under investment we have a according to the american society of civil engineers 3.6 trillion trillion that's with the tr trillion dollar deficit in america's infrastructure what we know is that no maintenance is the most expensive maintenance modern infrastructure is essential for our country it promotes commerce moving products to and from market it improves the quality of life by moving people to and from work and school more quickly it is good for the quality of our air and our water it works to connect all of our communities to the promise of the internet with broadband we must meet the need to reduce the deficit in infrastructure and to do so in an updated and green way over the years we have proven that policies that leverage private sector capital and expertise with government oversight are successful ways to create better more sustainable communities we should learn from these examples and expand opportunities for public private partnerships we should be putting people to work building roads bridges mass transit water systems broadband achieve bigger paychecks and better infrastructure and this is a strong priority in the president's budget in order to fund these investments we must create that will create jobs and reduce the deficit we must use the tax code and eliminate special interest tax expenditures that increase the deficit they are spending tax expenditures these loopholes as we close special interest loopholes we can reduce the corporate rate and produce more revenue we can have tax reform that ensures that all americans pay their fair share the economic security of america's working families must be our priority part of these reforms must include making permanent improving the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit policies that are set to expire in 2007 initiatives with bipartisan support that strengthened the budgets of working families and we did this with president bush in his stimulus package so this was has bipartisan support if these policies are allowed to expire these reforms nearly 16 million americans including 8 million children will be pushed into or pushed deeper into poverty we must also in that regard strengthen the child care development tax credit which is in the president's budget to further help families the ranking member of the budget committee our ranking member budget committee chris van has proposed several vote put several bold proposals on the table these proposals include a ceo employee paycheck fairness act a savers bonus to support retirement repealing the dual career penalty instituting a 0.1 financial transactions fee and provisions restoring respect for hard work and the tax code they're being reviewed by our members with tax reform for the middle class we could we can put more money into the pockets of working families and again ignite the middle engine of middle-class consumers demand that drives growth and opportunity for everyone a strong middle class is the bedrock of our prosperity it is the backbone of our democracy this isn't the understanding that animates each of the connections i have outlined today the collection the connection between public action and private success the connection between growing paychecks and reducing the deficit the connection between our investments today and our success tomorrow for us to choose to achieve a bright and durable future for our country we must embrace the fact that the financial security of our working families is both a measure and the engine of our nation's success it's a simple truth when the middle class succeeds america succeeds our recognition of that truth guides democrats action and orchestrating the recovery and as a laser focus again on the purchasing power of working families that our economy needs today we must achieve bigger paychecks better infrastructure invest in education and innovation and manufacture more products in the united states only by laying a firm foundation for growth which the president talked about in his inaugural address based on ambitious goals for our future can we secure and maintain a vibrant middle class only by focusing on working families can we reignite the american dream and step into a new era of american prosperity thank you all for the opportunity to be with you this morning i look forward to your questions thank you so much i just want to say that we apologize for the state of that microphone but it was actually a setup to show that no you'll allow no obstacle to silence your voice so welcome up this morning um i am very tempted to ask you about the impact on the middle class of what is clearly one of the most important news stories in the country right now i refer to pete carroll's decision to call a pass at the end of the super bowl it is clear that this has done wonders for the morale of the middle class in my native new england uh but you can pass on that um uh issue if you'd like where where i'd like to start um oh you can see by the paper it was the offense coach who called the past well i'm sorry but pete took responsibility as a good leader um yes no you can be reassured that no decision you ever made will be as second guessed as that one so um i wanted to uh i wanted to start sort of big with the president's budget it i think you can make a case that it's his most aggressive effort to influence uh the direction of the public debate in some ways since he took office um and he's made this um this effort um at a moment uh when republicans control both houses i wonder if you could talk a bit about how and then you have congressman val holland's proposals that are also out there um how are you going to balance a desire to put forward what democrats would do uh if they could if they controlled both houses again and how you will influence the outcome of what will inevitably if we're going to have have a budget at all the inevitably some compromise between the president the democrats and this particular republican congress well first of all we talked when we talk about what we would do we talked about what we have done and now we have to go forward because other things need to be done but i believe that the president's budget does have within it many areas of common ground infrastructure has never been a partisan issue we've always been able to put forth strong infrastructure legislation until the president suggested and then of course it became a a little bit different but i do think that the urgency is there the opportunities there is public-private partnerships and again it's an issue that has usually been non-partisan not even bipartisan nonpartisan in terms of some of the issues i talked about in the tax code relating to to children and the rest those are were priorities we put forth with president bush in his stimulus one he wanted to just use the tax code and he was was very accepting of proposals that we had for refundability all the for low income tax credit the uh child tax credit and the rest so these have been in issues that republicans not in addition to president bush have supported uh the issues that relate to sequestration this is probably the fundamental point in the budget that the president put forth that he would do away with sequestration which is anyway we'll do away with it and that is something that has appeal to republicans now i'm not here to speak for them but i'm just saying in the past they would actually be interested but what would do away with a sequestration uh where we had caps that we need to get away with if we were going to have growth they want to do that on the defense side and we support you know obviously we all support a strong national defense but also remove the caps on the the domestic side as well so whether it's the overarching nature of it which is to do away with sequestration there's probably could be common ground whether it is uh building the infrastructure of america investing in education these kinds of issues are really shouldn't have any partisan aspect to them so i think that while the president has staked out a very strong budget which i do believe is a statement of our national values of what we care about there is a distinction between his budget and the republican budget in terms of social security medicare all those things but on the other hand but on the other hand there's plenty of common ground to find some solutions and as i said in my the opening day and congress we all have to have the pride we take in our issues and knowledge we have of them the commitment we have but we also have to have humility about finding common ground where we can find it in your remarks you stressed the pride you and democrats take at what you accomplished particularly in the first two years notably the affordable care act the recovery act otherwise known as the stimulus the auto rescue yet these uh programs have never sort of captured broad popular support at least in the polls uh you know democrats have argued over and over that without the recovery act the recovery might not have happened or would have been infinitely slower the affordable care act has covered an awful lot of americans yet these still have not sort of grabbed uh the public the kind of majority support you would hope for but it wasn't as if it wasn't messaged properly but i have to say it's interesting to me to see all of our republican colleagues who speak out against the uh recovery package show up at every ribbon cutting and every groundbreaking uh 15 000 projects the statistics are staggering in terms of roads and mass transit all the things that came from that and again our fault that we haven't communicated i think there was a reluctance to uh people wanted to make sure the public knew that reducing the deficit was a very high priority for us and therefore that the jobs would come with it with the bill but not to boast of what the investments were early on it wasn't we should have messaged it differently as we should have messaged the affordable care act differently again on this point about the deficit one of the striking things about what the president did and in general what democrats are doing now is that there is they seem much less captive to the deficit debate it's almost as if that debate took hold so quickly that the things that needed to be done to get the economy moving were kind of pushed off the agenda can you talk about where the deficit is now relative to the desire to just get the country moving and deal with the long term in the long term well in order to reduce the deficit which is really important to all of us you have to have growth you can talk about cutting investments and you can talk about raising revenue and and all that should be on the table but you must have growth and you can't have false economies if anybody who thinks that by cutting education they're going to reduce the deficit is dead wrong because nothing brings more money to the treasury to reduce the deficit than the education of the american people from earliest childhood k-12 higher education post-grad lifetime learning for trained workforce so you have to you have to tell make a case to the american people about why certain investments are about the future and reduce the deficit and from the day the president took office to now the deficit has gone down two-thirds 1.4 trillion dollars so what is it 485 billion still too high we want to take it down but i think the public is understanding that growth and bigger paychecks for the consumer for working-class families to inject demand into the economy to create jobs that brings revenue uh to the treasury and so there has been a large 70 of the deficit has been reduced since the president took office it isn't any less a priority to reduce it further but there is a recognition more clearly that growth job creation is an important part of it not just by cutting investments as we go forward i just want to remind everybody that there are cards in the room and i should start getting them uh soon so please uh submit uh your questions again i also want to invite people uh to tweet if they uh wish uh hashtag pelosi at brookings um i want to um i could play a kind of psychological game and ask you what was the first thing that came to your mind when congressman paul ryan talked about envy economics but more generally i'd love to know what how do you react to that sort of argument i mean he made an it was interesting kind of juxta position where on the one hand he talked about rising inequality and then he talked about uh democratic economics as envy economics we don't have time to go completely into the republican budget but it is not a statement of values that most people would identify with when it comes to how we how we invest in the future and the rest but let me just say that it really is so wrong when i saw it i thought stale yesterday that isn't what this is about nobody begrudges sick people's success people recognize that that when people take risk and and succeed it creates wealth it creates jobs and that's a good thing what the concern is that we don't want that to happen at the exploitation of the worker so god bless everyone for their success god bless everyone for their success but not again at the exploitation now i don't paint everybody with the same brush but what we saw on wall street leading up to 2008 what we saw on wall street that was just not right now again not everyone on wall street should be painted with the same brush but we saw a situation where people on main street were seeing their the value of their homes or even their ability to keep a home the education of their children the stability of their jobs their savings were all diminished because of what happened in wall street and when we passed the tarp people said oh you just did that for wall street not for main street no we did it for our economy it's probably the toughest vote i ever asked members to take and they've paid a price for it because again not something clearly explained to the american people what the connection was between that tarp bailing out the banks and uh lifting up our economy that was interesting because i thought just may on that score because this was a big deal and not something that we should go back to but again would go back to the lacey lazy thing and by the way even adam smith wrote a different book what was his book called the theory of of principles oral sentiments of moral sentiments i wish he had written one book wealth of nations and the the uh theory of moral principles all in one book because he talks about the responsibility of people to each other in the other book so when i say laissez faire we all believe in the free markets you know that's that's what our capitalist system is about but it's not about they say they say they say fair that nobody there's no cop on the beat and look what happened a meltdown where the chairman of the fed an expert on the great depression ben bernanke an expert on the great tibetan tells us there'll be no economy by monday stunning stunning and so when he when paul ryan says that i want to quote him a chairman of the um of the standard oil of new jersey a few decades ago chairman abrams he talked about stakeholder capitalism capitalism where decisions are made by management address that took into consideration shareholders of course workers customers and the community at large and and that at that time we had uh wages at about for 30 times the ceo was making about 30 times what the workers were making 30 times productivity would rise ceo pay would rise workers wages would rise when we moved to something called shareholder capitalism where none of those other considerations the community at large the customer the the uh workers were part of the decision shareholder capitalism it went to 300 times ceo pay versus worker pay as i say a right angle going in the wrong direction and that so it's not about economic envy you know we don't we just don't want a rising tide to lift all yachts we wanted to lift all boats and and uh so god bless you for what you have but let's all share in the prosperity of our country because the productivity of the american worker contributes contributes to that and and uh and so i i think that's that's cute but it's not it's it's not a fact it's just not a fact everybody wants to succeed and they don't begrudge other people's success unless it's pressing them under their heel i think one of the headlines of the event is leader pelosi urges congressman ryan to read all of adam smith the um beautiful book adam smith's other book both of them actually i've got some great questions here which i am about to get to i want to ask one more question maybe i'll ask it in two half so i'll sneak in two questions um the the uh the first is when you look at a lot of polling there are two things that come out i think on public attitudes on the one hand there is a lot of skepticism about the way the economy is working a belief that laissez laisse to the nth power fair doesn't work by itself so there's a lot of general support for democratic ideas on the economy on the other side there is a lot of skepticism about government itself and that government itself can't really fix that and the reason i want to link it to the second question is that your democrats and this goes back to your days campaigning for your dad in baltimore always counted on the support of working class people of all colors white black latino democrats have had a particular problem with white working class people it seems to me some of it may relate to the first half of my question so i want to ask you a how do democrats especially whether they've got the white house but in a minority in congress restore some faith that government can actually succeed in doing some of these things and how do they win back more of these white working-class voters well i will add one other ingredient to your question because what happened in 2008 scarred people it scarred people and and they have uh in terms of the confidence they need to have consumer confidence to invest in and that i i'm not particularly interested in whether it's democrats or republicans we just want a policy that works for america's working families and i think the because of that scarring then people are feeling more optimistic about what's happening in the economy now but they are not the scarring has had them hesitate to think it's going to last or that that something else couldn't happen and that's not necessarily only government that's the private sector as well when they see people trying to repeal the volcker act and of dodd-frank and some other things so it's it's part of the debate as well in terms of the role of government that's been a debate in our country since we were founded it's always been what is the role of government how much do we need how much do we need at the federal level does it work and that's the lively legitimate debate of our country what i would say is different about the republicans now is it's not about the degree of government they many in the cauc and the i'm not talking about government republicans are at large in the country this is talking about the republicans in congress are not supportive of governance governance so it's not a place of where you are on the spectrum they're off the chart they don't support governance they don't believe in governance they don't believe in science and they don't believe in barack obama they have a trifecta going about being opposed to everything that is proposed and in their messaging with their endless money and all the rest of that uh that that has affected a thinking of people but also uh we haven't again messaged what we're doing and quite frankly the breakdown of the uh not the breakdown but the the not putting in perspective the uh rollout of the healthcare act was not a good thing you know people said oh it doesn't work well yeah but but the system works and 16 million people are into it it's like your refrigerator is keeping your food cold the light's not going on but the food is cold and so um you know so yeah that's an issue that we have to address you know as well as i that many of the people that you are describing had social issues that took a little path away uh from the democrats whether it was guns the 3gs guns got in and gaze but a lot of that is diminishing and so i maintain whatever it is about the social issues if you have a strong economic agenda that gives hope to people that they can get good paying jobs good paying jobs and give them that confidence of them that is the winning argument uh and that's one that we won't make the differentiation now now believe me and i mean this from the bottom of my heart if the republicans would come around to places where we could come together on these elections wouldn't be so important but as long as they in intend to engage and trickle down uh they say they say they make make i said once to the press and my president's government they make um um adam smith look like a they said what's a so i don't know what saying that must be a generational thing but but they don't this is so far beyond uh what our responsibility is in order to uh to uh protect our middle class and all that that involves so some of it was cultural issues that took people away from us some of it is that even though everything is improving they still have that scar from 08 and they're not ready to fully embrace what is happening they see government having played a role in what happened in a wait either by omission or by passing tarp which they didn't like but we had to do it uh but that was a better pill that i of the worst probably the worst bill i ever had to ask people to vote for in terms of the public not having a clear understanding of it and we supported president bush in that the president supported president bush but the republicans abandoned him so it was overwhelmingly a democratic vote to pass the tarp can you imagine that but we worked closely with president bush whether it was pepfar for aids drugs whether it was a civil the voting rights act the president signed whether it was issues that related as i said earlier to how tax credits and the rest and that whether it was an energy bill one of the biggest energy bills in the history of the country we passed with he wanted nuclear i want it renewable we had one of the greatest bills ever and so we did a number of things with including as i said the tarp with him and i only wish that the republican leadership in the congress would give the same respect to president obama and try to find common ground on issues thank you and if i mispronounce anyone's name i apologize thank you for some good questions i already have a rachel karas from inside health policy uh asks what do you believe uh is the democrats best defense against piecemeal attacks on the affordable care act by the gop what will the democratic strategy be in the face of the king burwell supreme court lawsuit presumably if the government loses well in terms of the second part of the question some of you may know i know some of our friends in the press who asked me this so many times who are here today uh when it was you know with the case before the court originally i said we're going to win i was wrong i said it'd be 6'3 it was 5'4 but i did say we'd have the chief uh i do believe that i have confidence about uh what will happen with the court what the case is is that they're saying that we can't give subsidies you all know what this case is we can't give subsidies to those who are not in a state uh marketplace if they're in the federal marketplace in states where they don't have a a plan in their states then that was not covered by the bill i don't see how that's a constitutional issue i don't i don't i think for the same reason they approved uh the verdict was what it was the decision was what it was before it will be this time the fact to your first part of the question how we attract the piecemeal this bill has oneness you can't have you can't say we're going to um eliminate discrimination against people on the basis of pre-existing medical condition but then not say we're going to have a mandate it all goes together because you have to bring down the cost that's as i said earlier one of the main reasons to have the bill even if we had no other reason was to bring down the cost and so when the republicans say well i'm against uh discrimination on the basis of pre-existing conditions and women and i don't want lifetime caps and i don't want annual cats well you can't say that unless you have the oneness the integrity the integral relationship of the different parts to the bill uh so that's that it's almost silly for them to say that without having the uh the the mandate which is essential to the uh uh to the bill and uh that's just the case it will have to make now endless money came in fire and brimstone carpet bombing scorched earth shocking all death panels abortion you name it things that had absolutely nothing to do with the bill and that really uh poisoned the well and we didn't have an antidote out there early enough and i may read a book about this subject and the whole messaging thing so i may i don't have time right now but i may write a book of it but because it's in fact as president lincoln said and we have it in his book in his own handwriting public sentiment is everything public sentiment is everything so don't you can't assume the public will understand this is in their interest or this or that the public is wise but they have to know god bless the public our country is so strong because of the wisdom of the american people the productivity the energy the ingenuity the optimism of the american people but you can't allow the other side with endless money anti-government ideologues at the time insurance companies who didn't want the bill to pass but now have become team players in it to define what the legislation was about it but it's so exciting it really we talked about lincoln let's talk about our founders life healthier life liberty liberty to pursue your happiness imagine in our founding documents life liberty pursuit of happiness and that's what this bill enables people to have a healthier life to pursue their happiness without being job locked because a child is bipolar or ja so they can they can be free to start a bit be self-employed start a business be a engaged in the arts change jobs have mobility and to pursue their happiness it's a great bill and it brings down cost lifts aspirations brings down cost and you can't take pieces of it now any bill we pass can be subjected to scrutiny to say how can we do this better or that better in the implementation and of course we're always always open to that but not something that totally takes the heart of it and undermines it it's too important this is as important as medicare medicaid affordable care for access for all americans it's a great thing very proud of it am i right i'm told we have five minutes left and i um i have one question i want to close with so what i'm going to do is combine two people's questions here and then ask you my last question which is actually a personal uh question personal for me uh this is from athena jones of cnn um who very wisely is on top of the day's news so the first question is will you weigh in on the vaccination debate should they be required uh and the second is working families from the department of department of homeland security could be affected by congressional inaction because the immigration fight that the republicans want to have are you concerned this funding battle will go down to the wire will there be another cr and i also just wanted to ask and i apologize for the other questions we couldn't get to um steve loman in the audience said what messages did you take from the 2014 election so vaccination homeland security and 2014 politics okay on the vaccination issue well i'm sympathetic to the concerns and i've i've met many many hours and and tried to facilitate conversations with families who have had concerns about vaccines and how that affect their children be it autism or otherwise it is a public health issue and the fact is is that children should be vaccinated that could be a generational thing you know when i was a little girl people had polio and it was you know a vaccine miraculous power to prevent spread of disease and i think that again i support the public health decisions that uh that call for children to be vaccinated a separate note we should do everything we can to find out what the causes of some of the diseases that affect our children are and that's why in the 90s we did i worked with four people senator specter democrats and john porter two republicans john porter inspector republican at the time park tom harkin and i and how and my side in the house to double the funding for the national institutes of health and what that meant to invention and discovery and of course the cdc and what that means in terms of prevention and public health it's really important to our country so i i would say sympathetic to the concerns but let's address it another way but the public health requires that we have the vaccination what's that the dhs oh my friends in the december the republicans said we're going to pass a bill which was a terrible bill the crummy bus i didn't know if that was like a doughnut and a quasar combined or something in new york that's what they stand in line to buy my kids tell me but in any event the the this um they pass this bill i won't even go into that let's just say what it didn't do it didn't fund homeland security for the year it kicked the canned and speaker said well we're going to do it we're going to just do it in it's like a a thing for his i don't want to say right wing because that's a legitimate place to be it's radical over the edge people that's december january paris just charlie the whole world is galvanized around the issue of homeland security in this person's country except in the hermetically sealed chamber of the house of representatives where we just aren't doing it we are that this is so dangerous to our security that we would be frivolous with this is really a dereliction of duty and and it is it you have to understand it again it's part of our messaging problem is we don't want to be fear mongers and if you tell it the way it is your hair's on fire you go running out the room it is so bad in terms of what it prevents homeland security from doing in terms of hiring people and the rest and what are we the whole world is you would think that the paris incident would have said okay okay we've we've made our point now we're going to the next place so what's the next place the next place is we're not doing homeland security just unless they can get their anti-immigrant and anti-immigration legislation and when i leave here a little bit later today i'll go to a press conference to call call out some of the statements that they're making about immigrants this isn't who we are we're a nation of immigrants by and large with all the respect and love for our native american brothers and sisters but it's a it it's it's it's more of the same from there and by the way you're concerned about the deficit the immigration bill reduces the deficit by 158 billion dollars in the first 10 years and then 700 billion over over a 20-year period so you want to reduce the deficit pass the senate passed bipartisan bill by the way the senate sees this differently than the house republicans in terms of immigration so it's hard to see what's going to happen but what we have now is they're taking the president to court over one thing or another that relates to immigration they're not passing a homeland security bill no wonder the american people have doubts about the effectiveness of government but since we're identified as more in terms of public private uh solutions than maybe uh they identify it with us but this on homeland security protect support and defend that's the oath of office that we take to support and defend constitution and therefore the american people and all that's in in the constitution and again their negative attitude toward immigrants is driving their attitude toward the homeland security bill it's just plain wrong and again if you want to make any distinction this isn't i mean we have republican former secretaries of health of a homeland security writing and saying don't do this because again don't paint all the republicans with this same brush but this is what's driving the agenda in the house and the house among the house democrats not even the senate republican the house republicans so i'm glad you asked about was there a third party well there was uh u.s oh yeah right the elections they as far as the house is concerned where there wasn't a senator gubernatorial race we did just fine in my state of california they came after us big because we had five tough races they came after us big they had a new uh leader in the republican side was a californian they were going to show me and take away the seats we won in last election not only did we win them all but we added one more and that's because we really just had the feel to ourselves it wasn't they're trying to take out a senator or a governor you know what i mean where they brought in that big enormous endless money and they brought in a lot in california but i'm talking endless in those other places to to win the senate uh and when some of the state houses did hurt us in the house races we didn't equivalent to the senate we didn't lose as many you know they lost 30 i mean they lost six that would have been 30 for us it's no consolation don't get me wrong but the fact is that you have to public sentiment is everything you have to give people a reason to register and a reason to vote they didn't see that reason shame on us for not making it clearer as i say at the risk of not being a fear-monger you you try to now this is the 50th and i'll close with this i think i have to this is the 50th anniversary still want to ask my one question if i may oh okay let me throw that up can i throw up my throw in my last question and then you can do the close that's part of it and it is a personal question because there is sort of the image of nancy pelosi the san francisco liberal that parody and yet uh every people who know you and have watched you know there were two aspects of you that don't get talked about much one is the deep importance of family to you mother grandmother and how family has been so much part of your life the other is god and religion and you spoke earlier about the loss of votes because of the social issues and you know i've not only heard you quote uh pope francis which is very popular among liberals these days i've heard you quote pope benedict uh which was not as popular among liberals and i kind of wanted you to square the person you think you are with this public image that was you know that some have because i think those aspects of your life would come as a surprise to people who have a certain view of you in their heads and i just wanted to put that on the table before we finish all right i'm so happy that my college roommate at trinity college washington d.c rita meyer is here yes we've been friends for many many years and here's the thing um pope benedict you know pope benedict's first encyclical was called god is love and in the encyclical he talks he quotes saint augustine and saint augustine said that any government that does not exist to promote justice is just a bunch of thieves words to that effect and this is saint augustine 17 centuries ago but in god's love benedict and uh close him and benedict is a beautiful writer and and thinker and when his speeches here were so fabulous in the rest so um so then benedict goes on to say sometimes it hot it's hard to define justice but when you try to do so you must avoid the blind the blinding blaze or where that effect of special interest and money is that beautiful so when i say that on the floor my republican colleagues are not happy about that my quoting benedict in that way but that's really what we have to do we have to get money in terms of special interest weighing in on government and legislation money controlling uh elections in a way that destroys any confidence the public has that their vote counts for anything and that takes and so your family i have five children um five children when my baby was brought home alexandra who many of you know journalists when i took her home from the hospital our oldest child nancy that week was turning six so when our colleagues on the floor start talking about what they know about family planning and the rest uh i think i have very strong credentials in fact one day since we're speaking of popes when we're having this debate on family planning whether it's domestic or international one of the republicans got up and said nancy pelosi thinks she knows more about having babies than the pope yeah this is a lot this is like 20 years ago yeah yeah maybe i think the pope would agree so so that it is a strange debate that we have because the fact is is that family yes is very important and the catholic church very very important to me and i love francis and i'm glad that he's named for saint francis who was the patron saint of san francisco and his song of saint francis making an instrument of thy peace is the anthem of our city republicans don't like when i say that either but but that is what those values are part of of who i am but raised in baltimore where we were devoutly catholic fiercely patriotic americans proud of our italian american heritage and in our case staunchly democratic we saw that as a connection so that's who i am uh the reason that they have a different image is because people spent nearly 100 million dollars in the campaign of like oh 10 to describe me to the public and since i wasn't really a known quantity some of that took but i say to my colleagues if you are effective you are a target so understand that and i accept that that mantle says she immodestly and then just back to this 50th anniversary 50th anniversary of the voting rights act mind you the court has undone some of it mind you the republicans in congress have not chosen to accept a bipartisan modest bill to correct that but also mind you that when president bush was president we passed the voting rights act we were in the minority but we worked with them uh in a bipartisan way to pass the voting rights act and i think it's really important because i think i have it here so that you don't think i'm making this up the voting rights act reauthorization july 6 13 2006 uh 390 to 33 in the house bipartisan 192 republicans voted for it and in the senate unanimous the voting rights act but we can't get it past a simple version passed to correct the courts now and that's just i mean it's the 50th anniversary since voting rights act it was in the some uh uh in the summer when it was signed originally august by president lyndon johnson and it uh it's really important but with it again you have to give people look a third of the people voted in the last election one-third of the people electorate vote those qualified eligible to vote voted so there's something wrong with our not getting out those other people they didn't see a reason to vote they see the influence of money and politics which we must reduce and that's a whole other session but also i'll just close but i say i would close one more time i will close with this i interrupted your class okay but i intended had this as a close but you took us to this path so i i can't ignore this pres you know we have selma coming up and we're all going to selma again to it's fabulous and you're the movie and 50th anniversary and all of that forever martin luther king said he had a dream that his children would not be judged to use the word dream and would not be judged by the color of their skin but the content of their character and that just haunts me all the time when we talk about budget when we talk about children children in economically disadvantaged areas their families are working two jobs because they make a minimum wage which is not a living wage they don't have time to even have dinner with their children to mentor their children to read to them to listen to them read back to their parents their neighbors are in the same boat so the community is not there so when we talk about judging people by the content of their character we have to judge our country by the content of our character if we are not recognizing that these children are worthy of everything they are the heirs of america's future and what you see what your children have the love the opportunity the this that and you see that disparity even i talked about it in terms of technology that opportunity gap and education gap so the character of our country should be judged as to how we how we invest in these children how we and and when i when people ask me what's the most important three issues facing the congress always say the same thing our children our children our children their health their education the economic security of their families a clean safe environment in which they can thrive a world at peace in which they can reach their aspirations but if you have a budget that does not enable that bigger paychecks ending education gap all of those kinds of initiatives that help a child's character grow with confidence with confidence and and with judgment uh with example of their parents hard-working but not able to meet the needs of their children although people try very very hard so i think that as we observe 50th anniversary we had to think of martin luther king and and examine our own consciences about what we are doing for the character of our country uh to to meet the needs of kids so they can be judged by the content of their character it's pretty it's a pretty exciting opportunity it's the inspiration that we have it's the inspiration we had at our issues conference uh in philadelphia and it's what unites us and i don't think there's any partisan aspect to uh investing in america's as president kennedy said they're our greatest resource and our best hope uh best hope for the future thank you all for the opportunity to be with you today thank you you

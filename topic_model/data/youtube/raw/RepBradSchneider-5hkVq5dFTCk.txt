I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5377,
the Restoring Tax Fairness for States and Localities Act. This legislation that seeks to fix one of
the most harmful provisions of the 2017 Republican tax law – the $10,000 limit on the State
and Local Tax Deduction. Raising this unfair, punishing cap is a top
priority for the constituents I represent. Forcing Americans to pay federal tax on taxes
they already paid to state and local governments is double taxation and it’s wrong. In my Illinois district, approximately 42
percent of filers use the SALT deduction, and the average deduction is significantly
higher – nearly double - the new cap. Even worse – the new $10,000 cap applies
equally to married and single filers. This creates a “marriage penalty” and
further punishes joint filers. This is not fair to America’s middle class. It’s wrong that the burden of a tax law
that overwhelmingly benefits the most fortunate Americans – 83 percent of the benefit to
the top one percent by one estimate – should lie with a narrow range of states like Illinois. H.R. 5377 would rectify these wrongs. I urge my colleagues to vote yes.

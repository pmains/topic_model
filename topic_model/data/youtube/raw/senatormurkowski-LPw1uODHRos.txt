let's see to the Joint session foreign ladies and gentlemen the U.S senator for the great state of Alaska The Honorable Lisa murkowski foreign well good morning everyone good morning yeah that's good enthusiasm president Stevens speaker Tilton to the members of the Alaska state legislature okay that's my formal part of it and uh know that I am I am pleased to be with you yet again for my annual address to to the legislature to talk about really to talk about our state's future and to talk about our future together those of you that have listened to my my comments in previous years know that I always start my remarks out with a little bit of a family update I share the latest on my husband Vern my our two sons Nick and Matt but I will tell you I look out this morning and and it's it's it's different it's a different look there's many of you that I don't know yet I'm looking forward to getting to know you um You probably don't know that my sons who are just now in their early 30s they they literally wore their first ties when they were guest Pages here in in this chamber when they were just eight years old so we go back a long way here in this body time time really flies it's been 24 years since I first entered this chamber as as a state representative I I served alongside of a few of you that are still here um Gary back here Donnie in the back Lyman Lyman sitting right next to Donnie there I guess that's the uh the old guys row back there I don't know about that but uh uh representative Foster where's where's Neil stuck in Gnome with a blizzard well I didn't serve with Neil but I served with with his dad Richard and Richard would serenade us with his birthday tributes which were always quite amusing and representative Sadler while you weren't serving here in this body I think that you were probably singing in some of the legislative skits back there I'm sure there's some tapes out there but we're not going to bring those up so to those of you who are continuing your service I'm glad that your commitment to Alaska continues to run strong to those of you who are beginning your first term I want to congratulate you it's it's really good it's it's refreshing it's right it's it's it's great to see so many new faces to see the diversity know your passion that you are bringing to our state and I want to give a particular shout out and commend the house freshmen who have created this informal bipartisan caucus to representative refridge to representative gray all of you who have joined just what a what a great idea really what a great idea in these divided times it's important that we know one another we need to know one another so that we can work with one another and work well with one another to achieve for Alaska and as you get to know one another you're never you're never quite sure who you actually may meet here how your lives might be connected over time among the freshmen in my class back in 1999 there was a young woman who I became fast friends with her name was Mary and today Mary and I work in the same building we're still friends carrying on the legacy of the Alaska Allegiance who came before us including the congressman for all Alaska our own Don young who we continue to miss him every single day so you've heard from Mary and Dan over the past couple weeks so there's probably not much left to be said I'm here to here to do wrap up but I'm sure that you heard from their comments whereas small delegation but we're a pretty Mighty delegation our gruffness rating I think has gone down just a touch but I think our Effectiveness is still high we're a good team for Alaska and we work hard to bring home results and of course we can't do what we do without the teams that are behind us just as you cannot do your jobs on that front I want to introduce uh some of the members of my staff who are here in the gallery with us today Amber ebarb is all the way in the corner there Amber is my new staff director on the Indian Affairs committee she is clinket she's raised in in Anchorage she's got family members from Huna next to her is Aaron Thiel Aaron has been my advisor on energy and natural resources Kim uh natural resources some of you may have recalled working with him when he was doing the same work over on the energy and natural resources committee when we were running the committee there Kevin Swanson sitting next to him joined us from Congressman Young's office he's my advisor on Transportation broadband and and a lot more so when we're talking infrastructure a lot of you have made contact with with Kevin there and then Matt Robertson is my new fish guy he's from the Golden Heart City of Fairbanks and doing a doing a great job for us you're going to see a few others wandering about the building here over the next couple days Caleb fralick who's my chief as well as Kate Williams Stern my deputy chief both from here in Juneau although Kate will remind me no I'm from Douglas so got to make that distinction you'll also see my ledge director Angela ramponi my communications director Karina Borger both of them hail from Soldotna and then Brian Hughes who many of you have known over the years is also wandering the Halls here we're here to make connections with you and your teams to really you to really be sharing some good ideas brainstorming on on how we can solve some problems together we've we've got a good team and I'm really proud of them it's a team that works tirelessly for alaskans I'm I'm proud of what we were able to do this past Congress and together with the delegation with many of you I think we've helped people and improve our state we responded to more than 8 000 individuals who wrote directly to my office we opened and successfully closed hundreds of cases for alaskans who needed assistance with everything from passport renewals to missing Social Security payments it seems like nobody contacts their Senate office until like three days before that critical trip and they realized my passports expired that's where we come in it's not the sexy stuff that makes the headlines but boy oh boy we're making a difference for people every one of them was important as were our legislative accomplishments so when I spoke to you last year our bipartisan infrastructure Bill had just become law and I explained then how it had the promise of of helping us build and modernize our core infrastructure everything from our roads to Bridges and ports and airports to Energy Water broadband and and our Ferry systems and in in just a year now that's playing out better than any of us had expected nearly 3.2 billion dollars from the infrastructure law has now been announced for the state of Alaska [Applause] Senator Senator Stedman uh Senator keel representative Ortiz representative Stutz you all know how much I love our ferry system yeah never one cheerleader over there but it was it was great to be able to give a call speak directly with you leave a message to give you the heads up that two 285 million dollars is headed our way to help our ferry system to to Senator Olson and representative Foster with 250 million dollars from the infrastructure law and the matching funds that you convince the legislature to approve where we're finally we're finally going to build gnomes Arctic deep draft Port that's a huge benefit for your region [Applause] so to to president Stevens and again representative stoots the Coast Guard our Coast Guard now has 210 million dollars for projects in Kodiak to support the offshore Patrol Cutters that will be home ported there there's so much good that's going on with our Coast Guard I just I'm so excited as we talk about all that we're providing for our Coast Guard men and women [Applause] to Senators Hoffman representative Edgeman representative potkatak your regions among among so many others around the state have received major grants for Broadband deployment you know Lyman and and Bryce your legislation to establish the state Broadband office and its coordination with the delegation effort has really made a big difference in our ability to bring these dollars back to Alaska so thank you for that that was very very key now Senator Hoffman you always every year you ask Lisa what are you doing on Rural energy so I want you to know Lyman that the department of energy is standing up the one billion dollar program that we created for energy improvements specific to Rural and remote areas so happy belated birthday so beyond infrastructure I partnered with many of you to leverage my position as as a senior appropriator my annual interior environment bill was chock full of Alaskan priorities from everything from transboundary water quality monitoring to a new program that we have stood up to clean up contaminated lands around the state this is going to be a really key initiative and I'm I'm very excited about what the promise holds there since I last spoke here we also engaged the congressionally directed spending process to secure nearly three quarters of a billion dollars in earmarks for Alaska to address nearly 200 local priorities around the state every community in Alaska has the right to clean water and to sanitation this has led to investments from from Petersburg to Palmer to St George and all across our state we're expanding Health Services we're providing housing for the victims of abuse and the homeless we're expanding the shipping channel to Dutch Harbor we're taking down the Polaris building to help Revitalize downtown Fairbanks we're supporting engineering and design the work on the gas line there backing law enforcement needs around the state just just to highlight a couple here and I know I get it I know that there's criticisms about earmarks but keep in mind these allocations come from across the political spectrum they are fully transparent they are within budget caps they do not increase spending levels and quite honestly these federal dollars would have gone elsewhere had we not fought to bring them back to Alaska so this is these are priorities that alaskans have weighed in and said we would like your help in returning our federal taxpayer dollars back to our priorities so on that note the Appropriations request portal on my website is now open it's going to be open through March 17th this is a process that I want to help in all of our communities including including those folks who just can't hop online to apply or perhaps to travel to DC to make their pitch that that is not necessary what is necessary though what is necessary is for us to try to reach everyone and understand their needs so we had we had some really big policy wins last year as well in addition to talking about the funding that is coming our way we passed my University of Alaska fiscal Foundation act which will add up to 360 000 acres to the University's land grant so this is something that that President Stevens Senator Kawasaki I know you have been championing this for along with many others here in the legislature but for quite some time and you've done it in partnership with the governor and the university and we have been successful now the reality is is we've got a great land-grant University here in the largest state in the Union but with a smaller land grant than even even Rhode Island and so now we're going to be addressing that we're going to be fixing that and over time the lands that the university receives from the state will generate additional revenues to support its students to support faculty and campus infrastructure so this is good for our University system other policy initiatives we reauthorized the violence against women act we secured 300 million dollars for commercial recreational and subsistence Harvesters that have been affected by Fisheries disasters we convinced FEMA to lift its cost sharing requirements to ensure a quick and effective response after the remnants of typhoon murbach slammed Western Alaska at our military we made historic investments in our military we brought home 335 million dollars for military con construction including our runways at Jay bear we gave the men and women who serve our country a well-deserved pay raise we passed major portions of my arctic Warrior act to provide additional benefits for those that are stationed here in Alaska we also honored our promises to our veterans Through The Pact act which will provide better care for those who suffered toxic exposure during their service so significant legislative accomplishments and I could go on about these but suffice to say last year was a good year for Alaska last Congress was a good year for Alaska and we didn't get everything that we wanted to never do we're still pushing for that commercial ice breaker we're not going to let up on that but we're going to feel the benefits of the measures that passed for generations to come so it's a beautiful day out there you can't tell in this chamber right now but it's a beautiful day in Juneau and as Sunny a day as it is there is there's also um this next part of my speech which is perhaps not so sunny um when I shared shared the direction that I was taking with my son saying you know what do you think what do you think about my comments and he's like oh Mom this is kind of like the tough love part um but you know what we can't talk about all of our successes without acknowledging that we have big challenges we face big challenges as a state you look at the analysis that Nolan clauda and his team are producing and it's hard it's hard for us to look at that we have had 10 straight years of net out migration our employment growth was next to last next to last of any state from 2015 to 2021. our GDP declined we're next to last over that same period Alaska's economy is recovering from the pandemic that's good but it's recovering at a slower Pace than almost any other state out there we all know that the price of a food and fuel is still too high it's it's hard to find eggs much less child care or affordable housing no one knowing that I'm talking to from private firms to State agencies from schools to hospitals can find enough workers where we're a resource state that isn't being allowed to produce resources in our vast Federal areas even potentially within our own petroleum Reserve some of our Fisheries from crab to Salmon or collapsing leaving families and communities without sustenance the impacts of climate change growing worse too many people too many people are struggling fentanyl is claiming more and more innocent lives including those of young alaskans like Bruce Snodgrass oh friends Alaska cannot settle for being 49th in anything but statehood we cannot settle for we cannot we cannot be a place where people spend part of their lives only to pack it up and leave because they don't see a future for them and their family or watch as the kids that we raised leave here and never come back Alaska needs to be the place where people want to move to and want to stay because they have good jobs that support their families they have a good place to live they have good schools where their kids can Excel they have a quality of life that cannot be matched anywhere else where we take care of our fellow alaskans when they when they hit rough patches and that's going to take a vision from all of us a different sort of effort from all of us and a recognition that while a lot of supplemental Federal support has come our way between the covid package the infrastructure bill we we can't count on that forever it's not open-ended here the delegation the administration and the legislature are all equal Partners in Alaska's success we need to be pulling together to take full advantage of these opportunities while they're still in front of us so as I start a new term I'm looking at every facet of how we can make Alaska the best place to live and work and play and stay and that comes with an extensive agenda touching on about every area of public policy and that the top of my list is economic development and of course on the top of that list is the willow project I'm proud that so many alaskans and so many friends from the lower 48 have come together to push for its reapproval and I welcome I thank the resolution that the house passed 36-0 sends a strong message about alaskan's Unity on this project and I understand that the Senate is is considering the same here but on this day on February 22nd with a little less than two weeks from a final decision I am still not certain which way this is going to go now know that I am absolutely totally committed to this fight my colleague Dan has been an absolute Warrior on this Mary has shown true courage pushing the administration on this standing up to the Democratic members of the House the governor has been crystal clear on his position and here in the legislature you have been steadfast in your resolve we're so thankful for that and I also want to express my thanks to the large majority of alaskans especially those Alaska natives who live on the North Slope who are pushing for Willow this has truly been a unified unified effort but we all know this is a difficult Administration to deal with from Ambler to Anwar to the tongas we've had decision after decision go against us and even this one a socially just project located within a petroleum Reserve it's perilously close so we need to finish strong every one of us needs to do everything that we can with every remaining day to make the case for why an economically viable project should be approved now we also need to recognize that if if the final decision on Willow should go against the recommendation of the career civil servants at the department of the interior this is these administer this administration's own experts and so if the decision goes against their recommendation folks it's nothing but pure politics and it has nothing to do with the merits of the project Willow though is our priority but it's not alone we have the Pica project we have the gas line I'm more more and more bullish on our mining future here in Alaska than I ever have been so long as the EPA follows its commitment to avoid further vetoes in our state we have incredible potential for renewable energy from hydropower down in angoon to geothermal at mccushin there's more more Federal support than ever we're going to deploy the first Advanced nuclear reactor in a few years we can be the global hub for both carbon sequestration and hydrogen and I commend the governor for putting some new ideas out there putting them on the table for carbon storage and and even monetization but there is one item out there for Alaskan energy that does not set well with me at all at all and that is the possibility of our state importing LNG to meet energy needs in the rail belt folks we have extraordinary resources we have tremendous resources on the North Slope we have more in Cook Inlet we have Renewables we have the promise of advanced nuclear and really we are going to settle for imported LNG from British Columbia we can do better than this folks we should not even be considering this as a temporary solution we should not this is hard this is hard because we're looking at this and it's like we're we're looking at the timing and it's not looking really well so we have to find a temporary well I'm afraid of the temporary solution why because in order to be able to accommodate a temporary solution we have to make some longer term adjustments like moving from an export terminal to an import terminal to get the ships under contract to make contracts with the Canadians for this and then what happens we get comfortable we get comfortable getting it from somebody else instead of taking care of ourselves with our own resources in my view it's the definition of aiming low and this is a long long way from that owner State mentality that Wally hickle preached to us alaskans deserve better on this one so I'm going to challenge you to work with us I'm we all have to work on this Beyond resources another priority of course is Workforce Development we're all talking about it from the North Slope to the projects that are being facilitated by the infrastructure bill everything else going on in our state we know that we need more workers in just about every field and that means that we need alaskans that are trained and ready for those opportunities so I've been able to to direct funding to several Workforce initiatives through the CDs process I'm going to support the University of Alaska elect savic Ute Northern Industrial training and all who prepare alaskans for the workforce and I'm going to do it every chance that I get and I would I would ask you I would encourage you to do the same because we also need those state-specific solutions to educate and train alaskans we need to be able to attract new talent to our state but we've got to have this Workforce you know it I know it next is child care wow wow who would have thought there's a federal role for child care there's a federal rule there's a state role there's a local role we know every region of our state lacks sufficient access to child care and that's taking people particularly moms out of the workforce lack of child care we're learning more and more can even impact our national security footing here in the state of Alaska I've I've spoken with with General nahom about this and I think it's no exaggeration to say that it's starting to impact our Readiness within the Alaska command we hear from we hear from the Coast Guard as well without child care options Coast Guard not going to look to HomePort new vessels so this is this is real at the federal level I'm working with others on the help committee to improve the child care and development block grant program to help child make child care more affordable help providers stay open enable them to better recruit and retain staff I'm going to continue to advocate for Head Start which also faces barriers to staff recruitment and retention and then as far as the military goes I'm looking at ways to give leadership more Authority and funding to staff Child Care Centers and give their employees a competitive wage I know representative Fields has a bill that he is working on with child care I know that others of you do as well so I would urge you do what you can from here by putting this issue firmly on the agenda for the 33rd legislature [Applause] so another areas as I travel around the state in addition to Workforce child care we're all hearing it housing we know we need more and we need better housing all across the state from St Lawrence Island to here in southeast and this is an area where quite honestly the federal federal government has a pretty limited role so I'm looking to to to try to find some Creative Solutions including housing for teachers Public Safety and some others but one Avenue that we can use one tool is through the CDs process which can provide some assistance with site preparation and water and sewer connections that are needed before the housing can be built we really tried to focus on that in this last round of CD CDs request to if you can if you can help build out that base infrastructure then perhaps the cost of that development is not going to be as weighty another area that we're looking at is the Native American housing assistance and self-determination act you know it as nahazda we're going to be pushing hard to reauthorize that this Congress but here again you have some opportunities there's some requests in the governor's budget for housing so I I would hope that you would take a look to give these thorough review add your own ideas here but the area that I would challenge you the most in today is transportation we have an unprecedented opportunity to refloat are struggling very system this is our shot this is your Lifeline please grab it I this is where I may be this is where I may be stepping over because I almost never call on the legislature to do anything specific here but I am asking you approve the matching funds for our ferry system it this is this is the Alaska Marine Highway System it is not the federal Marine Highway System this you know maybe I I have to admit because sometimes you just have to step yours take yourself back one step and I know that it's personal to me because I I spent my growing up years here in in southeast and and know and understand what is strong Marine highway system means to these communities means to a regional economy but the ferry system really matters it should matter to all of us in Alaska regardless of where you live as we as we worked through the infrastructure Bill placing priorities I made sure I made sure that people understood in our great state we are not well connected by Road that's why our airports are so important that's why our ports are so important and in our islanded regions as we have here as we have in Prince William sound and the Illusions and out on Kodiak the Marine Highway is our Highway and so I was able to educate some folks and it was good it was good and I've done what I can on this but it's now up to you to bring it home and I I know I know that there are many opportunities under the infrastructure Bill and under other Federal measures and I know full well the fiscal budget is tough I get it but the opportunities that we have created for alaskans to invest to invest in our future won't be fulfilled unless the legislature is able to step up with some of these State cost shares and so you know when we when we talk about transportation I've got to ask what's the long-term Vision here what's the plan when I was when I was serving here in this chamber representative Jeanette James from North Pole Jeanette sat I think right where you are Dan um uh she had big Ideas she had big ideas about a rail connection to to Canada you know Mike she talked about it all the time this was how we were going to move everything particularly our mineral resources and boy was she tough on it Frank murkowski you've all heard him talk about he's still talking about those big ideas and yet here we are here we are all these years later we've got good projects at risk of not being able to get off the ground because we still can't move our stuff we need to be thinking we need to be thinking big about how we move our people our resources our freight our trash let's not lower our sights here Frank is Right Frank is right on this one to maximize development opportunities across our great state we need to be able to move some things by rail so let's get this conversation going again about projects like the northern rail extension and the Matsu rail connection we also I'm all over let's get some get some rails on there Mike but when we're talking about connection let's bring it home to the port of Alaska because we've got to get it right we got to get it right there the heart of our transportation system around the state handling well well over half of the cargo our state receives it is imperative that we upgrade the port to Modern standards but for that to happen everybody has to agree on the design the delegation has stepped up to provide funding the state has stepped up with matching funds thank you Senator Merrick wherever you are Sid and thank you for your shoulder into that but when I read in the Anchorage Daily News about the proposed design modifications that may cost just another 200 million dollar with no understanding as to how we're going to pay for it besides applying for additional federal grants I mean really this port is too important to alaskans this project is too big to fail we we have got to get this right now many of you I know share my passion for the Arctic which is now on the front lines of the great power competition what we've done so far and they're good the funding for Broadband water other core infrastructure icebreakers the re-establishment of the 11th Airborne Arctic focused strategies from every branch of the military the creation of the Ted Stevens Center for Arctic security studies the recent announcement just last week of our first Arctic Ambassador a fellow fairbanksson these are all good steps but their first steps they're not our final pushes so where do we go in the Arctic we need to make our International territorial claims we need to prepare for greater Maritime traffic from shipping from tourism and resource development both here and abroad we need to invest more in the infrastructure to meet the needs of those who are living there in diplomacy to try to keep the Arctic a zone of Peace in scientific research to better understand the region and its an environment in adaptation to address climate change and of course insecurity to protect our sovereignty so many of us have worked to educate Washington about the Strategic importance of Alaska to our nation's security and people people outside of the state of Alaska are seeing in real time now what we've been saying all these years in a very very short time period Americans have seen firsthand how China is a threat how Russia is on our doorstep how North Korea is kind of lurking out there started several weeks back with a Chinese spy balloon transiting over Alaska a few days later our military shot down an unidentified object off the North Slope a few days just a couple days after that Russian Bear bombers were approaching our airspace and then just two days after that North Korea fires off ballistic missiles labeling the Pacific Ocean as its firing range we know Alaska is increasingly America's first line of defense and I am more thankful than ever for all those who serve and keep us safe and I'll tell you what the men and women of the 11th Air Force and the Alaska Air National Guard have so powerfully demonstrated in just these recent days is that when you when you threaten Alaska's sovereignty you threaten the nation's sovereignty and we will respond and as we discuss the threats to National sovereignty we acknowledge that we are now just two days from the one year mark of Russia's catastrophic war against Ukraine it it has never been more important to stand with Ukraine to help preserve their democracy I am proud to do so the people of Ukraine [Applause] of Ukraine deserve our support their need is immense and we applaud their courage and their continued sacrifice in the defense of democracy what is happening in Ukraine daily is is heartbreaking but the hearts of those people are not broken they are standing up in an extraordinary way that commands the respect of the entire world so we are there for the people of Ukraine final priority I wish to raise today is caring for the vulnerable right here at home because we have an obligation to do both as much as we invest in infrastructure and transportation connectors and everything physical we also need to invest in our people because as we know not is all well in our state too many alaskans are vulnerable and need our help we need to take care of the elderly the young the people with disabilities the hungry those who face violence and abuse and addiction and mental and behavioral issues and homelessness and we know that there are good ways to make a difference in these lives and we need to reach for them I was pleased to see the governor's proposal to extend Medicaid's postpartum coverage to 12 months I think that that was important we can also bolster our health care Workforce especially in our rural areas so that alaskans can access care closer to home we can do more to educate alaskans about the extreme dangers of fentanyl poisoning as we're doing with Bruce's law and to stop its illegal trafficking into our state we can provide resources to community-based organizations that support alaskans as they undergo treatment and recover from addiction we can reduce barriers to trauma-informed care after sexual assault I plan to make care for the most vulnerable a priority every day that I have the privilege to serve and I would ask that you all join with me in that we know our state needs big projects I've mentioned several of them here there's so many that I haven't mentioned grid modernization is going to be huge but I'll tell you these big projects they won't matter it they don't they won't matter as much if we don't have healthy families and healthy communities we have come so far as a state but we still have a long ways to go to reach our potential and what matters for each of us is that we're here we're here in the arena and sometimes the arena gets a little bit chaotic but we've been chosen by the people of Alaska to represent them to serve them to listen to them and to help them they're counting on us to have a vision to push that vision whether for resources housing Child Care Workforce Development Transportation or another big idea that can shape our state for future Generations a generation that stays instead of leaving so the delegation has has done a lot for Alaska in these past several years and we're happy to do it but we need our partners in the state to step forward that's my challenge to all of you who have the privilege of serving in this 33rd legislature and I hope I hope I didn't step on anybody's toes with some of my perhaps more direct comments I didn't necessarily stay in my lane today but I'll tell you I am comfortable in saying this to you because this is this is my place this is our place I love this place it's where I started it's it's it's my home it's my family we're family and I want the best for our state as I know you want the best for our state again we should not be 49th in anything but statehood so I promise you I will be with you every day as your partner as your fellow Alaskan to take on these big things together to resolve our challenges together and to help our people together thank you for the time that you've given me today okay thank you that's a graciously agreed to answer a few questions so we'll begin and if anyone has a question to ask please raise your okay Senator Hughes beginning with Senator Hughes foreign good afternoon or good morning I'm not sure which it is we're not quite there I didn't I didn't go past Dan Sullivan's time all right all right so I first a quick comment thank you for your comment about the importance of infrastructure in our state for the movement of people of resources and I just want to add that it's also very important for food security and we recognize we need a lot more infrastructure for food security Alaska my question actually is related to your comments regarding the Arctic and National Security we know as a state we embrace our military and that we love to have that presence but considering the era that we're in of increasing tensions that have really been demonstrated very visibly in the last couple of weeks even in the last 24 48 hours I am wondering whether it is time and I'd like your your view on it whether it's time to increase military Assets in this state whether that be military men and women um equipment more aircraft but particularly perhaps even another base a naval base Marine presence I I believe that I know I would sleep better at night because one of the things we've seen is you mentioned we're the first line of defense for the nation I would arguably say we're the first line of defense we're the gatekeeper actually for all of North America and we saw that so it I believe DC our leaders are recognizing that even though as you said for years we've known it but I believe what they've seen is in the last few weeks they would also agree so I'm wondering if it's time to step up and press for more military assets in Alaska thank you Senator Hughes it is it is important I think that we recognize kind of where we sit when it comes to again this National Defense and to your point it's not just it's not just the the front lines of defense for America but when that the role with with North com NORAD um it is North America that we're talking about here so do we need to be doing more I think it is important to recognize the significance of what we have currently in the state we have more fifth generation fighters in Alaska than anywhere else anywhere else so we're we're in we're in an extraordinary position there what we have between uh Fort Wainwright um Allison J bear uh the missile defense system out in at Fort Greeley uh clear with the with the um uh long-range discrimination radar the assets that we have out in the aleutians still nobody talks much about chemia but believe me we still have eyes on the skies out there at the end of the chain to your point though about is there more that can be done I will share with you that one thing that Senator Sullivan and I have really been leaning in on is making sure that we have the the refueling tankers that we need it's great to have the aircraft but if you if you're moving long distances and you don't have the refuel air refueling capacity so uh working to address that also with the hopefully soon addition of of the newly updated what we call e3s but would move to e7s that's going to be significant significant from a surveillance but it's not just in the air to your point about Naval assets we do not have that Naval Base it is something that we have been pushing the military on to explore whether it is whether it is something out in in the Illusions uh or or elsewhere around the state what are we doing to protect these extraordinary Waters we talk a lot about Coast Guard because Coast Guard is us here in Alaska but when you when you appreciate how much they have to cover and their their job is is is Homeland defense here so making sure that Coast Guard has the assets the upgraded modernized Fleet that they need and we have made extraordinary strides in addressing just that we have obviously much more to do on the Icebreaker side of things because that too is an asset that is yet um unaddressed we have authorized to three full polar security Cutters funded too but the problem is you blame everything on covet you blame everything on Workforce but at the end of the day we still don't have an icebreaker that's why this commercially available Icebreaker was going to be a gap filler so we got to get that back into the queue so that we're not left uncovered here but but believe you me it's not only the the the the Navy that we're pushing but the Marines as well where's the Marine presence in Alaska and would that not be something of consideration the fact that we had all branches of the of the services put forward an Arctic strategy to be incorporated as part of our national security strategy is really quite considerable so we have made extraordinary progress in in the past decade decade or so when it comes to to Arctic security but in my head Arctic security equals National Security so thank you to the communities that embrace our military into into your community um it makes a difference so everything that we can be doing from the asset side but also making sure that the men and women in their families are cared for whether it's housing in the interior whether it's Mental Health Services whether it's good schools we all have a role in supporting that as well so thank you thank you to our our Alaskan communities that embrace our military like no other state I know thank you for the question Senator Hughes thank you Senator representative prax thank you uh Senator murkowski you and the other members of the delegation gave us a lot of assistance in the interior to reach some sort of an agreement with the EPA over air quality goals and roughly the goal was all right you give us the goal we'll figure out how and that was quite a community effort and now they're reneiging on that promise so we need a little more attention brought to that situation we can figure it out but frankly we cannot figure it out the way they want us to figure it out so we'd like some help on that thank you thank you for raising it and um uh I think it's going to be important you know that they will EPA will hold uh I guess an open comment hearing up in Fairbanks I think it's the eighth of of March here it's going to be important for the voices from the interior to be heard clearly articulated as to why why uh uh this I was going to say why this approach is so detrimental that's that's kind of putting it way too politely what will happen if if the EPA were to not continue working with Fairbanks and the interior communities on this um is so so punitive without regard to the efforts that have been made to reduce your emissions I'm told by EPA that you have fully reduced by half by half your emissions that is nothing short of remarkable and it has not come without pain and consequence families have had to make some costly transitions in order to to comply and yet it seems as if there's no credit given and a failure to recognize that the options for for addressing the the remaining constraints are not not economically viable and so what does that mean to a community when you don't have the options the option is just not to to Force everybody to move out because I think that there are some who actually think that that would be a better outcome that that is not an approach or a strategy that works so there's there's a little bit of uh of uh responsibility maybe a lot of responsibility on the EPA we tried to help with these wood stove change out we've put a lot of money into that a lot of federal resources to help with that and then the EPA can't figure out their own certification standards for the wood stoves so we don't even know if it's helping I mean this is these are the types of things where I know people are looking at and saying the government the government is saying they're here to help and In fairness they haven't done much to help us out with so what I was hoping that I might be able to do and if we can't do it on this trip we need we the the interior delegation um folks on my team on Sullivan's team on paltola's team with with the state uh Administration here we need to be talking about what this strategy is because if if you fail according to EPA standards to meet their compliance and the punitive measures the enforcement measures come in it's an enforcement not just against Fairbanks in the interior the penalty is that the state of Alaska loses their Federal Highway dollars whoa if that doesn't get the attention of everybody in this room this is what we're talking about this is high stakes stuff in a place where the community has tried valiantly to address it made great strides and yet it's not good enough and you know what epa's biggest fear is right now well we're going to get litigated get litigated every day work with the communities so we really need we need the interior to be coming together in this for the question Mike and representative fields uh thank you sir murkowski for you and the delegations extraordinary and inspiring work to support democracy in Ukraine through Appropriations with pastors of the chips act uh the work that you all have done with the administration is incredible and my question with regard to that is when we see these authoritarian governments like China and Russia allow production of Natural Resources with no environmental controls no greenhouse gas controls um what you see as an opportunity for a border adjustment fee or similar policies to make sure that our American Producers who produce so much cleaner at least have a Level Playing Field and we're not helping out these authoritarian regimes thank you you got a couple different things here in your question representative fields and thank you um so there's there is an interesting discussion going on about a border Carmen adjustment fee a carbon border adjustment fee and and what that might mean and could that be something that is going to help kind of level the playing field allow us to be more competitive in this space and there have been other aspects of a broader broader carbon plan that have been talked about but I think one area where you're seeing Republicans and Democrats looking at this and saying all right is is this is something that we might want to have a more fulsome discussion on about what we might want to do there's a there's a level of caution here though because when you're imposing these effectively tariffs on things coming into the country you know what is that going to we all know that we we are a supply chain constrained particularly in a state like Alaska so we've got to look at that critically to see how uh how that will impact us but I I'll I'll kind of go a little bit beyond the uh the carbon a border adjustment to the whole issue of of where basically where we get our stuff because we're talking a lot about what we're going to be doing um in in building out our our renewable energy resources what more we need to be doing to um to win the war when it comes to not only solar panel production but chips manufacturing and at the end of the day it all comes back to you gotta have the stuff that allows you to to build the the smartphone or build the pen or or or coat the coat the wind the blades on the wind turbine and so where are we getting this how are we accessing our own resources to benefit our own country and so the the the great debate now about not just critical minerals but minerals in general from rare Earths to to everything else is is how and where are we sourcing because right now the United States in my view is taking the easy route we're looking to other countries to help give us what it is that we want so that we can be strong so that we can beat you so that we can we can win the you know the climate race we can win the arms War we need all of this but um uh it's just easier to get it from somewhere else perhaps other places where your environmental laws are so lacks they're practically non-existent perhaps from places where child labor laws are non-existent and literally you have children carrying Cobalt out in baskets on their back and we'll look the other way to who it comes from and how it got there because we need the resource instead of saying how can we how can we not only take care of ourselves have the resources that we need but also be honest instead of being hypocrites about our need for a resource and whether it is oil or or Cobalt name name your name your resource out there we've got to be honest about it we have stronger environmental standards stricter environmental standards in this country than you will find just about anywhere else out there we have we have labor laws that protect our people in ways that we should be proud and we can utilize the technology that we have in place to access our resources in a way that is in concert with your environment I was proud proud to stand with the people of the North Slope and have whaling captains stand there and say thank you for not only protecting our wailing quota but thank you for working so hard to get Willow opened because we need that resource because we know we know that the way that it will be developed here will be in concert with our standards so that we can continue the subsistence lifestyle that we have up here not every place can say that but we have been able to and we will continue to be able to and so how how we exchange our vulnerability for a resource for the ease of gaining it from somewhere else at someone else's expense we've got to look at ourselves in the mirror and this is this is one of those areas where the administration is saying the right thing we need to be producing more of Our Own critical minerals and then they fail they fail in doing much of anything to help Advance access to that and so you can't have it both ways you just can't thanks for the question Zach and thank you Senator representative Ortiz thank you Mr President thank you senator murkowski for being with us here today thank you for your um both inspiring and challenging words that you put before us uh into this particular body today um my questions kind of kind of go a little along perhaps a different route um as to the questions you've heard previously but in the end it's not really as you know um I'm from Ketchikan um your parents currently live in Wrangle and both those communities live in areas that are very close to some river systems like the eunuch and the stakein where just 50 miles to the east of us there's planned and continued movement towards large-scale mining development projects uh that potentially could threaten are very important fishing industry as you know the fishing industry is the second largest or largest private employer in the state of Alaska and there's challenges out there that that need to be addressed and one of those potential challenges is the potential impact that could come from this large-scale mining development that's been going on for the last 20 years or so on the other side of the Border my question is can you give us an update on your trans boundary work with the bind Administration and Canadian officials and what kinds of solutions can alaskans expect in the coming years on that particular topic important one it's an important one we and we can we can work things within our own State it's another thing when you're dealing with not even another state but another country another country which makes it complicated because we have international we have international agreements obviously Canada is free to produce their resources as we are free to produce our resources but when when it's recognized that there is impact that flows across boundaries that's where we have to have levels of cooperation and that's where I think that's where some of the frustration has been we have the international boundary commission Commissioners both Canadian and U.S that are charged with kind of doing this oversight In fairness for a while they did there wasn't a lot of teeth in terms of are they resourced as a commission we've kind of addressed that when when we first began looking at this issue some years ago there was no there was no monitoring that was being done whether around this decaying the eunuch or or any of the other transboundary waters and so what we have done over the years is continued to provide for that at Baseline monitoring so that in in a way it's it's it's precautionary but we need to know we need to know by the monitoring that has gone on so that has been in place now for probably uh I don't know I would say a decade I'm looking to my fish guys back there whether it's been a full decade about that um and we in this past in this past appropriation cycle continued that funding we've added another another watershed area so that's happening on our side um there was an effort this was actually back in the uh in the Walker Malott Administration where there was more direct engagement from the administration directly with our neighbors on the Canadian side I think some of that has has kind of um I don't I don't think it's fair to say stalled out but it hasn't been as as elevated it has been hard I will tell you it has been hard in the state department to get the attention focused on this there's an issue right now on transboundary water quality over in the Montana area and their issue has now helped Elevate our issue here because they've actually got they've got issues that are are real and present and threatening water quality on the U.S side it's it's awful to say but that you know until there's something something bad happens it's hard to get it to register with State and so this is something where again it helps us as your federal delegation to have you all keep pushing us on these issues so that we can go back to State and say you know we got we got all these folks back home and you're not assigning a level of priority that needs to happen with this so um as much as this Administration is focused on on environmental issues as much as this Administration is focused on uh kind of care for the environment but also a a real keen and an appropriate focus on indigenous peoples and impact on things like food security you would think that this would register a little bit higher and it has not I've raised it at the secretary level with secretary blinken and you know the part of the problem is is the secretary of state folks are pretty pretty occupied with the crisis of the day rather than we want to prevent a crisis from happening so we're going to keep that from happening but it requires vigilance so help us with that thanks thank you Senator our last question will be from representative Cronk thank you Mr President and thank you senator murkowski for being here today um there's so many important things I could ask a question about but the one thing that never fades for me is our ways of life in protecting our ways of life up here whether it's hunting fishing or trapping and uh the other day I read an article from the Yukon and it stated in 2023 the Yukon river Chinook is is functionally extinct and um in 2023 we're watching a culture a way of life a source of food go away you know in 2023 you were watching the smoke forever disappear from our smoke houses so what is being done at the federal level and what more can we get done to you know protect not only a way of life but a culture thank you you know for those of you that represent Coastal communities just think about the significance of what representative Cronk has said this is when we talk about fish disasters it it is not isolated to one area I mean you are you represent the heart of the interior and you're being impacted by what we're seeing in our oceans it's all connected folks and it's it's challenging because as we know there are there are so many different factors at play here some which we can control and some which we cannot and so trying to understand everything that we're still struggling and trying to understand the science we know that we can put more money towards data and research and we have been doing that aggressively everything from the fish disaster money but more important on the resource side what we've been putting into into NOAA into the into the agencies for for not only monitoring but just the pure research whether it's everything from ocean acidification to understanding what's happening with with the the temperatures to the food chain uh that the species survive on but it is hard to to be able to talk to somebody whose family relies on a full a full Smoke House a full a full freezer to make it through the winter and to have them say you don't need to give me research I know that there's no fish I know that there's no fish and so the need is so immediate that it feels so limited and weak to be able to say we're going to spend more money on Research I had one gentleman tell me he says Lisa can't you just put the fish back in the river and you know he's not being flip he's speaking for his family and so we've got uh we've got Board of fish that's meeting in Anchorage today um they've got some some management decisions that they need to be working through this is really the the proverbial all hands on deck in terms of what we can do to understand um I I have made clear and and Senator Sullivan has been really direct he's on the committee of jurisdiction on the Commerce Committee but we've been bringing agency people up to the state to see and hear and understand and listen they've been helpful um that that's gonna that's going to help we've got to understand when we're talking about issues like bycatch you know from a from a management perspective how do we how do we deal with these things those are things those are things that we can manage something like understanding how ocean acidification is is impacting our salmon species those are harder longer term but there are some things that we can be looking at in the here and now I know down here in southeast this this litigation coming out of the out of the Enviro the environmental organizations that would effectively shut down effectively shut down our trial industry here these These are matters where it sometimes it's a matter of of a shortage of resource that we don't understand and then there are issues like this which in my view are nothing more than uh than than litigants who are looking to to shut down an entire industry um and and and basing it on uh basing it on assumptions that are not not true to to the Alaska situation so we have so many challenges in front of us with regards to to our Fisheries but I think it's fair to say that we recognize you don't have to be from a Coastal Community or represent a coastal region in order to understand the priority and the significance of what this means we're talking food security here certainly but it really is a cultural identity we came to the union the state of Alaska came to the union over the fight over fish and fish is still at the Forefront of of our discussions and priorities thank you so much Senator murkowski we greatly appreciate your being with us and your leadership thank you thank you thanks for the time today thank you thanks everyone

thank you i i appreciate uh just a few moments here to talk about some matters that come before this committee quite frequently and that is the issue of offshore revenue sharing we have two measures being considered today agenda items 11 and 19. i think i've made very clear over the years that i believe that alaska should be eligible for the very same offshore revenue sharing as other coastal producing states notably the gulf coast states and i'm extremely unhappy and certainly was very unhappy when alaska was cut out of the initial deal back in in 2006 during my time as chairman of this committee i drew a line that there were not going to be any updates to this program unless alaska was brought to the table just a matter of equity and fairness and i still strongly hold that view today and that's why i was disappointed to see s 2130 the rise act introduced without alaska included as a state with the largest coastline in the nation and tremendous offshore potential i think it's completely unfair and unacceptable that alaska be left ineligible for the same revenue sharing as other states but fortunately after working with the bill's sponsors for nearly a year to find an equitable path forward i think we have reached an agreement that alaska will not be left out again i've spoken to senator whitehouse as the bill sponsor and i will look to senator cassidy and senator king to affirm their commitments to me that alaska will be included in any final revenue sharing measure agreed to in this congress and with these commitments in place i can support s 2130 the rise act hearing committee i will be offering an amendment to my own bill as 2996 the alaska offshore parity act which will bring its revenue sharing percentages and reporting requirements in line with those in s 21 30. so mr chairman and to ranking member brasso thank you for working with us on this at this time i would like to to yield to senator cassidy and senator king

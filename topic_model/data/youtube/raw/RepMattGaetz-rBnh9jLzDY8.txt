this thing that Wisconsin with one of the most awful things I've ever seen in my life you know just know you the extent that would ever go to to hold on to power and was all about one Supreme Court seat in the Stinson they will kill people to stay in power literally joining me now is Florida congressman Matt Gaetz and Chris Hahn former aide to Senator Chuck Schumer host of the aggressive progressive podcast all right congressman that was James Carville everybody knows James that was a lot of fear-mongering there is this a preview of how we're going to politicize this pandemic right up till Election Day in the most insincere of ways because President Trump had a historic turnout on Election Day and so there may be some voices trying to scare down and suppress the election day vote what I can say for those who choose to vote by mail is that there's a low risk that their vote will be tampered with so people who want to vote by mail should but in states that expand their vote by mail there is a belief that there will be an increased opportunity for fraud MIT professors have done studies that show that vote by mail actually has the highest propensity of fraud when compared to in-person voting or early voting well here's what Attorney General Bill Barr told me about changing the way we vote watch it's not the right time to be experimenting with the way elections are conducted that is through mail in and other kinds of techniques I think that right November we're gonna be dealing with a different set of circumstances but I think we can adapt our election prior practices at the polls to accommodate public health concerns Chris that sounds pretty reasonable six feet distance wear a mask to vote I mean why why are people in the Democrat Party jumping ahead to the fall already and trying to lay down new markers about voting I get why Republicans don't want vote-by-mail their entire plan is to suppress the vote and this is perfect for that plan what we're doing right now yeah scare people to think they might die at the polls so vote-by-mail which there's no evidence anywhere of mass fraud in Oregon where they've done it since the 80s and a hundred million people have voted there's only 11 cases of any document that fraud at all and no mass fraud but they want to say that and hope people believe it look if you believe that we should have a country and have elections you want to make sure people can vote even in a pandemic so we've got to come on with you something and I find it rich I find it rich yeah that congressman Vegas is talking about politicizing this stunt you pulled on the House floor with that gas mask I hope you're gonna lend that here please give me a break I was making a point that we should be concerned about values congressman because in Congress we go to the dirtiest airports and we we interact with a lot of people by the way a lot of members of Congress stop stop nobody can hear people drive it just drives people crazy it's fine to make a point make an aggressive point but try not to talk over each other drives me crazy and everybody else all right congressman games this is this is a concern I think is that people are afraid now right a lot of people are afraid they're afraid to go to the deli counter without we're in you know I saw two people at the deli counter yesterday in actual gas masks I mean the real ones with the filters on the side it was it was quite something I was like as a salami really that no but I you know people are scared are they going to be so petrified going into the fall that they're not going to vote and they're just going to say I'm going to stay home or do we want to encourage people to still participate you can vote by mail and and why are Republicans worried about that we aren't as a matter of fact Americans voted during the Civil War I suspect we will be able to vote during coronavirus and again there is little to no risk to an actual voter who chooses to vote by mail and so if you are a vote-by-mail voter and you're concerned about the integrity of your ballot there's no need to be but what Chris's point misses is that there are circumstances where in vote-by-mail states groups go and create fictitious people or people who have died long ago now I have a go and create registration those folks and then there's never a moment where I human being shows up to vote and so the risk is that votes being counted for people who might not be legally in our country who might not be able and who may have never been allowed yes none well what's wait hold on what so it's amazing though throughout this whole process is that one governor can just decide now you know we're not we're gonna call off an election we're not going to involve the state legislature we're not going to call the legislature back into session so they can proclaim or pass a law about changing one governor in Wisconsin tried to completely change a vote by executive Fiat and thank God that was struck down because that's the kind of stuff stunts people are gonna pull and Chris Hahn if a Republican governor pulled that I know you wouldn't be in favor of it no Laura Mike DeWine the Republican governor of Ohio did exactly that and he was right to do it he moved the election to June where it might be safer because he's trying to take care of his constituents just like the Governor of Wisconsin did but the Republicans wanted his view I got slapped down by the Supreme Court so they can they were different scenarios different processes and they were and it was struck down by the court the court enjoined the governor from from issuing an executive decree to change elections we have we voted during world wars we voted during the civil you know we voted during major major crises in America the idea that you just can buy executive Fiat without the legislature being involved are you kidding me and you guys call top an autocrat I'm all I'm all for there being a legislative involvement in these decisions I agree with you partially on that but that said the Republican plan is to suppress the vote they don't want people to vote because they camp down with I don't be that's what James Carville was doing when he was saying that people are gonna die if they show up and vote that was voter suppression coming directly from it wasn't Republican saying don't you vote you shouldn't be talking about people dying because people in your kid who are you making fun of this and took a little such a joke to the point testament to the fact that you don't have be intellectual

uh my first question has to do with vaccine mandates i have a lot of concerns about them um as you know president biden you know issued an executive order requiring all federal employees to be fully vaccinated by november 22nd given sir that federally inspected establishments cannot operate without usda inspection what is the usda's plan to ensure that federally inspected meat and poultry processing plants are adequately staffed if a significant percentage of the inspection workforce elects not to get vaccinated and is subsequently discharged in other words on one hand i think there's overwhelming consensus we need increased capacity on the other hand we're about to put ourselves in a situation because of forced vaccine mandates that we might the government might dramatically decrease capacity thoughts on that and what is the plan to remedy that well we're in the process of surveying our employees representative to determine whether or not uh what you've suggested is is a likely scenario at this point in time i'm not convinced it is uh i think that uh the significant percentage of of workers at usda understand and appreciate the that our concern is for worker safety our concern is to make sure that people are protected that we comply with cdc guidelines um and i don't anticipate at this point that we're going to see a major disruption in our capacity to do our job at usda we will make adjustments if it turns out the survey results over time begin to reflect a different approach than what i'm seeing today obviously we'll take steps to make sure that we do not disrupt um inspections we do not disrupt uh the important work that's being done at these plants we don't see it today we don't see it today so okay yeah november 22nd is going to be here pretty quickly and i just have a lot of concerns with the position we're potentially putting uh you know further dampering and hindering the industry the second question sir would you agree that part of a healthy free market competition is ability to distinguish a product you know your product from your competitors and if so and if the usda is successful in allowing individual harm as a basis for violation under section 202 won't this inhibit cattle producers in kansas and across the country from differentiating their products because the packer can't pay a higher price for a higher quality better product due to fear that a prosecution by the usda or a potential lawsuit firm producer who didn't get the same price for an inferior product i i don't believe so uh congressman i i think we can craft these rules in a way that provides a a bright line for industry to understand and appreciate what is acceptable and what is not acceptable what is fair to producers and what is unfair i think the problem in the past has been the uncertainty of what is or what isn't and that's what we're trying to to rectify uh with the packers and stockyards uh revisions that we're considering my understanding is today we've had eight federal circuit courts of appeal um you know have upheld the requirements so far with no descending circuits and the u.s supreme court has denied review of this topic multiple times each time the courts have found the plaintiffs must show harm to overall competition rather than injury to an individual essentially the court has said the law is meant to ensure equal opportunity uh not equal outcomes amongst producers so based on all the court decisions and despite a clear congressional intent how do you plan to initiate the rule making and draw this line that you discussed well i'm going to rely on on the the folks in in our department that are essentially responsible for making sure that what we propose can uh can pass muster in courts that's that's the goal here obviously it's not i we're not going to review these in isolation we're going to review these in light of of the way the law is and the way the law needs to be uh needs to be followed okay the cmi times expired thank you sir appreciate you coming on before us this afternoon

fine thank you thank you Mr chair I first of all I want to thank Senator Merkley for his leadership in introducing both the smoke planning and research Act of 2021 and the smoke ready communities Act of 2021. it's not just the state of Oregon not just the state of California but uh the entire Western United States but California in particular that is all too familiar with the devastation caused by wildfires not just the fires themselves I'm also referring to the smell and effects of wildfire smoke but again it's not just a California issue it's not just a western United States issue because uh a lot of people remember I know I got calls from my colleagues all the way to Illinois even colleagues on the Eastern Seaboard last year complaining about the air quality think about that the air quality in the East Coast that was the result of wildfires burning in the West so it truly is a national concern now Wildfire smoke is a complex mixture of air pollutants clearly unhealthy to breathe and it can be especially dangerous for children for the elderly for pregnant women for anyone with heart or respiratory conditions a recent Stanford University study found that single-family homes across the country tend to have three to four times higher particulate pollution during Wildfire events than public health guidelines recommend so my question is for Dr Mosley given that time is of the essence with increasingly extreme and more frequent wildfires continuing across the West how crucial do you think it is to enact these bills as quickly as possible to protect public health and better informed communities of the dangers posed by Wildfire smoke thank you for that question I Wildfire is growing so rapidly that for those of us who live in the west you can almost barely imagine it um the fires in your state and mine have been just astonishing and so the importance of taking action to protect people from Wildfire smoke is increasingly urgent not only in our States but as you say across the country as smoke as we learn more and more about the negative impacts of smoke as well as the rapid increase in the number of people in all walks of life were affected by that smoke I appreciate the near Red testimony a reference to equity concerns how there's a disproportionate impact on lower income individuals lower income communities uh Mr walkie my home state of California has long been recognized as the national leader in the fight against the climate crisis and for our efforts to protect communities from toxic air and water pollution as well California is also the largest agricultural state home to a 50 billion dollar agricultural economy and the largest dairy industry in the country California's farmers and ranchers know better than most that our ability to feed the nation and to support family farmers and Farm Workers alike relies on clean air and clean water that's why California is working to cut methane emissions by at least 40 percent by 2030 in partnership with farmers and ranchers as they transition to more sustainable manure management and emission reduction practices senate about 1475 would preemptively restrict epa's Authority preventing the agency from considering policies to address the industrial livestock sector to your knowledge is there precedent for exempting entire Industries for a major components of the Clean Air Act no certainly not in this manner I mean I was shocked to learn that agriculture emits more methane emissions in the United States than the oil and gas sector and the vast majority of that comes from the digestion processes of animals it's not a problem that we should be kind of permanently codifying into an exemption in the law if you know if we kick the can down the road with an appropriation writer we can always change our mind but if it becomes a permanent exemption from then clean air at my experiences it's just never going to go away and we're never going to solve this problem so so just to underscore the point how important is the epa's operating permit program to the ability of States like California to protect the public and support investments in smart sustainable agriculture practices well the key to the operating permit program and it's sometimes misunderstood is really to just have some monitoring the reporting so that there's public awareness and some accountability and that so the states and the federal government can get a handle on how much the emissions are from this industry right now we don't know there's nothing to require it EPA was required by a court in 2005 to develop emissions estimation methodologies for concentrating animal feeding operations or cafos they are 17 years overdue now they're supposed to come out with something this fall I'm waiting you know with baited breath to see what it will say but um we're just not taking this problem seriously and unfortunately a permanent exemption from the Clean Air Act is just not the right approach in my opinion thank you very much thank you Mr chairman Padilla good to see you thanks for joining us today Senator Marky how are you thank you Mr chairman I'm doing great I hope

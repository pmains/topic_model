in Shakespeare's Julius Caesar a soothsayer warned caesar to beware the ides of march for most Americans however the Ides of March passed without incident it's the Ides of april april fifteenth tax day that so many Americans dread mr. president the last few days must have been a big bonanza for the headache medicine industry taxes are due tonight at midnight and millions of Americans spent their weekend struggling to use tax software that crashed flailing about to locate receipts and wading through hundreds of pages of tax instructions instead of enjoying the outdoors or spending time with family and friends too many Americans spent this past weekend hunched over their kitchen tables are in front of their computers surrounded by a maze of receipts canceled checks forms and other paperwork as they undertook the annual water torture ritual of preparing tax reforms this is the tax instruction booklet for our personal taxes are 1040 forms it just goes on and on mr. president well over 200 pages the first hundred and four pages of instructions are the basic form 1040 and the further 110 pages of instructions are for the most common schedules to 1040 but there has got to be a better way someday mr. president I hope the Democrats and Republicans can come to the floor this body ask unanimous consent that this goes into the trash and instead we substitute a much simpler way for our people to do their taxes the reality is the tax code is too complex too costly and simply takes too much time to comply with it's a code that's hopelessly out of date mind numbingly complex increasingly unfair and extraordinarily inefficient as a result one of our most consequential economic policies our tax law does far more to stifle economic growth than to encourage it our country needs a comprehensive overhaul of our system of raising revenue and a modern tax code that's simpler fairer and simply more efficient in some what's needed is a pro-growth economic tax policy and if history is any guide mr. president particularly when former President Reagan and a big group of Democrats got together it can bolster American families and increase revenue mr. president without raising rates now I've been something of a broken record on this issue for some time but on a day like this particularly given what our people went through over the past weekend I think it's time to spend a few minutes and talk about how important it is to bring some common sense to American tax law what is particularly striking mr. president is I think the Congress understands what needs to be done is a question of political will now there have been all kinds of blue ribbon reports Bush administration the Obama administration I think what needs to be done is widely understood the pipes in the tax code are clogged with provisions that encourage rent seeking behavior the misallocation of capital and warped the American economy what needs to be done mr. president is go in there and drain the swamp and clean out the tax code it contains almost 4 million words in the last decade alone more than a hundred and thirty laws have been enacted that yielded almost 4,500 changes to the tax code that amounts to more than one change to the tax code each and every day year in and year out it's become so complicated than almost ninety percent of taxpayers either hire attacks prepare or use tax preparation software to complete returns the IRS reports that the average estimated time burden for all taxpayers filing a form 1040a 1044 t easy is 13 hours with an average cost of two hundred and ten dollars with respect to these forms non-business taxpayers face an average burden of about eight hours a full day's work while business taxpayers face an average burden of about 23 hours nearly three days of work in 2011 the Small Business Administration found that among businesses with 20 or fewer employees tax compliance costs 1584 dollars per employee in addition to the escalating costs of compliance with this code costs both time and money the complexity of the code in my view has obscured the typical person's ability to understand it and in my view has undercut voluntary compliance which is of course the bedrock principle of our tax law with the ongoing debate about how to reduce the budget deficit the tax codes complexity serves also to perpetuate what is known as the tax gap that's the difference between what taxpayers pay and what is owed under the law the most recent Internal Revenue use service estimate for the tax gap is 385 billion dollars based on statistical trends the likely gap for this year is going to exceed four hundred and twenty billion dollars this is an underpayment of approximately fourteen percent now my gut tells me and I serve on both the Finance Committee and the Joint Committee on taxation that some of this gap certainly is due to conscious tax evasion but I also believe a significant portion of it is attributable the inadvertent mistakes and filing many of which stems from the complexity of the code well coordinated thoughtful comprehensive reform is going to reduce the need for many complex provisions that limit the ability of taxpayers to benefit from certain deductions credit exemptions and exclusions comprehensive tax reform must eliminate the multiple provisions that require taxpayers to calculate their liability multiple times such as the alternative minimum tax talk about bureaucratic water torture mr. president all this weekend across the country had middle-class folks essentially doing their taxes twice as a result of the minimum tax and the personal exemption phaseout pepped and the phase-out of itemized deductions peace isn't much easier I just like to show this particular poster debt demonstrates eleven tax forms these are forms mr. president and colleagues that the typical tax filer has to fill out every year or if they can afford it pay somebody to fill them out is this really necessary to run this full-time hand cramping program to have our citizens try to wade through all of this we also have another alternative mr. president one-page 1040 form that I have worked on with colleagues for years it is only about twenty nine lines long mr. president some industrious reporters took this particular tax form and they found that a typical citizen this was work done by Democrats and Republicans can fill out their taxes with this form in under an hour now to illustrate how complicated the code has become let me just refer briefly to capital gains the income tax currently imposes at least nine different effective tax rates on capital gains depending on the taxpayers regular rate how long an asset was on the type of asset and whether the taxpayer owes the alternative minimum tax for this the IRS provides three different worksheets one with 37 lines to help taxpayers calculate the tax on capital gains comprehensive reforms should make things easier for taxpayers by allowing a percentage exclusion for long term gains and report reapplying regular tax rates to the rest that simple change mr. president to just have an exclusion for a measure of capital gains that have been earned and then a progressive rate structure from that point on would sharply reduce the complexity of returns while maintaining fairness and opportunities for all our people to invest further complicating matters a number of commonly used terms in the tax code qualifying child modified a justice adjusted gross income and more have multiple definitions depending on the provision certainly Democrats and Republicans should agree that uniform definitions for the most commonly used terms or something that shouldn't be a bipartisan issue more than 40 definition of small business exists in the tax code alone now there's certainly policy reasons to provide tax benefits to families with children but the definition of a child differs widely across the tax code children under 19 count in defining the Earned Income Tax Credit benefits those under 17 qualify for the child credit and only those under 13 are eligible for the child and dependent care credit now maybe these differences results from deliberate congressional actions about who ought to receive tax benefits but I think they needlessly complicating and certainly lead to inadvertent errors that the Internal Revenue Service then tries to figure out how to correct other factors used to define qualifying children further complicate the situation including the child's physical residents custody arrangements and who pays the child's living expenses establishing a single definition to determine whether taxpayers may claim tax benefits for children would simplify both tax filing and IRS processing of returns and mr. president I see colleagues you know are here and I would only say the list goes on and on the Earned Income Tax Credit something vital to low-income you know families a whole host of different workshops the educational accredits again another example where families with students in college qualifying for multiple attacks benefits to defray educational expenses often can claim only one of them for example a family may be able to claim either the Hope Credit or the Lifetime Learning credit but not both for the same student if the family is more than one student it may claim one credit for one student the other for a second student determining which alternative is best requires multiple calculations and can conflict with the use of other tax it's for education such as coverdale savings accounts and 529 savings plans comprehensive tax reform would at the very minimum coordinate these education of benefits so that it would be easier for families to determine eligibility just how complicated have things become mr. president a few years ago Treasury's inspector general for tax administration sent staff to pose as taxpayers at 12 commercial preparer chains and 16 small independent preparers of the 28 tax returns the professionals prepared 17 had mistakes all of the business returns were wrong let me repeat that all of the business returns were wrong when professionals had prepared them in 2006 the same sort of drill was undertaken again the General Accounting Office sound that professional preparers made mistakes they mishandled those bread-and-butter kinds of issues like the Earned Income Tax Credit and the child care credit and even got it wrong mr. president whether the taxpayer should even itemize whether the taxpayer should even itemize at all his or her deductions so the question colleagues is really if the pros can't figure out how to file taxes isn't that clear isn't that obvious to all of us that the tax code needs to be purged and the special interest breaks cleaned out so that rates can be held down for all and that in fact we can agree on a simple tax philosophy I can sum up mind in a sentence mr. president I believe we need a tax system that gives everybody in America the opportunity to get ahead if you're successful we want you to be successful you're going to pay your fair share but nothing in the tax code is going to make it impossible for you to be successful the days ahead and if you don't have much we're gonna have a tax code that is simple and understandable and when you work hard and play by the rules you're going to have an opportunity to get ahead as well comprehensive tax reform is going to make it easier to file its going to lay out an opportunity for the Senate Democrats and Republicans and independents to come together and I close simply by saying once again mr. president we saw just in the past few days how broken and dysfunctional our tax system in America has become can you imagine what people thought when their software was crashing in the last couple of days they're trying to find their receipts they're flailing through filing cabinets trying to find those documents that attest to their taxable events for the past year and they can't know with certainty based on some of those analyses by the General Accounting Office whether they've done it right or even professionals have done it right so until this Senate comes together on a bipartisan basis to work for a simpler more coherent you know tax system one that promotes growth and eases the burden on American families and American business until that is done mr. president there will be no relief from the Ides of april and that in my view is a tragedy worthy of Shakespeare president with that I yield the floor

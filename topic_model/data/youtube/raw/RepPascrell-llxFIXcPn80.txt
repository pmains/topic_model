[Music] to the point with congressman bill Pascrell focusing on the concerns and issues facing the families of New Jersey's ninth congressional district [Music] hello I'm congressman bill Pascrell and I would like to welcome you to this latest edition of to the point today's show focuses on a difficult subject school shootings remain a tragically regular occurrence in our country parkland Florida Mount Pleasant Michigan Birmingham Alabama grape Mills Maryland Santa Fe Texas jonesburg Georgia and Noblesville Indiana that's only a partial list of school shootings in America just this year alone 2018 think about it the gun violence epidemic in our school seems to get worse and worse and this year we're on pace to set a grisly new record rather than past proactive restrictions many states and even Congress continue to make it easier to own and wield a firearm in public after years of waiting for action some students and parents have said enough is enough they're leading the nation in calling for federal state and local governments to get off their backsides and pursue common-sense solutions the work of the students in the March for our lives movement some not even old enough to drive I shown more leadership in these last few months on the gun issue that many of my congressional colleagues have exhibited in the last 25 years today we welcome two of these leaders Elena Perez of students demand action Bergen County and Larissa Mendez Downs co-chair of moms demand action Burgin chapter everyone welcome and thank you for coming here for today's discussion and we're gonna get we're gonna jump right into it where are we well I guess it depends on what state you're in it at the national level not very far and when moms demand action was founded in 2012 shannon watts our founder knew that because nothing happened after the Sandy Hook massacre when 26 people 20 of whom were children were killed what moms and others have done is try to take action at the States level as you know congressman New Jersey's Senate just passed six gun bills which will make New Jersey even safer and we are one of the safest state in terms of gun violence we have gun laws we can always do better but we have motion but we have good gun laws but at the national level it seems we've stalled we've stalled for a long time a lot of people have said that if nothing happened after Sandy Hook nothing will happen obviously we don't believe that and what's been great about the parkland students and what young people like Elena have done since Parkland is that they haven't let the issue go out of the news so yeah now I'm gonna ask al in a second but they haven't let it go it's just not one and done it's not two demonstrations three demonstrations peaceful and then go home and that's the end of it I think there media-savvy I think the fact that they very quickly amassed social media following has been a huge component I think that they're articulate I also think that not only have they brought attention to the school shootings but the broader issue of gun violence in the United States so for example several of them of the Parkland students met with kids from Chicago from other cities that has affirmed and that's different exactly more suburban gun violence and really mass shootings at the school level make up while they are horrific of course they make up a minority of gun deaths and gun violence in the United States so they've sort of been able to bring attention to all of these things by social media by regular media and because they're so passionate and articulate and and have been so good at coalition building I think they've been really able to keep the the issue on the airwaves well you were also in the middle of this only now you're in the middle of working with other people not only kids in your own school Lyndhurst it's gonna shout out for Lyndhurst not only work with the kids in the high school but reaching out to other schools and other kids are you part of that as well Elena and tell me do you think this is different does it feel different besides being different to start off yeah it feels really different about like when we started Bergen County students um in action is sorry that we would go on Instagram and look who's having a walkout and then we DM or message to person say okay do you want to have be a part of this group and now it's not even just Bergen County which I'm on FaceTime with kids from Texas from Santa Fe from Harlan from other countries I was on FaceTime with a girl from Germany because they wanted to know what's happening and I mean a couple years even before right before is born you couldn't do that so we have the momentum of you could talk to kids from Newark in a minute that experienced this every day or you could talk to kids from columbine who experienced the shooting in their school how do you know people are listening to each other that's work that we're good at talking particularly in the Congress do we listen are you are are people your age listening I think we are which my teachers will maybe disagree with most of the time but I feel like especially students talking to students you get this sense of okay they're friends I'd that could have been made that could've been my best friends so it starts hitting us especially if you'll my generation at a personal level because we've never I remember hearing about sent um Sandy Hook hysterical crying in colonial old were you an eleven you will and then I remember hearing about Columbine before I can remember when I heard about so I wasn't even born or next was parkland and then after Parkland we have Santa Fe and I'm million I've ever a million shootings I haven't names and events because it's something that we hear in the news so frequent a lot of people became them too now you heard and she's very clear about this Larissa say she doesn't see much action on the federal level do you have that perception and do your folks in the or do your your students that yet your peers feel the same way we do and I think with midterms coming up we've definitely are pushing for voting towards your candidates that have want common sense gun laws I think a lot of people get scared as we say common sense gun laws thinking we're going to take all your guns away and that's alone what we want we're against them yeah I'm told you support the second I'm I strongly support the second mom supports the second I support the Second Amendment what what what do we want you articulate what we're looking for we're looking for universal background checks we would make it harder for people who have issues and who shouldn't be who aren't able bobby's to have weapons right people to not have them I also think that and the private show private selling loop and gun show loophole which you could get a gun without a background check a lot of guns going north from South mm gun shows also we have the facts of band bump stocks because it makes a semi-automatic weapon automatic even though they are bet on my car bands yes a ban on the ar-15 and well I'm James that's just what have on top of my head but it's not I'm like I say my uncle owns guns and I'm fine with it it's just we own I've trust him and I know he's not gonna do anything harmful and he got it Louie go away and I feel that we could end a lot of these shootings if we take account of who's getting them and how we get them it's pretty crazy is it not when you can get on a line at an airport and be stopped because you're on a watch list walk out of that Airport and go buy a gun is that insane I mean what am I missing here tell me what I'm missing you're absolutely right and it's also insane that when over 90 percent of Americans support you know initiatives like universal background and in fact most of the NRA members support responsible gun ownership securing weaponry it really is the leadership that continues to be wild ownership of these gun organization so persistent they they believe that if you do something to begin to mediate the situation you are on that slippery slope of getting rid of the Second Amendment is there reason for them to believe that I mean are they making it up or no there really isn't and and you know the NRA was founded originally as a safety organization marksmanship organization and it really became sometime in the late 70s early 80s when it started representing gun manufacturers that it kind of went off the deep end and there was always rumors throughout the Obama administration which I'm sure you remember about Obama coming to take the guns away well that never happened good bumper sticker yes and then in fact the gun manufacturers have faced what they call the Trump slump because when President Trump who is very cozy with the NRA Lobby came to power there wasn't that idea that anybody was going to take anyone's guns away I don't know why if we have responsible gun owners we can't have that conversation you know mom's has a program we call be smart it's about secure gun ownership in the home whether you're going to somebody's house we ask about peanut allergies cats dogs unsecured pools so this program says ask about guns in someone else's home or you know if somebody's coming to your house are they locked up are they locked up that's all and so we need to have that awkward conversation and it's okay and most gun owners and one of the best presentations I did about b-smart was in front of a rifle club and they were super respectful and they enjoyed the conversation and I think what was because we approached were in in the middle we all agreed that we don't want our children to be hurt we all agree we want our kids we should be safe we should agree that's a basic their right to life or debarred very basic so how do we do that and how do we do that do we do that Elena by putting giving a gun to every teacher oh why not because we also we have the problem with first our teachers able to have guns if there's a shooting that breaks out in the school can that's got teacher accidentally shoot a student and then the teacher has to live with that and now they've killed a student while they should be focusing on protecting their students or helping them hide sharing share the progress that we've made 25 years ago I had a debate on television with a prominent state New Jersey senator none of my party doesn't matter he said the solution is very simple don't don't have any worry about gun violence what you need to worry about is that everybody who can should carry a gun now his salute we had just been talking about a bank robbery in Florida and he said what if no people were carrying there that was at the time when his debate about which states were going to allow you to carry openly or underneath their jacket or whatever he said what if everyone had a gun they would have been able to shoot down the bank robber and I remember what I might like my knee-jerk reaction weather was collected I was another question my knee-jerk reaction is what if he had shot some customers well in his anxiety to stop the brutality whatever the brutality was in this bank robbery isn't it possible that we've increased the chances and his answer was well we'll stop the bank robber the question is do you think that's a solution either everybody carry gun okay carry a gun no go back to the Wild West no because now we have to make our citizens feel like it's their job to protect a person coming with a gun my cousin had the science says future teacher or not a future soldier because we should be focusing on how to prevent knees from happening these events these school shootings these regular shootings from happening not saying ok if I have a gun I'm gonna stop it and everything's gonna be good now we don't have to worry about now we have students struggling with PTSD right now we have teachers that feel like they have to throw themselves in front of students or with a gun and maybe shoot their mate classmate or something so and are they able body to have them like what if that person feels suicidal yeah so now we're focusing if everyone could have a gun before you purchase a weapon should it be mandatory that you must go through a universal check to see your background whether you are capable of using it whether you are fit to have this gun on your present and I guess it would be particularly more significant if you are in a state where you can carry you know there are those there are some in New Jersey and like that to happen to on a federal level I'm strictly against that but that's up to the state that's not up to the federal government I'd be very suspect in that situation I mean we're gonna we're gonna turn this into the Wild West is not the ways about it absolutely and universal background checks what would be helpful at the federal level is that at the state level they're very spotty I mean look what happened in in in you know you have you have somebody who whose records weren't submitted by the Air Force to the proper authorities and that never made it on to the next space so we have a very spotty state system because all of the states have very different laws on the records about who can carry is it a shall carry or may carry state all of these different factors and so it makes any attempts to sort of hodgepodge the system less effective and and so the idea of universal background checks to make them comprehensive and universal is is a tough hurdle but i but it is supported by over 90% of Americans and if we have the political will we can do it right well if the Congress has the political will we're we're frightened in the in the House of Representatives on their present leadership to even bring it up this has nothing to do with Democrat Republican the leadership the majority doesn't want to even talk about it because it may have to come up to a vote we know they're hot-button issues we know there's a lot of visceral miss in discussion these issues don't we want to make it easier for kids to live and grow up why make it more difficult for them if more weapons are are available you know some may argue that things haven't changed when I was in the Jersey Legislature I introduced legislation along with a few other legislators to ban assault weapons I think they shouldn't be banned we made a mistake by putting more weapons in that band than should have been in and no question about it so we need to be careful about what we ban if we ban that weapon and we ban this weapon we want sportsmen to have their way and legal means we want those people who are fishing ADO's to have their way everybody's doing doing it illegal what we don't want is for anybody to put anyone else in jeopardy protect yourself why not there's nothing wrong with that you know we advocate it so we passed the legislation in the early 90s Jim Florio was the governor at the time and he chose Paterson New Jersey or I was the mayor to come and sign the legislation so we're going to go out and sign the legislation ten o'clock in the morning in front of City Hall and the Public Safety Director stopped me and said you can't go out there like that I said what do you mean I can't go out there like that you need a flak jacket I had to wear a flak jacket the governor well I assume probably on his trip up from Trenton put it on he had his flak jacket that's the only way we signed this legislation apparently people have made some phone calls the night before we're going to get those I saw whatever and but this is these are strange strange times are we past that stage or is it even more dangerous now what do you think I have a few takes on that I think we are not fully past the stage I feel we have come some ways but like my school for example we get threats a lot other schools I know have been on lockdown for it we were on lockdown for six hours three hours once schools I've known been locked down for six seven hours because we don't know they catch the people who did it I'm not all the time because sometimes it's like a computer threat sometimes the student the right like nut we got a threat the other day but a few weeks ago but right after Parkland by a student that's pretty sick yeah because what do you what's the punishment for that punishment usually expelling our I don't know the kid's name but I know they can't only got suspended yeah because since they found no weapons in his house he had weapons he did it since they found the weapons in someone's house there's been a real wise guy yeah but then it always gives you the uncomfort with maybe he has a way of getting it he's back in school or she's back in school and we're learning a lot about these perpetrators mm-hmm whether and/or or you know if they're killed at the scene or are they not killed at the scene we learned so much about their inner lives about no one reached though even the authorities maybe we're hesitant to do that we all have a responsibility here don't we oh absolutely and really the literature seems to suggest that it's actually wellness programs holistic health programs that end up making the difference one of our allies the Sandy Hook promise they were founded by several parents after Sandy Hook their idea is inclusion that starts at the elementary school level but at the middle school and high school level Sandy Hook promise has programs about saying something if you see something they have an app that sort of correlates with that and therefore if somebody says something something absolutely it's about going through the steps to ensure that if a threat is made then there is follow-up to ensure that there's an inclusivity in the school and that is not to place the burden on victims because that certainly happened after a parkland because that's not the case at all but about making the community responsive to those kind of threats do something we need to do something about guns we know we need to do something about mental health we finally just a few years ago I got parity to discuss it like any other illness but we need to do something about guns too and an extreme is not what anyone's advocating and that is let's do a wave let's take the guns out of people's hands no one's advocating that no two of the last school shootings have been young people getting access to parents guns and in the case of for example gun suicides which are two-thirds of the deaths that we have in the United States if a person has access to a gun they're more likely to make a fatal suicide decision for example so acts at Massachusetts it's the one state in the Union where there are laws regarding how to secure a weapon in various different states including New Jersey we have laws that cover if a child I believe it's under 16 and under 14 it's not the full range to 18 though if a child gains access and injures himself or other than there's consequences but otherwise no so again a spotty state system of laws and that's a big step that we could take at the federal level I'm not happy to report to you that in this last budget money was taken out of the budget particularly for research on the technology of guns now some of the universities in New Jersey are doing fantastic work and JT Stevens etc and smart guns which I believe in I had legislation a few years ago it didn't go anyplace but only the person who owns the gun can fire the gun because of prints and all of that and I think that's healthy because many people are being killed by other people's guns children are getting hold of guns and they wouldn't be able to fire it because they wouldn't have the print on that gun the science is not there the science is there to prevent that from happening what's so bizarre about that tell me what's so anti Second Amendment about that I don't honestly know especially when the technology also exists for very basic safes that would give you immediate access that's a lot of the pushback we get well what if I want to get my hunt my gun immediately in case of immediate danger to my household or my house or family and you know we talked about this Heller vs. DC gives people the fundamental right to own a gun for self-defense in their homes and that's great but the technology exists where you can put your fingerprints the safe immediately opens and you have accident and we need to to invest in the research the the question I I was in the Congress along with Carolyn McCarthy congresswoman she's no longer cronniss woman from Long Island when her husband was killed on an Li training and her son was wounded I went to the hospital I she then ran for Congress and we helped in a minor way but we helped put together a Million Moms March on Washington after Columbine they come out of the woodwork everybody was there everybody was there and then it was done I don't believe that people your age are saying one and done I personally believe in listening particularly those kids from Parkland my heart goes out to them they are real American heroes like yourself like yourself American heroes are standing up for what they think is right they're not afraid they're not here to hurt anybody they're here to protect people so I have a lot of faith and what those kids and you kids I'm sorry for calling it kid and will you young ladies and gentlemen are doing in the United States of America and I would tell my audience over and over again don't be depressed about this you got to be up for this you bother me this is not for the faint in art and if you sit back and say well that's for other people to decide that's the problem in America today we can't let the government solve all these problems we've got to show our responsibilities as in the citizens as citizens and I think that's possible I think that'll change that change the entire situation if people if if these young people are as I perceive them to be into this and they're not going home this is something very very very different I think it is a game changer I think people Elena's age you're not 18 yet 17 but they're already even the under 18 crowd are mobilizing their peers to get registered to vote to file for absentee ballots if they're going to be starting college for example the Parkland kids are doing a nationwide tour this summer to register people to vote so I think what you said congressman about citizens if that's the keyword it's using your rights of the citizen your free speech your right to vote that's ultimately gonna make a difference I I am so pleased that both many many Democrats and Republicans are gonna be rational about this and reasonable about this I see that many folks on the other side of the aisle are are coming forward now they don't want to think guns away from anybody but they're saying let's stop this insanity let's do something about it we've come together we can do something about it and in this in this school in all the schools because we cannot take guns off the table when we're discussing gun violence I want to thank you both you did it did a great job you know where I stand I'm out there with try to get there as many groups as I can there's only certain time in a week but enough time in a week but I'm doing my best thing I can assure you plus what legislation but I want to hang out my legislation and I said I'm doing my job if I introduce legislation I always say that's the easy part you got to change what's out there the culture and that's what I'm looking for thank you both you've done a great job I'm proud of both of you and I know you're gonna bring about change look I want to thank you for watching this edition up to the point I want to thank my guests Elena and

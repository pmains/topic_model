we're here in the Brookside community of Indianapolis I'm inspired every time I visit these community leaders and their neighbors what they've done is they've taken a otherwise high crime neighborhood low educational opportunities they've shown that the real platform for change across our country comes all the way down to the neighborhood level whether it's our urban communities or rural communities I hear about some of the same challenges people are facing time and again they want their children and grandchildren to be able to play a meaningful role in this growing and changing economy then one affordable housing we're so honored that the senator would come and visit just for one thing just to show them our work rebuilding a community we think of it as didn't more restoration we're not trying to ya know raise the property values as much as restore homes our citizen leaders have descended on this place with a spirit of love they've really helped create a culture where economic development is now thriving where houses are being restored subsidized by some local churches and not-for-profits carrying neighbors and transform lives making their neighborhood and making this country a little better place you

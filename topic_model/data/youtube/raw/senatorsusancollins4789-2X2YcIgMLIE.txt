it has been nine weeks since nearly 300 girls were kidnapped from their school by the terrorist group Boko Haram in Nigeria I believe that the United States should have provided immediate surveillance reconnaissance and intelligence assets to locate these girls before they were split up into more difficult to find smaller groups I'd further believe that contingency plans should have been made so that our Special Forces who performed so extraordinarily well as we saw during this past weekend with their capture of the terrorists who let the big the Benghazi attack should have been on the ground working with Nigerian forces to plan a rescue of these girls mr. secretary with each passing day the future of these girls grows more and more precarious there's no doubt that some of them have already been forced into early marriages others have been taken across the border and sold into slavery all have been required to convert to Islam according to the video that we've all seen yet it feels like these girls have been forgotten pushed off the front pages by a string of endless crises I've made my concerns known to the administration in several venues about my disappointment that we did not act sooner and more aggressively to help rescue these girls working with the Nigerians could you tell me my question for you is is this an urgent priority what is going on senator I can assure you this president feels exactly the same as you do as we all do as you have framed it up and laid out the tragedy of this the urgency of this but but let me also address your questions about why wasn't there more action quicker so on first as you know we cannot just drop into a sovereign country without that country's government asking us for assistant that country nigeria has an elected government about the president so we were preparing once we heard a new what was going on also working with them diplomatically to get a request from them for each of the resources that we were able to provide and still are providing that's one second the capability of the Nigerian forces to be able to carry out well we can give them in the way of intelligence or assistance is still their responsibility they have limited capabilities now I know that's not a good answer but that's that's the reality we are as focused as today on on helping locate these girls doing everything we can to get them out of there but this is a sovereign nation and we require obviously like any other situation the government to ask us to come in they give us the limits and the parameters on where we can operate how we can operate the other part of this too is you know is this is about terrain wise as complicated a part of the world as there is a triple quadruple canopy jungles they move them around the your deadly smart guys Boko Haram so we're up against that is as well so unless the Chairman would like to this that would be my general assessment but make no mistakes are this president all of us are as committed to this even though you don't read in the front pages because of the reasons you mentioned we're still involved and we're still assisting well time is taking away and with each passing day the chances of these girls being reunited with their families grows ever dimmer and the fact is the Nigerians did say yes I realized they didn't say yes immediately and it seems to me we should have had a plan so that when they said yes we could swoop right in we did as much as they would let us do and if you want to get down to details of the operation I'll let general well I just want to assure you senator we didn't wait for the Nigerians to ask or respond to our question the military under the Secretary's leadership began repositioning resources when we saw this occurring but I do so two things i do want to bring us back to this budget hearing we are where we are around the world today because we can be and we can respond it may not have been adequate to this task but we are certainly adequate to a lot of tasks and that capability is eroding while we sit here well let me switch to another issue but let me first just say that I specifically asked whether there was contingency planning for Special Forces to go in and was told that there was not so I'm glad to hear you contradict that but that is not the answer that well let me distinguish between moving assets in the event that we are given permission to use them in contingency planning and also senator the the Abu khattala operation though it may have looked you know rather routine it took us months of preparation and intelligence soaked but that's exactly my point I mean from day one I think we should have been working on this and I know how meticulous and difficult and operation that are special forces involved and is but that's that's sort of part of my frustration

to California hosted by Democratic congresswoman barbara Lee aptly named Nixon to trump perspectives on presidential accountability representative Lee will be joined by experts and Friends of our show John Dean and Malcom Nance in a conversation about Trump scandal-ridden presidency and it will also address calls for impeachment from her constituents in the East Bay join me now is representative barbara Lee herself a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee who controls the federal perspiration for string and our very own MSNBC contributor Malcolm Nance all right thank you both for being here and represent if we I'm going to go with you first why this event today and what you hope to accomplish well I think it's so important that the public continue to be engaged with regard to presidential accountability there are so many issues that need to be unraveled and I am so pleased that mr. Nance and mr. Dean will be with us today because I was an intern for the great congressman Ron Dellums during the Watergate era and I swear it feels like that and by councils have passed resolutions calling for investigations to continue and so I think the public all around the country needs to know what is taking place uncover the facts of course call for a bipartisan independent commission congresswoman Karen bass held when in Southern California we're doing one today in Berkeley and I hope that people around the country will hold presidential accountability forms a Town Meeting and now that we you've had a few members of the United States Senate who have been on the sunday shows this morning to play one of them Dianne Feinstein off of California she's on Face the Nation this morning talking about the Russia investigation take a listen you get the sense that the federal investigation into this includes something beyond just the question of Russia and the Trump campaign but that it now includes a cover-up question well I think that's right it does I know what the president told me when he called to say that he was firing him and that turned out not to be the reason so Malcolm you know I'll ask you basically the same question how wide-ranging do you think that this investigation ultimately will go well you know as I wrote my book plot to hack America which I'm going to be discussing today who was an England Watergate trial you know nine months ago we saw that this was going to go in multiple directions but its main thrust and the part that everyone is you know they think this is 500 different little parts it's not it's one thing and that is the Russian intervention in the US elections for the first time in the nation's history and now it's just a component of did the administration know anything about it we're there other American you know American citizens who may have been involved with the known Russian intelligence officers who did this act so I think it's going to go in many many different areas because it involves finance and in some cases perhaps even espionage you know I think that is what frustrates a lot of people representative leads to quite frankly I mean we've been talking about Russian interference with Malcolm literally since last July I feel like Malcolm and I have done the same show over and over and over again week after week after weekend going back to last summer but people are behaving is is that this is something that cropped up after Donald Trump was elected how is it that the entire country and the government apparatus has been so inert about what Russia has done to our country since last was more than a year ago and it's unfortunate that at every step of the way we have seen the White House attempt to quash these investigations we saw what the CIA intelligence committee chair his behavior he had to recuse himself we see that attorney general sessions have to recuse himself and then he crops up later in the firing of FBI director Comey we see the president providing classified information to the Russians hoping that this would in the investigation so every step of the way you have seen attempts to make sure that the public is not informed that this investigation does not move any further but I tell you one thing now with regard to the special counsel now looking at both a investigation as well as the Civic the possible obstruction of justice possible collusion with the Russians during the elections I think once we get an independent bipartisan Commission established and hopefully Republicans will sign on to that we can really expose what has actually taken place and so the time it takes time but we need to really wrap this up and that's why these forms around the country are extremely important and welcome from the point of view of an intelligence professional how successful of an operation would it was it from Russia's point of view to have had Michael Flynn a potentially compromised person even for 27 days become the national security adviser of the United States despite all the warnings about him well it's terrifying and it's quite honest with you we have no clue as to the depth of what actually happened here with Michael Flynn you have to remember he was one of the first American officers ever to visit the headquarters of Russian military intelligence back in 2013 when he was still direct deputy I was still director of Defense Intelligence Agency then was soon after fired and he became a disgruntled very high-ranking intelligence person and in the regular world that wouldn't matter very much they would go off and become a defense contractor he went in and started dealing with foreign governments for pay and the Russians paid him that would be the first entry way to turning somebody into an asset or in the worst case an agent for that nation for him to ascend to where he was is I know everyone I speak to any intelligence community from jr. baby operator up to senior deputy you know former directors of the CIA and NSA everyone is alarmed that this could possibly be the greatest Russian intelligence operation in history and Michael Flynn may have been part of their operation and it covers women you know as we all know the impeachment which is a word being thrown around a lot emerges from the House of Representative and yet the party of the other side the Republicans who control the House of Representatives have been almost unit unanimous in their unswerving support for Donald Trump you're starting to see a few cracks at at least the rhetorical support for him although they haven't take much action but let's just jump over to the Senate side from it and let you listen to Marco Rubio who sort of I guess he would sort of be exhibit a of what Republicans think and say about Trump take a listen if any president tries to impede an investigation any president no matter who it is by interfering with the FBI yes that would be problematic it would be not just problematic it would be you know obviously a potential obstruction of justice what would it take just from your day-to-day conversations with Republicans in the house for them to move from that sort of bland leaning in chastising rhetoric about any president potentially doing anything that sounded like it may be a social injustice to actually holding the current president accountable well these investigations will determine whether there was obstruction of justice and joy obstruction of justice constitutes grounds for impeachment and so the Republicans need to understand that they need to be for real they need to go where the facts lead and hopefully they will sign on to our bipartisan Commission because this will make sure that the investigation moves forward in a more expedited and objective manner but you do hear more Republicans now beginning to question the behavior and actions of this president and and I tell you guys what what mr. Manson listin will talk about this afternoon will give us even more information with regard to how these investigations should move forward so that we can make sure that the American people know exactly what took place and what the consequences are and Malcolm I'll ask you if a commission were to be formed what should it attempt to do and attempt to discover well of course you know now we have a special counsel so he is going to be carrying out the broad I have broad range but very deep dive investigations using the FBI and other agencies so anything beyond that if there's going to be a commission further one it's number one goal would have to be to determine how did we get here how did we get to a situation where a foreign nation and its intelligence that agencies could actually try to effect an election outcome what systems did they use how did they use them were Americans complicit if they were complicit why did they do that you know and did anybody else and did any other thing including the media did they contribute to this that's what the job well I think of a commission would be you know but now you've got the House Intelligence Committee the Senate Intelligence Committee who will probably defer more to the General Counsel's investigation but you know once all this is washed out you know and we find that whether there was any criminality or whether people were completely innocent there was all just the Russians then we need to have a national dialogue about just exactly how do we never get to this point again and how do we restore the nation back to norms yeah absolutely and you'll get an amen on that one on this Sunday congresswoman barbara Lee and Malcom Nance of luck with that event today thank you and say hi to John Dino live strain destroyed this afternoon on my Facebook page for those who would like

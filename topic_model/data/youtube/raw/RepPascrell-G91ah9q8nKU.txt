want to congratulate New Jersey Transit I want to congratulate the township of Montclair for rebuilding the upper montclair train station and their this was a very very unfortunate fire and you seized the opportunity to bring some improvements to the station I've always tried to look at the communities that I think are that stand out as examples of what communities ought to be and in Montclair is always at the top of that list no community did I know up cares more about the quality of life the month when you jerk how she from Montclair wanted to see this station rehabilitated to leadership the mayor and the members of the council that was high on their priority list and then also NJ transit terms of trying to cut through some of the red tape that was involved in making us become a reality and I must say Montclair has a good sense of balance in terms of economic development and then balancing that with the sensitivities of the community the constituents and the people that live out here that commute day to day and I know we touch bait you know we touched briefly on them but they were out here in the pouring rain they were out here in the torrential downpours are always a lot of partners and people behind the scenes working very hard to get things like this done and we're really happy and proud to have this new restaurant there's a really great example of you know what happens when you've got a private company that's doing really good work and partnering with with the public free

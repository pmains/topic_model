we have a house budget we have a Senate Democratic budget the next step in the process what we call regular order is to go to conference so we have a conversation about how we iron out the differences try and make have a negotiation but right now the Speaker of the House has refused to send conferees to that conversation we have called repeatedly for return to regular order in this body well regular order is going to conference all I say to my colleagues is can't we after all those hours would I forgot what hour in the morning now it was after all those votes after all that debate after all that discussion and and we came up with a budget and now we won't go to conference why is that and there's simply no reason why the very reasonable approach suggested by Senator McCain that would allow us to go to conference should not be adopted because that's why we appoint conferees and that's why we approve or disapprove the result of that conference that's how our laws are made and that's how our budgets are made and that's how our budgets are made

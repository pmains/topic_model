uh thank you chairman tonko uh and i agree today's um we we're gonna be covering three bills in this today but curiously only two of which have had a hearing during this congress uh that the aqua act will make significant changes to our drinking water laws i know it's well intended but i have some concerns with this bill it removes primarily the cost benefit requirement and a small business system variants from the safe drinking water act now let's get more down in the weeds the cost benefit analysis is an important tool to evaluate the impacts of our policy choices when developing drinking water regulations cost benefit analysis and the variances allow eligible systems serving small communities paul 3 300 people or fewer like many in my districts to apply to the epa to use treatment technologies that they can actually afford i intend to offer an amendment to this bill to ensure these two provisions are reconsidered to be part of the bill the subcommittee also will mar will consider the low-income water customer assistance program act of 2021 this legislation will create a permanent rate assistance program for low-income water customers and lastly the subcommittee will be marking up the pfas action that you refer to we haven't had a hearing on this in two years mr chairman nearly a quarter of our members are new to the committee and unaware of what has happened what changes have occurred the intent of this legislation is to do away with pfas and treat it as a hazardous material i understand that that's why focus on what we're trying to do here do away with pfas and treat it as a hazardous material but the science on pfas has evolved since our last year over two years ago and this is a non-scientific approach to deal with pfas the american chemistry council has stated pfas it is quote is a large class of different chemicals over 9 000 with different properties and characteristics and it and each of them has a different hazard and risk profile so i don't understand mr chairman why we're dealing with a one-size-fits-all it just quintessential washington knowing best rather than dealing with the issues one at a time and the epa has made significant progress in advancing this since the bill would pass the house last year in fact the epa is moving forward drinking water regulations hazardous substance designation under the superfund and toxicity assessments for certain pfas the congress in congress has passed key bipartisan laws like you referred to to address pfas like requiring the defense department to stop using pfas containing firefight fighting phones and requiring epa to mandate that drinking water systems monitor for for certain unregulated pfas and thirdly requiring the epa to restrict new uses of p-fola and pfas even the defense department is voluntarily cleaning up their contaminated sites so mr chairman as i said earlier our committee has yet to have epa testify about what's taken place over the last two years so i'm asking you as we go forward uh will you commit to working with us and and holding a hearing with the epa before this is put before the full committee or taking to the floor can we work together you talked about that can we do that you know as we indicated you know i think both parties have uh through the course of time um recognized hearings that were held in the previous congress and went forward with uh votes on the bill so um would still like to move this in subcommittee today i and i'm okay with that but i'm saying and and and i'll be supporting you on pfast but i want to say let's make sure that this is not a one size fits all so i'm asking if we could have a hearing and learn a little bit more about where the progre where it is because if we're gonna let's focus on the big problem pfast and water rather than the pfas that's used in electronic equipment and medical equipment let's let's be careful about how we proceed with it so all i'm asking is before now and when we bring this before the full committee that we're gonna we can have a hearing that's all i'm asking you to see can we try to have a hearing before the self-affordable committee yeah well representative mckinley i think you know i hear where you're coming from but also it's pretty well known that there you know it's been some you know there's been dragging along where we needed to really address pipas because of his grave concern to uh our constituents and you know i think the dragging of the feet just didn't help in this situation well i've seen my times gone over i'm i'm still hoping if we could just have one or one week or two weeks to have a hearing uh mr jeremy you and i both know that would be beneficial as we go forward with this because i want to see where epa has moved ahead and where research is moving ahead to address the alternative to using pfas in other uses we'll talk more about it during the amendment states so i look forward to i thought this thoughtful markup and i yield back the balance of my time thank you representative mckinley the gentleman yield

hi i'm representative eric burleson with another capitol report um i'm in the capitol rotunda on the second floor and behind me etching the walls are some some words of advice the earth is the lord's and the fullness thereof righteousness righteousness exalted the nation lord god of hosts be with us yet lest we forget you know prayer and in the people's relationship with god is an important part of our government i'll never forget my fourth grade teacher mrs venable at sherwood elementary in springfield every day our classroom by mrs venable asking a student to lead us in the pledge of allegiance and after the pledge each day she would bow her head and and lead us in a moment of silence and i'm certain that every day during her prayer she was probably pain praying for patients how to deal with a class of very busy and energetic eight-year-olds but this has become something that's been contentious argument over the years and a lot has changed since i was in fourth grade not too long ago a missouri student drew a picture that said jesus loves me and her teacher advised her to change the drawing to say mommy loves me taking out the name jesus in a similar situation a young girl brought home brought her bible to study hall to read and she was asked to put the bible away and not to read it while at a public school hearing about these incidences is deeply concerning and i it's deeply concerning to me and i hope it's deeply concerning to you and i want to talk about this something is called the myth of the separation church and state the myth originates from a letter not from a government document the letter was from thomas jefferson to the danbury baptist and it's the basis for the term separation of the church to estate and in the letter he says believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between man and his god that he owes account to none other for this for his faith or his worship that the legislative powers of government reach actions only and not opinions i contemplate with sovereign reverence that acts of the whole american people which declare that their legislature should make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof this thus building a wall of separation between church and state the first problem with the assertion is that this quote is from is from an official document this quote does not exist in the constitution the law of separation between church and state does not exist any official government document the second is that it was jefferson's intent that this meant that the church was was to be protected from government and not the other way around so why should we deny children of this state or any any individual the ability to express their religious freedom and express their freedom of speech so it's become obvious to me and others that something needs to be done my good friend representative mike mcgee has introduced legislation that protects our constitutional rights and and continues to underline those rights for missouri citizens through house joint resolution 62 and hgr 62 guarantees the citizens first amendment rights to pray and worship in all public areas including schools these activities must be voluntary and they are held to the same rules and regulations that apply to other types of freedom of speech and of course our citizens retain the right to choose any religion that they want including the ability to have no to believe it have no religion at all it also states that public schools receiving state funds must display the a copy of the bill of rights in a visible way and a portion of the resolution also protects the rights of government officials such as myself and other employees to be able to pray in public in public buildings you know every day we begin session on the house floor with prayer and passing this resolution underlines and underscores our rights that are given and granted under the constitution uh i want to thank you again for the for the opportunity to be able to convey my thoughts and yep and for you to be able to watch this video i ask that you if you like it that you can share it with your friends on facebook or other other tools and also please let me know about any other topics or issues that are concerning you i look forward to hearing from you thank you

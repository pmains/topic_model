thank you very much mr. speaker I thank the gentlelady for yielding I thank you also for her leadership on this really very important issue to the values of our country her service on the agricultural committee Agriculture Committee is indeed a blessing to us at all as we fight for our children and mr. Lucas thank you for your leadership of the committee as well I know you tried to bring a bipartisan bill to the floor what happened after that well I will go into it i also want to salute Collin Peterson our colleagues on the committee we need a farm bill we want to have a good farm bill for our farmers for our ranchers for food security for our country so hopefully we can get to that place but not with doing violence to our children Mr Speaker we come this body is so magnificent because it's so diverse we represent districts all over the country we represent people are different backgrounds all over the country but one thing among others but one thing that we certainly have in common is that each one of us has people in our district each of us has people in our district have people in our districts who depend on the SNAP program for their nutrition there isn't one person in this room who could rise up and say nobody in my district relies on the nutrition programs that are in the farm bill chief among them our children seniors veterans and their families they are the real faces of hunger in America and their stories are the most compelling reason to reject this dangerous Republican legislation in my district in san francisco people from all walks of life have relied on the supplement the SNAP program to make it through tough and trying times one yelling woman i want to highlight this catlin now in her 20s worked hard at a part-time job to put ourselves through college but as the recession took its toll on students across the country looking for work Catlin found that she could not afford to pay rent and purchase food each month because she qualified for mergency food snap initiative she was able to get by get a promotion and now works full-time here's Brian 50 years old and homeless even though he searches constantly for full-time employment he spends his spare time volunteering at st. Anthony's dining room helping other people a place that helps other people to find food to find shelter clothes and compassion in our community there he gives back what little he has to the community wholeheartedly serving our seniors veterans children and families who also rely on the generosity of people like Brian to feed themselves and their loved ones like Brian and Caitlin millions of people across America are working hard and getting all they have to lift themselves up and help others get on their feet I've heard my colleagues to talk about one of them says something if you don't work you should need or something to that effect and correctly it's really important to note that because of the low minimum wage in our country a family of four with both parents working full-time and earning the minimum wage are below the poverty line they don't even come close to one hundred and thirty percent of property they are below the poverty line so in some respects the SNAP program is subsidizing a low minimum wage in our country as other support does as well I wish that we could respect how hard it is for a family of four with two people working full-time not making enough money to put food on the table that we respect them where they're struggling for their concern for their families and not judge them that they shouldn't have food on the table because our country has chosen to pay a sub living wage to so many people in our country the Republicans proposed on the for today slashes at the legs on which many of these people stand indeed cutting investments is a full assault on the health and economic security of millions of families one and consider this one in five children that soon becoming one in four but one in five children struggle with hunger and nearly half of all snap recipients are children nearly four million Americans over age 60 rely on nutrition assistance five thousand active duty military families active duty families rely on snap depend on Pat snap nearly three million veterans and their families don't get enough to eat each month million veterans and this jeopardized food assistance for as many as 170,000 veterans a couple weeks ago I was in houston texas visiting my grandchildren and we were at mass and the sermon was a beautiful one about and the bible was actually the gospel was that day too many of our colleagues have quoted the Gospel of Matthew when I was hungry who gave me to eat and other parts of the Bible and and the gospel that day was talking about how the prayers that day we're talking about how we have a responsibility to each other and the sermon in the sermon that pre said something that I think we should consider as we consider our vote here today he said you just can't come to church and pray on Sunday and go out and prey on people the rest of the week this legislation is praying PR ey ing on people on children or veterans on seniors on all those who are struggling to do their best in our country it is our moral obligation to reject this legislation and to preserve the investments these investments that every American need for Americans who need them and other Americans who want them to have it it is our moral duty to vote down this measure and to work across the aisle in conference on a comprehensive farm bill that ensure food security supports our farmers and ranchers and strengthens world communities community that should be the word of the hour what is our responsibility to community it certainly isn't to say the kids we want your best in school but we're not going to fuel your mind by giving you food to eat or to thank our veterans by depriving them of this our seniors for all that they have done something is very wrong with this picture but I know one thing for sure every person who votes for this Republican measure is voting to hurt his or her own constituents because we all represent people who at some time need help that I yield back the balance of my time gentlelady yields back to the time the gentleman smoke

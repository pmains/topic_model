house minority whip steve scalise joins us now so they're going to lay out or we're going to you're going to lay out the your vision for infrastructure you guys want to do an infrastructure bill yeah brian good morning good to be with you there's been a lot of interest going back to president trump and getting a bipartisan infrastructure deal speaker pelosi walked out of multiple meetings at the white house when trump was president where he was trying to get a bipartisan agreement and then on this they're not talking to republican leaders at all and we've reached out but they they won't even talk to us because they just want to go it alone like they did on that non-coveted 1.9 trillion dollar spending bill that they just passed here they go with trillions more in in this kind of soviet-style infrastructure dream list of the left so uh senator chris coons yesterday yesterday says this will likely end up just a purely partisan bill first do everything we can reasonably to negotiate in a bipartisan bill with the other side and then basically he predicted they're going to have to do it themselves can they if they don't have joe manchin and kirsten cinema i don't care what the parliamentarian says uh you're not going to have the numbers yeah you know speaker pelosi's socialist agenda she's been pushing these last few months since they've controlled all levels of power is starting to catch up with their with their members that are less socialist you know they don't really have any moderates left but but even the liberal members are starting to have angst because they're voting against the will of their own districts and people are starting to get fed up that out of control spending they're going to propose raising taxes all under the guise of infrastructure look over 90 of what they're proposing has nothing to do with roads or bridges you know they're talking about child care and uh things uh you know like they're gonna do green new deal policies that have nothing to do with infrastructure and by the way the national association of manufacturers said what they're proposing right now abiding in the democrats will cost over a million more jobs these are hard-working blue-collar jobs that we will be losing if they get their way of a democrat-only bill i don't think that's good for america it's surely an infrastructure well it's up to you guys to start communicating to the rest of the country it's not that you're trying to deny bridges and tunnels but we can't afford to do eldercare healthcare and have a green militia trying to jam that energy down our throats let's fast forward to the border crisis because it is a crisis even though the president won't acknowledge it and the vice president would show up to do her job we see two democrats vincente gonzalez as as well as another who's come out and said they have to solve this problem by the summer because the numbers are going to get worse what can be done today about this crisis yeah it's alarming what's happening at the border all created by president biden's executive action so he could today start fixing this problem first get back to the remaining mexico policy it worked incredibly well we had an agreement with mexico to help us control our southern border their northern border and they were holding people coming over that were seeking asylum most of the asylum claims are rejected because it doesn't meet our definition if you want to come to america legally there's a process to do it we let a million people in a year legally most generous nation in the world but what you're seeing today is thousands of people a day coming over illegally because president biden said america's borders open put back on the remaining mexico policy get back to building the wall brian we're paying the contractors to build the wall but president biden ordered them to stop building they abandoned the work sites yet the taxpayers of america are getting fleeced because we're still paying their bill even though they're not building that wall uh build it again it was working get the agreement with the northern triangle countries you know we had a lot of the countries in south and central america working with us again this was something president trump negotiated agreements with these other countries to help us control their border and our border right now the drug cartels are controlling america's southern border because president biden is taking our border patrol agents off the border over 40 percent of them diverted away from doing their job of stopping the drug cartels because they're over at detention facilities like the donna detention facility where they have for these cells that biden has set up that are set up for 33 kids they have over 400 kids in each of these holding cells that were designed for 33. they'd shut your restaurant down if you were that far over the limit yet this is happening at america's border by president biden's executive action i know he can reverse it and we could have done this segment two weeks ago it's the same thing he doesn't do anything about it and here's the editorial you're frustrated and this was included in it's on foxnews.com democrats open border crisis here are the heartbreaking images we saw firsthand and you put them in that's happening but and it's amazing how the compliant press is perfectly okay being locked out of these facilities can you imagine if it was president trump and you had these kids in pens in facilities that are 800 percent over capacity and in case people are wondering it's just steve scalise saying this the guatemalan president said the messages are confusing the compassionate message were understood by the people in our country especially the coyotes to tell families quote we'll take the children the children could go and once the children are there they'll call their parents that's what they're doing it's actually working for the uh coyotes who are taking that money and giving it to the cartels some are mortgaging their houses congressman this is disgusting brian look it's child abuse what's going on in the donna detention facility that's why they don't want the press in there i saw kids crying in there they don't want to be there they don't want to be a pawn in this game that president biden's plan to have open borders in el salvador guatemala they don't want to lose their next generation all the young kids that are fleeing out coming into america illegally it's the wrong message they're abusing these kids it's a national disgrace and president biden and kamala harris won't go down and see it for themselves they owe it to the american people to go down there see it and then fix it they can fix it today all right congressman thanks so much just a two-seat advantage currently for the democrats meanwhile

next week the president will come up and make a state of the union speech to the Congress and it'll be an opportunity for all of us to examine his uh his last year in office his first two years in office and I think one thing that the American people are obviously feeling is the impact of his policies with respect to inflation and if you look at overall inflation it's 13 and a half percent increase in the cost of everything since this president took office but more particularly if you look at food which is where a lot of people experience that cost it's much higher than that it's 18.6 percent increase in the cost of food since President Biden took office for basic items like eggs 60 increase 30 percent increase for butter 24 increase for lettuce and so these are the the types of costs that the American people are experiencing on a daily basis and I hope the president will address that issue and what he intends to do to address this rampant inflation that is been so harmful to the pocketbooks of everyday Americans as we think about the the cost of food and those who produce it this is a farm bill year and that's an issue that's incredibly important to me South Dakota our agriculture is our number one industry in South Dakota and so as we get into the farm bill debate this year I'm going to be very focused on making sure that we have a farm bill in place that is good for American Agriculture and good for American consumers and that really starts with making sure that consumers know where their food is coming from where it originated one of the things I hear from folks across South Dakota is the importance of that all our food products but in particular beef knowing its origin and if you think about you know the beef that you buy in the supermarket today at the grocery store today in many cases the only thing American about it may be the plastic that it's wrapped in if that and so I've introduced now the again the American beef labeling system which would require mandatory country of origin labeling for beef so that the American Consumer will know where their beef is coming from and I hope to have that included in the next farm bill and I hope that the president in his State of the Union speech this week takes a a hard look and talks about those things that are that he intends to do to make life easier not harder and less expensive not more expensive for the American people who for now for the past two years have been experiencing the very harmful impacts of his inflationary policies

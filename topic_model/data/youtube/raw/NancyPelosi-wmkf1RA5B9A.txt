i thank the gentleman for calling the special order congress has adjourned for the thanksgiving holiday but i thank you for staying so that we can acknowledge and observe the 50th anniversary of a great loss for our country my colleague mr larson you spoke so beautifully about what happened on november 22nd 50 years ago how your mother reacted and the rest and you could have been speaking for every family in america certainly uh we took special ownership of president kennedy as the first catholic president but everyone who enjoys firsts understands that that what that pioneer action that courage that success that he had was not just about him being the first catholic president but america embracing our country more fully the people of our country more fully yes mr speaker mr larson 50 years ago tragedy struck the heart of a nation in dallas texas 50 years ago president kennedy was taken from us suddenly and unexpectedly and the entire nation was shaken and was out and mourned as you said we don't want to dwell on that sad day we want to spring from it to talk about what went before and what has come from the legacy of president john f kennedy today 50 years later we rise on the floor of the house to pay tribute to him as a leader on the anniversary of a tragedy but on a focus with a focus on many victories here in this chamber president kennedy served can you imagine i take great pride in the fact all of us do who serve here that president kennedy began his federal service in office in the house of representatives his grandfather honey fritz honey fitz also served in the house his grand nephews served in the house so it has been a kennedy family tradition to serve in the house of representatives he did so as a proud member of the massachusetts delegation i honor witness to uh i rise to honor the life and legacy inspiration and achievements i rise uh to um salute an extraordinary leader for our country and the world i feel emotional about it listening uh to mr larson describe the events of the day and the and the weekend that followed the beautiful family dignity that mrs kennedy and the children demonstrated had made a mark on our hearts were so pleased that as the president said last night as we're here caroline is drawing crowds in tokyo as a student i had the privilege of being there when president kennedy was inaugurated i had the privilege of meeting him as a student in high school in baltimore maryland when my father was mayor spent an evening as a because my mother couldn't attend a dinner well she said she couldn't attend but it enabled me to attend in her place as the first lady of baltimore so i had the privilege of sitting within senator kennedy and to be dazzled by his presentation to united nations association of maryland dinner honoring jacob blaustein a leader in our community my father was mayor and i was very lucky so and then and on other occasions during the course of his campaign i had the privilege of of being in the uh in service to that campaign in terms of one time we had a show called president senator kennedy answers your questions and i was one of the people i was in college at the time of answering the phone and hearing the questions all the questions were about uh seniors and and health at the time it was just before medicare and it became a it was an important issue present but any event on that happy day in january 20th 1961 i had the privilege of being there in the freezing cold to hear the president's inaugural address his stirring address still echoes in the hearts of those who were there and all others who heard his call to serve he appealed to the energy the faith and devotion that will light our country and all who serve it and the glow from that fire can truly light the world what inspiring words perhaps the most significant of all he be ushered in a new era with a simple yet powerful call to start anew declaring let us begin let us begin so we began to answer the call to carry forward the torch to ask what we could do for our country and we began to get america moving again and we began an era that would recast america's future that would set us on course to address so many of the challenges facing us 50 years ago and still confronting our nation today as i reference his ask not what we could do for our country everybody knows that that was an important part of the president's call to action in that day the citizens of america ask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country it's memorized by students all over the world when he delivered it it was so stirring but what i remember is the next the very next sentence in the very next sentence he says to the citizens of the world ask not what america can do for you but what we can do working together for the for mankind for and it was just so beautiful and so that no wonder one of his first actions would be to establish the peace corps a renewed beginning witnessing the creation of the peace corps a group of americans serving as ambassadors of goodwill worldwide and to this day then it was started under the leadership of sergeant treiber's brother-in-law to this day each peace corps volunteer is a tribute to president kennedy i renew a few weeks ago i had the privilege of being in massachusetts under the auspices of the kennedy library where we had observed the 50th anniversary of the president signing the equal pay act into law legislation he called a first step to end the unconscionable practice of unequal pay on this agenda that the president had imagined equal pay for equal work for women in the workplace also established a commission on the status of women headed by eleanor roosevelt and its recommendations were raise the minimum wage equal pay for equal work child care as an initiative both public and with tax credits so forward thinking so much of it still left to be done 50 years later but part of the vision and again with great women like eleanor roosevelt and esther peterson and others there with with him as he signed the bill today as i mentioned that battle continues and if president kennedy were here he certainly beckoned us to do more to take the next step which we have done and that when women succeed america succeeds legislation to have respect for women's pay uh women's work in the workplace raise the minimum wage 62 percent of women 62 percent of people get the minimum wage are women equal pay for equal work paid health health paid sick leave and child care which is important part of president obama's agenda the fight for equality whether in the workplace that president kennedy had become the first president to call civil rights above all issue mr speaker he said to remind us it was time long time passed to keep the promise of freedom and so he put forward a civil rights bill to right the wrongs of history and in his name in the wake of his death in the years that followed under the leadership of president lyndon johnson the congress passed the civil rights act and the voting rights act yet still today the march to civil rights is not finished completely and as in the time of president remains our immoral obligation to preserve expand and strengthen voting rights that is our challenge now in the house um any equality so let us begin so many other things that we witnessed it's hard for people to imagine now how impossible it sounded when the president said that that new beginning that bold action and exploration a commitment and a promise to be the first to honor he said if we are to honor the vows of our founders we must be first and therefore we intend to be first uh it was a commitment and a promise to invest in science and innovation and when he said that we would send a man to the moon and be back safely in 10 years it seemed impossible but it happened even in a shorter period of time he laid out his vision to do what was hard and unthinkable but by the close of the 1960s as we know two american men walked on the moon and returned safely home so many other people were part of that success uh our beginning ignited the fires of all kinds of innovation that our country has been at front from even though he wasn't there to see all the legislation through he had his vision and he was an inspiration for others to get the job done one thing i want to because sometimes we all quote president kennedy because he's so quotable and he was so wise and and what he said uh resonates and is timeless so um i when they we had the i had the privilege of speaking at the groundbreaking of the institute of peace i quoted what senator the president kennedy said at the american university in 1963. he said the united states as the world knows will never start a war we do not want a war we do not now expect a war that this generation americans has already had enough more than enough of war and hate and oppression he went on to say we shall be prepared if others wish it we shall be alert to try to stop it but we shall also do our part to build a world of peace where the weak are safe and the strong are just so remarkable so remarkable again would take hours for us to uh truly mention all of the accomplishments the moonshot all the things about the test ban treaty the list goes on and on but the fact is a person came into the life of america from a family which is hard to imagine any other family in america that has had or to name any other family in america that has made as great a contribution to the well-being of our country than the kennedy family starting before even with rose kennedy's father honey fitz but then coming through to even now service in the congress of of joe kennedy uh a grand nephew of the president and we had the privilege here of serving with patrick kennedy so i was thought and where i began and taking pride in the fact of the president kennedy's association with this house of representatives uh this people's house and to say that uh i'm so happy that i have had the opportunity uh to see him on so many times and i'll disclose with one we're at the convention in los angeles i was with my parents we went to a restaurant after the president's speech at the stadium the first time a president had accepted the nomination at a stadium tens of thousands of people there speech was fabulous and great and we went to this restaurant called romanovs which i said to my father and mother i wanted to go to a los angeles type restaurant what turned out to be los angeles type in that it was very expensive more expensive for shrimp cocktail than it would have been in baltimore maryland where we were from and so my father said he's always why did you find this place this is the most expensive restaurant i've ever been in i said that's probably true but it's an experience and everything it costs so much more for shrimp cocktail here than in baltimore maryland and it goes on and on well in another few minutes the doors open to the restaurant in comes president kennedy from the speech from the speech came right over the table tommy my father thomas alessandra tommy how did you like my speech of course my father told him that he asked me how i liked his speech imagine that and then he went on to with his entourage uh to have his uh a celebratory dinner well after that price was no object the cost of the restaurant went made it just the prices kept coming down in my father's view so again we were i was lucky many different times to have the opportunity to have uh some conversation uh with the president and so when that horrible thing happened that day for our country everybody took it very personally and perhaps part of his legacy is the sacrifice that he made for our country the inspiration that was intensified by that sacrifice and may we always when we always always remember it and may we always remember what he said the light from that fire shall truly light the world the glow from that fire can truly light the world may god bless the memory of president john f kennedy his family may we draw strength from his legacy and his vision may god always bless the country he loved and led the united states of america and all who serve it with that mr speaker i again thank mr larson for calling the special order i'm honored to be here with him and with our distinguished wit mr hoyer i yield that you

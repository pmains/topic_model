uh colorado uh congressman jason crowe joining you uh this afternoon for the next installment of our virtual job training webinar series uh as many of you know who have joined us with uh from prior training sessions over the last few weeks we're doing things a little bit differently this year last year we held the first ever congressional district 6 job fair we actually had over a thousand job seekers and over 60 employers all come together under one roof to interview folks give them new jobs and help take them take their careers and their families to the next level it was a great success and we were planning to do it again this year but as we all know unfortunately the pandemic is preventing us from doing it the same way but we wanted to provide that same service uh to the uh cd6 community and we wanted to try to make sure we're meeting the the great need that our community faces now as thousands of people find themselves laid off or furloughed uh and unemployed uh during this economic and health crisis so we put together this virtual series to help job seekers get the trainings that they need the transition to new careers or to seek jobs within the same industry uh and also help connect uh with job uh employers uh with job seekers as well so i'm really excited about tonight's uh training we have lauren brown joining us this evening from the mikasa resource center and lauren's going to be providing a really important training about professional email because we find ourselves communicating more and more virtually whether that's over zoom or facetime or email and you know that first impression that you make that first encounter with somebody is oftentimes over email so what do you need to know how do you need to communicate to go to that next step in the job interview process and we're really excited but before i kick it over to lauren to get to the training that is going to be so valuable tonight i wanted to say a quick word about what we're doing in washington to address the economic stimulus right now so last friday the unemployment insurance program expired uh and uh millions of americans who rely on this program to pay their rent uh their mortgage utility bills are to buy food now don't have it so we are working really hard to try to get that uh expanded and continued uh in some form uh so we actually about two months ago over two months ago now the house passed the heroes act that had an extension of that program and so many other really important programs from uh ppp loans to additional support for businesses to additional support for cities and counties to expanded testing to vote by mail to all sorts of things that we need to get ourselves through the economic and health crisis we passed that bill over two months ago now it's time for the senate to pass their bill so that we can negotiate a compromise that's good for the country it moves us to forward and protects uh the people of our community so we're putting pressure on the senate the act they have to pass a bill they have to pass it quick because we need to get these benefits back to the american people so that's what i'm here in dc working on this week so uh now with no further ado i'm proud to introduce lauren brown who's going to work it through uh this next virtual training uh so that we know uh how to formulate emails and communicate people effectively and i think lauren this is a training that everyone in congress needs as well because so often there are misunderstandings uh with email communication and it's important that you do it the right way so thanks uh for joining us lauren and thank you to all of you at home for joining this next installment and we hope to see you in the next one yeah thank you for having me thank you lauren

covid19 pandemic figuring out how to offer our services online we do our career coaching our business consulting all of it is available online and via zoom so we would love to be in touch with with each of you um so our webinar agenda today we're really going to look at four things how to set yourself up set yourself up for success unlocking subject lines that is our invitation to open and is so important to writing an email we're going to talk about how to build the your email and then how to get out your magnifying glass and how to make sure that you proofread your work for success so as you think about setting yourself up for success it's important to remember what email is email is a great way it's a quick way to communicate an idea or ask a question so as you are a job seeker and you're thinking about applying for new jobs email is a great way to communicate to ask questions to learn more email is also an incredibly important part of workplace success in 2020 whether you like it or not you need to know how to do email and utilize your email in a strong and professional manner so you can be successful i think it's also really really important to remember what email is not and this is where i think we can sometimes get ourselves into trouble when we use email for the things that it is not email is not an immediate way to get a response so i think what you don't want to use email for is to ask someone a question that needs an immediate response email's never a replacement for an in-person conversation so if you need to have a phone call or a video conference of course right now in person conversations are much different but it is not a replacement for those things the things that need to be communicated either face to face or via phone or via a video conference email shouldn't replace that an email isn't a place to communicate sensitive information or to have a difficult conversation so it's important when you think about your email to always check your purpose before you send an email you need to ask yourself is this the best way to communicate this information sending an email might not be the best way having setting up a video conference setting up a phone call maybe serves your purpose is better and this is an important one as people we're also a little bit like babies you need to ask yourself are you angry are you tired are you hungry are there things getting in the way of you sending a professional email the worst time to send a professional email is when you're hungry tired and angry right you're gonna say something or email something that you might regret so i think it's incredibly important to check in with yourself to find out you know what's really going on in the moment um you can always ask um for an email you can always send an email to ask for a meeting maybe to ask for that face-to-face conversation uh or a video conference or a phone call knowing that the bulk of what you want to talk about and the bulk of the issue is going to happen in that other context you don't want to send something that you're going to regret and hard and negative feedback is already hard and difficult to communicate so don't don't shoot yourself in the foot by sending it via email always give yourself enough time to write email it can be tempting to sit in front of your computer and try to compose something really quickly and check it off of your to-do list but a strong professional email takes time so make sure you give yourself enough time if you're emailing a hiring manager a human resources manager to ask about a job don't do it as you're sitting outside waiting for school pickup it takes time make sure that you give yourself enough space to write the email that makes you and paints you in the very best light one thing that cannot be overstated is to make sure that you have a professional email address if you're currently a job seeker and you don't have a professional email address set one up today um an example cutie girl 14 it's not professional and we don't want to be applying for jobs and positions with an unprofessional email address um something like tconners4 gmail.com would be considered a lot more professional and i think it's also important oops uh it's also important to make sure that your name that you set up with your email address um matches the name that you're submitting in your materials so if you are submitting for a job for example if i had an email address that said that it needs to match lauren brown with my email address um 76 of resumes with unprofessional email addresses are rejected by hiring managers right away so this is not a mistake that should be made make sure that you have a professional email address to set yourself up for success and give yourself the best chance to get past that uh that initial screening of a hiring manager i also want to talk about unlocking subject lines this is really our invitation to open and so we want to make sure that we put our very best foot forward um every single email you send needs a subject line don't ever send an email without a subject line um so i want you just to think um very briefly about if you were to receive an email um and the email said in the subject line hi is that an invitation to open it may be but in the context of a professional email you want to make sure you spend time to get the right subject line because if they don't open your email it really doesn't matter you could have the best professional email but if somebody doesn't open it and get to read it it really doesn't matter the average person who works in an office environment receives 121 emails per day so you want to make sure that your message is read hiring managers hr managers they are getting even more email than that so make sure that you're sending them um an email that they're going to click into the subject line is the title of your email so we want to invite the person to open your email it's a nice opportunity to give them an idea of what the email is about i often write my subject lines after i'm done with my email um you can do it personal preference um maybe it's better for you to write the subject line and then write your email so you stay on topic but i like to write my subject line after i've composed the email so i can write the strongest subject line possible that encapsulates what i've covered in my email here are some examples march 3rd meeting notes executive assistant application martin smith if i'm the hiring manager and i get that executive assistant application and i see martin smith's name i know exactly who sent me the email and what it's regarding some do's and don'ts on writing a strong subject line we want to keep it short and sweet we want to signal to what's inside there's lots of you know spam click bait email marketing where they are going to write some you know maybe maybe provocative subject line to get you to open it and what's inside the email has nothing to do with the subject line that might be good for spam that might be good for email marketing but that's not good for a professional context your email subject needs to signal what's inside your email and make sure that you're consistent with capitalizing letters there's two examples here neither one is better than the other but it needs to be consistent so if you say coffee meeting fall internship and everything's capitalized make sure that that's consistent across the email subject just like the second one the first letter is capitalized because it's the beginning the rest or lower case it's got to be consistent what you never want to do is to use all caps or too many in a professional context all capitals should be used never or almost never you never want to come across as screaming or demanding please don't be too general in a subject line email um meeting question mark question those don't give the the reader the person receiving the email any indication of what that email is about um include the question in the subject line if you are writing to an hr manager the question are you hiring that's something that you would want to include in the body of your email it shouldn't be your subject line and then this is important to leave off a subject entirely you don't want to send an email that comes through with no subject um you missed an opportunity to show what's inside your email and encourage your reader to to open it it also shows that this was something that was hurried that you didn't spend time working on um so this is a little subject line practice that you can do for yourself at home if you have a sheet of paper or want to mark you know take down some notes please do that so here's a potential email good afternoon matthew i found your poetry at the southlands farmer's market and immediately loved it you're clearly a very talented artist i'm collecting donations for the community center fundraiser would you be interested in donating two pieces for us to auction off all proceeds from the fundraiser will go towards the community center's mission of providing a safe place for young people to get homework help please let me know if you're interested or if you know of other artists who would like to get involved all the best alice walkerson so i want you to just jot down maybe on a piece of paper even just in your mind what do you think would be a strong subject line for alice's email some of the ones that i came up with were community center fundraiser interest community center fundraiser request pottery donation request make sure that you get to your inviting matthew to support your community center but just cut to the chase um you know i think that there can be the temptation when we're asking people for things when we're trying to get something from someone um even in a positive way um maybe that we want to couch it uh in uh pleasantries but make sure to just come right out pottery donation request is is my favorite of the three that i came up with because i think it gets right to the heart of the matter of what you are hoping for from michael or matthew pardon me um let's move into talking about building the body of your email um so we're gonna use the same example email from alice to matthew and every professional email should have these three things a greeting an introduction a body and a conclusion and signature again sometimes in the interest of time it can we can forget about one of these options one of these things reading an introduction body conclusion and signature um but the greeting needs to fit the audience um so you should also be mindful of um using the role of the person for example if i was going to email um representative crow i wouldn't send an email that said hey jason that would be too casual and it wouldn't um project the professionalism that i was hoping to um you don't need to be uh over formal uh we don't want to be be too formal but you should always be respectful and should depend on the role as you move into the body of the email consider using line breaks and paragraphs to make things more clear and we want to use traditional writing skills sentences and punctuation make sure that you pay attention to the flow of your email and write out deadlines if you have them um so you'll see here um you know there's a nice introduction that says i found your pottery i'm impressed with you moving into the ask and then conclusion and signature um so we're going to go a little bit deeper with greetings and introductions um strong greetings good morning good afternoon dear hello we don't want to keep our greetings informal things like hey um what's up things like that um are not appropriate in professional email and then an opening sentence or two it was nice to run into you i hope you were doing well i think we have all been affected so much by the pandemic um i've noticed that in my emails to folks in my greetings i hope that you're healthy i hope that you and your family are safe and healthy just to show folks that you're thinking of them that you want them to be doing well and then moving pretty quickly into the introduction and the purpose of the email i'm emailing in regard to our conversation yesterday we want to get down to business and part of professional communication is that we leave room for pleasantries but we also move to the heart of the matter pretty quickly we never want to be demanding or rude we still use please thank you but we also don't want to go overboard and come across as saccharin or too sweet moving into the body of the email this is where the bulk of the information should be make sure that you ensure that the information is listed in a clear and concise manner if there's suggested meeting times that you are available if there's something specific that you're asking your colleague to do um and consider adding other contact information um if you're job seeking um it never hurts to clarify that they have your phone number so they can get in touch with you quickly and be sure to use traditional writing skills we always want to use complete sentences and correct punctuation again write out those deadlines if you have them can you give me feedback on the presentation by tuesday afternoon email can be particularly hard to read emotion or expectation so it's important to be really specific and clear with folks when you need their help watch out for hedging so this is something that i think everyone can be guilty of is using qualifying phrases or words to soften our statements um we do of course always want to be mindful of the tone but you'll see here some common hedging phrases i feel like it would be great if just basically um we're going to do a little practice on rewriting hedging sentences and thinking about rewriting hedging sentences is going to help us get more to the point and have more direct and professional communication i think it would be great if we discussed the project you can think about how you might put that into your own words i changed it to we should discuss the project we don't need to beat around the bush we need to have a conversation and discuss the project i feel like you would be a good reference for me would you please be a reference for me you're asking the person you need a good reference would you please be a reference for me it's much more direct you're clearly communicating what you need basically i am just looking for professional connection in the tech industry i'm looking for a professional connection in the tech industry no need to put the word basically in there um just cut it out altogether no need to put the word just in there cut it out all together you're looking for a professional connection just come right out and say it so hopefully you can see the fun gif what we want to do always is just wrap it up wrap it up with your action steps if you have suggested meeting times if you're delegating tasks and make sure that you always conclude with a signature don't send an email before you have put a signature in and consider adding your other contact information i've added here some email sign off ideas you of course can use your own and personalize it but i think it's important to remember to not be too casual in this part thanks thank you best take care cheers best wishes have a wonderful day have a wonderful weekend avoid love xoxo that would certainly not be professional in the uh context of uh a work environment or a job-seeking environment um a little dash in your name um respectfully you want to be respectful all the time um sent from my iphone some of these things are generated automatically by our phone in professional email um take them off um or nothing um you know sometimes in the interest of time somebody shoots off an email and they don't put any sort of sign off or signature in there um follow-up i think that this is really important um make sure that you follow up um 24 to 48 hours business hours for following up different uh different companies can have different expectations for how quickly you respond to email so take this advice with a grain of salt if you have an employer that expects you to follow up more more quickly do know that but i think email is not like texting a friend um you can reply quickly if you're able but it's you're not expected to respond within minutes um nor should you take three four five days to respond to someone's email um you can check to see if you haven't received a re a response in a reasonable time people miss emails and it's okay to send something back a few days later but i think it's really important to remember email is not something that people sit and check all the time and if you haven't received your response in a reasonable amount of time um an hour is not a reasonable amount of time it may be a few days or a week and respond to the email that you receive in a prompt manner i think that this can also be something if you have a new job or a new job seeker directly asking um you know your boss or your manager your supervisor you know i like to respond to emails within 24 to 48 hours what's your expectation of me um i think that that's also something that can be very helpful um it is totally appropriate and okay to check in if you haven't received a response in a reasonable amount of time let's move to get out your magnifying glass proofreading this is incredibly important and sometimes you need to bring in friends family or other colleagues to help proofread your work so check for spelling errors you don't want to send out professional emails that have spelling errors particularly pay close attention to the name of the person the email is going to um my name is lauren and i receive lots of uh emails from folks that says laura sometimes it's simply an autocorrect issue but make sure that you pay attention to who the person is going to be receiving your email that their name is spelled correctly and that there are no other that there are no spelling errors in your email um ensure that you have complete sentences um if your email is full of phrases or just simple bullet points maybe you need to stop take your time and come back to the email when you can really get your thoughts down in full and complete sentences check attachments i think that i know that i've been guilty of this is i send an email i say please see the attached documents and then i forget to send an attachment that's because i'm doing it too quickly and i'm moving in a hurry be sure to check attachments there are some services or some technology solutions to that now um gmail will sometimes prompt you to did you forget to attach something there's also that feature on outlook so be sure to enable that feature if you have it as an option but always proofread your email to make sure that you've attached the option or put the attachment in this one is incredibly important only send emails that you would be okay if someone else saw this if you are writing an email you need to remember that people can forward your email they can screenshot your email they can share your email so it's very important to remember that email is not a private uh communication tool um and in theory um while this probably doesn't happen often if you're emailing at work your company can see your emails and are the owner of your workplace communication so make sure that you're not emailing things that wouldn't be okay if other people saw um always check your tone before you send an email this goes back to that being angry hungry tired right tone and writing is the attitude that your writing conveys it's about the words and the meaning behind your writing um in speaking when we're speaking to folks we can often read their facial expressions their body language those non-verbal cues we can understand the context in which things are said we don't have this in email so consider the words that you are using here's two things that you might have to write in an e in a work email or a professional email you have to ship the item back before it will refund your money that's true you're not going to get your money back until the company receives the item but there's a friendlier kinder more professional way to say this once we receive your item we'll be happy to refund your money remember that humor and sarcasm are hard to read um and in general don't use emojis in professional email um it can be tempting to sometimes put in a smiley face and there's no no no need for it in professional communication you can leave that to your personal communication with friends and family make sure you seek balance with tone i think that this is important just like we said humor and sarcasm can be hard to read we never want to be too informal can you meet tomorrow hope so and a ton of exclamation points that's way too informal for professional communication um using something like gr8 to say great with emojis while it certainly communicates what you want it to say it's not done in a professional manner and then call me that's very short it's not clear we don't know what the person wants um we would definitely you know i hate to say that this i hate i hate to admit it it happens um but we also never want to see swearing um or derogatory language and email things that sound aggressive um you know call me right now there's a very a much more professional way to say this we also don't want to be too formal it is with great pleasure that i reach out to you and hope that this email finds you and your family in good health that's the other side of the spectrum you don't want to sound like a robot we shall revisit the deadline in the future and you don't need to use language that's unnatural to you either right in a way that captures your voice who you are it would be really strange to interact with someone over email and then talk to them on the phone or over zoom or face to face and find out that the way that they speak is completely and totally different so on your screen you'll see an email proofread this email and jot down some of the issues that you see with it morgan it was so nice to meet you at the networking event on thursday hearing about your company it would be awesome to chat with you about how you got into the role you have and learn more about the industry as a whole do you think that you would maybe possibly have just a little bit of time in the coming weeks to meet up i'd be happy to swing by your offices or grab coffee whatever it's most convenient for you love max so this is a little bit of an exaggeration potentially on some of the errors that we've just discussed but i've highlighted here um some of the issues that we see with this email um morgan exclamation point uh sounds like you're shouting morgan's name um something like dear morgan hello morgan with a comma is going to be much much nicer you need to spell out you it was so nice to meet you we shouldn't use those informalities that come from texting in our emails no need here for the second exclamation point or any of the emojis um the sentence hearing about your company is not a sentence um make it into a complete sentence it was a pleasure to hear about your company it was a pleasure to learn more about your role and your company um i enjoyed learning about hearing about your company the next section do you think that you would maybe possibly have just a little bit of time in the coming weeks to meet up there's a lot of qualifiers and hedging in there would maybe possibly get straight to the point let's meet up in the next couple of weeks what are some times that work for you um i'd be happy to swing by your offices um happy is misspelled and then love in a professional context is certainly too informal so this next slide the sample email is the email rewritten into that professional format it was so nice to meet you i loved hearing about what you do within your company it would be great to chat about how you got into the role you have and learn more about the industry as a whole do you have a bit of time in the coming weeks to meet up it's okay to hedge a little bit you're not asking for hours of morgan's time do you have a bit of time i'd be happy to swing by your offices or grab coffee whatever's most convenient for you best max morgan and max had a great connection at the networking event so it doesn't have to be too formal great so i think i see some folks who are adding some questions uh to the chat or to the q a um i did want to share this slide with me casa's services on here specifically there's two that i want to highlight we have career coaching that is happens one on one it's via appointment so you have to have an appointment to attend right now we're offering that by phone or video conference we hope to add some in-person socially distanced coaching soon at our at our building in southwest denver but i think we would love to meet one-on-one with any and all of you our career coach has a wide variety of employer contacts no matter your skills or experience and then i did want to highlight our financial services training we do this in the hybrid and online format i would be happy to answer stay on and answer questions about any of these um but javier martinez is the is the person to call his email address and his phone number are listed here he can get you set up with a career coaching appointment he can share more with you about the financial services training those are for roles in banks and credit unions folks who have a background in customer service cash handling retail they're all great fits for jobs in banks and credit unions and banks and credit unions are hiring so it's a good industry to jump into right now so uh again please make sure to note javier's contact information there and i'm going to start i'll leave up the the contact information slide and answer some questions here so i have a question from peg i read that i should not use exclamation points in email is one exclamation point at the end of sentences wrong what about at the end of several sentences in my email to convey my excitement peg i definitely think that it is okay to use exclamation points sparingly in emails um it's definitely not something to go bonkers with um and i think that um you know i always re-read my emails and if i have more than two exclamation points i know that i'm going a little i'm going a little crazy so um i my personal rule is no more than two i am a person who gets excited so i want to share that excitement but i think it's important to not uh put multiple exclamation points and really limit the number of times that we use them that is for me something i often have to go back and edit because i'll use a lot of exclamation points when periods will do just fine what else are there other questions thoughts ideas that folks have great um it looks like we've got another question um so um someone asks here that they have a new job um and they have their employer makes all of the emails uh the same way so for example like my email um is we do the semi casa my name is lauren brown so it's l brown at me casa resource center dot org um and this person uh their name uh makes a silly word um so they're asking should they ask their employer to change kind of the the format that they use because it follows company pattern um or should they you know just just go along with the company norm so i uh it looks like the person's name is sandy um so i would say sandy it's really up to you i think that it's um you know on one hand it maybe will make your email address uh easy for folks to remember um but i also would also say that if it's something that makes you uncomfortable or something that doesn't work it's also would be okay to just check in with the company and ask them hey you know i this is my new email address are you guys okay with this um because i think you know it's important for them to know um where you're coming from but i would say if you're okay with it um i if you're okay with it i think it doesn't say anything negative about you since it's clearly not an email address that you chose now if you took that you know kind of silly email address and took it to uh gmail um i i would give you different advice but i think since it's given to you by your company i think that that's okay um i i'm i'm navigating through these um the question and answer so i hope uh if i if i skip something for someone uh please feel free to ask it again i've got another question here that says i just want to ask a quick question from my boss why do i have to do all the extra stuff like an intro signature etc i think that it is important for us to realize as employees is that there are professional norms and there are ways in which we can dislike some professional norms but there's also ways in which we just play by the rules of the game i think you know maybe in your personal life the professional communication norms that we've talked about today would feel really funny and they're certainly not the way that you need to communicate with your friends and family but at work i think it is so important that we follow those professional norms um and things like an intro telling someone hello um you know i hope this email finds you well i hope you're doing well those are to communicate care and appreciation compassion acknowledgement uh and those are all positive things with positive intent i also think you know uh for example at mikasa um we have a email signature and the expectation um from you know the highest level of our organization is that we include that email signature that for me in my personal life would be something that would feel really funny um but at work it's what i'm expected to do and it's one way in which i show that i'm a committed employee and a strong team player um i think that at work we we do always want to convey that right we want to convey those positive things that we bring to our team and the positive things that we bring to our company um so another question looks like from cheryl says in an intro email to a potential employer do i ask for follow-up do i tell them that i will follow up or is that considered annoying cheryl i think that in an intro email to a potential employer it is um totally okay to ask for follow-up i would recommend you know you don't want to come across as kind of overbearing or uh to you know demanding but i think it's totally okay to ask questions like you know i'd love to learn more about your timeline for hiring um things like that getting more information is only going to help you be a stronger candidate the best candidates are ones that know the organization who have learned about the organization and can show the organization how they're going to fit in well so i think it's appropriate um you know to to gently ask for follow-up um and i would say you know if you send in an email about a job and you don't hear anything back from anyone you don't get an acknowledgement that your application was received it's totally appropriate to send another email and follow up and see where you are in the process if there's any information that they need from you to ensure that you know that application goes to to the top lots of companies use applicant tracking systems and sometimes simple errors can get you kicked out of in an applicant tracking system so i think it's always a positive thing to follow up can i use fonts another person asks can i use fonts and colors in a professional email the first thing that i would do is make sure that your that your organization or your company doesn't have a style guide or a recommendation for that so lots of organizations have fonts and colors that they prefer people to communicate in i know at our organization we ask that people send emails in a certain font and then in black uh in their initial email and then in the like default outlook color which is a sort of a dark blue um so we don't have an option um i think that it's important to not personalize too much using kind of fun fonts cursive fonts or fun colors that might feel like a fun way for you to express your personality but it doesn't translate well unfortunately in professional email and it's important for us to not undermine our awesome professionalism by using a font and color when should i use reply versus reply all in a big group email this question is a tough one this is something that i think get can get people frustrated i personally think that it is really important to reply all when you're sharing information um one of the things you don't want to do is hit reply only to the person and it's information that the entire group needed i also think that when you write an email it can be very helpful to give people direct instructions on whether you want them to reply or reply all often times when i send an email to my team and i need a response on something i will tell them i need a response on this please reply to only me um and i will be very direct and very clear with them about what i need so also feel free to do that that when you are writing an email to a group and you don't need people to reply all it's okay to tell them that i would also say it's going to depend sometimes on the culture of your company and your organization there are some companies that do not want you to reply all and that's something when you're a new employee those are questions that are good to ask your supervisor you know tell me about the communication norms here at you know this company you know do you have any advice for me as i learn to communicate in this new office culture um i think it is important to use reply all sparingly you don't want to clog people's inboxes with information that they don't need but you also want to be thoughtful i will often take people off an email um and say you know i'm moving you off of this email because the information no longer applies and i think that that succinct and direct communication is important um another person asked in the chat is there a professional etiquette about forwarding emails that would be another one that i would defer to some of the company culture or the organizational culture i think the important thing to remember about the professional etiquette with forwarding emails is that the emails that you send are not private now you certainly as the recipient of an email you don't want to forward an email to gossip to perpetuate a negative office culture or to get someone in trouble now you should always follow the procedures and protocols of the organization or company that you're in if you get an email that is inappropriate or that needs to be brought to someone above you's attention um but i think you know if you are forwarding the email make sure that you do a gut check with yourself about why um i've got another question here uh sometimes clients send me emails all night long with lots of questions should i respond to them in one big email in the morning or individually to each email and send them five or six emails in a row i think that you should send them one email i think that you can model professional expectations for your clients and maybe do some uh some of the things that we've learned here today um teach back to them um if they are thinking of questions for you all night long um maybe they can have a draft with questions for you and they send you one email but i think modeling that behavior back is great to say i got your five emails i've compiled all of the questions you have here in one i'm going to go through and answer your questions you know and then if it's appropriate in the context you know i'm not sure the nature of your relationship um but if it's appropriate say hey i have an idea you know it would help me serve you more effectively to get one email with all your questions what do you think about this um of course that that may or may not be appropriate but i think it's totally appropriate to send them one big email with all of their questions that's going to make their life easier too to determine the response um other questions uh thoughts ideas okay great well that is that is everything that i have um i have included my email address here as i mentioned our company uh sets it up this way l brown at mecasaresourcecenter.org

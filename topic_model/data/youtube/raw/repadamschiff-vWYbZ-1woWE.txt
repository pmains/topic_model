EYEWITNESS NEWS. MARC: THANK YOU. LOCAL CONGRESSMAN ADAM SCHIFF LED TODAY'S HEARING ON THE ATTACK ON THE CAPITOL. HE JOINS US NOW LIVE FROM WASHINGTON, D.C. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. WE HEARD EMOTIONAL TESTIMONY TODAY ABOUT THE PRESSURE CAMPAIGN TARGETING STATE OFFICIALS TO TRY AND GET THEM TO REJECT THE RESULTS OF THE 2020 ELECTION. WHY IS THAT AN IMPORTANT PART OF THIS INVESTIGATION, AND DO YOU THINK, BASED ON WHAT YOU'VE SEEN AS A FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR, IS THERE CRIMINALITY HERE? >> I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO SHOW THE COUNTRY THAT DONALD TRUMP PUT ENORMOUS PRESSURE ON THESE STATE ELECTION WORKERS, KNOWING WHAT HE WAS TELLING THE COUNTRY WAS A BIG LIE, AND HE DIDN'T CARE. THESE COURAGEOUS OFFICIALS, MANY OF THEM REPUBLICAN, TOLD HIM THEY WOULD NOT INVALIDATE THE RESULTS -- THEIR OATH OF OFFICE. BUT THE COUNTRY GOT TO SEE HOW HE BROUGHT THE FULL WEIGHT OF THAT OFFICE DOWN ON PEOPLE, INCLUDING LOCAL ELECTIONS WORKERS, AND REALLY DESTROY THEIR LIVES. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE COUNTRY TO UNDERSTAND THIS WAS ALL DELIBERATE. THIS WAS KNOWING. THE PRESIDENT WAS TOLD BY HIS OWN ATTORNEY GENERAL THAT WHAT HE WAS SAYING WAS, I WON'T USE THE EXPLETIVE THE BILL BARR USED, BUT UTTER NONSENSE. AND THE COUNTRY GOT TO SEE, I THINK, THE HUMAN TOLL OF WHAT DONALD TRUMP DID. MARC: DELIBERATE, KNOWING, WAS IT CRIMINAL? >> THERE IS CERTAINLY SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO INVESTIGATE. A FEDERAL JUDGE, DAVID CARTER OF CALIFORNIA, HAS WRITTEN IN A COUPLE OPINIONS THAT HE BELIEVES DONALD TRUMP AND THOSE AROUND HIM ENGAGED IN LIKELY MULTIPLE CRIMINAL ACTS. WHETHER THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WILL ULTIMATELY CONCLUDE THAT THEY CAN PROVE BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT WILL BE THERE DECISION, BUT THERE IS CERTAINLY SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO INVESTIGATE. I THINK OUR HEARING AND OTHERS HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT AMPLY. MARC: WHEN WE LOOK AT THE EFFECT , THE PERSONAL IMPACT ON SHAY MOSS AND HER MOTHER, ON HOW THEY DON'T EVEN WANT TO HAVE THEIR NAMES UTTERED IN PUBLIC, OUT OF FEAR THAT SOMEBODY MIGHT SAY OR DO SOMETHING AGAINST THEM, AND THE FACT THAT ALL OF THESE -- A LOT OF THE ELECTION WORKERS WHO WERE THERE IN FULTON COUNTY HAVE LEFT SINCE THE 2020 ELECTION. WHAT EFFECT DO YOU THINK THIS KIND OF TARGETING OF ELECTED OFFICIALS IS GOING TO HAVE ON FUTURE ELECTIONS, ON THE NEXT ELECTION? >> THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION, BECAUSE IT DIDN'T END ON JANUARY 6. THE BIG LIE THAT PROPELLED THE VIOLENCE THAT DAY, THE LIE THAT, WHENEVER YOU LOSE, SOMEHOW THE ELECTION IS RIGGED OR PLAGUED WITH FRAUD, THAT LIFE GOES ON. THAT LIE HAS BEEN USED AROUND THE COUNTRY TO INTIMIDATE OTHER ELECTIONS OFFICIALS, TO FORCE THEM OUT OF TOWN WITH DEATH THREATS. SO, WE NEED TO BE AWARE OF THIS. WE NEED TO COMBAT IT. ONE OF OUR HOPES AND THE HEARING IS, BY PUTTING OUT INFORMATION, BY SHOWING THE COUNTRY, ESSENTIALLY, HOW DONALD TRUMP DELIBERATELY LIED TO THEM AND PUT PEOPLE'S LIVES IN DANGER, THEN, HOPEFULLY, PEOPLE WILL RECOGNIZE THAT OTHERS ARE DOING THE SAME THING. THAT'S THE ONLY WAY I THINK WE CAN PROTECT OURSELVES, TO EXPOSE THE TRUTH AND CALL ON PEOPLE TO LIVE UP TO THEIR OATH OF OFFICE, AS THESE WITNESSES DID. MARC: WHAT SHOULD WE EXPECT IN THE NEXT HEARING? >> THE NEXT HEARING WILL BE ABOUT THE PRESIDENT, DONALD TRUMP'S EFFORT TO DECAPITATE THE LEADERSHIP OF THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, TO SACK ANYONE WHO DISAGREED WITH HIM AND INSTALL SOMEONE IN JEFFREY CLARK WHO WOULD SIMPLY DO HIS BIDDING IN THIS SCHEME TO GET THE VICE PRESIDENT TO ELECT OR TO RECOGNIZE THESE PHONY ELECTORS. YOU WILL HEAR HOW, MANY THREATENED TO RESIGN AT THE PRESIDENT WENT FORWARD WITH THIS SCHEME. MARC: CONGRESSMAN ADA

thank you mr chairman and thank you gentlemen for your patience and persistence these last two days i understand there's a lot of hours to be sitting before all of us and when you're tailing charlie like i am in this batting order most of the ground's been broken but i do have a couple of things but first i've been i was kind of puzzled hearing general mackenzie's uh characterization of our uh departure now out of afghanistan as being something other than a surrender you know it doesn't feel that way to me it certainly doesn't feel that way to the american public and you know 20 years ago exactly i was sitting in bahrain we were planning the initial strikes into afghanistan and at that time our marching orders were to defeat al qaeda and to ensure that afghanistan would no longer be a safe haven for terrorists and now fast forward 20 years those conditions while uh you know jeremiah you said within maybe six to 36 months the country will be ripe again potentially to be launching strikes like that or targets targeting against us it doesn't feel like um like it's anything other than the surrender but um general mckenzie you had mentioned that holding bagram was untenable under the circumstances and that the bagram option went away when you were given an end strength of 650 i understand that um i assume that you you mean that it was untenable because of the troop limitation but uh if you had not been limited would your professional military advice been to relinquish bagram so at a troop level of 2500 we would have held bagram and that would have been my recommendation that was my position okay so you had also mentioned that there was no tactical reason to hold bagram would you elaborate i assume that would mean i don't want to put words in your mouth but strategically would you see a value to us when i said there was no tactical reason to hold bagram i was specifically talking about the neo operation okay so once we went down to 650 and then we were given the orders to do to conduct a nato uh for the reasons the secretary and the chairman have already outlined the center of gravity of that was actually h kaya it's where the people are you got the mog operating capacity there to move airplanes in and out i will i will tell you this though representative we had a branch plan to seize bagram airfield should hkia have become untenable but that would have required as has already been noted a significant investment in combat power in bagram and h kaya never became untenable so we did not have to consider that plan although we had a highly detailed plan to be able to do it it simply was not necessary because we were able to maintain the throughput at h kaya and again had we gone into bagram we would have introduced significant additional us combat forces into the country and probably would have provoked another conflict with with the taliban which would have been a political decision not a military decision i understand political decision um but you know here it is since 1898 we've maintained guantanamo bay so we do have a history of keeping uh territory even in lands where we don't have friendly forces there at our side but i do know seeing already the challenge with over the horizon uh conducting our strikes over the horizon it sure would be nice to have that field uh now secretary austin um i just want to wholeheartedly agree with chairman smith's comment earlier that um we make the decisions in the world that we live in and we don't have the luxury of having the magic wand i get that and that's the the world you all face every day you told us that you would like to have seen this conflict in with a negotiated settlement general miller you did as well i know there's been a lot of talk about whether president trump should have been negotiating with the taliban or not and it's a different conversation for another day but um those those terms that were agreed to were not really complied with by the taliban and here it is you know we we know that general mill in your testimony seven of the eight conditions that were given to the taliban were broken uh in light of that failure uh secretary austin do you do you think it was wise for us to continue with the timeline or do we feel compelled because i i constantly hear the administration pushing back saying we had no choice our hands were tied the trump administration tied our hands to this timeline but the taliban didn't comply with their end of the deal and now we're kind of stuck in a bad situation do you feel that we we should have pushed a timeline not necessarily to stay in afghanistan i get it i think that there's a time for us to start negotiating an exit there but in light of how disastrous the hasty withdrawal turned out to be we could have used more time to get those folks out well quite frankly uh because of the fact that uh you know you know for a year we weren't striking the taliban they they were increasing in combat power we released 5 000 prisoners uh which kind of re-regenerated combat power for them they were they were able to make uh advances against the uh afghan security forces because you know we weren't doing things to fully support uh that again i apologize that generous time has expired that'll have to suffice

hi I'm Ben Sasse and this is my boy Breck and I have no idea how long he's gonna stay with us here but since this is about the babies let's give it a try I want to talk to you today about the assault on religious liberty currently under way in the new Obamacare regime it's a scary matter and these are scary times but first let's at least pause and express gratitude for some good news as well this year as we mark the 41st anniversary of Roe vs. Wade the years of faithfulness by the foot soldiers and the pro-life movement are finally beginning to bear some fruit by speaking for those who can't speak for themselves we have made some real progress and we are blessed that advances in medicine and technology have allowed our neighbors to see the unborn for who they really are the life inside a mother's womb is not just a blob of cells but a child created in the image of God babies we have an obligation to protect and to care for not cast aside but while the hearts of real Americans are moving one way the right way DC elites are moving the other they have imposed the Obamacare regime on our land you're gonna run off alright love ya as of January 1st Uncle Sam is now in the abortion business our federal government established precisely to secure life has now aligned itself against it for years the Hyde Amendment had kept federal cash from flowing to abortionists but now by directly financing insurance and mandating that it cover abortifacient birth control Obamacare has destroyed that Democratic protection of conscience worse religious lip employers are being forced to pay for services that they believe are immoral forced by the government the phrase Obamacare verses Sisters of the Poor Little Sisters of the Poor sounds like it should be the start of some sort of joke skit on a comedy channel but it isn't a joke it is now real life must the government make every intimate decision for us our families not competent to decide anything in these central planners Orwellian world actual infants are being cast aside but with their new mandates employers and employees alike are treated like infants and made into Ward's of the state this president has forced people who respect life to pay for the deaths of innocent children this is not a government that respects the faith of all of us who believe that even in the womb we are fearfully and wonderfully made by a loving God this is why we need more than a vote in the Senate we need a confident voice a voice of faith who shares the religious convictions that are being violated we need a champion for the unborn we need someone who speaks for the babies we need a voice that can lead the charge to repeal the birth control mandate repeal Obama cares attack on religious liberty and the entire world view that goes with it I'm Ben Sasse and I'm running for Senate for my children for breakfast all for a while and for Melissa and my other children and for your children and for their children thanks for listening and let's keep working

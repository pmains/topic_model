as we mark J Street's 10th anniversary it's important to look forward because our work is so far from being done and the challenges before us are huge it's also important to look back to celebrate and to thank the men and women who have done so much for our movement who remain with us in spirit and will continue to inspire us in the last year our movement has lost many important people who helped ensure that J Street could be born and grow to become what it is today you will see the faces of some of them on the screen in a moment they are proud to be a part of our extended J Street family and we are so grateful that they decide to devote energy and passion to building this movement the very fact that so many of you are gathered here in Washington speaking out for peace and justice for diplomacy and for eternal Jewish and human values shows that this precious legacy that they helped to build lives and breathes in the hearts and souls of each of us after all we stand on the shoulders of those who came before us the ones who planted the trees for those for us to enjoy knowing that they themselves would never see those trees reach their full maturity this is the aim of the J Street legacy of peace Society of which my husband and I are proud members like many of those whose memories we are honoring today it's a way of ensuring that the work we build we have all put into J Street will endure even after we no longer are here it's a way of investing in the future of our community our movements and the work still to be done to finally bring peace between Israelis and Palestinians when we think about the future we might be accused excuse from regarding what is yet to come with anxiety and trepidation there's nothing new about that either our parents and grandparents witnessed the Holocaust and the birth of Israel we ourselves may have memories of the Six Day War and the Yom Kippur War but now Israel faces a different existential challenge how to continue to fulfill its promise as a homeland for the Jewish people and remain a democracy that protects the rights and liberties of all people helping to secure and guarantee that next chapter in the history of Israel and the Jewish people is the great project that J Street is committed to we like Moses may not personally enter the Promised Land but if we climb the mountain gaze into the future we can all see it before us and so with deep credit gratitude and pride we honor the memories of some of these very special individuals [Music] [Music] [Applause]

hey carson malinowski thank you very much for joining us tonight i really appreciate it you uh actually introduced in congress uh in last year uh a resolution uh uh going after q anon uh what happened to you after that well it was an early warning sign i i started getting death threats and it wasn't just because i was going after q anon this is the interesting part it was because of an ad that the republican national congressional committee spent over a million dollars running against me in my race in new jersey that was basically playing to the q a on messaging the the fear of this you know sex trafficking cabal in the government which they which they amazingly found some crazy way to to link me and other candidates around the country too um q anon then picked up on that and i started getting death threats so this was an example of the republicans political arm feeding the beast that is now coming after them because actually it's my republican colleagues who are getting most of the death threats today so i mean that is the uh you know evidentiary wise kind of the smoking gun in this discussion about uh to what extent does q is q anon part of the republican party and what you're telling us is the republican party the washington republican party uh put out campaign ads against a democratic members of the house like you using q anon messaging specifically in the ads in order to turn out their vote and oh if that happened to lead to death threats for you well that's just part of doing business as a republican now yeah well i i actually confronted uh congressman tom emmer who's the head of the nrcc on the house floor after this happened and he said oh you know it's not my business what people do with our ads so they wash their hands of it and um but again it it's now coming after them because as you talk about that mob they were as angry if not more at the people they consider to be republican traders who voted to certify this election as they are at me or any other democrat uh carson jimmy gomez has introduced uh what a resolution to expel uh marjorie taylor greene from the house of representatives uh kevin mccarthy has said he will have a private conversation with her uh what should be happening in in this situation so we're gonna we're gonna have two at least century resolutions next week i'm leading one of them against congressman mo brooks of alabama who was a republican congressman who addressed the mob before they laid siege to the capitol and told them that today is the day when american patriots start taking down names and kicking ass and we can do it on the way to the capitol building so we're gonna do that and then yes there will be motions to expel uh marjorie taylor green and what's gonna happen well i think my resolution will pass fairly easily as for expulsion that's up to the republicans right because it takes two-thirds they're gonna have to tell us who they are what kind of party they are and you know i hear a lot from my republican colleagues about it's time to move on you know don't live in the past we've got to unify but you know there's again i think you pointed this out a few minutes ago they're not unifying and moving on when it comes to liz cheney or adam kinzender they're not unifying and moving on when it comes to resolutions condemning cindy mccain and primary challenges against every single republican who's had the integrity to do the right thing so you know their their message is you know when it comes to an attack on our democracy we forget about that when it comes to liz cheney and people defending our democracy they get canceled so they're gonna have to figure out this stuff i can't figure it out for them but they'll have a chance congressman tom malinowski we will be watching them face that chance next week on the house floor when you bring up that century resolution and when the expulsion resolution comes up thank you very much for joining us tonight we really appreciate it

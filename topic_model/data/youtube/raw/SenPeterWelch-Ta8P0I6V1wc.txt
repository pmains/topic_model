we're gonna strike the last word well I thank my colleague congresswoman Schakowsky you know this situation we have with Pharma is totally out of hand essentially what they're doing with these incredible price increases you know five hundred five hundred seventy-five dollars was the price one day the next day it's forty five hundred dollars they see suffering as a profit Center that's what it is they are holding hostage the suffering of American families who have loved ones that need the medication they have and what is the difference between a stick-up in what they are doing you've got somebody who needs this cancer drug you need someone who needs this this drug that's gonna save them from dying and what Pharma does is they say you want it how much you how much is in your bank account oh we've bled that dry white about a second mortgage oh by the way you still have a retirement account they want it all and that's what's happening we are the only country where the government that represents consumers and all of its citizens refuses to stand up in help against price gouging by the pharmaceutical industry it is a broken market this is not a supply-demand situation this is not what the market will bear this is what Pharma dictates we have to pay and I find the contradiction between many people who went into the pharmaceutical industry particularly our science scientists who were dedicated to using the skills they have to create products that we're gonna extend life in relief suffering their aspirations have been hijacked by the financial wizards who have one goal in one goal only and that's maximization of profit you know the head of one of our farming industries over ten years made 631 million dollars 631 million dollars so this proposal is modest and necessary we've got to stop to stick up by Pharma that is holding hostage the suffering of American families I yield back germ√°n yield back other members wishing to speak on

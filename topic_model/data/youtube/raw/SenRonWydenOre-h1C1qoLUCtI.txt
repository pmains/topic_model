here's my question for each of you it's willing to comment I think you heard senator Murkowski and I both talking about the importance of working in a bipartisan way that's what it's going to take in order to get anything done and what I'd like is to in effect assess your views on one issue and that is is there a way to a natural gas Policy where America can have it all economic growth lower emissions cheaper power and reduced trade deficits certainly or what comes to mind what would each of you recommend that the committee do in order to have it all in effect find that sweet spot where we can attain so many of these important objectives for the country why don't we start with You governor that's certainly no easy question again I come back to the the notion of regulation appropriate regulation and my own inclination obviously being in governor knowing that there are enough former governors up there is that the states are the laboratory of democracy and that we are focusing on how do we create a rigorous set of regulations that will be I mean we steal from each other every day and I think the federal government at least at Jackson and EPA has been a great partner with us in terms of trying to push us further and and and and figure out where those sweet spots are using some of the technical expertise that she has had at her disposal but I think that that's going to take a you know a certain amount of time although we which we should have our full regulatory environment together within by the end of this year and at that point we're still doing testing and measuring the air pollution issues and air quality around these large fields trying to push our large companies to do less trucking back and forth more pipeline transfers to convert more of their diesel operations to be fueled with LNG and one of the large exploration companies noble energy in Colorado they're based out of houston but they are now building their own LNG plant in Colorado so that they can sell it and run these operations and more clean faster if I can get some others in mr. liver yes mr. Chairman I mentioned the quadruple win we believe that if the American public benefits and we get the benefit of jobs from exports and domestic manufacturing America can be an energy and manufacturing superpower all you have to do is follow the current law the regulatory regime that exists which is look at the Public Interest with each application take a cautious approach our numbers suggest somewhere between five and eight bcf a day should be what we see in this first little while while in the fifth year of these great energy fines I think we also have conversations around responsible regulations we should have a con responsible supply responsible supply and making sure demand and supply don't get out of check like they did ten years ago we should not let the market call it the speculators call it Wall Street call it the financial world set the price domestically because as we all have seen with commodities like oil that price is set in the main by financial markets as much as real supply and demand so there is a way to have it all I believe very good we were just given a reprieve for 15 minutes so we're going to go to 1130 then we'll take a break mr. eisenberg thank you i think this committee is taking a very thoughtful approach to the issue i I know this is not the very that's not the first time this committees had a hearing on the issue of LNG exports I mean you did this 14 months ago you're taking a very thoughtful and cautious approach to trying to understand all the challenges if I can focus on one thing it really would be permitting in my written testimony and I'll walk through it a little bit again I talked about some of the the hoops that you really have to jump through to actually get an LNG export facility up and running so not only the deal we license is not the final hoop that they have to jump through here they have to engage in very very broad environmental review of their project led by FERC compliance with NEPA requires the developer developer acquire the land and begin design and engineering planes that takes about two years then NEPA requires the input of up to about 20 federal and state agencies including the Army Corps for dredge and fill permits which we know can can be very controversial a waterway suitability assessment from the US Coast Guard air permits from state in nepa agencies and in the usual state and local construction permits if they can somehow get through that and get a final eis then you can be sued for six years if you can somehow get through that then you have to get the long-term financing in place and get the contracts in place then when you get the contracts in place then you have to go find ten billion dollars to build the facility this is not an easy process I really recommend to take on some real legislation to try to make the permitting process work faster let's do this ms by Nicki and and for each of you understand the trade-offs because if we all just go back to our position then it's going to be hard to find the sweet spot is by Nicki senator I think that one of the key issues is gaining how you gain public confidence and I think having minimal federal standards and public disclosure of chemicals there right now they're in the 30 states in which fracking is occurring there's only chemical disclosure at 14 and those states vary considerably so in order for natural gas to provide the benefit that my colleagues on this panel have identified you have to figure out how are you going to assure the public that their health and that their well-being is protected and there need to be minimum federal standards that provide that and they don't exist now very good dr. Medlock yes um well I actually second what miss meineke just said with regard to federal standards the one place I think the federal government could actually have a very active role as in promoting transparency I think that's something that is lacking with the exception of a few states where certain states have actually taken initiatives to make sure that transparency regulations are put in place the other thing and I'll kind of shift gears a little bit here but I think that could really help benefit and all of the above kind of outcome is to allow markets to do what they do what they've always done they've actually resulted as I mentioned in my testimony in a very efficient natural gas market in this country and it's hard to imagine anything that would be adopted they would disrupt that but one thing that we need in this country that would really benefit not only the medium term but even the long term is the ability to store electricity if we get to that point it actually changes the entire landscape of the energy infrastructure in this country and would convey a lot of benefits associated with renewables associate but now gasps associate with nuclear power that we simply can't reap right now you're spot on and storage I'm over my time mr. Gerard I'll be brief first the first thing we can do is remember how we got to where we are today in a very real way we are today at a sweet spot we got here because of market conditions and the free market brought us to the point of three dollar gas when it was $14 gashes four or five years ago so the worst thing for us to do and this is where I take strong exception with my good friend andrew is to get the government involved in trying to set the price and to control the market the market will sort this out and find the equilibrium we will from that benefit from improved environment with lower emissions having low cost affordable natural gas will generate two million jobs will generate 2.5 trillion dollars in revenue to the federal government all while finding the opportunity to literally have it both ways in terms of exports and domestic production very good

Dominus recognized mr. speaker it's important for us to understand why we are here we are here because the Republican majority in the house and the Senate and the president the United States have not funded the government secondly we also are here because there are a number of issues on which I think there is agreement in both houses that have not been brought to the floor irrespective of the majorities will it appears from what the Senate leader has said is the third agreement in the Senate and perhaps and I think we probably will move forward today to open up government but I hope my Republican colleagues do not misinterpret what is happening because the issues will not go away between now and February 8th if that's the date we must resolve how we're going to fund the government that is what has held us up and we must bring to this floor a bill to protect people that the president United States said we ought to protect let's do it let's do our work I yield back the balance of my time as Thomas is fired for what purpose does gentleman Colorado seek recognition the objection the gentleman is recognized for one minute

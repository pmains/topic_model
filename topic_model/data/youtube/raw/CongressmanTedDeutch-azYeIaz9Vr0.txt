the chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida mr. Deutsch Thank You mr. chairman thank you for being here there's been there's been a lot of talk about dates and timelines I'd like to actually just walk through for the benefit of my colleagues just a short timeline from this year in January the FBI CIA and NSA concluded the following and I quote we assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the u.s. presidential election Russia's goals were to undermine public faith in the u.s. democratic process denigrate Secretary Clinton and harm her electability and potential presidency we further assess Putin and the Russian government developed a clear preference for president elect Trump close quote mr. Rosen's he'd give any reason to dispute that no in January also in January January 24th Michael Flynn denied to the FBI agents that he discussed the u.s. sanctions with Russia before he took office on January 26th acting Attorney General Sally Yates told the White House Counsel that Flynn lied about the nature of his calls with kiss lyac and is vulnerable to blackmail on February 13th of this year Flynn resigned over his conversations with the vice president on February 15th public reports of telephone records that show that members of the Trump campaign and other Trump associates had repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials in the year before the election on March 16th documents released by representative Cummings show that Flynn received 30 $3,750 from Russia's state-owned TV for a speech that he made in Moscow on March 20th the FBI director acknowledged an investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia on May 9th the president fired the FBI director on May 10th Trump met with Russian diplomats in the White House and revealed classified information and told them that he fired the head of FBI called him a nutjob and said and I quote I face great pressure because of Russia that's taken off close quote on may 11th the president told NBC News that the Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story on June 7th we learned President Trump urged call me to drop the Flint investigation on July 8th we learned of undisclosed and undisclosed Trump Tower meeting between Donald Trump jr. Jared Kushner Paul Manafort and a Russian lawyer the next day five sources stated that Donald Trump jr. agreed to the meeting on the premise the damaging information on Hillary Clinton would be provided and five days after that a veteran of the Russian military we learned also attempted that Trump Tower meeting with Donald Trump jr. Paul Manafort and Jared Kushner on October the 5th George papadopolis one of five people the president identified as a policy adviser pleaded guilty to one count of making a false statement to the FBI on January 27th about the timing extent nature of relationships and interactions with certain foreign nationals in the statement of offense we learned that he reached out regarding his connections that he could help arrange a meeting between Trump and Putin on October 27th former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and campaign advisor riff Gates were indicted on multiple counts including conspiracy against the United States in November the President of the United States met with Vladimir Putin and said and I quote he said he didn't medal he said he didn't medal I asked him again you can only ask so many times every time he sees me he says I didn't do that and I really believe that when he tells me that he means it president went on to say I mean give me a break talking about the the national security folks who put together that report that I quoted earlier give me a break they are political hacks on December 1st former National Security Advisor Mike Flynn pleaded guilty to one count of making a false statement to the FBI about conversations he had with the Russian ambassador regarding sanctions this is a little walk through what happened over the past year I would like to ask you mr. Rosenstein I'd like to quote some of my colleagues from this committee one of them said that the special counsels investigation into whether the Trump campaign assisted in its effort to interfere in the election is actually an attempt to overthrow the government in the United States do you believe that mr. Rosenstein no he said we're at risk of a coup d'etat in this country if we allow an unaccountable person is the Special Counsel unaccountable here no he's not unaccountable he went on to say with no oversight is there no oversight at all with the special counsel there is oversight and then he went on to say that if we allow an unaccountable person with no over-under to undermine the duly elected president States is pursuing the rule of law undermining the duly elected president of the United States mr. Rosenstein note is not one of my other colleagues said we've got to clean this town up he talked about firing Mahler one of our former colleagues on this committee accused Muller of having a vendetta against President Trump because he fired James Comey mr. Rosenstein do you believe that he is a vendetta I guess there wasn't no I do not I I would just conclude that this little walk through this one year in American history makes it impossible to understand how it is that my colleagues on the other side continue to launch attacks not only against reporters against the FBI against the Special Counsel but they do so to throw dirt on this story to make it try to go away they may want to bury their heads in the sand but mr. chairman I want to make clear that they will not bury the rule of law in the United States of America and I yield back

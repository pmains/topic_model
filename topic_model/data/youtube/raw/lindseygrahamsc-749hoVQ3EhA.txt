thank you mr chairman um from the president's point of view do does the authorization use military force does it in any way restrict his ability to go after terrorist organizations that represent a national security threat to this country and places outside of afghanistan that are not within the hierarchy of al-qaeda that existed on september 11 2001. senator i don't it would not okay so do we need to change it to give the president is there anything the president would like us to do differently than then that exists today senator i think the aumf provides very clear guidance for al qaeda taliban and associated forces he has many other authorities that you're aware of that he could use that that he used prior to aomf to deal with any other threats to our national security do you agree with with me the war against radical islam or terror or whatever description like to provide will go on after the second term of president obama centered my judgment this is going to go on for quite a while and yes beyond the second term of the president and beyond this term of congress yes sir i think it's at least 10 to 20 years i i think you're absolutely right i think we're involved in a generational struggle so the lessons of 9 11 are always learned the hard way so your advice would be to the committee is to do nothing senator i think it's appropriate to review a law that was written in 12 years and doing nothing is an exceptional you know for congress could be the right answer more often than not yes sir i think it's appropriate uh time to review this and we're taking this very seriously to review it but at this time we don't find that it would neces that would improve our ability to conduct the global our global campaign against these organizations well general do you agree with that uh senator i agree that the current aumf is adequate for us we we have in the time i've had in central command down at isaf and afghanistan and and also here on the joint staff you know we've been able to to to go after the enemy that is fits within the aumf do you agree with me uh mr secretary that the inherent authority of the president is commander in commander-in-chief would give him or her great latitude in terms of pursuing terrorist organizations that represent a threat against the united states apart from congress yes sir i do agree but you also agree that when the congress and the president and our courts are all aligned we're stronger as a nation when we're all on the same sheet of music yes sir so the one thing i do believe would be helpful is if the congress does more than just criticize that we find ways to empower the commander-in-chief and also it you know in some ways control the power of the of the executive branch but i tend to agree that what we have today uh is working but we all agree that the enemy of today is different than it was on 9 11. do you agree with that sir they have changed a bit but in many ways it's they have not changed very much at all they are operating in a very similar way that they were in 1998 out of traditional strongholds in yemen and east africa they have expanded in north africa and some other areas but quite frankly this has been a global organization since day one but would you agree with me because of the pressure we've placed on the enemy in afghanistan and iraq they're moving yeah so they've always moved even in 2002 they were very active in north africa uh so i couldn't agree with you more so from your point of view you have all the authorization and legal authorities necessary to conduct a drone strike against terrorist organizations in yemen without changing the emf yes sir i do believe that you agree with that general i do sir general do you agree with that i do sir okay could we send military members into yemen to strike against one of these organizations does president have that authority to put boots on the ground in yemen as i mentioned before there's domestic authority and international law authority at the moment uh the basis for putting boots in the ground in yemen we respect the the sovereignty of yemen um and uh it would uh i'm not talking about that i'm talking about does he have the legal authority under our law to do that under domestic authority he would have that authority i hope the congress is okay with that i'm okay with that uh does he have authority to put boots on ground in the congo yes sir he does okay do you agree with me that when it comes to international terrorism we're talking about a worldwide struggle absolutely sir would you agree with me the battlefield is wherever the enemy chooses to make it yes sir from boston to to uh the fatah i couldn't agree with you more we're in do you agree with that general yes sir i agree that the enemy decides where the battlefield is and it could be any place on the planet and we have to be aware and able to act and do you have the ability to act and you aware of the threats yes sir we do have the ability to react and we are tracking the threats globally from my point of view i think your analysis is correct and i appreciate all of your service to our country

thank you madam chairwoman and Thank You chairman Powell for being here today to testify chairman pal vice chairman Quarles just yesterday indicated the Federal Reserve would revise its stress capital buffer proposal in the near future vice chairman Quarles indicated one option would be to look at an average of stress test results over a number of years are you in agreement with vice chairman Quarles that this is something that needs to be considered and what factors might necessitate this change sir so there are we are in the process of evaluating I think in the late stages of evaluating how to put into effect the stress capital buffer which merges the results of the stress tests with the underlying overall capital framework it's a complicated exercise there are many moving pieces that's one of them I wouldn't want to single any single one out as as important for our consideration but that's that's the average taking an average of stress test results over a number of years is something that's under consideration but is it maybe a change that you're not necessitating just yet or we're very much in the process of evaluating all of those ideas and I wouldn't want to single that one out as as if they're in or out just there are many pieces and but yes that is one of the pieces mr. chairman you said you're in the late stages but what's your time frame do you believe for coming up with an option in terms of the stress capital buffer proposal I have to come back to you with a date but it would be you know within you soon in the near future thank you Karen Paul at your January press conference you were asked whether a four trillion dollar balance sheet gave you sufficient firepower to handle a future recession and you answered yes however the Fed's balance sheet as a share of GDP is about where the Bank of Japan balance sheet was prior to the financial crisis today the Bank of Japan has ended up with a balance sheet as large as the Japanese economy with mixed results on inflation and limited room to handle another downturn has Japan's experience are affected your thinking on the appropriate size of the Fed's balance sheet I think there are a lot of lessons to be learned from the experience of Japan really over the last quarter century and and all of us have looked very carefully at that you know what why should we feel certain that the US could avoid a similar fate and perhaps you could elaborate what Japan has his feminin self in a situation where inflation has gotten down close to zero for a very long time and they've tried many many things including as you mentioned extensive asset purchases and all sorts of forward guidance to move inflation back up and have not met with much success although they continue to struggle to do that so my main takeaway from that and by the way the European Central Bank is is fighting that battle well my main takeaway from that honestly is that that the Fed needs to stand here and and try to keep inflation symmetrically at 2% we don't want to get on that road of declining it the extent inflation continues to decline in expectations decline that will show up in lower interest rates which will give the central bank even less firepower to react and we see that that road is hard to get off of so I think it's quite important that we that we we fight at 2% to keep inflation up to 2% and use our tools to to achieve that symmetrically and we're strongly committed to doing that the most recent monetary policy report stated and I quote we're spending in the first quarter was lackluster but appears to have picked up and you talked a little bit about this in your opening statement mr. chairman can you please explain the possible variables behind lackluster consumer spending and why the recent turnaround well I think the the consumer part of the economy is 70% of the economy and it's it's healthy its strong its job good job creation its rising wages workers survey show that they think jobs are plentiful business survey show that they think workers are scarce so this is a this is a good place for the consumer part of the economy and you see that in survey as you see it in consumer spending and things like it serves about workforce development and and having enough able workforce is very key you're right they are in it but I think a tight labor force is lifting all sorts of communities into the labor force and it's it's it's good the issue really is more now on the business side where we see business confidence and business investment weakening a bit I think whoever and out of time I yield back to the chair thank you sir

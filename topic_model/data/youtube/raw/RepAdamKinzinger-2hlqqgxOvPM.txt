thank you thanks guys [Applause] way too nice thank you you know honestly this is the first time i've spoken in front of a group of people in months so thank you for being out here and uh if i'm a little rusty on my you know speaking skills you can blame covet and having a baby because that'll that'll keep you out of that out of that business for a little bit but look it is it is awesome to see you guys and uh it is really incredible i heard heath actually and by the way heath great job and and uh we deep respect i remember uh you know i heard him on the bulwark charlie sykes charlie i saw earlier um and you know he was just talking about look it's it's there is this sense that we've we are alone right like we kind of feel like you you you watch the news or you look at the internet and you're like am i the only person that's not nuts and you are there's others and i think that's the thing is as we see courage is contagious and i know that i'm coming on the tail end of the conference and so i recognize that probably some of the stuff i'm going to talk about you've talked about in some form or another and others have said some version of it but i i want to talk uh really briefly too about some courage and uh you know what we see in ukraine uh is courage what we see uh in in many of the leaders that we've heard of and many of the folks that we saw on january 6th and many of the folks that we saw between the election and the inauguration that may not have gotten as much you know tv coverage as liz cheney and i but actually were way more important to the defense of democracy and there's probably so many of you in here but i think of people of course like stephen richer i think of bill gates not the billionaire the one that's probably not worth quite a billion but way more heroic i think of al schmidt you know all these folks brad raffersberger that was on a phone call with the president of the united states was able to stand strong and say mr president i just can't lie right i i voted for you i supported you but you know i don't lie i'm not gonna i believe in the principles of democracy like that matters because if people like brad steven and others don't stand up at that moment in that in that pressure everything that generations have built in this country falls apart everything because then the other side decides to do it and then we decide to do it even worse and then the other side and this is what ends up happening when you don't have that basic construct i also think of people like michael wood ran for congress in texas you guys know him obviously and he was up here i remember when all this was going down he made his announcement and he basically i don't stood in front of a crowd of people or was talking to a reporter and said i refuse to lie i'm a conservative i refuse to lie and he actually made a comment that for me has always stuck out and i've probably stolen it unintentionally but he says this is what happens when people are abused when their patriotism is abused i have no doubt that everybody we talk about whether you're on the left right center loves the united states of america maybe they love it in a little different way or maybe they think something else should happen or there's of course disagreements on what that means and and what the united states should look like in what kind of a society that's actually what makes us strong but when leaders come along and they take your love for country and they manipulate you and abuse you bad things happens happen mike knew that that was a tough race mike knew it was a long road to win but he stood anyway and i'll tell you that's a brutal process to go through and i know some of you in here are considering a run for office and i'll say this if you're considering to run for office and you know that you have that fortitude to just stand up and do the right thing and no matter what the result is be able to look at yourself in the mirror then go for it do it if you have any doubt don't but if you can do it i think of uh jake hunsacker and utah is he here jake are you here hey jake uh making a a run for congress and i'm supportive of him he made the decision that telling the truth matters he made the decision that he's going to stand up for his principles and not lie and not abuse people to get there you know actually when i was planning to come speak obviously the world became very different in the last four or five days and so i've kind of adjusted what i really even wanted to talk about on that basis you know it's interesting when you see what's happened in ukraine and i think as of even five days ago if we'd have been sitting in this room there would have been this kind of understanding that darkness is on the march this understanding that lies are rising and truth is falling you know this understanding that division is growing i think that's how we all felt and look i think that's the case still but something happened five days ago when vladimir putin made the decision to attack ukraine decision that actually was probably made months before that we all are talking about zielinski when the president of ukraine made the decision that he's not going to worry for his life he's going to stay i got to tell you ladies and gentlemen him staying has made the difference between a ukraine that is on the battlefield today not only just putting up a fair fight against russia but defeating them that is what happens when somebody stands up and shows what courage is we have leaders that are sometimes scared to lose their election or they're scared of a bad news article or they're scared of being flooded on twitter i've been flooded on twitter i tweet too much by the way i know that but you know you you look at that and you and you see what happens when people are put in a position to show strength you see that when you see people that stand up between election day and inauguration and say i don't care if you protest outside of my house i will not go into that you'll see what happens when the president of ukraine says i'm staying just give me more stuff to shoot russians with [Applause] that's what matters and so when i thought that all this stuff is on the march i got to tell you i'm standing in front of you today and for the first time in a while i kind of see a little bit of a crack in that evil and in that darkness and in those lies i gotta tell you what this country no doubt is at a crossroads there's no doubt ukraine is at a crossroads ukraine's crossroads is a little more physical it's a little more obvious and it's way more violent but we're at a crossroads in this country i know you all know this i knew it too but there was a day that i kind of had the realization that it wasn't just a crossroads it was the fight of our lives i'll tell you a little about that day that was january 6 2021. i actually had been paying attention to the twitter feed spheres and all the other comments and i'm like man this looks like this might be a violent day and i also knew what every one of you know instinctively which is when we want to do democracy when we want to have self-governance there is only one basic contract that has to exist it doesn't have to be agreement on taxes it doesn't have to be agreement even on voting hours the one basic contract that that has to exist is that if you vote it will count and that the count the vote will be accurate the counting will be accurate when you have a leader of the free world that stands in front of america and convinces half the country that the system is broken that your vote doesn't count listen as a as patriotic americans we can understand why some would say then it is time to overthrow government by force if i truly believed that the election system in this country was rigged by satan worshiping pedophiles who drink babies blood i don't think i'd go peacefully into the night either which is why a leader's words matter so much so go in and on january 6 january 1st we have a conversation with the house republicans and liz cheney was speaking isn't she amazing by the way yeah [Applause] liz's liz's strength has been an inspiration for me even way before this she is somebody that i i just have nothing but praise for and as you guys have seen play out but she was running the house republican conference and at that point we knew that there was going to be this objection to election certification but to this point kevin mccarthy had not made us made his position known liz goes first she gives about a five minute impassioned speech on this phone call about why we have to certify the election kevin mccarthy goes second and he says liz cheney does not speak for the republican conference he didn't give his position yet until a day or two later about him voting against certification but i remember i was the very first caller to actually ask the questions 200 of us house republicans on the call and the thing i told kevin mccarthy and we were friends at this point i said kevin when you convince americans that an election is going to be stolen there's going to be violence and his answer was next caller next question i didn't know that they would sack the capital but i knew there were a lot of people convinced that the system wasn't working for them and so i go into work that day i asked my wife i used to say i told my wife i didn't she's she has her own agency i asked her though to stay at the apartment my staff stayed home and i go in and it's obviously developing into what it's developing into and i remember coming off the floor after the opening i decided not to stay i was going to watch a little bit of it on c-span i go to my office and by the time i get to my office i'm looking at capitol police officers listening to their radios wide-eyed and i asked one of the capitol police officers i go is it starting that's what is it starting she just looks at me and she goes yeah they're using bear spray like oh wow go up to my office open the window by this time the dc metro police had shown up huge heroes by the way every one of these people um [Applause] the dc metro showed up and i started hearing the non-lethal munitions and obviously i go once obviously i go on cspan.com and they have different camera views i go to statuary hall and at this point ladies and gentlemen imagine if there was a security perimeter around this building and that security perimeter was breached you would now believe that you were vulnerable and and we all were because if you can breach a perimeter of the capital the only thing stopping you from having free range of the entire complex is a couple capital police officers at different checkpoints and if you've just overrun 1500 of them if these people knew the plans better it would have been a very very different day if god had not been on our side it would have been a very very different day but i remember calling my wife on the phone and i just you know like disbelief it reminded me a lot of of you know moments in war and i just felt something i've only felt maybe twice in my entire life a dark kind of evil presence and i'm not one of these people that walks around sensing evil everywhere okay but that moment i just said this is wrong this is gross this is terrible and of course after that everybody said the right thing and it only took a few weeks for that those stars that idea of power that idea of adulation and and applause to take over and if we as republicans would have just simply taken a full accounting for what happened taken responsibility we could have moved on we could have determined nothing like that would ever happen again in the united states and instead we try to sweep it under the rug well it's not going to get swept under the rug the truth is out there and it's coming [Applause] because because whether or not you or your friends want to know the truth your kids do and their kids do and the next generation does and american and americans in a hundred years deserve to know the truth because we will not be the first generation in american history that leaves our kids a country worse off than the one we inherited we refuse to and we have the ability to refuse to do that i don't blame the people that came in that day now i gotta tell you of course i believe they should be arrested everybody is responsible for their own actions but as i said earlier when you have people that are worshiping politicians that you have politicians then use those words abuse their patriotism convince them of untruths we could have expected no different and people look to washington dc to say well how are you guys going to fix this of course the january 6 committee is extremely important but how are you going to fix the souls how are you going to fix the truth telling ladies and gentlemen i got to tell you it's not going to come from washington d.c it's going to come from this room and people like you around the country that have had enough it's going to come from people that have said you know what i still believe in what this american dream is we live in a moment where hope has been squashed in people's minds we live in a moment where people don't feel like they have opportunity we live in a moment where people feel like the future is actually more grim than the past some of it is from legitimate concerns that we have to be able to focus on instead of focusing on what the latest cultural battle is or how we can own the left or own the right how can we actually focus on some of these on fixing some of these problems but the other thing is putting leaders in that no longer have a desire to lie to you to feed their own ego of election i gotta tell you i'm done with this job in a year and i'm actually pretty excited about that i have people sometimes say like so sorry you're leaving i'm like thanks i'm not but thank you but i gotta tell you i'm not going anywhere i may be getting out of the house and i'm excited to leave the house but i'm actually excited to have way more time to work with all of you to make sure that we take back our political system because we deserve that [Applause] but those generations of americans deserve it but they've been told that there's no hope been told that there's no opportunity they've been told that somebody that doesn't think like you is the enemy they've been told by a former president that vladimir putin is a good guy i mean i have no doubt that people feel confused this is why leadership's so important at this moment and i want to tell you what's at stake because yes obviously the future of this country is at stake and that's important and honestly we can debate things like what the tax code is or you know any number of issues we deal with in washington dc that we've debated for a hundred years and we'll hopefully god willing debate for another hundred years we can talk about that stuff but i've got to tell you the thing that stands out to me most is what is it that we stand for as a country and what is the impact on people around the world we have 360 million americans that is my number one priority to make sure americans are safe to make sure they're fed to make sure they have hope to make sure the kid in the inner city of chicago has the same opportunity as a kid born in the wealthiest suburb i want to make sure that people have the born in the rural town in illinois have the same opportunity to succeed as somebody born in the suburb of illinois and i actually want to make sure and i know principles first does this too and country first is doing this as well and by the way there's country first volunteers and members here thank you so much it's been amazing to see that grow [Applause] [Music] but i want to see groups of people that live in the inner city talk to people that live in the rural town and recognize the fact that the challenges they have are the same you have drug issues in the inner city you have drug issues in the rural town you have unemployment in the inner city you have unemployment in the rural town you have broken homes in the inner city and you have broken homes in the rural town why are we not comparing notes why are we not aligned why are we not looking at things we have in common with people and seeing humanity and coming up with new solutions that is important for our country but i have to tell you what sticks out to me the most at this moment today is the fact that there are billions of people looking to the united states for leadership and desperate for our example democracies can live through bad days every democracy has a bad day the question on the strength of a democracy is how do you come back from those bad days that's where we're being tested as a country at this moment but if you look at the spirit of the people in ukraine a country that was divided among itself a country that had a national identity but it's never really had to rally around that national identity by the way as i was driving in here there was convoys of people with ukrainian flags honking their horns i didn't know what was going on and then i was pretty excited about it but when you're attacked by the outside people come together and they recognize their common humanity and a former president takes up an ak-47 and a current president takes up an ak-47 and we're all ukrainians today it doesn't need to take an external threat to the united states of america but our mission and when i say things like what is our mission why is that important if you look at all the great stuff we have let's take all the feel good stuff out of it and just talk about things and money all the benefits we have as a country is because we've not forgotten our role in the world at the end of world war ii an entire generation of americans were war weary an entire generation they didn't and in fact america doubled down at that moment and behind the iron curtain the third generation of people born into oppression had had enough of seeing what freedom is and seeing what hope and opportunity is and they tore down the iron curtain they stood up and said we demand better and you see people living in freedom today with opportunity today that never would have had the shot had we not forgot had we not had had we forgotten our mission in the world i think of a time when i went to kenya i went as a congressman they had no idea who i was but i came in some big black suv like we always travel in i get out of this village and they proceed to tell me the story of how how an american kid came up from the university of illinois and taught this kenyan village how to care for their cows they all had cows how to care for them properly and i was talking to this specific family that told me you know look our cow used to make i'm not a farmer so i'm gonna probably get the numbers wrong but you know our cow used to produce just one or two pints of milk a day now it produced six seven pints enough to feed the family and we take the excess down to the co-op built by the united states of america by the way we sell that for profit and our life has been changed and as they're telling me this story you know in their land that's about the size of just up here i look around and there's 50 to 100 other people from the village standing around wanting to get a look at me they didn't know who i was but they didn't know one thing they knew i was from the united states of america and they knew that the united states of america changed their life you're never going to recruit a member of al-qaeda or an enemy of the united states out of a place like that people that can always tell the story of how one kid through usaid came from the university of illinois and changed their life that's what this is about we have to be that example to people in kenya and every other country that say is self-governance even possible if we don't get it right they're gonna say every democracy fails if we do get it right they're gonna say democracy and self-governance can endure forever even in difficult times my grandpa when he stared down the nazis in world war ii and could never talk about it until i went to the military and went to war i never understood why he was willing to give it all and to some extent he kind of did yes he was always haunted by what he did over in europe and what happened over in europe we think of the generations from the you know the shot at concord to the civil war to all the wars in between to my generation responding after the terrorist attacks on 9 11. i know many of you in here are veterans as well and thank you but every time we are tested people rise up to defend this place right now we're being tested it may not be an external threat although they're out there right now the threat testing the united states of america is ourselves and the question is will we get sucked into this dark place or will we resist i have to do this every day there are days i wake up and i just feel consumed by the darkness and i feel angry and i feel defeated and i'm sure every one of you have those days too and we need to be honest about that but when you have those days it's when you look to god and ask for strength and look to your family and ask for strength and you go through and you can throw things at the tv or whatever but you always come back to the light you always remember that we don't have a right as americans to give up on this country that's not even our right to make that choice because generations gave us where we are today and it's a pretty good place even in all our flaws it is now on us to carry that torch forward so five days ago i would have come here and told you that darkness is on the march i actually think darkness today is on the retreat when donald trump stands up and says vladimir putin's a great guy and then we say see who vladimir putin is sometimes sometimes the lies have to be shown to the truth sometimes the lies in the darkness have to be laid out for display so that the truth can prevail and as much as i thought lies were on the march five days ago today i actually think the truth is rising up i really believe people are valuing straight talk and truth telling and ultimately the division that divides us yeah that'll always continue to be a problem but if we can all be ukrainians maybe we can all be americans too [Applause] so as i as we wrap up this weekend and we wrap up all of you being together and sharing ideas and debating ideas and celebrating our freedom to debate ideas i just want to personally say from the bottom of my heart thank you for the inspiration that you give me look i'm not going to stand up here and tell you that i love doing what i'm doing i'm not going to stand up here and tell you that you know taking the stand i have has been fun it hasn't um but i got to tell you there are days again when you're down and then you see the people that stand with you and it is so encouraging and so reinvigorating to realize that there are people it's like the biblical story of well now you're going to hear my old testament history ain't that great the guy that was alone and then there were thousands with him that god showed him that is this moment for us today but we look around and say there are people that know this is wrong and we're all going to join hands we're going to unite together and i think they're going to write history books about what we did and it may not be charging a mountain or sitting in a foxhole and fighting off an enemy but it will be fighting off evil darkness lies and the temptation to do things for the moment and not invest in the long-term history of this country i'm going to tell you your kids and grandkids yet born thank you thank you very much god bless you

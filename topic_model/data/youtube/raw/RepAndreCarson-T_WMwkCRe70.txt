for all of this congressman Andre Carson is joining us he's a Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee congressman thanks for joining us thanks for having me wolf so you have special insight how do these revelations about Jared Kushner Michael Flynn affect the investigation being conducted by your intelligence committee and by others without matter in Congress what I will say this it raises additional concerns it raises concerns about how to how how much coordination was taking place and you know Russia very skilled at manipulating individuals globally for their ultimate gain and I think that Russia is has been genius at manipulating people and and taking advantage of their naivete to further their objectives so do you think that the Jared Kushner and general Flynn were naive I'm not at liberty to speak on those matters at this time wolf but I will say that it is very troubling very concerning the the the close relationship that both Kushner and Flynn has had with the Russians but I just want to be precise and obviously we don't know want you to release any classified information but I'm sort of intrigued are you suggesting there's information you have right now about all of this that you need you can't necessarily share I'm not at liberty to comment or even comment on that no sir all right so I'll assume the answer is yes but let me let me move on now that robert muller has taken control of this overall investigation as you know he was appointed the special counsel he's a former FBI director some lawmakers some of your colleagues have complained that congressional investigations will be stifled in the process because of his supposed criminal investigation do you share that concern both investigations will take place independently Robert Miller has a great reputation having served under both President Bush and President Obama he's very respected within the bureau and the congressional investigations have gotten us to this point and I think those investigations will continue will they be slowed down or stifled because he doesn't want those investigations in the House and the Senate to interfere with his investigation I think Robert Muller will will conduct his own investigation honestly from scratch it won't impede the congressional investigations that are taking place right now and I think that this multi-pronged approach is actually healthy for for our country and to to really keep our democracy alive you expect the fired FBI director James Comey to still testify in public he suggested he wants a consult with the new special counsel will see a director Comey has a great reputation as well within the bureau and I think that he is someone who was very disciplined he's someone of many believed of high integrity and I think that any contribution that he could make to further this investigation will be most beneficial but you have no assurances that he will still go ahead and testify in open session in the coming days as he earlier and expressed their readiness to do sure that remains to be seen I'm hopeful to hear I'm excited about hearing what he has to say I think all of us are excited to hear what he has to say as also enough the former CIA director John Brennan he expressed concern last week that some Americans may have been led down what he described as a treasonous path by Russian spies either knowingly or even unknowingly do you believe Jared Kushner may have been a target of Russian intelligence services well it wouldn't surprise me I think director Brennan and I actually attended that hearing director Brennan has decades of service in the CIA so he would know best personally I come from Indiana Department of Homeland Security was a police officer with the state excise police I understand how how criminals work on a local state national level and if you look at the global perspective I think Russia has been a leader in terms of counterintelligence and espionage should the shooter have the security clearances suspended I think his his clearance should be under review as we speak I think the actions that were taken were inappropriate were questionable and I think it calls for us to really review his security clearance to ultimately determine whether or not it should be revoked some have suggested that the Russian ambassador here in Washington Sergei kis lyac could have been exaggerating a Kushner and Flynn's request or even purposely sending out disinformation knowing the u.s. might be listening in there wanting to create some chaos if you will do you take that possibility seriously in the game of spies distractions lies diversions or regular order so it's difficult to say at this point but it's it's the order of the day and in this game of spine and counterintelligence do you believe pressure was simply unaware how risky and unusual this request was if in fact he did make that kind of request for a back-channel using Russian embassy communications equipment to deal with the Kremlin it's difficult to say if he even cared again the Russians have brought a lot a lot to our world history but most importantly they second to the United States of America have have been pretty good at this spy game okay and you're not hating people and baiting people into their ultimately web of deception stand by congressman affected directed issue thought first I think the fact that there's out there has been obvious interference by the Russian government in our electoral process raises questions about why even mr. Krishna would even participate in in even seeking a back-channel to the Russian government very questionable yeah wasn't just a Christian remember it was general Flynn who was the top national security to the president-elect as well a man with enormous intelligence experience the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency so he didn't come in from the real estate business he came in from the intelligence community into this entire process a lot of experience there I stand by congressman person we have more to disc

fascinating details though coming out so joining us now member of the House Intelligence Committee Democratic congressman Jim Himes of Connecticut good to have you on this morning good morning mica so George Conway has a piece and The Washington Post and he he writes a lot about the mother report but the part that really stands out is how stunned he is that the report is quoted as saying it does not exonerate him he says it's a stunning thing for a prosecutor to say do you think that is as well and the president says he's completely exonerated by the report what's your response well I guess I'm - I have two responses to that number one you know the dead end defenders of the president I think are getting it wrong it by the way some of the people who are disappointed with this report are also getting it wrong but the dead end defenders were doing things like going after Adam Schiff saying there was never any evidence of possible collusion they're just plain wrong there was lots of evidence of a possible collusion right and it just didn't rise to the level of an indictable offense with respect to the obstruction yeah here's my theory as we know it is the Department of Justice policy that the president cannot be indicted so there is no amount of evidence no fact pattern that would cause the Department of Justice to indict the president for obstruction of justice now we've all seen the evidence of possible and I impossible their obstruction and so what I think is happening here is that Bob Muller who understands the inner workings of Washington and the DOJ by probably as well as anybody he is sending a signal that Congress which of course is the sole body that can hold the president accountable needs to make the decision about whether there was obstruction which is of course why it's important that we get the full the full report well we have to get the full report you vol Levin in the National Review at a great great column yesterday where he talked about he called it the bar letter interlude and you've all said this when he looked back upon this sordid story we won't remember the conclusion as defined by bars leather but by Mulder's report and we have yet to see what the report says so we don't actually know exactly what were slot that definition will consist of which it gets fairly remarkable how from the start you did have both sides and jumping to good to conclusions when in fact we still don't know what the report says how do you get the report so we can put this behind us and start focusing much more on healthcare and wages and you know getting people back to work yeah yeah look we're gonna get the report Joe you know there was a unanimous vote in the house to release the report most senators agree that the report should be a release except for apparently Lindsey Graham the president says release the report so we're going to get the report even if it requires a subpoena I am sort of curious about why it is that the report hasn't been released I understand classified information that can be dealt with quickly look if this report made the president United States look good we would have had it three milliseconds after it arrived at the Department of Justice so I'm very curious about that we are going to get the report but again people need to manage their expectations the people who are defending the pro-- it all costs you know there is no way you come out of being cleared of treason looking good there is no way you get out of not being impeached for obstruction of justice which if Nancy Pelosi's policy is to be believed is where we end up looking good on the other hand you know again those mostly on my side of the aisle who were disappointed that the president wasn't colluding with a hostile foreign power folks step back the fact that our president was not criminally conspiring with a hostile foreign power is cause for celebration not cause for political disappointment so congressman I want to ask about something you said earlier I'm so in the bar letter he specifically writes I believe that the question of whether the president can be prosecuted was not central to his determination that there was no obstruction and so I'm asking you like it's possible that he's making that up but that he's reverting something that something else was going on there that in fact did the policy and the view of the president can't be criminally prosecuted was in fact part of his consideration without the facts it's hard to know whether that conclusion is right or not what we do know is two things number one the Attorney General with all due respect got his job partly because he wrote a 19 page memo to the Department of Justice saying you can't and you can't investigate not charge you can't investigate the president for obstruction of justice and number two is setting that aside and that's just a possible indication of bias on the part of the Attorney General it's not his call to make to previous presidents Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon were threatened with impeachment or actually impeached for obstruction of justice so what the decision he's making is arrogating the authority of Congress to make that decision which is yet another reason why that report needs to be made in its entirety available to us Michael steel-cut Congress that point because I think it's it says a lot about where the Democrats go next potentially how much of this do you think is actually resonating with the American people right now to the extent that we've just spent the last few minutes or so getting a little bit weedy about this subject matter do you think that this is something that American people have been paying that close attention to that all they see right now is the president going hey no collusion as I said I'm exonerated even though the report didn't say that they don't know that necessarily how do you think the American people are reading this and what does that mean for Democrats politically going into 2020 let alone the rest of this year yeah Michael that's that's a that's a great question and to me it's sort of the central question and by to me what I mean by that is I'm in the camp of those who believe that this president gets held accountable not via impeachment or indictment but gets held accountable in 2020 when the American people decide whether to renew his contract but your aunt the answer your question Michael I'm pretty convinced is that this scandal speaks intensely and as I talked about earlier probably inappropriately to the relatively small and I don't know if that number is twenty thirty or forty percent of Americans who are absolutely dug in pro or against this president for them this is absolute catnip but for most Americans who are worried about how they're going to educate their kids who are worried about you know losing their health care I think this is a little bit of a sideshow and so to answer the other part of your question I think if Democrats are smart we're gonna continue to do the oversight that we need to do of a president that desperately needs oversight but we're gonna remember that our chance to hold this guy accountable comes down to the extent to which we have told the American people prior to 2020s election that we care about their health care that we care about their ability to retire that we care about their ability to educate their kids if we don't focus on that our opportunity to hold this president accountable with the force of an American election will begin to erode and that scares me a lot Congressman Jim Himes thank you very much for being on this morning

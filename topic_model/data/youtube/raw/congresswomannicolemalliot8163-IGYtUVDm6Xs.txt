nicole malliotakis it's good to have you back on okay we know republicans are looking into russia funding anti-fracking climate activists to destroy u.s energy independence russia has repeatedly hacked into the u.s power grid a big hack four years ago right congresswoman green does putin know the power grid is not ready to take on a flood of electric cars it could collapse the system of course he does and now we have evidence that i think several million dollars have been routed through non-profit organizations in bermuda to basically attack our energy industry to push the anti-fracking business uh the environmentalist claims so it's uh it's a huge massive disinformation campaign for putin it's right up there with his involvement in our elections and you know this whole steele dossier stuff that was the nice shiny object that took the mainstream media and a lot of them anyway and a bunch of democrats off track yeah distracted while he was advancing his agenda and congresswoman to the congressman green's point electric cars are now less than one percent of all cars on the road if all cars went electric we need to double our electricity output that means more coal and that gas to power our electric grid that's what powers two-thirds of u.s electricity congresswoman in new york city where i'm from they actually want to prohibit any new home development unless it is connected to just electric powered heat think about that no more natural gas this is what is happening with the far left in charge they are actually feeding right into people like putin's hands by making sure that we are not exploring our energy independence right here at home it is critically important that we do that we know that these totalitarian regimes dictators tyrants that they use disinformation campaigns as my colleague just said the question is why are the democrats playing into their hands we need energy independence now yeah it's a matter of national security and economics for american families yeah to the congresswoman's point let's listen to republican congresswoman kathy mcmorris rogers with us last night on this topic of the gop sending letters to crime climate groups saying come clean talk to us and we're getting your funding from watch this when i visited the ukraine in 2015 with the energy and commerce committee the ukrainians as well as nato warned us that putin president putin in russia was funding the ngos the non-government organizations as well as other environmental groups that were opposed to fracking in europe we are asking questions of u.s environmental groups due to a suspicious foundation in san francisco and their ties to this foundation as to whether putin also has been influencing american environmental groups to shut down american energy listen you know russia's putin congressman green has been really worried about u.s uh fracking and energy for more than a decade he feels it's a threat to russian interests you know when u.s fracking took off last decade the oil prices dropped by half that's when he stood up sat up and took notice former nato secretary general hillary clinton has been warning about russia funding propaganda against fracking and u.s energy what do you say congressman green well absolutely when we produce and when we're energy independent and the supply of oil and gas is coming from our wells the price of that gas and oil decreases massively you'll recall that actually the price of oil went negative they had to pay people to come get it out of the out of the wells back when trump was president so when that happens by trump or uh putin loses tons of uh billion dollars because of the price fall yeah that's a good point of course yeah of course he's going to push you know an anti-fracking uh you know disinformation campaign because it it increases the price of gas and makes him more money that's right and congresswoman uh congressman meliatakis tesla increased the prices of its entire lineup of electric vehicles 5 10 to 10 shortly after the transportation secretary pete butterjudge was pushing electric cars watch democrats again say the solution to your high gas prices is buying an expensive electric car watch this today the average gas price in america hit an all-time record high of over four dollars per gallon i'm willing to pay four dollars a gallon hell i'll pay 15 a gallon because i drive a tesla perhaps if you let the market work in this respect people will feel pain they'll take a second look at that ford f-450 gigantoid truck they'll reconsider a tesla you'll see hybrid innovation happy to be standing here sandwiched between um our two electric vehicles uh secretary buda judge and i both have two of the electric vehicles we have to move to clean energy solutions clean is in the end where we should be so that we don't find ourselves in this position again that's it and there's no sound or fuel there there is nothing so how do i know it's actually working it is okay again and again and again we've got to take this point up congresswoman malaytakis u.s electricity is powered by natural gas and coal and fossil fuels about two thirds of that if we go all electric you're going to have to basically ratchet that up to order in order to power electric cars your final word absolutely right look the democrats have had a war on cars look at new york city the congestion pricing proposal increased tolls eliminating parking spots this is just another example of why they want to increase the cost for drivers hoping that they'll move to electric but it really doesn't make a difference because again as you said electricity powered by natural gas look what cuomo did with indian point nuclear power plant reducing 26 percent of new york city's electricity it's ridiculous and now people paying skyrocketing costs got it congressman greene congressman meliatakis thanks for joining us the senate voted

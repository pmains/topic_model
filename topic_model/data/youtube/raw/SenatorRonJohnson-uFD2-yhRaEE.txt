to delegitimize joe biden's election 12 republican senators and senators elect say that they will reject the election results of swing states won by joe biden until an audit of alleged fraud is completed they now have the support of the vice president none of this is any chance of actually overturning the election there was no widespread fraud number one but it is looks like it's being done to curry favor with president trump and his supporters and among the senators taking part is ron johnson wisconsin into his credit he's agreed to join me this morning senator johnson welcome back to meet the press so i want to start with this last month you told a newspaper in your home state that you would not object to the electoral college certification quote unless something surfaced there have been 57 cases filed by the president or his allies not a single court has found a single instance of fraud or any of this evidence seen as legitimate so what has changed to suddenly put you on the side of questioning the results of this election sir well good morning chuck and happy new year let me first respond on on covid i think our greatest failure in responding to covet is we've completely ignored early treatment and we've actually vilified doctors have had the courage to practice medicine and treat patients with widely available uh repurposed drugs so i just have to point that out we've utterly failed from that standpoint to answer your question i would ask that all your listeners ask you ask our critics to actually read the letter one of the points we make is that we are not acting to thwart the democratic process we're acting to protect it the fact of the matter is that we have a unsustainable state of affairs in this country where we have tens of millions of people that do not view this election result is legitimate we've just come off for four years where the other side refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of president trump and here we are again and what we're saying is we need transparency and you do not when you're trying to investigate wrong doing elections you don't have very much time and so we're suggesting is uh let's set up a commission as they did i know i know it's a long time ago 1877 but let's take a look at a bipartisan commission to organize all the allegations uh certainly what i did in my hearing is the three and a half hour hearing we barely scratched the surface but organize the allegations let's put out take off the table the ones that have been explained but also acknowledge the problem areas that have not been explained so that we can restore confidence election system this is an unsustainable state of affairs right now and that's that's all we're saying is as long as somebody's going to be objecting to this and we're going to be taking the vote let's propose a solution in terms of you know transparency investigation uh with commission all right senator i want to quote senator ben sasse for you because what you're alleging is essentially you have you and your colleagues have created this controversy so right now we are locked into a destructive vicious circle in some ways as you kind of outlined except which is you made an allegation that there was widespread fraud you have failed to offer specific evidence of that widespread fraud but you're demanding an investigation on the grounds that there are allegations of widespread fraud so essentially you're the arsonist here president trump is the arsonist here you've started this fire and now you're saying oh look at this oh my god all these people believe what we told them because you didn't have the guts to tell the truth that this election was fair chuck this fire was started back in you know january 2017 people like mark zaid in his tweet the coup has started first of many steps rebellion and impeachment to follow ultimately this was started when the mainstream media stopped dropped any pretense of being unbiased and actually chose sides during this election this fight was started when you completely ignored for example our investigation hunter biden you know no no evidence wrong doing there and now we find out after the election no there is a fair amount of evidence to the point that we have a real fbi investigation senator all right it's the it's no listen i've had enough of this too the situation where republicans and conservatives do not trust the mainstream media and that is what's required that is what has destroyed the credibility of the media and our institutions and right really you know the destruction confidence in the intellectual election result so i can start this listen you you have spent and i'm just curious senator you have spent much of your time in the last two years carrying a lot of this crazy conspiratorial water for president trump whether it was the attempt to somehow blame ukraine uh for the interference in the election rather than russia you've used your committee to sort of create the illusion of voter fraud as you just described earlier because there are quote allegations i i'm just trying to understand here what are you doing it for you're not trying to overturn the election you just said are you simply trying to curry favor with constituents of the presidents is that what this is all about is this cynical political ploy i'm i'm i'm trying to be transparent you know one of the things we found out in our hearing uh is you know the basic allegations kind of fall into three categories i would say the first is the either violation over lacks enforcement of election law there there is voter fraud there always is we had one witness talk about 42 000 uh people voting twice in nevada uh the the other the other issues because you have somebody saying i didn't make it it's easy it's easy stop you don't get to make these allegations um that that haven't been proven true here's what i don't understand you understand how the our government was set up the reason we have a judiciary is because partisans like yourself weren't going to be trusted by the public to decide who won or lost an election let me ask you this who carried the state of wisconsin well uh vice president biden has won by 20 000 votes but there are also issues in in wisconsin one of the things i point out and was revealed in our hearing is i entered in the record three letters written by congressional democrats to the voting machine manufacturers now at that point in time i didn't hear chuck schumer call it quackery or conspiracy theory or you know a ridiculous charade but that's exactly how he attacked my hearing that i thought was a really good hearing that laid out some of the issues you know we had chris krebs testify you know chris krebs said oh you know there's it's the most secure election but in our in our hearing he actually admitted he wasn't talking about potential fraud he was just looking at hacking he also admitted that some of these election and tabulation machines are are hooked up the internet which probably told me that that wasn't the case so again i didn't criticize democrats when they were talking about potential hacking of voting machines but now it's quackery now it's conspiracy theory that's the problem chuck there's a double standard here and we are not being transparent and we are dismissing the concerns of tens of millions of americans again i didn't i didn't like this fire this fire was written over over four years ago and we've destroyed the credibility of you have destroyed the credibility of the news media by your bias and of course people like james comey andrew mccabe uh john brennan destroyed the credibility fbi and depart and our justice system as well we have an enormous problem in this country it's unsustainable and the only way you solve it is with information and transparency and hearings and investigations it's not conspiracy theory is what's going to be required let me ask you this then why didn't you hold hearings um about the 911 truthers there's plenty of people who thought 911 was an inside job so we're basically saying it's a judgment what i would like told hearings on you know what i was talking about and why did we not spend hundreds of billions of dollars exploring early treatment why did we vilify doctors who had the courage to treat covet patients practice medicine try and find available cheap repurposed drugs to do so why i'd love to hold hearings on that there are all kinds of things that i'd like to hold hearings on you have to kind of pick and choose based on priorities right now we have this election we've got tens of millions of americans that think this election was stolen we need to get to the bottom of it again what's what's explained we need to explain it get that off the table but we also have to acknowledge there are some real problems there's some issues that need to be explored and investigated you got to ask yourself when you tell people a million times that something was stolen or something was fraught and then they believe it um i think you need to look in the mirror and ask yourself why so many people chuck you need to look at your mirror and senator johnson i've got to go i appreciate your question conclusion that is what you did in the media you carried that water for years you destroyed the creek senator johnson uh other than other than crediting you for for coming on i appreciate that because only two of your colleagues had the guts to say yes this weekend about this um conspiracy theory that you're working on thanks for coming on that i appreciate when we come back to voting rights activists

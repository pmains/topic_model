to evolve to reflect our nation's key energy supply security and environmental needs american fossil energy r d takes place in our national energy technology laboratories throughout the country including laboratories in morgantown west virginia and in pittsburgh pennsylvania over the years these two labs alone have produced thousands of jobs billions of dollars in investment into local and state economies and an incredible working relationship among wvu pitt carnegie mellon penn state and virginia tech just to point out the importance of fossil energy are indeed funding to the gentleman's home state of california in 2011 over 200 projects were developing in california this research provided 1.6 billion dollars in funds being brought into that state along with over 7 600 jobs in hawaii there were over 36 million dollars spent in research involving nearly 300 jobs fossil energy r d has led the research to significantly reduce acid rain as well as in other advanced pollution controls and mercury emission reductions and has led in or conducted research that created technology used in 75 percent of our nation's largest coal power plants today fossil energy r d continues to lead the nation's efforts in carbon capture sequestration and utilization and has led efforts in combustion and turbine r d that led to substantial increases in power plant efficiencies and reductions in power plant emissions simply put the research through this program focuses on developable developing affordable safe and clean mechanisms to enhance and utilize our domestic fossil energy resources in the most efficient manner if this amendment passes congress will not be able to ensure our nation of job security job retention and growth and the ability to meet our ever increasing energy needs not only would this amendment destroy nearly 90 000 jobs 2 100 research projects and over 18 billion dollars in investments but it would harm our educational institutions and the students scientists and professors who work in our national energy laboratories i urge all of my colleagues to oppose this amendment and continue to support our domestic fossil energy initiatives i yield back my time the gentleman yields back for what purpose does the gentleman from indiana

this is such an unbelievable ripoff that never stops I mean let's acknowledge something pharmaceutical companies do a good thing they create life extending and pain-relieving drugs and then what they do is they charge so much that the American families are held hostage to the heartache that they feel when they've got a loved one who needs that medication for pain relief or for a continued life it is a legal stick up and there's one example after another one of the most recent ones a BV boom era huge price thousands and thousands of dollars they're coming up to the point where they don't have the patent any longer they were going to have competition from another huge pharmaceutical company Amgen they made a deal we don't know what the terms of that deal was but Amgen is not going to market its product which would allow competition for this price to come down in the United States but they are going to market in Europe and it's going to be in a lot less more affordable that is a legal stick up and we in Congress by doing nothing are causing real pain to American families and that's right Alijah the cost of nothing is not nothing the cost of nothing is this pharmaceutical company saying to that family it needs that drug give us your paycheck and when you finish with that paycheck give us that college account you set aside for your daughter and when you finish with that that retirement savings account give us that and when you finish with that you can take out a second mortgage we've checked it out that's what they are doing they are holding hostage the pain of good American families who have heartache about a loved one who needs that medication and they're saying you go broke and maybe we'll dole out a little medication it has got to stop President Trump you were right but you're doing nothing it's time to put up or shut up

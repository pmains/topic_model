welcome back to morning joe beautiful live picture of the united states capitol at 7 46 in the morning in washington joining us now member of the intelligence committee independent senator angus king of maine senator king good morning it's good to have you with us we want to talk about your view and your criticisms of the republican proposal for coronavirus relief and how you think we can do better on this but i want to ask you first as a member of the intelligence committee for your reaction to the interview just out this morning jonathan swann of axios the president of the united states sitting down jonathan swann asked the president about this intel about the program from russia the gru to put out bounties on american soldiers in afghanistan here's what the president said it's been widely reported that the u.s has intelligence indicating that russia paid bounties or offered to pay bounties to taliban fighters to kill american soldiers you had a phone call with vladimir putin on july 23rd did you bring up this issue no that was a phone call to discuss other things and frankly uh that's an issue that uh many people said was uh fake news who said it was before i think a lot of people uh if you look at some of the wonderful folks from the bush administration uh some of them not any friends of mine were saying that it's a fake issue but a lot of people said it's a fake issue there was just we had a call we had a call talking about nuclear proliferation which is a very big subject where they would like to do something and so would i we discussed numerous things we did not discuss that now and you've never discussed it with him i have never discussed it with him now so senator king the president said he has not discussed that issue with president putin on any of the many phone calls he's had since then you sit on the intelligence committee is it your assessment that that intel is quote fake news as the president puts it no how's that for a short answer i've seen the intelligence in my opinion it's not it's not fake news it's not a hoax it's serious and uh later in that interview which i heard earlier on your program the president said something about that well i didn't know about it or i didn't see it or it didn't come to my desk well it was on the front page of the new york times within a few days and there was nothing keeping the president from i i'm quite sure he knew about that story and still didn't raise it with president putin i i find it just absolutely astonishing uh and and it's uh the president still hasn't uh even respect the interview you just mentioned i think is the first time he's actually responded to the story and basically he sort of shrugged his shoulders and said well i didn't see it no big deal putin and i are talking about other things i don't know what could be more important than uh the russians providing incentives to take the lives of americans and as you know senator it wasn't just the new york times it appeared in the president's daily brief that's how important intel officials thought it was you say the intelligence is solid based on what you've seen how do you explain then the president reflexively taking the side of putin taking the side of the dissenters on this intelligence i don't i i don't have any explanation except it's part of a pattern that is no surprise to anybody that the president has been very reluctant to cross president putin going back to helsinki and and before uh there's no real explanation for it and you know what here's what bothers me and i i get into this dilemma where the president makes some kind of statement like that and i know better but i can't talk about it and i'm not going to talk about the specific intelligence i'm only going to say that in my opinion it's not fake news uh but if the president says it never got to my desk then he could uh prove that by showing that the daily briefs that he got for for late february when this was current didn't mention it i don't i don't think he's going to do that so senator is anything being done to push back on this as far as you're aware we know the president isn't pushing back on it but as you say there's solid intelligence that russia is paying taliban linked militants to kill american soldiers in afghanistan is there any pushback on that well first i you just made a very assertive statement that i didn't i i don't i'm not necessarily agreeing with every phrase that you just said uh but the the answer to your question is foreign policy is largely in the hands of the president now uh we could have hearings on this and and uh try to bring the facts out but that gets into the difficult situation of uh not uh betraying sources and methods of how we learn things so uh it's very difficult to have a public hearing on a matter of this of this nature uh but you know the president has said what he said you saw it in the interview and basically and then when he started when general nicholson talked about you know there were this this is nothing new for the russians uh he sort of blew that off and denigrated a a decorated uh american general so i just i don't know where you go with this uh claire mccaskill uh i'll take that question to you and then you can take it to the senator but i just what indication do we have from what we have seen from president trump that he's not to take it a step further almost coordinating with russia in some way because nothing explains this and i wonder if we should be looking at this with a much more critical eye i can assure you there are many people in washington dc both currently involved in foreign policy and intelligence and formal and formerly involved that see trump as a form of a russian operative in the united states there has been a consistent pattern with this president um and is beyond um troubling um angus good morning i've got a question for you about the coronavirus aid bill um it seems to me looking at it from the outside at this moment that mitch mcconnell has a crisis that is fairly rare for him and that is he doesn't have a unified caucus on this uh there is a real dissension with among republicans as to how to move forward and it's my understanding he didn't even show up yesterday for the negotiation on the bill um it's beginning to feel looking at it that there may not be a bill what does it feel like there uh is this in fact mitch mcconnell finally having the wheels come off in terms of keeping his um his his troops um all gathered together well i think there'll be a bill because the american people are going to demand it and as someone pointed out last night i can't imagine being one of those endangered republican senators going home and saying well you know we just didn't do anything when people are losing their extended unemployment benefits uh snap benefits are not being increased evictions are going to start again in a big way uh this this crisis isn't over and two preliminary points claire one is we shouldn't even be having this discussion we should be look we should be moving out of the pandemic now instead of back into the teeth of it it was the failure of this administration to have a a plan and b to not build the infrastructure particularly for testing and tracing that could have allowed us to uh to handle this as it's been handled in every place else in the world i saw a graph the other day in the eu which is about the same size as the us democracy uh industrialized countries they're having five or six thousand cases a day we're having sixty thousand uh we have four percent of the world's population we've had 23 of the deaths uh that there's no other explanation for the for that other than our government has has completely failed us on that the second point is we ought to be having this discussion about the next round of relief because we need it a month ago uh or at least two or three weeks ago and to wait until now when the deadline is this friday for the expiration of these benefits i i just i i don't get it i mean everybody knows what the issues are mitch mcconnell was talking about liability you know a month and six weeks ago why they waited this long and now as you say they don't have a unified caucus but i think there will be a bill i think you'll find a combination of republicans that feel that they have to do something and democrats who feel they have to do something i think there's going to be enough in the senate to put together a bill along with they're going to have to negotiate with the with the white house but uh this is like you know you see the train coming and you you know you're just still playing tiddlywinks on the tracks i mean they knew that this was these deadlines were coming these cliffs were coming on unemployment insurance and didn't even open negotiations didn't respond to letters calls or anything else it just uh it's it's it's the antithesis of responsible government eddie glaude jump in senator angus i i i really appreciate your your comments about this whole process but i want to pan out just for a little bit uh as you say we know that the american people are suffering uh and we know that uh the the the circumstances around rent the circumstances around employment insurance all of this is is coming to a head and it's coming to a head immediately as you as you see this process as you're participating in this process what would you describe as the values animating the republican side what is being revealed about what they care most about that the american people should know in this moment well i think you can start with what they don't seem to be too worried about which is all those people who are losing unemployment insurance in maine at 72 000 people they wanted to cut from 600 to 400 to 200 that's 400 a week i did the math it's almost 30 million dollars a week out of the pockets of those people who desperately need it i've been talking to them but it's also 30 million dollars a week out of the main economy so this is this is bad both for the for the the recipients but also for the economy there's a there's a newfound uh deficit hawk uh ness in the republican caucus people who are suddenly saying how can we spend all that money i was walking by a republican senator yesterday getting on the elevator and he was saying that we can't spend all this money we don't have and i i i was i shouted i said so why did you vote for the tax bill uh well i didn't get any answer to that uh you know that was totally unfunded and and added significantly over a trillion dollars to the deficit uh but they don't want to spend money to to help people make the rent maybe it's because they just don't know anybody who can't pay their rent they you know maybe it's because of the circles they travel in i don't know i don't know what it is but this is not the time i listen i i hate the deficit and i think we ought to be chipping away at it but we should have been doing it in good times a time like this is not the time for uh for taking that concern and having it override the needs of of real people the economic result of not doing something will be worse for the deficit in the long run than if we do something i mean we learned that at the beginning of the great depression and we we we just can't uh have this uh you know this drama about the deficit uh when this is a this is a national hurricane if you will that's destroying the country and we've got to respond to it and we realize that they're people that just through no fault of their own are absolutely hurting for for food for rent for medicine for just ordinary able to let to live and and to be dubbing around the way we have been for the last couple of weeks uh without any any action on this from senator mcconnell is as i think i can't remember my phrase but it i think i said it's not responsible governing senator angus king thank you very much for being on this morning

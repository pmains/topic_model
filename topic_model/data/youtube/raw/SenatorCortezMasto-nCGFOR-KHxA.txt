Thank You mr. chair thank you to the witnesses that are here today as well I look forward to working with you along with my colleagues on the pending legislation since I have the opportunity though how I'd like to highlight a particular bill we could go I introduced s 33:49 it's the story county land conveyance act and the bill provides technical fixes to a 2014 law originally meant to resolve conflict and title issues between residential property private property owners and the BLM in Story County Nevada conflicting claims to these properties were caused by improper federal conveyance of land surface rights for residential and non mining commercial uses stemming from the 19th century the 2014 law contains language that conflicts with BLM's land survey and conveyance procedures and the effort to provide legal certainty to my constituents in Story County has been on hold ever since I bring this up today as my staff and I've been working with storey County with the BLM and the Interior Department on making sure we have the necessary language to help those Nevadans whose property has been in legal limbo although we were unable to have my bill included on today's agenda I've received assurances from the Interior Department that they will work with us to move my bill through the legislative process as soon as possible and just want to confirm that I do have that commitment from Interior and the beyond to work with me on this senator you do have that commitment from interior to continue working with you on that thank you I appreciate that and so mr. chair I also ask for support from you and your staff to help solve and resolve this issue as expediently as possible I look forward to working with you

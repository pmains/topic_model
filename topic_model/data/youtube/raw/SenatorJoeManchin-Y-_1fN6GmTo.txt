first of all let me just say this to all of my colleagues i just can't tell you how proud we all are of us coming together and basically we're coming together all the support of ukraine what's happening in ukraine it's absolutely the carnage we see going on innocent peace loving people being attacked viciously by russia by putin's russia let's put it very clearly putin's russia and we have to do everything we can to support them i was very proud of the president when he said that basically there won't be one inch of uh of nato land that we will not defend that's a strong statement and i feel very strongly about that and i think showing the support that we have in united about this we will but one what we can make no no mistake this this is a this is a uh energy has become a weapon of war for putin and he's using that as a weapon of war he's using it against all of europe if you will but ukraine is basically the catalyst of what he's doing so what we're doing today is we introduced a bill it's been dropped we have i think there's 18 of us 9ds and 9rs that are on this piece of legislation that basically bans the russian energy imports act that's all it is we're banning russian imports act what we're banning is basically petroleum petroleum products crude oil lng coal mostly all fossils coming in the united states and whatever they should be it's an impressive group that we put together here but we're also united and basically if we can't show the united the uniting support that we have for ukraine and backing ukraine and making sure our allies nato allies know how supportive we are and that we're united behind them too and protecting them if we can't do that here that's going to be very hard to have them hold holding lines together that's been always my concern i've said this as a young person i'm i think i'm the oldest person here no let me just say i've never been more concerned since the cuban missile crisis as a young 15 year old i remember that vividly and man we were scared i mean really scared that what could happen because we knew the effects of a nuclear war i'm as concerned now about what this could escalate into if we don't do what we're doing now and stop and and hopefully he will he will understand the economics of this to his country and the detriment to his own country and putin so with that i think we can uh we can uh we can show solidarity here but also we can make a difference uh it also shows you the fragility of the energy uh and in the markets around the world and what we're dealing with uh the united states has the ability to backfill and help all of our our allies around the world as they use this energy as a weapon but we have to make sure that we're doing ours we do it cleaner than anybody else we do it in a better fashion anybody else and we have the ability with the reserves to do much more during this crisis time of crisis so i hope we all take that in consideration so we're going to step up and we're asking the government step up i've put i've spoken to most of the largest ceos petroleum ceos in the united states that basically are all over the world they have markets over the world they have their tentacles everywhere in the world and spoke to all of them i asked him i said i want you to do everything you possibly can they said we have basically started aggressively pulling back all of our investments and pulling back all of our dependency on russian products that's that's that's great i applaud him for that and i said i need you to do something else i need you to make sure you make a commitment that basically the united states economy and the citizens of the united states will not be impacted because of corporate profits or shareholders profits whatever it would be during this period of time of crisis they all said this is a matter of national unity for us to and i was very proud to hear that so i'm going to say that everyone seems to be very much on board 100 and supporting this effort so with that i have no um no concerns that we should have any shortages right here so the united states of america in 2019 was producing 12 million barrels a day 12.3 we're down 11.2 because of code market dropped off we have no problem at all ramping back up with what we already have ready to go so we can backfill that we have tremendous amount of lng we have a tremendous amount of gas that we can produce the lng for we're expanding on our exports as far as with our lng terminals uh germany is putting two terminals to receive lng so they don't have to depend on on russia it's up to us to make sure that we connect all that together so without further ado i want to thank one of our co-sponsors one of our lead co-sponsors and everyone you see here this is a bicameral event you have house members and josh godhammer and brian fitzpatrick here and then basically the group that we've put together so i'll bring lisa murkowski up at this time and lisa if you will thank you so it's good to be working with my buddy joe manchin on bipartisan things there's been a flurry flurry of bills that you have seen ideas floated out there in the past in the past week bills that have been introduced i think the difference with what you have here is this is bipartisan this means it actually has some legs and the fact that it is bicameral as well i think is one of the reasons why you've got so many folks that are gathered here today because this is actually something that can make a difference that can get putin's attention senator manchin has has used the words you know putin is not afraid to weaponize energy he's been doing that we've seen it all along into this lead up and and there's been an approach and a policy from this administration that says we don't want to do that we don't want to put that on the table well i'm sorry sir it's already on the table and it's been put on the table by putin and so what what can we do to respond well i will tell you today our message should be pretty clear and pretty simple no no more russian energy should come into the united states for the duration of this bloody horrifying and unprovoked war against ukraine so this measure this measure is in direct response to what russia is doing with the with the bombing of the schools and the hospitals and the apartment buildings forcing the ukrainians to flee their country killing the innocents that remain and and using some of the worst weapons in the world and indiscriminately uh to do it so these are not just acts of of war they're war crimes and there should not be a single additional american dollar allowed to finance these atrocities so the president has said i'm going to use every tool in the toolbox mr president this is a tool this is a tool the one tool the one tool that might just force vladimir putin to sue for peace here so we've got an opportunity here to address this we in this country can move today to ban russian energy imports so we know that we've been bringing crude oil russian crude into this country and and and oil products but we've been seeing those numbers drop back in 2021 everyone's looking at those numbers it's about about 700 000 barrels that were coming in we've started to see companies that are basically self-sanctioning in light of russia's activities according to eia's preliminary data u.s crude imports from russia were new were near zero at january so to senator manchin's point we can backfill all of this but i think people need to kind of put it into context in terms of how much we might need to to step up i'm confident that we can fill the supply gaps by american production along along with our allies in in canada for instance so i i would urge the president take take your take your counterproductive policies like taxes and royalty hikes take them off the table give the industry the confidence that it needs to be producing more he he might not want to hear this but i think the most important step that can be taken right now to lower domestic gas prices because that's what everybody wants how are we going to get the prices down it's almost psychological in nature he's got to change course he's got to embrace american energy he's got to tell the public that he's doing this that's going to do a lot more to calm than some some temporary spro sale we've we've seen that you don't get much mileage out of that in terms of reduction in the price you don't you don't see it calming the markets so to me this is clear as day we are not going to send russia any more us dollars to help them kill innocent people this bill will do it it's bipartisan it's bicameral and it needs to move and it needs to move today so let's go to the other side of the house here josh got hunger thank you very much thanks lisa thanks for inviting us over we will leave within a half hour don't worry uh thank you joe for inviting us and lisa thanks very much uh and it's great to be with all uh my colleagues and with brian fitzpatrick who's co-chairman with me the problem solvers caucus you know in times of great distress at home or abroad we have always done best when we've stood together as a one nation with our allies as putin's forces continue the brutal invasion to the ukraine the united states must stand strong against the russian dictator so we're joining together today to cut off putin's largest revenue source and support america's own energy independence and security and we're joining forces both across the aisle and as lisa said across both chambers to lead bipartisan bicameral legislation to ban russian oil and petroleum from being imported to the united states and as we're announcing today and as i'm here with brian fitzpatrick who i mentioned as co-chair of the problem solvers caucus we plan to bring not only lead in the the charge in the house but of course to bring it to the problem solvers caucus for consideration we've already taken critical steps the commander-in-chief has responded quickly and aggressively to the conflict rallying together with our nato and democratic allies helping build the international coalition to counter russia support ukraine and protect democratic values we've shut down putin's access to assets in the united states and sanctioned russia's major banks important first steps but to truly deter putin we need to do more just today my home state of of new jersey there the governor phil murphy signed an executive order requiring all state agencies to temporarily revoke any contracts permits or licenses currently issued to companies controlled by russia or belarus this is the type of impactful action we need but now despite widespread condemnation of russia's actions the united states must do more and we have to continue to do more to import as well more than half a million barrels of oil each day that must stop immediately by banning the import of russian oil here in the united states we have the opportunity to work with our allies to stabilize the energy market across the world safeguard our nation's energy security and boost our own energy independence it's time to ban all imports of russian oil and the us and our allies have already announced the initial release of 60 million barrels of oil from the spro obviously we've got to do more now is the time to act together here at home with our allies abroad and ban imports of russian oil and we stand strong we're glad to hear positive uh feedback from the speaker on this effort this is a moment for people who love democracy at home and around the world to unite and that's what we must do is democrats and republicans here in the greatest country in the world and now uh i'm very honored to introduce my co-chair the problem solver caucus brian fitzpatrick thanks thanks um when it comes to uh when it comes to ukraine i think we all can agree that we have a collective similar feeling and that is pit in the stomach how is it possible that in the year 2022 we could be witnessing what we're seeing on tv things that we thought were permanently relegated for the history books my last uh international assignment as an fbi agent was in ukraine i lived there those are my friends that are under assault right now and it's there where i will be flying tomorrow afternoon to go to the poland ukrainian border to be with some of them and this is one of the things we're going to be talking about as my colleague said there should not be a single dime not a single cent taxpayer dollars funding vladimir putin's murder machine and it's a very simple concept it's one that's overwhelmingly bipartisan as is evidenced here speaker pelosi today said she supports the concept of completely banning imports of russian oil into the united states this should not be difficult i personally think we're going to be going a lot further than this but this is a very very good first step i want to compliment and thank my friends and colleagues many of whom we've worked together on some pretty other some other very very monumental pieces of legislation this is really really important to send a signal not only to to do what's right and not contribute a dime to russia's economy particularly when it comes to oil but senate to send a message around the world that every single country should be doing this we have to tighten the news around russia's economy if we want to continue to deter him from killing innocent amazing courageous ukrainian citizens many of whom close to half were born after 1991 after they won their independence they know little of and want nothing of kremlin rule and we got to do everything we can as my colleagues said in our toolbox to make sure that we stand behind them unequivocally and unapologetically senator tester from montana it's been said already um putin is uh weaponized energy um i don't believe this country should be importing any thing from russia but the fact of the matter is is energy is something that putin depends upon for his finances and he's depending on it to fight this war in ukraine we see the tragedy that's happening in ukraine for the last week it is the very least that we can do to stop any energy imports into this country it will i think it will have a dramatic effect and will send even a bigger message that the united states is in this with the ukrainians for the long haul i just want to thank joe and lisa for bringing us together we almost got the band back together guys thank you very much uh if i could see i'd tell you who's next and john we'll talk portman it says um so nancy pelosi is with us which made me wonder what am i doing uh she's right yeah listen you've done something putin nobody else could do and uh so i want to thank joe and the whole squad up here uh for getting us behind an idea this long overdue but not too late so this will be a significant blow to putin's warship war machine a crippling blow would be if other countries would follow our lead so here's my call listen to what we're doing here in america and follow us to the extent you can uh lisa mentioned suing for peace putin's never going to sue for peace how does this end eventually the russian people have to decide to get rid of this guy as long as he's your leader you're going nowhere the world has turned a blind eye in a deaf ear to war crimes and murder and thievery for the past 20 years the ukrainian people have broken that cycle none of us are going to treat this like syria which was a disaster where we pump our you know beat our chest and forget about it this is about to become an insurgency cities will fall but the ukrainian people will not fall so this is an emergency declaration it's a really smart idea joe this is a national emergency we're going to suspend russian imports of oil during the emergency well i'm here to tell you this is going to go for a very long time this won't be weeks this could be years and what i hope will happen over time is that the world will follow our lead here if you hit him in the energy the oil gas sector of his economy he will fail never in the history of warfare has a bad guy been so exposed as putin is today the revenue from oil and gas keeps them afloat if we can isolate the oil and gas sector produce more here at home that will do more to end this war than any single thing i can think of well i'd like you to echo the gratitude of everybody to getting the band back together again joe lisa uh you know what uh in 2021 we we imported about 700 000 barrels of russian petroleum products per day present prices that's pretty close to 75 million dollars a day that's going to fund their war machine and i think the us as the leader of the free world and i'm old enough joe remember we used to talk about america leading the free world well one thing you can certainly say about joe biden is he has unified the free world uh in a way that has never happened before nato's never been so unified switzerland is now on board with this and i think if more people figure up figure out that they can follow the america's lead in banning the import of russian oil in response to putin's heinous actions it will make a significant difference and will accelerate the end of this of this tragedy uh you know my beef and i feel i have a very good friend in in denver uh who did two years in the peace corps in ukraine so i've been following he's been talking to me for the last several months and the beef is not with the russian people it's with putin and i think the sooner the russian people recognize that the world is against their leader that there will be that opportunity will come and there will be a a change but until then we've got to do everything we can in this country to make sure that we cut off those imports it's going to accelerate the transition we're already seeing from into sun driven energy and wind-driven energy water-driven energy that acceleration is only going to help make us more independent from these types of situations anyway who's rob so it's night time in ukraine and we will again see horrific images on our tv screens of artillery fire missiles being fired into cities like kharkiv and kiev they're hitting apartment buildings they're hitting hospitals they're hitting day care centers yesterday they even damaged the holocaust memorial in keith this is indiscriminate shelling that is killing thousands of civilians the numbers we have don't tell the whole story because there are people who are under rubble who we can't count there are children babies who are in nicu units that have had to leave the hospitals who we haven't counted this is an atrocity and the united states of america has an opportunity here not just to lead the free world but to help ukraine more and one way we can help the people of ukraine more is to tighten the news on the putin economy oil and gas fossil fuels is number one john mccain's famous saying this is a country of thugs runs a big gas station without those oil gas revenues the russian economy definitely craters so between 50 and 70 million bucks a day going to russia why does that make sense so of course i support this effort and i thank joe and lisa and fitz the house members josh who are with us with us today because this is important that we be bipartisan bicameral and actually get something done here it's not just about talking this is about a crisis people are dying i was in ukraine for the last congressional delegation gene shaheen and i led it it was in january the people we met with are now in bunkers fearing for their lives i've been to the line of contact the soldiers i met are now under fire some of them are dead these are the people who have turned to us i was in cleveland on sunday night at a rally a thousand people showed up in cleveland ohio ukrainians but also latvians and lithuanians and poles and people from all over eastern and central europe supporting this effort knowing that they've been under the thumb of russia before and the soviet union before and they're not going to put up with it they're going to fight but instead of having them fight to the death we need to help them be able to fight and survive and to be able to win so i thank you guys for what you're doing here i'm strongly in support of it we need to do much more by the way russia has most favored nation trading status with us they're in the world trade organization so we give them a preferential trade status with the united states of america that needs to end and we need to ask every country around the world to also end that status that would actually increase the tariff on oil by the way among other things but it's critical that we not just go on as if this is business as usual again tonight as these bombs are raining down on these cities and killing civilians we need at the very least to do everything we can to tighten that news to ensure that the people of russia at some point say enough yet we're not going to do this we're not going to be killing our innocent neighbors and suffering these economic consequences we're going to do something about the corrupt government in moscow thank you guys for doing this thank you well i'm going to read something just came out the white house deputy secretary which press secretary which i hope spoke on their own behalf and nobody else's behalf basically said we don't have a strategic interest in reducing the global supply of energy that would raise prices the gas pump for americans they're so wrong so wrong but if there's an inconvenience because we have to basically change the corporate model of where you get the products to do what they want to do and how they blend there's other places in the world other than putin and when you talk about an inconvenience can you imagine if you lived in ukraine right now i think it's a little bit more this is life or death and if they can't show that we can make some sacrifices in order to support them and stop the aggressions of this this horrible dictator these are innocent people what rob just told you we're seeing kids who are getting basically cancer treatment and unbelievable having a hard time getting a sterile place to do it all of us i mean my goodness for the sake of of humankind this is not right and for us to think it might be an inconvenience it's going to convince people it's going to be but we don't have a interest in reducing first of all we don't have to reduce we can basically produce whatever needs to be produced we just do our job get back to 12 million barrels a day doesn't displace anybody or anything i don't know what we're waiting on what those are such a big problem we have the natural gas more natural gas in almost any place in the world next to the middle east but yet if that's basically the desire that that this press secretary i'm not even saying this administration but this press secretary or deputy press secretary whoever it may be put out a statement like this is irresponsible let me just add on that because i i think it needs to be reinforced that our legislation is not a global ban on on on russian oil and gas it is just domestic and there's been press reports out there that if there were a global ban it would have a definite increase in the price we would see it here in this country as we would as they would in europe and in other places this is domestic for purposes of this emergency and so i think you've got a deputy press secretary that perhaps has not looked at what we're doing our actual ban on domestic import from from russia i spoke i'll just give you a few of the corporations that we spoke to and making sure that we understood that they understood conoco exxon chevron shell occidental and valero those are the biggest the biggest of the biggest that's basically support the american market they've all committed to everything humanly possible to adjust wherever their sourcing may be but have committed that basically they will absolutely pull away from russian products that's that's a strong statement from them and do it by minimizing if not in affecting the markets here because they have to make some logistic changes we did not reach back anything that might be coming this direction we did not reach back and stop it we said anything in the pipeline but what we will do is stop anything for the purchases that's what we're trying to do with that we'll take questions to anybody where you had bipartisan senators willing to put sanctions into place ostensibly that was undercut by the white house now you're telling us you have a bipartisan piece of legislation here to cut off this uh importation of oil from russia they seem to be undercutting that isn't this the second coming of that well i'm hoping that they did not understand as senator murkowski just pointed out to you they haven't seen or haven't read our legislation we just dropped the bill so the bills just dropped now i'm sure that they are aware of it by now they have it the white house has it they have it by now let's see what they do well let me just the sanction i'm not going to say that the strategy that was used there i'm sure lindsay can speak to it because he's involved on a day-to-day basis but as i understand that the sanctions and the reason they were they were trying to put basically the coalition of nato in order to do that they didn't want to basically get ahead of them they want everybody on board once ukraine once russia did what they did an invasion of ukraine then they were able to move that's what i'm understanding this is different than that this is absolutely different and think about what has happened since kind of the deal fell apart where there was supposedly a bipartisan deal and then the white house comes in and says no that was 10 days 12 days ago think about how the world has changed you have had you've got a unified group of allies and the world has changed with with sanctions out there chad to your specific question i mean i was one of the negotiators with with jim risch and a couple others on our side and this is entirely different i just read the quote from nancy pelosi i'm all for it ban it i mean our issue was we didn't have that kind of strong bipartisan support for pre-invasion sanctions which is what we wanted to do would have made a difference nobody can tell you that but it might have and now we are where we are so we got to go forward and i think be more unified and act more quickly and that's why i love again as i said earlier the fact that we've got the house and the senate republican and democrat all involved in this it's a different situation it has much much higher chance of success you have your hands up i'll go there and then garrett and we'll jump right do around have in this gas prices have been high since before russia invaded ukraine and a lot of the policies that president biden put in place got us there so at this point at what point would you push the president to reverse some of these policies whether it's killing the keystone pipeline banning drilling on federal lands among other things sounds like you're on my staff we've been pursuing this we really have we have to have an all-in-energy policy there's no doubt about it and i think what we see happening and and what has happened in the last two weeks is something beyond our belief we didn't think this would go to this event we thought it basically the might of that military would everyone would have backed down we've seen the strength of freedom of peace loving people with free we've seen that strength we've not seen that type of backbone for a long time in the world it's people willing to stand up and put their life online can you imagine putting your wife and your babies on a train for safety and you're going back in or people coming over or ukrainians that basically are going over there to fight now i don't think anyone ever thought that would happen so we have to rethink i would hope the administration would we're going to be talking to them in i think very civil tone that basically this is a time for america to stand tall you know they depend on us the world depends on us energy has been weaponized we have the ability to basically counter that weapon we really do and and that's what we're asking for if we're asking we've never seen i've never seen nato i never thought that in all honesty that germany would actually come up to pony up to the table for two percent of their gdp for defense i've never seen switzerland ever thought switzerland would get off the bench you know god love them they're just a peace loving people but enough's enough if you've moved switzerland off the bench then we better get off the bench i can tell you that and we're going to be moving everything that we had a hearing today as you know on on the fur some decisions they're making which we think is very detrimental to us and our ability to produce the energy independence that we need if the president were to come before the american public tomorrow and give a speech saying that we in this country need to embrace the role that we can take on as a full energy producer i think that that would do as much to send the signal to to help calm the markets to help address what we're seeing with the daily prices of fuel at the pump but right now the signal from this administration is we're going to keep ours in the ground and we're going to count on it from somewhere else and now we're realizing we've been counting on russia to help us with that that signal needs to be uncrossed i can't help myself no i mean your question is the right one and you know my view i'm not speaking for anybody here is this is about replacing russian oil with american and north american resources that this administration has stifled let's face it and it's executive order on public lands it's the decision to stop the keystone keystone by those 820 000 barrels per day so more than all the russian oil that has been coming in per day even at its height at about 700 000. so there's replacement right there now you know that's decision has been made where we are but there are things center mansion's absolutely right we can do to just get our production back up to where it was finally i've gotten a little heat on this issue from some folks saying that gosh that's bad for the environment because if you cut off russian oil then we've got to produce more here are you kidding who thinks that the russian oil is being produced in a more environmentally sound way than american oil it's it's gas it's i mean they've got methane flares all over the country you know you can go online and look at the map of the world and you see the methane coming out of it it's much dirtier in terms of how they produce it then they got to send it here by ship which creates a lot of co2 so the notion that somehow this is going to be bad for the environment if we cut off russian oil just the opposite it will lead to fewer emissions and also has obvious national security implications right now during this crisis i'll give you an example we have one pipeline mountain valley pipeline if that pipeline is 95 built they could finish it within two to six months that pipeline would deliver 2 billion bcf billion cubic feet a day two billion cubic feet to go into the market to go to basically lngs to go to cove point to be sent overseas immediately we could do that so we have the ability to do what needs to be done yes my question is actually for senator pesky because i think you are starting to address this in a point you made earlier this legislation wouldn't take any oil out of the global markets it's just a ban on u.s imports of russian oil but because of it energy markets are global somebody will buy all those barrels of russian oil via india or china or someone else so i guess in terms of punishing putin how does this do anything to do that other than keep our hands clean of buying his oil first of all i think that there is a moral obligation here i don't want u.s dollars to be funding this this carnage in ukraine led by putin i i think all of us should agree that that is not where we go now there is it is a global supply out there but it is not it is not a supply without limitation now we're going to be pushing to to do everything that we can to get production up in this country despite some of the policies that have been put in place that have held us back others will likely be trying to do the same but you can't turn this on a dime and so in the meantime you're you're going to see around around the globe pinch points and what we all need to be doing is making sure that that pinch point is felt most most forcefully in russia directly to to putin's accounts so what we can do here in this country because because we are poised to produce more if just given the right signal we can help ameliorate the pressure on us we can help ameliorate the pressure on our allies but not if not if we just continue to say well we're just going to keep doing what we've been doing and effectively reward putin that's wrong let me jump in and say this first of all the market's shrinking there's very few people that are buying russian products they're moving away every day so you mentioned two billion people in india hold on that's fine that's fine but that's a that's a smaller market with less cost he's going to be punished because he will not get the price he's getting he's now playing the best price of the market he has his market has shrunk dramatically okay so if you only had one game in town i knew i could only sell to you you'd be a little bit tougher to deal with i know that but with that we're sending a very strong signal and we're saying a strong signal to our allies too we're not disrupting the world distribution is that the missing piece of it is this more effective if 20 other countries step forward countries are stepping forward everywhere humanly possible they need backfilled we should be able to have be that backfield and that's what we're working on and there shouldn't be any the lng we're going from eight percent up to thirteen percent getting there quickly we can go further than that if we do we have oceans of energy we have to use that it's a political weapon today i mean not a political weapon what political weapon has more a weapon period a weapon of war is what he's using it for and basically no extreme it is more effective if you have others that jump in but not everybody else has the ability to do the backfill and so they're looking to us and saying can't you help us what are you sitting on your hands you know asking us to keep keep taking it from russia no they're looking to us and saying you've got the ability to do more to help all of us so do it north stream north stream twos is charged okay ready to go by the will of the germans and the little europeans they shut it down that shows the resolve they have now we they we just i mean someone's got to help them and as quickly as we possibly can let me say i know we could go on all day long i got i'm gonna just hold on one second i i really like and then afterwards i want to say i want brian basically we've all heard and and our hearts go out and i just want everyone to take a moment of thinking about ukrainian people as we said here today and the safety we have in the defense of our country and uh think about these human beings are basically thrust in a war zone to where their children are at risk they're at risk their way of life's at risk their homes are gone think about that changed all in one week for you for you and me we don't and we had someone out there who's always been our friend he said man i wish my friend come help me i really wish my friend would come that's really what they're at brian why don't you basically in in his own native language language it's um you know it's just before 10 o'clock uh in kiev knight has fallen uh president zielinski mayor klitschko members of the rada members of the press are all wearing kevlar if they can find it arms carrying arms if they have them available um ukraine's independence is 30 years old they're a very young country and we were a very young democracy at one point our democracy we all know is 245 years old and we're the oldest democracy on the planet and ukraine and the world are now seeing how hard it is to remain free in an era where evil is rampant across the globe and for all of our friends in ukraine slavo karina as i say the rallying cry glory be to ukraine well yeah i think about i've never seen anything more more bipartisan support than i've seen for this in a bicameral way that quickly that quickly we did it one day one day and basically when you have nancy pelosi saying this is something she would support women hold on foreign oh no we're willing to talk about anything the bottom line is the production of fossil fuels right now i mean wind and solar is not going to put natural gas over there and okay that's we have to be realistic what we're trying to do here the bottom line is we can go from 11 11 million to 12 million overnight overnight if they use less we can build a pipeline in two to six months against two billion bcf we can do that but the people that are fighting and taking to court all the time and basically administration needs to step up and help us on that and absolutely we have to go forward with our with our climate with our climate solutions i'm all for that i've always been off of that but it's not in policy i'm not going to throw one out to win it for the other you need a horsepower to run a country you need a horsepower to be the superpower of the world and be able to have your allies depend on you and we haven't been there for that we've throttled back and never throttled back up that's all i'm saying and i'll just say this for my own i would i would gladly if if there was a poll being taken he said joe would you pay 10 cents more gallon to support the people of ukraine and stop basically the support of russia i would gladly pay 10 cents more a gallon senator mentioned do you think people will feel that way after they've been told for months by everyone in congress inflation is attacked it's a heavy profit is attacked this is war will people believe that i have to ask them take a poll okay

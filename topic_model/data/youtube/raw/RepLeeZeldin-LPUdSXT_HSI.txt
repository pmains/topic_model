call or you have a comment press star 3 so we'll we'll get started and bring on our our first phone call it's from Michael Michael Kinney here yeah hey Michael yes how you doing Lee Zeldin hey thanks for going home thank you I just didn't expect to be first you turn me off I wanted to thank you and Europe especial will helping me with my second lemon issue with Brookhaven of Japan corpus I was a vet and I was running into problems with documentation and it took a couple of years but you guys stepped in and fix it quick and that's another reason why I voted for you to show second amendment pro-second amendment my question really is um I I was very very disturbed and I did vote for Trump but I was very disturbed when he said what he said as far as due process comes after um due process is first one can in referencing our second rent rights and taking guns away from people that may be perceived as not having any business in having them but that doesn't come from an officer and a law with all due respect that comes from the dish's judicial system and I wanted to be assured that you would do your part to remind our president that due process does not come second yeah well Michael I mean I totally agree with you a due process is incredibly important and as you're asking the question I was thinking about the debate over that you know no-fly no-buy I mean I have there 535 members of Congress and we I don't know a member of Congress who is in favor of a terrorist being able to purchase a firearm or explosive but one of the the main proposal that was getting pushed when my colleagues were saying no-fly no-buy was a proposal that would make the purchaser have to prove that they are not a terrorist as opposed to having a process in place where a a purchaser is given notice and a hearing and right to counsel and there is due process and the burden is on the government to show that someone is a known or suspected terrorist so you know that the due process is incredibly important you know there was a debate that that took place about a year ago because there was a an eleventh-hour regulation that was imposed at the very end of the Obama administration where essentially anyone who had a designated payee for Social Security like if you have someone else designated to be a payee for your Social Security benefit that you would lose your second Amendment rights based off of that now the defenders of that would say and and the many of them still to this day say that this is that was a proposal to make sure that Tooley ill don't purchase firearms it wasn't specific to the mentally ill it was that anyone who was a payee what who had a designated payee someone else a loved one a kid a friend for their Social Security benefit that doesn't mean that you're mentally ill and all of a sudden you should lose your second Amendment rights so it's important that you know we're doing what we need to do smart policy to keep people safe there were so many balls that were dropped in parkland at different levels of government the system that's currently in place just not working and you know people who are saying Nicholas Cruz should not have had access to a particular kind of firearm I'll say a guy who shows that I don't care if he's you know 19 or 89 anyone who is showing all those threats and indicators they should not have access to to any firearm I mean Cruz was very clear and specifically stating that he had ever used manifesting all the intention of murdering with his with his firearm so you know in that particular case when you're manifesting an intent to murder with your firearm you should have access to none rules already on the books that that could have prevented it law enforcement needs to work together and that could have been prevented so those are a few thoughts though about I mean go back to the original point about due process it's incredibly important so important and I do strongly support individual Second Amendment rights to be able to protect themselves their loved ones that that's very important so uh by the way I wanted to give a shout out we we had we have a miss Kelly mrs. Smith Kelsey's Hampton Bays high school class is on the line give an extra credit for being on participating tonight to tell Town Hall so thank you to miss cows and all the high school students who are on board with tonight's call so again anyone has any calls any questions throughout the call just press star three date/time so we're bringing Dan hello Dan hi Lee how are you good how are you feeling good I wanted to ask how you can help the rid the Bellport high school ms-13 we know that there is a presence there they did it awesome job and central islip engaging the police and all the different resources and we need to help also here in Bellport well yeah I mean ms-13 issue is a is a huge issue locally nationally it's been a big focus of the the Trump administration of President as you know is been to Suffolk AG sessions has been the Suffolk the US attorney for the Eastern District has brought charges against many it's it's a product of working with local law enforcement whether it's the the subject police detectives D at the DEA all levels of government working together to crack down on ms-13 part of this has to do with that coordination that goes on between different agencies working well together part of it has to do with our immigration policies where for example we set up a kid for failure when they come as an unaccompanied minor their parent turns them over for a dangerous mission to the United States when they get here they are sent to they can be sent to a foster family in an area that might have the most amount of transient transiency the lowest graduation rate the higher amount of gang recruitment so the unaccompanied minor program for example that's just one example of where we're setting up kids for failure and we've seen multiple examples all now and where people have ended up inside of ms-13 it's also the specific crimes need to be crack down on drug trafficking sex trafficking the human trafficking aspect of it goes on right here on the island so that is an important aspect I introduced a bill this is just one of many different things that need to get done but we are seeing people who are applying they're receiving naturalization in the United States and then they're committing crimes as gang members I believe that they should lose their naturalization if they are gang members but you know that's just me I feel strongly about that I introduced a bill called protecting our communities from gang violence act HR fifty sixty five that's one bill someone continue to work with all the different your agencies whether it's appropriations in Congress immigration bills that are getting passed to fix our broken immigration system anything I can do at all to help is really important so thanks about it thanks for asking about ms-13 it's a really important issue and again anyone who wants to participate in tonight's call just just press star 3 and now we're going to bring Noor on hello Nora hi Lee how you doing this historians from New York State Public Employees Federation and I'm in our district hospital in regards to the opioid epidemic I realized that lots of funding keeps being you know funneled toward this crisis and I see that the police are arresting more and more of the drug dealers and things of that nature I'm not seeing in the hospital setting that the people themselves who are taking the drugs who are addicted are actually getting the help that they need and again I work in the neonatal intensive care at Stony Brook and mother's we've lost several mothers this year who were inpatient and stopped using for awhile went back out on the street and overdosed leaving the children orphaned so I'm just want yet I don't see that there's actually treatment centers that are available there's long waiting lists for people who are in need and I'm just wondering if we if there are any plans to build facilities that people can actually get the treatment they need in a timely fashion before they die well thanks for what you do for for helping everyone in need and very close to to my heart the effort at the NICU in Stony Brook my daughters are born in the NICU down in Georgetown and I had a meeting today with I had four former three and four-star generals and we were talking about the future of diplomacy in the military and foreign affairs and I expressed to them that the number one issue that we have in Congress with our federal government the one mandatory function constitutionally is to provide for a comment and even though this wasn't part of the meeting I said but if you yeah if you really wanted to ask me about it a little bit further I would say combating the heroin and opioid abuse epidemic is getting pretty close and it's I've personally been to way too many weeks and I going to just one is too many but I've been to way too many weeks the top priority last Congress was passing the comprehensive addiction and Recovery Act otherwise known as Cara I was a co-sponsor of it did multiple press conferences to push it we got it passed signed into law which is great and now Cara being law we have to make sure that it is properly funded every years or going through the appropriations process it is very important to get people help if you save them it with a lot of focus on narcan for example as I'm sure you're very familiar with narcan can reverse an overdose within minutes but if you're not getting that person the help that they need they can go right back to using going back to the time when I was in the state Senate I helped pass something called I stopped in New York State to try to bring up this 24 which by the way has you know it certainly can benefit from further improvements but it was it was something they to crack down on dr. shopping and you know and also we're seeing issues in pharmacies there are federal investigations into pharmacies as well you know a doctor wants to help someone with you know try to save money on a copay so you give them 90 days worth of a prescription instead of 30 and you know that medicine cabinets getting completely filled up with all different kinds of different medications and staying there you have unwanted expired unused medication that ends up sitting in a medicine cabinet and that's one of the ways that we have our kids and others start using so you know I also have co-sponsored I've hosted the shed the meds events where people can get rid of their unwanted expired unused medication we have to get people you're working with the insurance companies it's it's very important that that individuals are able to get the help that they need insurance companies aren't just kicking someone out in the street or giving them a certain standard of care that isn't going to help them actually recover Oasis enforcement at the state level because you have sober homes and other locations where individuals go for help and the quality there is not at an acceptable minimal standard so someone goes into a local home for help to get out of what they're going through and while while they're there they're actually surrounded an environment that makes it even worse for using so you know I think increasing the standard and enforcement of silver homes are important important I mean this could go on and I've met with the DEA FBI DEA FBI where they were they're talking about just internationally the illegal substances that come across our country come into our country from international they need more tools to in order to be able to crack down on it we're where you're talking about the International aspect many times when we talk about border security or people entering our country what often gets lost in that is this is also a legal substance substance substances as well so those are just many different thoughts that that come to mind you know just briefly recapping its making sure the care is funded that law enforcement has some of the tools that they're asking for better increasing the standards and effectiveness of sober homes getting insurance companies to make sure that people are getting to the beds they need for the time necessary you know and the further implementation of I stopped and improving on whatever needs to get improved but cutting down on doctor shopping and cracking down on pharmacies that aren't doing what they're supposed to be doing and there is a heroin and opioid abuse epidemic in this country that needs to needs to be dealt with but thanks for raising the important question and thank you again for for what you do with the other local NICU so we have poll questions we're having poll questions throughout tonight's call so after our next caller we'll get started with our first our first poll question of the night and thank you everyone participating if you have any questions just dial star 3 at at any time and we're gonna bring Joe good evening congressman Zeldin how are you I'm doing well how are you I am doing okay I am a full-time commercial and potty charter boat fisherman out of Santa Marys New York and we've been in and out of your office in Patchogue myself and a group of the other fishermen and guys that make a living fishing on merges Bay over the last few years trying to get something done with the dredging of moriches Inlet and with these last three bad Nor'easters in March the inlet has just about closed itself off this pictures of it up all over on Facebook in and all over social media online with the sand pretty much filling up just about half of the inlet between the jetties and a tremendous bar on the outside preventing boats from transiting in and out of the inlet and you know with the good part of the season coming up is eight full-time fisherman and moriches three party charter boats there's over ten marinas bait tackle shops and it looks like they are gonna have a very tough season and may even be a beheading coach going out of business due to the lack of maintenance and and the need for dredging in merges Inlet and we're just trying to find out what can be done if there's any emergency action that can be taken to to clear the inland and allow us to go back to work yeah and I appreciate you raising it here on the call it's all over my radar as a matter of fact earlier today we sent a request in to the Army Corps of engineer where I am personally asking for an emergency dredge to be done of Murchison wit I've seen the pictures we forwarded the pictures a meeting actually tomorrow in my DC office with Colonel Asbury who is in charge of the Army Corps of Engineers for our entire region so I'm going to be raising this issue with him when we meet I am very familiar with riches in wit it's a it's a situation that really I mean I'm a guru up on the mastic peninsula I mean I've been familiar with this inlet since I was five or six years old you know I know that there's been a long history of it being difficult navigating inside of the bay navigating inside the inlet especially if you're not timing it right with tides coming in and out but the situation right now is just it's obvious ridiculous came and compared it to anything in the past which I believe there's a just by looking at the pictures of what's going on there make and it makes an incredibly strong argument as to why there needs to be an emergency dredge now the first response that we got today was that there isn't funding for it I am really happy that it just so happens I have my meeting with Colonel Asbury tomorrow because I'm going to raise it as a really important imperative issue for them to go out to see for themselves we're also reaching out to the local Coast Guard because in this situation it's not just an Army Corps issue because of the need for the dredging but it's also a navigational issue so hopefully the Coast Guard can weigh in in support too I know we had a meeting scheduled that ended up like right one that storm one of the Nor'easters ended up hitting so I know that my Patchogue office is trying to reschedule the merchants inlet meeting hopefully we have army corps representatives there but I want to really get an answer tomorrow if at all possible but I really appreciate bringing it up here thanks for your advocacy on social media you know keep sending the pictures to me it helps for me to be able to forward all of those pictures all of your information into the Army Corps to the Coast Guard because they'll be seeing whatever you're seeing in real time so thanks again Joe let's work together on it and please stay in touch with my Patchogue office on it and hopefully we'll be able to make some progress when I talk to the Army Corps tomorrow all right so we have our first poll question of the night we have a few of them but the first one of the night is which issue is most important to you so I'm going to read off a bunch of options with keys you'll one through nine and even zero but I'll read through the list twice the question is which issues are most important to you press one for economy or jobs press two for Foreign Affairs or terrorism press three for taxes for for infrastructure five for immigration or border security six for healthcare seven for veterans eight for the environment nine for spending or debt or zero for education which issue is most important to you press one for economy or jobs - for Foreign Affairs or terrorism three for taxes for for infrastructure five for immigration or border security six for healthcare seven veterans eight environment nine spending or debt or zero for education so we'll look for thanks for everybody for participating and I look forward to checking out the the results and we'll keep on going through the callers and bring in Virginia Oh Virginia hi Lee I just had a quick question about infrastructure I just wanted to ask if you had spoken to the administration and advocated pour some of the transportation needs we face on Long Island to stay economically strong you know transportations pretty vital so with New York City instituting congestion pricing we don't have a lot of ways off the islands so I was just wondering if you had spoken to them about extending the runways of macarthur or bridge or tunnel to connecticut or new york yeah I actually just had a the first part is off of off of Long Island but important for our region I just had a meeting a couple hours ago with the speaker of the New York and New Jersey delegation with regards to a gateway project which is a really important project for our region you have these aging tunnels that if you look in Northeast Corridor in a cell lines of Amtrak or is those are the only two profitable routes of the entire Amtrak system nationally the project needs to get done and there's a little bit of a debate battle going on right now to the house the Senate in the White House so we're going to keep working through that on Long Island closer to home I have one of the things that we did I introduced something called the safe bridges act which was added to an infrastructure bill which changes the federal formula in order to get money for our state and local bridges so what had happened in maybe 2011 or 2012 the federal government passed an infrastructure bill we're no longer would we be receiving money for state or local bridges which would have the effect of a quarter billion dollars less money for New York State local bridges but we have just under a hundred functionally obsolete structurally deficient bridges just in the first congressional district we were able to secure 26 million dollars for the hospital Road bridge to revitalize and widen the bridge that projects 80% federally-funded so that's important from the from the bridge standpoint as far as MacArthur goes right now we're we got the the need for a an international custom station if we're able to add international flights we have gotten funding for runways in throughout the district throughout Suffolk County that funding is there as far as MacArthur goes it's going to be I mean if they were to they should have really put the terminal on the north side where it would have been right next to the tracks where JFK you can take a train to JFK and MacArthur Airport you can take a train and then you have to get in a cab in order to get to the the terminal where if they built the terminal on the other side that would have helped out I know that ISIL town has been working hard for years and trying to get additional planes to fly out of McArthur they have Frontier Airlines there you'll see where the future is of Islip Airport you know as far as there being a tunnel or a bridge between Long Island and Connecticut that should have gotten done a long time ago would have been a heck of a lot cheaper to do it then than it is now and we you know at the point now it would be great if there was a way for us to get from Long Island to Connecticut there's going to be people who will complain about it especially if you you put it in you know one place you know or another that might be far worse than some of the alternatives there is Mindy ISM going on all across Long Island people would love to have a tunnel or bridge getting connected to somewhere other than their neighborhood the infrastructure has to support it but yeah those are those are a few thoughts that come to mind I would certainly love to see I would really wish that it happened a long time ago that's why 1:35 ends abruptly the way it does because supposed to go to to Connecticut those are a few thoughts we also have federal money that has come to help the the efforts to connect the railroad into Manhattan 2nd Avenue subway when I was in the state Senate getting money for the second track between Ronkonkoma in Farmingdale that was big too so a lot of different infrastructure projects and conversations that take place since I first actually stood in the first kind of the state Senate but thanks for the question and we'll go to the second poll question which is do you approve of the job I am doing in Congress do you would prove of the job I'm doing in Congress press 1 for yes two for no or three undecided you approve of the job I am doing in Congress press 1 for yes two for no or three for undecided and Ezer you're answering will go on to the the next question and we'll look forward to being able to fill everyone in on the results of our few different poll questions as we go along so next we'll graph Francis well Francis J this is James Francis husband ah it sounds like we got that the last color to us at Virginia and I heard a melon would go down I'm calling because of this shooting down in Florida and all this criticism of the NRA NRA had nothing to do with this shooting mural about gun safety but what I'd like to know is we keep hearing about how many people drop the ball at this could have been prevented but I don't hear about anybody being held accountable for it and what's being done to hold people accountable so that this doesn't happen again yeah there are a lot of balls dropped with the law enforcement and there was a great Sunday morning interview with Jake Tapper and a Broward County Sheriff it was like a 28 29 minute interview that sheriff needs to resign I have there are so many other examples all across our entire country where there was a situation to deal with to respond to well-trained law enforcement have their instincts their training their courage kick in and they resolve the situation and they keep people safe yeah I saw it where you know we you know Steve Scalise ended up getting shot but if not for the heroism and the good work of the Capitol Police officers who engaged with their their firearms they were using pistols against much more a much more lethal weapon targeting them if not for their heroism there would have been two dozen more members of Congress and and staffers who were there as well because they were trapped inside of the ball field so as far as accountability goes in Broward County you saw the school resource officer resigned but there needs to be a swift a thorough but swift investigation and accountability with regards to any of those share any of those deputy sheriff's and especially the the main sheriff of Broward County he shouldn't be there and when he was put on the spot budget during an interview about whether or not he should resign he started praising his own leadership so completely tone-deaf it doesn't even seem like he's going to learn the lessons of what had happened and prevent it from happening again and as far as the the FBI goes you know it's it's really important for and Congress has an oversight function to figure out exactly what was shared where the ball was dropped and not not just lessons learned but if we're ever necessary for there to to be accountability at all levels of government because the law enforcement at all levels of government ended up failing and there are a lot of great people in law enforcement who are there because they love their country their community they're there for all the reasons they want to do the right thing but there there was a lot of failure and incompetency in this particular situation ended up costing precious young lives their their future their their lives their family their community ended up getting devastated by that that conduct so there certainly needs to be accountability I completely agree with you and one for sment actually had all of the resources it needed to prevent parkland from even happening in the first place so thanks for thanks for your question and as we go through the poll questions will also fill you in on the results so like the first question that we asked which issue is most important to you the top was immigration of border security at 32% number two with taxes at 13% health care was 11% economy our jobs 9% environment 7% spending or debt six education six veterans six infrastructure six Foreign Affairs or terrorism five and the I just asked do you prove of the job I'm doing in Congress 62% of you said yes 17% said no 21% said undecided and before we bring on our next caller and thank you everybody for participating the next poll question do you believe our country is on the right track or wrong track press 1 for right track press 2 for wrong track do you believe our country is on the right track or the wrong track press 1 for right track or 2 for wrong track now we also have some questions that are coming in online so throughout the call we have a couple of questions that came in with regards to the shooting that we just discussed Mac's asks what are your opinions on Long Island and America's youth taking charge on gun control reform Lindsay says hi I'm Lindsay Haynes from Hampton Bays High School and I was wondering what your thoughts are on the recent school shootings and your plans regarding school safety so thank you to Max and Lindsay for asking your questions online that is very cool of you to be participating that way we actually just had a bill pass on the floor today and it's called the stop school violence act if you want to look it up online it's HR for 9:09 stop school violence act now give you a little bit of background so the house has passed us a couple hours ago helps school personnel and law enforcement personnel identify and prevent violence in schools authorizes 500 million for state based grants administered by the DOJ to support evidence based violence prevention programs in every middle or and high school across the country these grants support a range of proactive strategies for identifying and preventing school targeted violence including evidence based training anonymous reporting systems threat assessments intervention teams and increase coordination between schools and local law enforcement so train school personnel local law enforcement students would be able to better identify warning signs and intervene to stop violence and suicide to develop and implement these anonymous reporting systems for threats of school violence in coordination with local law enforcement and to train and operate school threat assessment intervention teams to preemptively triage threats before tragedy hits so the programs that they provide grant support and will provide important significant improvements to school security again parkland could have totally have been prevented with the laws on the books but whatever we can do all levels of government in our local communities our schools what our our schools do to help secure schools are very important so everyone has an important role to play here in order to learn lessons and that my background is the military that's one of the one of the great things about our military is something we do called after after-action reports learning our lessons from what happened to prevent tragedy again and we also have to do a better job enforcing the laws that are already on the books I remember one year where the Department of Justice had over a thousand attempted illegal purchases of firearms and in that year the DOJ only prosecuted forty-one of them that's the laws that are already on the books and that you know I think it's I think it's really good at - Max's question what are your opinions on long island in America's youth taking charge on gun control reform I I think it's very it's great when people are inspired to be involved we have high school students on tonight's call get involved in government advocate advocate on causes that you believe passionately on I would I would say it's it's best when you're able to do do all of your homework on the issue Get Smart so you're you're able to debate and effectively advocate to convince people to think the way that you think but also be open minded and hearing why there may be disagreement because I would say on this issue what happens too much you have people who talk past each other and not to each other I've been I'm ever having one room where there was seven people in the room this is just a couple weeks ago there's seven people in the room who all wanted to talk about guns and they all wanted to see new laws get passed and four of the people in the room would you know they would ask a question and they would want to hear the answer and they would want to engage in a productive conversation not talking past each other but to each other to try to find common ground but then there were other people in the room who are actually trying to use the issue as a political wedge where they just didn't want to hear anything that I had to say they just wanted to you know just kind of heckle and that's just not the right way to make progress on any issue that you're passionate about it's really disingenuous it's it's important it's greatly unfortunate as well but we just so we're going to ask you the fourth poll questions we have five poll questions on the call the the fourth question is do you approve of the job that President Trump is doing s14 yes press two for no or three for undecided do you approve of the job that President Trump is doing press 1 for yes two for no or press three for undecided and we'll go to our next caller in the meantime while you're answering its Michael hello Michael hi good evening congressman diligent how are you great how are you I'm great thanks I guess first and foremost I just want to thank you for representing our districts with class so I appreciate that my question is regarding the gridlock in Washington I believe that the biggest threat to our country is the unproductivity coming out of Washington I know that you recently sponsored two bipartisan bills regarding the living will and the severely disabled vet so I applaud you for that I'm just curious what would be your advice to your fellow congressmen to work across the aisle and what efforts do you plan on undertaking to continue doing that in the future well you know I'll tell you there there is there is partisanship in Washington and there are also things that get done in Washington with regards to the partisanship I mean it's real it happens and especially as you get closer to an election you'll see more partisanship not less but what's been really interesting what I've done a few times is I'll be in a room and this particular conversation is taking place and I'll ask my first term the 114th Congress 2015 and 2016 I'll say now take a guess how many bills and everyone who's on this call you can all answer this question to yourself when I ask how many bills would you say were passed in the hundred 14th Congress Republican Congress and we're signed by a Democratic president and the answer that I get most often is zero people by the way will very confidently say zero now the answer was actually over 350 and he's included bills that reauthorized the Zadroga Act to overhaul sustainable growth rate to prevent increases to Medicare a five-year fully funded highway bill and education reauthorization there there were real substantive bills I mean that mixi also have bills that rename post offices which you know is an important tribute for you know for that veteran who's getting a post office renamed after them but they're also huge you know nationally significant bills that got passed there's a Drug Act for example everybody was talking about the drug act when the partisan bickering was preventing it from getting passed and then when it actually got passed it wasn't news and if were to turn on the national news right now I'm having no idea what's on Fox CNN and MSNBC as I'm saying this but there's a good chance that is not a positive story it's possible I mean I'm not saying that's what happens 100% of the time but I wish it sold more when people were able what you know if if media was telling us about what good was happening in our government so I will I will cosign op eds with Democrats and I will co-sponsor bills with Democrats and we'll do press conferences together will sign a proprietary quest where you know I find an op-ed with Grace mang on giving our surplus bunker-buster bombs to Israel I led a letter to get money for Sea Grant which was successful in fully funding Sea Grant last year which is really important especially for a coastal economy like what what we have my adult a health care bill actually passed the House yesterday and it's going to President Trump for his signature that was a product of Republicans and Democrats working together on the House Veterans Affairs Committee and House in the Senate so you know we need to have more bipartisan agreement where common ground can be found that doesn't mean that you know that we're going to Amin where this isn't utopia where you're going to get 535 people to help be unanimous on on an appropriations bill I mean people are going to be on happy if you're passing a bill to fund the government for example there's going to be disagreement but you always have to be trying to in good faith pursue common ground however possible some people are unreasonable they believe that the only version of compromise that's acceptable is when they get their way 100 percent of the time that really isn't compromise and that person needs to do some self-reflection but you know I will say there is too much partisanship but it's not total and whatever we can do to make progress is is really important but great question great comment so so thank you and I'll give you the the answers to question three and four question three was do you believe our country is on the right track or wrong track 62% said right track and 38% said wrong track do you approve of the job that President Trump is doing 63% said yes 30 percent said no 7% said undecided so again thanks to everybody for participating and one more shout-out to miss Kelsey's Hampton Bays high school class for being on the call I think that's a great idea of future tella town halls to get more participation from our great high school students from all across the other districts so a great idea there in Hampton Bays school district our last poll question of the night is would you like to sign up to receive email newsletters from my office so it's just a one option if the answer is yes if you'd like to sign up to receive email newsletters from my office press one you press one yeah you'd be choosing to sign up to receive the updates that my office sends out over email to stay connected with what's going on in our country Congress and locally so okay so we're going to get we're just going to keep answering questions as they come in next one is Frank get hello congressman Zeldin yes sir how are you tonight I'm doing well I just wanted to give you a little recommendation if you're going to be walking across the aisles to shake hands with the Democrats that you might want to get your army fatigues on your helmet before you do that uh yeah I'll tell you there are there are some really good members on the other side of the aisle and there are some other members who are impossible to work with and I'm not I'm also not going to suggest that you know even everyone on my own side of the aisle is you know perfect to work with there are reasonable people on both sides and you know I found I mentioned that you know leading the effort with Joe Courtney of Connecticut there's a lot that I disagree with Joe Courtney on I mean we vote on the opposite side of a whole bunch of issues but that doesn't mean that where my district borders the Long Island Sound and his district borders the Long Island Sound that we can't work on an important issue for a while on sound so you know some people they just refuse to talk to the other side I let's say where you can find allies you can find common ground where your best representing your constituents you know go for it I'm all for it now understand yes sir I did I just note that as kind of just to be funny but I my real question had to do with immigration illegal immigration specifically um you know yeah it's just nationally obviously I think there is there needs to be some support of President Trump in really stopping illegal immigration and locally what I was concerned about locally is that you know my understanding is that there are many areas in Long Island and probably in your congressional district that support sanctuary status and sanctuary cities and also maybe there may be illegal immigrants in my community here and maybe some of their children are going to go into the school districts in Smithtown and taxpayers are bearing the burden for that and I think mayors and governors and university presidents that support sanctuary cities and sanctuary statuses is a blatant disregard of federal law and something needs to be done about this and they need to be prosecuted yeah I'm with yet you know we saw what's on it what happened in Oakland where the mayor ends up giving notice to all of these in arming public notice to everybody where ice was about to perform a raid where you're putting those great ice agents into danger for their own physical safety when you're telling people who they're about to do the raid on that ice is coming to be able to in order to enforce a detainer order you know or whatever other action is that is leaving a nice agent to come to their house in Denver you had a situation where someone who is in our country illegally is involved in a fatal hit-and-run about a week ago just over a week ago please the scene in the person sometimes of dying as a result of that accident Denver so the ice puts out a detainer order they put out a request for notification and days later Denver releases this person there's a legal immigrant and then 65 minutes later not beforehand but 65 minutes after the release they tell ice that they've released this person the sanctuary City policies that we see around our country are are so wrong the federal government is responsible for creating immigration law in this country and where you have local politicians pandering for votes and refusing to assist world.if feel different levels of government should be working together in order to crack down on illegal immigration you're putting our great law enforcement officers at risk you are making a broken immigration system even more broken than it was before I have colleagues who celebrate illegal immigration they want to reward illegal immigration as opposed to stopping it so as the president has mentioned his desire to find a permanent solution with regards to daca he has said that we have to at the same time tackle other aspects here because if not you'll end up actually increasing the amount of legal immigration whether it's intentional or unintentional and I agree that we have a broken immigration system that your border security is part of it interior enforcement certain rules have to change and that we also be working together to to try to to get it done so I appreciate your question an important one it sounds like you and I are on the the same same page with yep we'll bring in a roast hello rose hello the fishing industry will be devastated when Trump's donors oil rigs get built and our pumping catching fire and collapsing are you in favor of the offshore drilling that Trump wants all on the coastline with the exception of Florida because mar-a-lago is there well I appreciate the the question the I mean I I have I just hosted a an offshore drilling hearing with the Department of Interior a couple weeks ago really well intended hundred attended hundreds of locals showing off to voice their opposition I I don't support the this proposal that would allow offshore drilling off the coast of Long Island it's really important to note that it isn't even known that we even have oil oil and gas resources off of our coast so the danger that can because just searching for something that doesn't even exist off of our coast that's one of the the reasons why I have been working closely with my friend Ryan's Enki trying to get him to listen to my concerns and those locally here on the island because I've heard it from from everybody really its Young Republicans and Democrats environmentalists business leaders local elected officials everyone seems to be on the same page that there needs to be a change made in the next draft of this proposal and you know I I feel strongly that that that needs to get done I'm hoping at the next draft towards the end of the year incorporates the request that's being made by Long Islanders I'm hoping that our concerns are being heard I want to say that they are but until I actually see a draft that make the changes that were advocating for just got to keep on fighting and thank you if anyone on this call participated in that offshore drilling hearing that took place it was really well attended so so thank you and we're gonna bring in asking hello Anthony hello me hurt have you hang on hang on a second please I just got turned to by him up or can you hear me yes sir yeah uh you and I go back a long ways I used to be the Chamber of Commerce president for mr. Kelly Oh eighty-five forty five years ago when you ran we probably did too I remember he could what was that the that the old lad Akins sight yep okay i won yeah you know one of the things you had posted something on Manorville in to 13 or to 15 that demand vote would have the stuff for us to do our x-rays and stuff I'm 88 years old now and for me to drive oil into North Port it's a three and a half hour ride on Long Island and I can't imagine what the people out east - so I haven't I haven't made it in there now and over a month and I gotta get things done and I have to have x-rays and stuff done and I thought that was the place that you had decided in Manorville and Peconic Bay Hospital yes so we will say a few things one is we can just we can personally work with you directly to get you whatever assistance at all is available so for example I have someone in my Patchogue office Cleveland Johnson who is full-time just working on Veterans constituent work the Peconic Bay Medical Center has a site in Manorville that had that's just part of the VA Choice Program that veterans go there to receive a whole host of different services that they otherwise would have to go to north port in order to receive so what we'll do is I'll make sure I'm just making a note we'll make sure to reach out to you separately independent of the call to work with you to get you set up I would just also add that something that the VA is been working on is expanding something called C box where they have other sites throughout Long Island that would be more convenient than going all the way to North port especially as they expand their C box to have new services that is even more of a reason why you be able to go to we have one location Riverhead for example we have one location in Patchogue as another example there are others all throughout Long Island so the C box will pay do provide another opportunity for you so I'm going to have someone from my office call you separately to make sure we get you set up and very importantly thank you for or your service as a better country one more question along with that you know we have the choice availability all right but you got to go to the VA we will go through the VA to get a choice card I have a full choice I have a choice card but suggestion was made that people should go ask their doctors if they accept choice and start letting them understand that maybe to get a whole lot more customers and there should be one choice card and we can make the calls to find out if they accept choice or not if we can't find out then we will call there and have them suggest something yeah well and I am supportive of a veteran being able to bring their VA benefit to any provider they wish I feel like you veteran served our country you've earned that VA benefit if you want to go to save Northport VA to get your services god bless you when you go you should have the highest standard of care quality of service possible if you for whatever reason don't want to maybe you live in Montauk maybe you live in orient maybe it's going to be a full day try yeah in service then you should be able to go to a provider near Montauk or near Orion Point and not even have to go always with CBOC I think I think Trump also had suggested that now happen happening too what you just said yeah that's um you said there is a possibility I mean depending on what news story we're watching you could say it's a good possibility but I just don't know to confirm independently but it seems like he might be making a change over in that position for Secretary of Veterans Affairs I have heard different names get mentioned one of the names Pete hexif is someone I've known for a very long time Pete and I were doing veteran's events together over a decade ago he is not just a vet himself but passionate on these issues I don't want to speak for Pete but I feel confident that if he was the Secretary of Veterans Affairs that he would support the idea of a veteran being able to take their VA benefit to any location that they wish so yeah thank you thank you again for uh for your service and those great points now so what we do throughout the year but with these tella town halls provide a great opportunity for me I'm here in Washington DC I'm having this call from my office Longworth house office building and all of you are hopefully in

dr. heifers and we just stay for the record I think they cancelled the UT football practice to do that football practice which was the biggest miracle of all in my students eyes which is a big deal in Texas but let me just beautiful from your last comment because I think that's probably most but first of all this is astounding that you could hijack a UAV and bring it down and I think it's an eye-opener and when we also state that military UAVs are encrypted this cannot be done to a military UAV such as the ones used on the border but anyone's use domestically I think had this vulnerability that we're very concerned about you know I'll talk ask you about that later but you mentioned that you talked to the FAA and their main concern is security of the airways safety you say I'm sorry safety viewer ways in terms of you go bill designate a flight pattern to end the one make sure that there are no other than by their airplanes or UAVs that would interfere with that flight pattern but their focus is not security that's right so there is no federal agency that is providing oversight in terms of that security aspect today is that correct as far as I know as far as i know and i believe that the DHS has a role to play in that and that the FAA could possibly play a role there too but as I say it's culture and its expertise are not designed for that well I think the Government Accountability Office agreed with you we went in the report they said that this is the Royal when they directed the Secretary of Homeland Security and to the TSA to basically provide for that security assess the security risks within the country domestically and develop a national policy so I I think you have some company there in terms of agreement I find this to be you know a bit of a no one's minding the store type scenario no federal agencies one you step up to the plate and when you got the GAO saying that DHS needs to do it I tend to agree with them the DHS should be stepping up to the plate what they fail to bring witnesses to testify here today on the smooth very important issue when you had a terror plot just warded in the Unites you know right that the United States Capitol less than a year ago using one of these UAVs getting back to the let me ask you this in terms that you've identified a real vulnerability with these domestic UAVs tell me what would be sort of your kind of nightmare scenario in demonstrating what you were able to do with UAVs if a terrorist or some other malicious person wanted to exploit the system okay well I should point out that currently I'm not terribly worried about this the UAV that we brought down was only about 13 pounds not very large it could do some damage to you if it fell on on you and the helicopter blades swing swiftly but I'm not terribly worried at present what my nightmare scenario would be is looking forward three or four years where we have now adopted the UAVs into the national airspace without addressing this problem and now the problem is scaling up so that we've got more heavy UAVs more capable UAVs and yet this particular vulnerability isn't addressed so that would be my nightmare scenario we don't fix it and it becomes even more an indigenous problem in the UAV and navigation systems in fact I think in the next two years predictable have thousands of these things flying around domestically does that give you concerned given the fact that there's no federal agency really addressing the security aspects the FAA did make a prediction that by 2020 there could be three thirty thousand of these applying our airspace it does concern me I would like someone to take to take ownership of the security component of UAVs coming to the National aerospace and getting like you know you've done I think we're country a great service by identifying a vulnerability you know we talked about what about cyber security for connected to the Internet you're vulnerable and what you've identified is if you're connected to a GPS device you're vulnerable can you explain to us basically how that works in the limited amount of time I have left and how we can fix that yeah sure well you're right this is a bigger problem than UAVs this is just one expression of the larger problem of unauthenticated civilian GPS signals the civilian GPS signals have been so popular so useful that over the last two decades we've absorbed the technology deeply into our critical national infrastructure so it is that even manned aircraft have some vulnerability to spoofing financial exchanges and and the energy distribution system are increasingly reliant on EPS for timing so in fact this is this is a larger problem than the UAV and and it all gets traced back to the unauthenticated civilian GPS signals I see my times that ready to experiment we just say thank you for coming up to Washington testify here today thank you for what I believe is a great service to the country thanks for identifying your vulnerability not only technology wise but also from a bureaucratic standpoint and I intend for this committee to fix this problem with that the chair now recognizes the ranking member mr. choir

Madam Speaker, We are all concerned about the growing spread
of coronavirus, and these concerns are not relieved by troubling stories of shortages
of critically-needed medical devices, including respirator masks. Concerningly, as our health care system responds,
it is exposing serious weaknesses in the supply chain supply chain for medical devices. These are products providers depend on to
deliver life-saving care. That’s why today, with my colleagues Jan
Schakowsky of Illinois and Jody Hice of Georgia, I’m introducing important, bipartisan legislation
to help the FDA combat the threat. My bill would allow the FDA to act expeditiously
to address shortages, including by importing medical devices as needed. And it would ensure that the manufacturers are
communicating with the FDA about expected shortages of medical devices, and that this
information is shared transparently with the public. The FDA already has these authorities to act
during drug shortages - and we should grant them the same ability to respond to shortages
of medical devices. I urge all my colleagues to join us supporting
this common sense bill, and I yield back.

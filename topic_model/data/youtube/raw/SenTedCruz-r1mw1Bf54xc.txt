Kruse Thank You mr. chairman mr. secretary welcome thank you for your service I want to talk a little bit about a Iran yes sir and let me start out by thanking you and the administration for designating Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Guard Corps as a foreign terrorist organization as you know that's a step I have long advocated of introduced legislation to move it forward and I wanted to ask you to explain to this committee and the American people why designating the IRGC as a terrorist organization is number one justified on the merits and number two what the consequences of that designation are specifically for financial institutions or corporations doing business with IRGC affiliated entities today right that's very name people say that I or DC and sometimes they get the eye on the are wrong this is the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps I think that's important they they named themselves appropriately as terrorist organization it's killed over 600 Americans the numbers probably far higher than that they continue to engage in terror around the world including assassinations campaigns in Europe in the West this was a kind of easy decision we're reflecting reality and so I'm I'm happy that we were able to announce that decision yesterday a second with respect to its impact the rgc has another component which is what I'll call the kleptocracy component it runs a significant piece of the Iranian economy the numbers vary but I've seen numbers as high as 20 or 25 percent of the Iranian economy has resources wealth the transfer to the IRGC itself if you're the general Council of Asia bank or a European Bank your world changed when that designation came out yesterday if you're thinking about doing business or providing material support in any way to any company that might be connected to the IRGC this sanction will cause you not to do that from our from our goal what that will do is it will deny them the resources to continue their terror campaign around the world thank you for that answer you and I work together as there was an interagency debate within the administration about whether the president should pull out of the Iranian nuclear deal I think the president made unquestionably the right decision as you know there were significant voices within the State Department that resisted that step and that I believe continued to resist that step and and and I want to talk to you about two different aspects of implementing that decision to pull out of the Iran deal namely the nuclear waivers and the oil waivers on the nuclear waivers as you know we have waivers that allow Iran to continue with with supposedly non-military nuclear research if you look to the extraordinary results that that the Israeli raids seized from Iran that that debunked what we were told by the Obama administration and the International Atomic Energy Agency and and made clear that that were entire parts of Iran's civilian nuclear program that were built in order to create nuclear weapons and then and that it was little more than a sham I want to ask your view on should we continue to grant nuclear waivers as I understand they're up for renewal next month should we continue to grant nuclear waivers given the the rather significant evidence that that doing so could further Iran acquiring nuclear weapons senator I think I think this administration I think it's hard to challenge the fact that we have been tough with respect to sanctions on Iran with respect to particular waiver decisions both these and the crudo once I don't have any announcements to make today we need to make sure that they wind through the process appropriately your point about different opinions inside the state part we get 90,000 employees probably have that many opinions make no mistake about we will we will stare closely at this on the non-proliferation waivers I'd love to talk to you in a classified setting about it it's complicated but suffice it to say President Trump I can I can assure the American people I can assure the world president Trump will continue to ratchet up the pressure on the Islamic Republic of Iran such that their behavior will change well there will be a critical decision point next month also concerning the oil waivers and it's been publicly reported that there is currently in our interagency dispute between the State Department and the Energy Department about whether to grant those waivers again right now Iran is producing roughly 1.2 million barrels of oil a day that's generating billions of dollars that is funding the Ayatollah and I believe endangering our security what are your views on whether allowing Iran to continue to produce 1.2 million barrels of oil a day and sell it on the world market is that in our national interest I think the State Department me I think we've been clear about our objective of getting around to zero just as quickly as we possibly can and we will continue to do that well let me let me urge you and urge the department unequivocally not to grant the nuclear waivers and not to grant the oil waivers I think maximum pressure should mean maximum pressure you have been a strong voice for that and let me encourage you to to continue that strong position defending on our national security Thank You senator

I i was born in Blue Earth Minnesota it's the home where all four of my grandparents lived their lives where they're buried today where my parents grew up went to school got married and my father and mother bought a farm here just outside of Truman went school grad school at st. Paul's Lutheran in Truman I've developed friendships and connections that have lasted 45 to almost 50 years my roots will always be in Truman Minnesota in Blue Earth Minnesota that's that's my home I cast my first vote in 1980 as a resident in the state of Minnesota that was for Ronald Reagan who's very proud day in my life what school and college at george mason university had the opportunity to work for the financial management services the director of legislative and public affairs and we ended up closing for check writing centers eliminating well over a hundred bureaucrat jobs saved about a billion and a half dollars we improve service to the American people that was the right thing to do I've known Jim Hagedorn his whole life he is a true minnesotan I really feel that he lines up with the values of the first District southern Minnesota I think the gym has those small-town values those raw values of hard work integrity I've seen that in the way that Jim's been working hard on this campaign I think he understands agriculture is gonna be a strong advocate for us and he'll be a leader for us in Washington we run a family business in southern Minnesota where we employ 250 people Obamacare has really affected our business I've had to sit down with my employees look him in the eye and tell him I don't know what's around the corner for us that I don't know whats around a corner for you Jim Hagedorn is my candidate because he's smart he's quick on his feet he understands the issues Jim Hagedorn is the best choice because jim has been running the general election campaign since day one the day I entered this race is the day Tim Walz began being held accountable for his liberal voting record and how he's let the people of southern Minnesota down that's the way we go after Tim Walz we take it right to it whether it's on Obama care whether it's on energy policy whether it's on the spending I'm on the other side I'm for repealing and replacing Obamacare I'm for energy independence if we don't stymie this Obama walls liberalism take back our country it'll be called the United States of America but it'll never be the United States of America that the four fathers envisioned and fought for a lot of people will put on that badge and say I'm a conservative and you know and try to get the endorsement and then pretty soon after the endorsement to running the other way Jim is not that kind of guy Jim speaks from the heart I think that makes him an exceptional candidate we spent too much money we expanded government we got into Wars of diminishing returns and didn't ation building we didn't secure the border well we've made mistakes but what I've learned from that is when you hold power you do something with it you implement your conservative reforms Jim is making a connection with the voters of southern Minnesota that nobody we could replace jim hagen horn is the conservative to beat Tim Walz Jim is a better candidate because he understands what it's going to take the win he'll take the fight right to Tim Walz he will not back away we need a winner Jim Hagedorn is that winner the only reason you run for office is because you believe in the people and you want to make your country better I'm out there 18 hours a day seven days a week when I win go to Congress work with like-minded conservatives that we can truly change this country we can stymie the walls Obama liberalism and take back our country bring the power back from Washington give it back to the states and the people you you

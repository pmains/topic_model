the president's focus of attention on our veterans it is so important during what remains a time of war against international terrorism and other threats the American people that we don't forget about the people who put their life on the line for us and some who make the ultimate sacrifice I know as a military brat you feel strongly about this issue I had a mother from the state of Indiana contact me before the address sand eater whiskey have come to know we're well over the years in fact I've warned her sons bracelets on my left wrist for a number of years to honor her son I was able to give that to the president last night because sandy tore whiskey said this president has not forgotten the sacrifices of people like her son Alec so that is something that ought to be unifying if anything was unifying last night the president's elevation of our men and women in uniform well and and I appreciate you bringing up the military component it is important to all of us here in America I do have a military brat background you you made a video talking about the president in those common areas and how he did last night I want to get to where the president references more women in Congress than ever before let's watch that don't sit yet you know like this at exactly one century after Congress passed the constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote we also have more women serving in Congress than at any time before a moment that resonated outside of that room and through television sets no doubt across the country senator young a quick thought on that and then I'm going to move on to the next topic well look we have an unfolding history as a nation of becoming a more perfect union we still remain imperfect there's work to do but I think we can celebrate the fact that most of our college graduates most of our college attendees are now females in this country we've gone such distances and as a father of three young daughters I celebrate that fact once again that was a unifying message in something I think we can build on in the next two years meanwhile House Speaker Nancy Pelosi once again signaled that she will support whatever agreement the bipartisan border security conference comes to she first said that last week and she says now that she is optimistic they'll meet their deadline here she is left to their own devices I think they can have an agreement by at one time by Friday it has to be signed the conference report by Friday I spoke with senator Shelby I told him whatever you all come to agreement on bipartisan agreement I will support will that change things well I'd like to hear those words and I'm encouraged by that language the people back in my home state of Indiana like so many across the country really want results they want to make sure that we secure that border and let's not draw ideological artificial lines with respect to what that package looks like we used to be bipartisan consensus around the idea that you not only put boots on the ground but invest in technology to secure our border and also have physical barriers where they are required and that's why the leadership has brought in members of the Customs and Border Patrol President Obama's head of that agency indicated that we needed actual physical fencing in certain areas that's what president Trump's adviser says as well as a Marine who served in Arizona in an area with heavy narco trafficking in human trafficking going on back in the 90s subsequently up a physical barrier was placed in that area Yuma areas Arizona and trafficking went down ninety-five percent over the rough roughly the next decade so walls or or barriers or structures whatever you want to call them do indeed work when properly and intelligent Lee placed and I hope that's part of the final package we can agree on Nancy Pelosi saying left to their own devices hopefully that bipartisan group can do what they need to do without a lot of influence other than the experts senator young great to have you on the program today thank you very much for your time thank you for having me Harris Democratic

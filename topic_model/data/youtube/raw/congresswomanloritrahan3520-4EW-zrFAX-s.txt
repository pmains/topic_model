kind compassionate members of congress who truly wanted to understand the issue inside and out um and made the the the trip to el paso and for that i will always be so grateful so thank you lori for all your support for everything you do for our country for your constituents i'm very lucky to be able to serve with you well thank you thank you veronica and you know you so um because this is going to be our spanish-speaking uh teletown hall or facebook live um i'm going to introduce uh jj uh from my team he's uh so jj is um my staffer on armed services committee which is the committee that uh congresswoman escobar and i sit on together uh but we also sit on the congressional hispanic caucus together uh so i'm gonna stop because i think we've loaded jj i should remember that and jj i can i can deliver my comments about the great congresswoman in spanish when you give me the green light perfect thank you so much congresswoman gracias when i started es gran trabajadora siempre esta buscandon modo collaborar para mejorar su distrito siempre esta luchando por ustedes trabajando con cada membro thank you so today today we're going to be talking about the disproportionate effects of covid19 uh that it's having on our spanish-speaking communities in all of our districts but more importantly the resources that are available to you and the additional relief uh which we're still fighting for down in waterfront before i do that i just want to take a moment to provide uh everyone with the latest uh on the coronavirus and and tell you a little bit about what veronica and i are doing uh and fighting for in washington as of today uh over one and a half million people have tested positive for covet 19 across our country and more than 95 000 people have died here in massachusetts 90 000 people have tested positive and tragically more than 6 000 have passed away from this disease over 60 percent of those people have been residents of senior care facilities even as states like massachusetts slowly begins the process of reopening the economic impact on our workers and our small businesses continues to worsen uh yesterday we got the latest numbers and the last just in the past week nearly two and a half million more people have filed unemployment claims bring the total number to 36.8 million uh in the past nine weeks that includes more than 1.2 million people in the state of massachusetts is we also know that this virus uh like most public health crises in our in our country's history is having a disproportionate impact on our communities of color in fact a recent report from the massachusetts attorney general's office shows that the communities with great greater populations of people of color have the highest rates of covid19 infection across 38 of the largest cities in the commonwealth including lawrence and lowell on the ground we've seen this firsthand as of as of late april 90 of the patients at lawrence general who tested positive for covid19 were latino or hispanic crisis but you know nationwide impact on our spanish-speaking workers has been equally devastating in addition to the number of states releasing data that points to disproportionate effects of this pandemic on communities of color latinos also make up a large percentage of the millions of essential workers of our critical infrastructure to make matters worse one in every five latinos are out of work because of covet 19 and as a racial demographic they continue to have the highest uninsured uninsured rate in our country i know we'll talk a lot about this issue uh later on the event but i want to let everyone not uh know watching that this is something that we take very seriously you know i've been in touch with the governor's command center the attorney general's uh office local officials and community leaders to make sure that we're putting every tool to use that we can here in the third congressional district to make sure we get through this pandemic without leaving a single person behind in washington congress has cast 2.7 trillion dollars in emergency relief funding to help families and small businesses and to keep our health care heroes our first responders and our front line workers safe but what's clearer now than ever before is people here in massachusetts and across our country are in need of more help last week i drove down to washington which is something veronica can't do unfortunately how to vote for the heroes act the three trillion dollar relief package that delivers on many of the needs of our heroes fighting on the front lines to save the lives of our working families who are being who are doing everything that they can to make ends meet although the senate has refused to take up this important piece of legislation so far there's no question that we have so much more to do at the negotiating table for the american people and our workers and our small business owners are going to need much more help getting back on their feet and congress will have to act to provide that assistance in washington the [Music] [Music] now before we get to your questions i have to introduce one again once again our incredible guests for this afternoon's event uh congresswoman veronica escobar is a third generation el pasoan did i say that right el paso exactly proudly represents texas's 16th congressional district i i had the distinct honor of being sworn in with her as a first-term member out of the u.s house of representatives last year i serve on the house armed services committee uh with congresswoman escobar but she also serves on the house judiciary committee she has already made history as the first woman ever to be elected to her seat and in the halls of congress she's been a tireless champion for the rights of immigrants across our country but also just a steadfast pragmatic leader and one who i look to always for ways to work together on but also um someone who actually is uh so poised and so savvy uh in terms of getting the ball moved forward um so anyway veronica thank you so much for joining and before you speak jj has to uh is [Music] is so thank you veronica and i want to get to the questions because that's why we're here we had lots of people submit questions so we're going to do our best to get to as many of them as possible so the first question i'm i'm going to take it um and then uh uh it reads i know that everyone is affected by covid19 but our cities specifically our communities of color seem to be impacted in higher numbers what is our state doing to mitigate this so i'll take it because it is a bit of a state question but um i veronica you can feel free to chime in as well i so it's indisputable that this pandemic has had a disproportionate impact on communities of color on all fronts right per capita hospitalization fatality rates to economic uh harm covet 19 woke many people up uh to the disturbing reality that public health crises have historically exacerbated inequities that harm people of color and low-income families more than others in the case of this crisis it's not because the virus picks on certain people it's because of systemic problems that have persisted for generations despite their harm uh to the most vulnerable for too long many of uh these failures have been slow to change or they've gone unchallenged entirely and that's that's unacceptable and i'd like to add oh oh sorry i forgot the translation no problem [Music] and one thing that i'd like to add is in texas we're seeing very similar impacts that's why it was so important in the heroes act in our bill that we just passed last week we prioritized testing and tracing and resources for minority communities necessarily yeah uh i'll just i'll just add um you know i congresswoman ayanna presley has also been you know a leader on this issue we introduced together legislation that would require the federal government to collect and report which is so important racial and ethnic ethnic data related to covid19 and certainly the heroes act prioritizes that we require the cdc and the department of health and human services to report additional information on race and ethnicity rates of covet 19 testing uh tracing and treatment so that's how we get at this we put our resources where uh they actually need to go and today in the third congressional district that's to lawrence that's behavioral that's to lowell information [Music] [Music] this next question is for you it's from eunice and methuen and she asks representative how do minority-owned small businesses get access to additional benefits it's been increasingly difficult to get approved for loans that i need to stay afloat am i doing something wrong are there additional options for me well uh eunice thank you for the question and we knew when we headed back to dc to negotiate and to pass uh changes to the ppp program that businesses like yours were being left out and um we specifically worked on funding for you for small and minority-owned businesses and the best way for you to access that is to work with your local community banks also you really should reach out to the small business administration to make sure that you are taking advantage of everything that you possibly can but it's those small community banks that are so important to to your access to the 60 billion dollars that we set aside specifically for you um we also know that that some of the big corporations that that took up some of that money meant for you have given it back and that money specifically um our intent is for it to be set aside for businesses like yours oh did you did you jj did you need to translate the question yes if that's fine okay and then i'll and then i'll answer in spanish sorry i'm getting used to this [Music] [Music] [Music] and i would just add in our area community development financial institutions we call them you know cdfis um you know that have been putting this money this designated money to work uh like mill city's community investment in lawrence is a great example they've been able to distribute lots of funds as a result of this the the development thank you thanks jj uh so the next uh the next question is from joe in haverhill he says i hear a lot about this heroes act that was passed is it law yet uh what is next in terms of additional rebates is there a potential itin tax payer relief many of us feel we need additional funds going forward uh so joe it's an excellent question it's why we went back to washington uh to to act on heroes uh i'll give you a few specifics of what it includes it provides a trillion dollars in support to our state and local governments to get to our emergency and our front line workers it commits us to a science-based approach to reopening the economy by setting aside 75 billion dollars for testing tracing and treatment and it provides a second round of direct cash payments of up to twelve hundred dollars per person six thousand dollars per family to help folks weather this storm to answer your question about those with an individual taxpayer identification number or itins this legislation retroactively repeals the prohibition on them receiving their rebates that means that individuals and many mixed status families would immediately receive this relief from both the cares act which was passed you know a month ago and the heroes act uh i'll also note that the heroes act sets aside another 175 billion dollars in housing assistance to help our most vulnerable keep a roof over their heads and cover their utility bills are the heroes thank you and to answer the final part of your question joe sadly the heroes act is not law yet uh but with this morning's um news coming out of the senate uh majority leaders uh office i'm hopeful that we're going to have a negotiated heroes uh in the in the coming weeks of the heroes jane from methuen uh wants to know with the covid19 pandemic going on is the census put on hold what is the status of it and should i be filling it out jane thank you so much for that question please fill out your census and please make sure that everybody in your family fills it out the census hasn't gone away we're not you know punting it to another year we've got to get it done this year and the census as you probably know is critical to making sure that that your district that your community your neighborhood gets the resources that it needs for roads for schools you name it um really more than ever we are seeing uh the need for resources in our communities but that is all going to and representation also by the way um everyone needs to fill out the census so that they can have the accurate number of representatives uh both at the state level and at the federal level um and so if you haven't filled out your census yet you can go to www.2020census.gov or you can call 1-844-330-2020 in order to fill it out and

gracias uh it's it's safe and it's confidential and it's quick and easy so please take the time to do it um okay this next one's for me it's from laura in lawrence i have a lot of family back in my count in my home country of venezuela and i'm wondering are they able to visit us at this time what is the status of traveling outside the united states additionally what spanish resources does your office provide us thank you for the question laura this is such a difficult time to be separated from our families and our and our loved ones and so to answer your question uh the cdc maintains a list of all countries whose citizens may not enter the united states due to covet 19. venezuela is not currently on that list however the state department does advise that americans avoid all international travel due to the global impact of the coronavirus they've also recommended that people who are still in countries where uh commercial departure options remain available should arrange for an immediate return to the united states if you have trouble uh please call my office we can help we've helped uh fly home over a hundred people who have been stuck abroad uh so don't hesitate to call our office at 978-459-0101 what are you translating now today i'll do the second part okay lawrence is [Music] [Music] the last part of your question what spanish resources does your office provide i firmly believe that translating our resources into other languages critical to ensuring that all people have the materials that they need to be informed and to keep their families safe especially especially right now you can access our entire website is available in spanish so if you go to trahan.house.gov and click the in espanol tab it will translate for you we've also translate our entire covid19 resource page to spanish as well and i'll also say i've got uh multiple people um on my team who speak spanish uh so call and don't hesitate to call and ask for jj i ask for jocelyn unesco vladimir i'm probably missing someone but uh they are all spanish speakers and they would be delighted to help respond okay veronica we only get time for one more question and it's for you i'm worried about the november election and the threat the virus could have on overall turnout can you discuss what actions congress is considering to assure those who want to vote who will be able to without potentially risking their health and is congress even considering any action from karina thank you so much for that question we are those of us in the house of representatives including your fantastic congresswoman lori trahan and i last week we voted for the heroes legislation because of the concerns that you've just articulated we believe that americans should not have to choose between their health and their safety and security and their right to participate in their democracy um i personally i cannot understand why there is so much objection to ballot by mail a national um program for everyone to be able to vote conveniently from their home so that they can stay safe and so that they can help determine the future of their government um there should be no controversy uh as an example my children who uh when when they are away at college they vote by mail our soldiers overseas they vote by mail the president of the united states donald trump he's voted by mail so if all of these folks are able to do it safely and securely surely and during a global pandemic we should be able to do that for our country we included that in past pieces of legislation unfortunately um in the senate they they stripped the funding for uh a comprehensive program for mail-in ballots but in the heroes act we put it back in and we are going to keep fighting to make sure that you have the right to vote in your election determine your future for your country your state and your local governments um in november and i'm proud that your congresswoman and i voted in favor of the heroes act thank you veronica so sadly that's all the time that we have for today i'm so grateful that you took uh uh so much time uh veronica you know your insight is so valuable your fight your work it's uh it's it's just contagious and the country certainly your district is lucky to have you el paso is lucky to have you uh and we all are so grateful uh for you so um do you have any parting words uh for

first of all thank you for your service and thank you for your for your intent to continue the service uh and we appreciate very much uh let me just ask you this um isis remains a threat in syria as we all know most of its activity is focused on establishing networks assassinating and intimidating local leaders and security forces and ex extending its influence in rural areas throughout the eastern syria and iraq so my question would be do you assess that the february third killing of isis leader qurashi gave a significant blow to the isis in the region and how do you plan to capitalize on lack of leadership if it did really truly break up their network senator any time an i a leader of any terrorist organization is taken out it causes the leadership to have to figure out who will take over it it generally temporarily sets them back it depends on the capability of that leader that was in charge but then what it does it also exposes that network as they they communicate and try and find the next leader to replace them and that provides opportunities so the intel the opportunity of intel uh right now is probably a premium it is senator let me say this i want to also tell you sir i appreciate so much the efforts that you all have made to protect all all civilians and we truly do but we also know i think senator tell us both points we had senator warren uh warren who was concerned and we're all concerned and senator tillis identifying that basically they embed themselves in so we know your job is difficult we sympathize but also we cannot allow these tariffs to go unchecked or un undeterred that's for sure um in the past counting violent extreme groups with al qaeda and islamic state was the top national security both of which are critical challenges sent commentary of responsibility for decades how do you assess this shift in resources if with china and russia right now taking the forefront in national security challenges facing united states that shift in resources would affect centcon senator i'll have to look at the missions as if confirmed look at the missions assigned to centcom the resources allocated and the risks associated with each of those missions and look at ways to mitigate that risk one of the ways is tech is partially through partnerships and allies that can make up some of that mitigation and also through technology going forward but then i would come back to both the chairman and the secretary of defense and inform this committee of any additional resources required let me ask if you have any knowledge of the validity of china's talking points of partnering with a taliban in afghanistan and if so how are we going to counter that senator i know that the taliban has reached out to china that was in open source but if confirmed that is an area that i'll have to make a deep assessment of and sir national guard operations with centcom in west virginia the national guard already has a strong connection with qatar through our state partnership program i think it was one of the first in the middle east it might still be the only one i'm not sure we also had multiple units rotate to the middle east throughout our wars with both afghanistan and iraq additionally over 50 percent the total force of c-130 is operated by reserve component units and we have a large contingency of that also in west virginia can you tell me how you think strategically strategically when employing national guard units in your area of responsibility senator i i have observed as the centcom chief of staff that our national guard and our reserve provide tremendous capability into the aor and can also help offset the impact on the active duty force as well so you all and in your planning operations and defense and things of that and security you're using national guard and their abilities is basically with your own uh forces senator we've used the national guard in all my experience in the middle east well let me say thank you i appreciate very much i yield back my time

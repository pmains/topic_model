[Music] to the point with congressman bill Pascrell focusing on the concerns and issues facing the families of New Jersey's ninth congressional district [Music] hello I'm congressman bill Pascrell and I would like to welcome you to this latest edition of to the point with the potential ties between Trump administration officials and Russian agents with nepotism occurring within president Trump's inner circle and with a lack of transparency in the West Wing the time is right for a discussion of ethics and the White House there are many Americans wondering if the Trump family is profiting from their father's presidency and ethics issues in the nation's capital had never been more pressing that is why I've invited a former White House Ethics our norm Eisen on the show today he can give a guide to interpreting these troubling potentially unethical times in American government norm is the former Special Counsel for the ethics and Government Reform to the White House under President Obama and today is leading an effort to suit Trump over the emoluments clause article 1 section 9 norm has been studying ethics issues for almost his entire career graduated from Harvard University Law School the same year that President Obama and the newly appointed Supreme Court justice neo bushy aside from his work with ethics and government norm served as the ambassador to Czech Republic one of my favorite countries from 2011 to 2014 he is the co-founder and chair of the Citizens for responsibility and ethics in Washington or as it's known crew one of the foremost government watchdog organizations in Washington DC norm thank you for so much man thanks for having me bill we're going to jump right into this like okay resilient questions that XQ let me say this you know I've got a book my book you know there's a number of matter came out over the last couple years teapot dome the sisters of charity would pound this into my head and they said I was hopeless because I didn't remember too much in the seventh grade very important probably the biggest one of the biggest scandals of the 20th century and happened during the Harding Coolidge administrations and then it led because of the stand they led to a change in the tax code of 1924 and jump in if I'm doing this indirectly and we put something in section 60 103f one and that was that some groups some committees in the Congress would have the right to ask for somebody in the executive branch of government tax return that's what happened when secretary the interior fall who served came up with the brilliant idea that he was going to turn army a navy reserve oil naval reserve oil and a teapot dome cheap on rock Wyoming he decided going to privatize this bring in his voice and make them part and cut up the pie that way and he was found guilty later on somebody murdered somebody else that was a fascinating thing to read through every book I read pick up new stuff when I read about the Teapot Dome scandal everybody should read that interesting about what we need what you need to know about a conflict of interest and what could happen etc etc etc and I just was shocked last week last Monday at Tuesday when I read that this president now our president Donald Trump decided that what he wants to do is take the monuments or the preserved land and put it up for development and it reminded me of the t-top teapot Oh am i stretching the truth here what is that no you are not what this administration has planned unless they straighten things out starting with President Trump himself it's going to make the teapot dome look like the teacup Dome scandal or like that like a symbol so that's a table huge it's a huge mess waiting to happen in fact the ethics crisis is already happening bill when have you seen a new administration not even in it wasn't even a hundred days in and they already had a major scandal the Russia investigation looming over their heads we've never seen new committees in three committees and we got the FBI investigating etc a DOJ the Department of Justice yes we've never seen anything like them FX problems and the lack of transparency in this administration it starts with the president because and I want to give you a plug right now thank you all that you need my plug but I read through never turn down the flood I read through what the President President Obama committed to and this is not a partisan show here no we've got Democrats and Republicans on etc etc but what came out the day after he was sworn in the presidential documents executive order one three four nine Oh January 21st 200 nine ethics commitments by the executive branch of personnel and I read through these because I know you were the author basically I read through the entire document and I said oh my god what we what we have here is a jewel it's it's a GPS through government and how what to do and what not to do and on the very basis of the revolving door for people leaving the administration and becoming lobbyists this is an ultimate disgrace what is happening now well unfortunately president Trump he huh he hung on to all of his businesses so many conflicts hundreds of businesses he refused to turn over his tax returns he broke a precedent their bill that every other president Democrat and Republican like your show bipartisan right he broke that president and then to add insult injury he took this executive order which I was privileged to assist President Obama with and he gutted it yes he took out the lobbying ban he said he was going to drain the swamp and then he took out the lobby there are some people that have joined the administration early on in January and are ready out there lobbying denying correct they refused we required everybody to sign this he let some of these people didn't have this including Flynn that's a shocker when have you ever seen a national security adviser get out never hat and make no mistake about it it's not just President Trump who has conflicts these terrible conflicts which violate the Constitution that's what we're doing our litigation about we'll talk about that it's spread like to continue our teapot dome analogy like an oil slick it's spread throughout the White House it's swept up Flynn so many others and throughout the administration this unethical conduct and a lot of it comes from gutting that executive order they took out the lobbying ban they took out many of the safeguards that made that work that helped the Obama administration have relatively fewer scandals and you know else they took out because president Trump hates it the transparency bill we published if somebody got a waiver for example under our order right in Obama we publish it we put it on the White House website down uh things are no no do you think that was comfortable we don't even know who the heck is visiting I why he's trashed the transparency just like he won't turn over his tax returns I've never seen a mess like this it's no wonder there's already Russia investigation and let me tell you these issues relate to the restaurant investigation because Trump's son has said we see a lot before his dad was running for office he wasn't as careful as he is now he said we see a lot of Russian money flowing into our businesses and yet Trump won't give us his tax return which have the details in a lot of detail about foreign money maybe if we have those tax returns we can understand president Trump's bizarre former embrace of Putin well the money follow the money this is the point so we changed the law in in 1924 we changed the tax code to give three specific committees ways and means Joint Committee on taxation and Senate Finance they add the authenticity and they had the law behind them if they wanted to investigate anybody in the executive branch of government my rights off all right the law is on our side plus the fact article 1 section 9 gifts emoluments whatever you want to call them from other parties definitely banned because that puts you in a difficult position to make an objective viewpoint whether it's foreign policy or domestic policy am I on the right track and pursuing this since February 1st of this year you are and first of all I want to say that you have been a leader on these issues and so I thank you and I think the American people thank you for pushing the law allows these tax returns to be produced at the demand of Congress I don't know why Congress wouldn't want to take a look at them and just understand in the middle of a Russian investigation is Trump getting Russian money or not as son says they are I've been accused by my chairman of who I have a great deal of respect for I get along with very well Kevin Brady of wanting to rummage through quote-unquote people's private business and I said to Kevin Kevin you you guys had a vote three four years ago to look at the 51 private returns from organizations when you're going after this Lerner over there in the IRS is that different you went through 51 of these I want to see the presidents not simply because the precedent is there from Gerald Ford to now but because the only way I find out about is 500-plus investments investments all over the world the only way I find out about is partnerships so that they're clean and that you can make objective decisions is if I have a not only is two pages of the you know those those two pages don't mean a damn thing I want to see the backup schedule yes I want to see the backup reports who he does business with when it went in 1995 when he had the the big loss that he took 900 million dollars he's able to move it forward so that he did not by any taxes from then on I mean you didn't break the law but I think everybody should pay their fair share of taxes well we need to see these taxes we want to evaluate for ourselves a series of questions including how aggressive he was in his tax treatments in his tax shelters in claiming deduction every other president has done that with far fewer conflicts than him now there is another way to get those tax returns I hope Congress is going to do the right thing and I'm happy to come up and chat with you and the Chairman anytime you like about why it's so important and it's bipartisan because I work together with the bush ethic and I did that I made it bipartisan should be by Breyer first this is not Democrat a Republican I said to Kevin let's do it together I said because they're going to be very embarrassing I'm going to make sure that there are votes on the floor I've done that I'm going to make sure there's votes in the house in the Ways and Means Committee and other committees are moving and doing as I'm doing to put it on the floor for a proposal for inquiry so we have the right to do that they have to bring it up within a certain amount of time and I want them on record now they're saying don't stop there's yet going through 80% of the American people I want to see these tax returns they should they say that in public in fact I asked one in the committee hearing why no would tell the truth and said yes I believe he should but he wouldn't vote with us so I understand that but if I could get them even to say at a public meeting a town meeting if I could get them to say to their local newspaper that means in the conglomerate that means more pressure on it not that the president going to listen to any of this well there is another you got to keep it up because a majority a supermajority of Americans in poll after poll somewhere between 75 and 80 percent want to see and that includes most of mr. Trump's own voters so keep it up but there are other vehicles to do this as well one of the reasons that my group crew my watchdog group filed the lawsuit alleging that the president was violating the concept lucien was because we're so concerned about the combination of these unconstitutional foreign government payments and the secrecy that has gone on you know as you point out the Constitution says a president cannot accept presence cash or benefit very clear very clear not only the president yes remember you're right sector the branch federal officials you're right and you know what's so interesting bill the founders of our country and the framers of our Constitution were so worried and you we hit the nail right on the head a president's judgment or any other federal official could be distorted if they got these foreign government payments that they didn't put in any test it's not like a bribe you got a show quid pro quo it's a flat-out prohibition that a president cannot accept these payments and Donald Trump is all over the United States and all over the world you know you can see it happening from the steps of the White House in his hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue foreign government after foreign government is doing business with that hotel you know the thing that pushed me over the top to begin this in February first was the fact that he never divested himself of his businesses the present Czar of ethics in the government now mr. Schwaab he told him to do it he said this is the right thing to do but they did not do that the fact that it in divest means he's just as much as in business now as he is the President of the United States we've never had that before and we shouldn't have it right now we have to get those stats returns well the American people are behind you and I'm behind you and by the way in addition to what you're doing our lawsuit will also serve to require the production of these tax returns in the discovery phase you know first right you argue about the law then if the court says yes go ahead you can seek discovery of information lots of course and in this case the cause is in order to establish these questions about the foreign business we're going to want to see the tax returns so I think between your efforts the litigation that's happening the investigation that's going on of the Russian ties and just the day-to-day business that mr. Trump is doing I'm going to tell you something that's very interesting by the way because we've just amended our lawsuit to add plaintiffs who represent restaurants and hotels competitors with mr. Trump when we filed our suit our watchdog was the plaintiff in the suit people I said well can a watchdog really sue now I think we can just this week the Supreme Court cited very favorably a case that we rely on but if you had any question those questions have been put to rest now we have restaurants and hotel related plaintiffs however there's another very interesting aspect to this lawsuit we've brought it out you know it's not just foreign government payments mr. Trump has spent a third of his presidency third of the days of his presidency he's visited one of his own properties and that is generating a lot of cash and benefits for him from the federal government and the state governments and in article 2 the framers of the Constitution said you can't do that either it applies to the president it's called the domestic emoluments club monuments just a fancy eighteenth-century word for cash and benefits and they forbade the president from doing just what Donald Trump is doing he's using the presidency a third of the day's bill he's using the presidency as a giant infomercial for his property he's raking in the cash in benefits we're going to put a stop to with our litigation I hope you're right in members of his family now when we were negotiating on some things with China all of a sudden china decides to okay the trademarks for his daughter and you know daughters a hardworking person and you know he got a lover but the fact of the matter is you are part of the White House you're part of the family and how did you get those trademarks so quickly when you were waiting so long now your father is the president and you may say well you're jealous because you didn't get a trademark well I never applied for a trademark but the point is I don't whether the point at the point of the matter is that this is very suspect we will never get to conflicts of interest and whether a person is acting objectively if we can look at those sex people are very concerned about the jobs that have flowed out of the United States to other countries including China for many years how can we trust Donald Trump and his family to stanch the flow of those jobs flow of wealth to China if they're getting these enormous gifts that your end and you're the stinkiest one Donald Trump himself for years bill he litigated to get his his name trademarked in China one trademark he wanted he was refused of course all run by the Communist Party to a greater lesser degree he was refused he gets on the threshold of the Oval Office and he says I'm gonna reverse our China policy I'm going to go back to a Taiwan policy they give him the trademark that he wanted all these years and he says okay I'll go back to one China and then while his daughter was sitting having dinner with President Xi and her father she gets three trademarks I mean it's open season that that's not the American style of doing business the China for a president that's gone and because and has shown himself to be a quote-unquote populist that he's going to do things for the people that the establishment did not do on a while when he was part of the establishment didn't matter the fact of the matter is he is turned on the mat he's turned their backs his backs on him and this has nothing to do with Democrat and Republican you see the votes that are happening in the legislature today because people going to watch this over a couple of weeks they're going to be able to go back to look at it and get a chance to look at it again the point of the matter is you see that this is not coming down as the Democrats versus the Republicans there's all kinds of divisions here what we want to do is bring people together want to come to some agreements but the president has to show some you morality he has to say I need the Democrats I need the Republicans I need the left on the Democratic side I need the right on the Democratic side and vice versa with the Republican Party look at that we were able to avert the government shutdown and I get a spending package because we work together now mr. Trump's upset because the Democrats got something too he's sending out angry tweets but as we should be in Washington let both sides succeed but the problem with this situation of his cash and benefits that he's getting in his presence that he's getting from China and the other countries it runs contrary to his slogan drain the swamp I think he must have misspoken yes he must have meant to say I will drown the swamp with emoluments because that's what's happening well don't forget Washington DC is built on swampland it is it not until dawn humid down here in the summertime and he was going to drain all of this he was going to get rid of the corruption you know eight years Obama for all of his warts and his faults nobody's perfect nobody's perfect at all no one none of us are the point is that it was a clean eight years when you go over it with a fine magnifying glass why is that important not only sets an example but the person there you may not like his policies but at the pilot but what he's doing is transparent we can see it that he's not making a buck on a side or setting it up sorry to make a buck later on that's important to America people also well I think that the example that was set for the Obama administration was a good one and I had hopes you know it's been publicly reported I'll say it on your show I went and talked to the Trump transition was being run by Governor Christie I said you know we're Americans first I don't agree with the policy of the president-elect but let me help you run the government with respect give them an even better version of that document they listened and then Christy was thrown out that was the end and the Trump kleptocracy took over and we've seen now a hundred days my watchdog group has issued a report more than a hundred scandals under Daisy's you know I'll leave abolishment sarbanes sarbanes of Marylanders but I gather a document along with oversight and a beautiful document that goes into each of these specifics when you examine those 560 investments all over the world the history of them was mind-boggling as to who he was dealing with who his company was dealing yes and not to divest yourself from any of this is very suspect well we talked about the the fact that it's against the Constitution it's wrong and it stinks these the cash and benefits he's getting but it also hurts Americans because we can't trust the president that he's going to do the best for us save our jobs for example when he's negotiating with China if China is giving him this valuable stuff on foreign policy it hurts too because look at do tear take calls do tear tear Philippines I need to I need to have you come to the United States because of North Korea need your help of North Korea the Philippines has never helped us North Korea that has nothing to do with North Korea is it a coincidence that there is a Trump Tower in downtown Manila no force so when you provide this bogus explanation one can only assume oh he's doing it for the sake of his business and it's the same with all of these visa tyrants Turkey he has an attraction to time it's well easy what is our president have an attraction to Duarte was easy to build in those countries because there's not a lot of due process right if the tyrant says yes build the Trump Tower it gets built Turkey same thing he's built he's got a property in Turk an we force him to divest beef but the president of the United States our president could we force him to divest before he gives us his tax returns well our legal action is seeking to force him to divest that's the remedy in the limo does not exactly mean you are listening to court well okay if we're successful it'll come after discovery outright we've established the evidence the court will say President Trump as the courts have done with the Muslim ban they sure had the same thing with the sanctuary cities he's at a losing streak in the courts the courts are just as powerful as the president we have extra balancers we have three parts of our government we have your part the legislature we have the courts the president co-equal branches growth just as powerful and the judge we're going to ask the judge to say to him mr. president you got to get rid of your of monuments no more cash from foreign governments no more benefits no more presents you can't do that you can't be shaking down the federal government to support a third of your time in your own properties you can't do it with the states either no government money because it distorts your judgment Cornelius Vanderbilt learning great people in American history said very very clearly what do you mean the law I have the power and you know what that's very dangerous in the democracy we need to renew that democracy every day for our kids as well and ourselves has sent our grandkids and I keep that in mind that's why I'm here to do my job and they're not going to scare me they're not going to threaten me I'm going to do what I have to do and when it's time for me to be retired I'll retire in another 20 years so retire we need to bail so the fact of the matter is if it weren't for you and a lot of

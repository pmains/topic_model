Mr Speaker I rise today to talk about nutrition and more specifically malnutrition my family and I have traveled across the country doing mission work from the poorest country in this Western Hemisphere Haiti to the plains of Kenya across Mexico and throughout Central America on those trips I went there as a physician thinking I could help people but what I quickly discovered that was despite how many antibiotics I had how many bottles of IV fluids that I was without proper nutrition without proper water and sewage I was simply running into a headwind into a war that I could never win unfortunately across the globe there's almost a billion people who suffer from malnutrition and it's a problem that doesn't exist just in the across the world it also exists in my own district in my own communities we think that there's absolutely there's that actually about 12% of United States households have food insecurity issues and in households with children there's even up to 16 percent of food insecurity issues it would be my opinion without this hierarchy of needs being met there's a hierarchy of the needs of proper proper sewage and proper nutrition that you'll never have a healthy community without a healthy community you'll never see economic growth this Madol against malnutrition is long-running in recent years many in the hunger community have recognized the value of fighting malnutrition in targeted ways one which was popularized by Roger Thurow in his book the first thousand days research shows that good nutrition actually begins before conception good nutrition starts before conception continues throughout the woman's pregnancy and when and especially those first two years of the child's birth birthdays are very very important as a practicing obstetrician for 25 years I've seen over and over the impact of proper nutrition proper nutrition in those first thousand days starts with a well-balanced diet and adequate calories additionally we always try to start our prenatal vitamins at least three months before conception you might ask well why is that important when we what we have found is that there's adequate folic acid in a woman's body along with adequate iron it decreases birth defects and it creases premature burst and low birth weights specifically folic acid decreases neural tube defects so those two vitamins are particularly important that we continue in these diets preconception alee during the pregnancy of then after for at least the first two years the child receives the proper 1000 a nutrition has a lower chance of obesity heart disease and chronic illnesses the child's ten times more likely to overcome serious childhood illnesses and it's more likely to fulfill their full god-given potential what we know and understand is that the most vulnerable will succumb to viruses whether it's the elderly or the infants if they don't have proper nutrition an investment during this critical time period these first thousand days not only impacts the development of the child but results in a higher likelihood of healthiness and generations to follow allowing the benefits of adequate nutrition to compound over time as we in Congress began to consider the reauthorization of the new farm bill been reviewing many programs targeting hunger and malnourishment these programs allow our state governments and nonprofits to promote nutrition and assist in providing food for women and children both here at home and around the globe I'm especially proud of the mcgovern-dole International Food for education program but what we've of course call in Kansas the dole McGovern international food for education program this program has provided over forty four million people and low-income across the world food deficient countries with the MIL during the school time to help those kids do better in in school this is made possible by donations from the u.s. agriculture products and the kindness of Americans food for peace is another life-saving food assistance program that for more than 60 years has helped tens of thousands tens of millions of people's get enough to eat drink through an emergency development and nutritional support programs not only these programs provide food necessary to help their country survive good nutrition for women and children they benefit u.s. national security and foster goodwill lending a helping hand to those around the globe is a classic American value but assisting those here at home is an absolute priority this is being achieved through the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children the WIC program as most of us have called it I've had such great first-hand experience at sea and important.this WIC programs are to pregnant women and breastfeeding women and not only just the vitamins that we give them but it's the extra education that we give them to help raise or chip their children in a healthy environment so we need to provide federal grants to these states through the WIC program that are used provide food supplements and nutritional education to low-income mothers and babies nutrition is so critical for these first thousand days that goes far beyond anything that I can say or any statistics I can quote as we continue to strive for improved nation Allah help the importance of these first thousand days should not be under emphasized the United States has an opportunity make a global statement in advancing this initiative no matter where you are in the world you can be assured that community health growth and quality of life begins with good nutrition

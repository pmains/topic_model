malinowski of new jersey he's a member of the house foreign affairs homeland security and transportation committees good to see you so ukraine's president says he does not expect much from this meeting but that the delegations should try you held top diplomatic roles in the clinton and obama administrations how much hope do you have in these planned talks i don't have a lot of hope that this is going to be resolved by diplomacy in the next 24-48 hours of course putin at this point hoped to be marching through uh kiev and toppling the ukrainian government and celebrating some kind of sick victory and that has not proved as easy as he wanted so i guess it's a good sign they're willing to start talking i think they're going to need to suffer significantly more setbacks on the battlefield before anything acceptable to these brave ukrainian fighters and leaders could even be possible you say nato has never been more united in its history do you see that along with sanctions limiting russia's banking access and a growing commitment of arsenal to ukraine eventually leading to russia retreating there's no question in my mind that russia will suffer a strategic defeat in in this war um that said they may still win some tactical victories they do still have a significantly larger and more powerful military and i worry that as they are frustrated on the battlefield they may use increasingly brutal tactics so we do need to brace ourselves as inspiring as it is to see the success of these brave ukrainian defenders this may remain ugly for some some time but there's no question that strategically putin is losing he's united nato against him he's united ukrainians against him he has not achieved his military objectives uh heck he's even united democrats and republicans in the united states to do something against him and that's quite a feat so um you know this is i hope that at some point we get to a point where he is willing to talk about terms for backing down i just don't think we're there yet i mean you are paying the picture that he is a desperate he's in a desperate situation and you know in in desperation people do desperate things does that make you even more concerned about this nuclear deterrence force uh being put at the ready no i i'm we should be calm about that that that is putin trying to rattle us that's psychological deterrence works he knows perfectly well that if he were to do anything with nuclear weapons it would be the end of his country and of him personally um so we need to we we need to remain confident and calm stay the course here uh remember sanctions move more slowly than tanks the sanctions that president biden has uh announced are incredibly strong but they will be felt uh increasingly strongly by the russians and by the russian leader over the coming days and weeks and as that happens i think we'll be in a much better position to resolve this in a way that is just and fair and in keeping with the the bravery of the ukrainian people slow as it may be these sanctions or even other limitations uh being you know that are targeting uh the russian government how much of a difference does it make that even his enablers too will be caught up in you know the web of sanctions and limitations i i think it's a tightening news around around his regime uh i you know we don't know what's happening in the kremlin right now we don't know what the conversations are like but just reading the tea leaves seeing the the footage of putin sitting 12 15 20 feet away from his closest advisors this does not look like a government where people are telling him the truth it does not seem like a a good arrangement for making good decisions and i think that may be one explanation for for the really bad disastrously bad decisions that putin has made um it's going to be i think that the point of the sanctions is to is to harm his economy to make it harder for the russian government to continue this course but it's also going to be a morale boost i think for the ukrainians to see key people around putin lose their yachts and their planes to see police tape around their luxury villas in paris and london and yes in new york city and miami we've been complicit in this as well we have to accept that um so watch that space watch how the united states and our european allies in a united determined way uh aggressively scour the world seizing the properties and the wealth of these guys who have propped up putin all these years i cannot wait to see that and i know the ukrainians can't either senator chuck schumer is pushing a 6.4 billion dollar emergency aid package that would include humanitarian economic security assistance to people and to the government of ukraine are you confident that congress will be able to get this through yes absolutely that's a no-brainer uh a group of us were in munich last weekend for the security conference that just preceded the invasion of ukraine we we came out of that uh committed to work towards supplemental funding to help ukraine's fighters to provide humanitarian aid i think we need to beef up some of the parts of the u.s government involved in the sanctions enforcement effort that i just mentioned in congress at least democrats and most republicans are determined to do what we can to help the ukrainians win this fight and now to even more personal stuff i mean there's been some heartbreaking images of ukrainians fleeing their homeland families being split up you were born in communist poland during the height of the cold war and and when you were six and here's a photo of you you and your mother fled to the united states i can only imagine your emotions when you see you know the kind of fear and panic on the faces of ukrainians um and in relation to what you personally experience what has it been like for you to watch this i just feel such an enormous sense of kinship with with these wonderful people um i was there three weeks ago in kiev and tried to imagine what it would be like to look up in the air and to see planes dropping bombs trying to kill me and it was just impossible to imagine but i grew up with these stories my my family lived through the second world war uh lived through the violence and displacement and the evil of that conflict and for me what this is all about is making sure that that evil is not visited on the world again the the dictatorships trying to change borders by force with tanks that's what led to the second world war that's what led to the greatest tragedies of the 20th century and it has been the mission of the united states in the world ever since to prevent that from happening that's why it's so important that the putin lose this fight because the whole world is watching to see whether the free world will stand up for the rules that have kept us safe all these years democratic congressman tom malinowski pleasure having you with us thank you so much thank you very much

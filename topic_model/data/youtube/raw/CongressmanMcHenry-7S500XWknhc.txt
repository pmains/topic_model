  CHIEF DEPUTY WHIP, MR. MCHENRY.  THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE   GENTLEMAN FROM NORTH CAROLINA  IS RECOGNIZED FOR THREE  MINUTES. MR. MCHENRY: THANK YOU, MR.  SPEAKER. I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR OF   THE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE   FOR HIS HARD WORK AND HIS  EFFORT, HIS STAFF'S EFFORT AND   COMMITTEE EFFORT.  THE TAX CUT AND JOBS ACT IS A  VITALLY IMPORTANT BILL.  THIS WILL HELP ALL AMERICANS'  LIVES FOR THE BETTER.  THE NAME FITS FOR THIS BILL AS   WELL.  IT TRULY IS A TAX CUT FOR  AMERICAN WORKING FAMILIES AND  IT CREATES GOOD-PAYING JOBS. THE BILL IS THE RESULT OF OVER   THREE YEARS OF HARD WORK HERE  IN THE HOUSE OF  REPRESENTATIVES. IT'S BEEN CLEAR FOR YEARS THAT   OUR TAX CODE IS BROKEN.  WE ALL AGREE ON THAT.  BUT SIMPLY PUT, IT DOES NOT  WORK FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF  THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. AND WHAT WE DO IS SIMPLIFY THE   TAX CODE.  MORE AMERICANS WILL BE ABLE TO   TAKE A STANDARD DEDUCTION, FILE  ON A POSTCARD THEIR TAX RETURN.  SIMPLIFIES THE PROCESS.  IMPORTANTLY, IT MAKES US MORE  COMPETITIVE INTERNATIONALLY SO   WE DON'T LOSE JOBS TO OVERSEAS   COMPANIES. THAT MAKES US STRONG AS A  NATION.  AND AT THE SAME TIME IT HELPS  SMALL BUSINESSES COMPETE WITH  THOSE LARGE BUSINESSES, WITH   THOSE GLOBAL BUSINESSES AND  MAKE SURE OUR MAIN STREETS ARE   STRONG IN AMERICA. THIS IS A VERY GOOD BILL.  IT IS A VERY GOOD BILL,  WELL-CONTEMPLATED, AND WILL  HAVE A GREAT IMPACT ON WORKING   FAMILIES.  THE BILL HELPS FAMILIES IN MY  DISTRICT, IN PARTICULAR. THE TAX FOUNDATION SAYS THAT   AVERAGE MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES  IN MY DISTRICT IN WESTERN NORTH  CAROLINA ARE GOING TO SEE A  $2,400 INCREASE IN THEIR   TAX-HOME PAY.  THAT'S REAL MONEY FOR WORKING  AMERICANS. IT'S REAL MONEY FOR NORTH  CAROLINAIANS AS WELL.  THE BILL ALSO HELPS SMALL  BUSINESSES BY REDUCING THEIR   TAX RATES AND ALLOWING THEM TO   CREATE MORE GOOD-PAYING JOBS.  WE NEED THAT.  SMALL BUSINESSES ARE THE   LIFEBLOOD OF WESTERN NORTH   CAROLINA'S COMMUNITIES.  WE NEED THEM STRENGTHENED. THE SAME TAX FOUNDATION STUDY  ESTIMATES THAT THIS BILL WILL  CREATE NEARLY A MILLION NEW  JOBS NATIONWIDE, INCLUDING MORE  THAN 30,000 IN NORTH CAROLINA  ALONE. NOW, THERE'S A GREAT DEBATE IN   THIS BODY ABOUT THE APPROACH WE  TOOK ON THIS BILL. THERE'S A FUNDAMENTAL  DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN THE TWO   PARTIES HERE.  MY COLLEAGUES ON THE LEFT WANT   MORE POWER, MORE EXPENDITURES  FROM GOVERNMENT AND WANT TO  TAKE MORE FROM THE AMERICAN  PEOPLE IN ORDER TO PAY FOR   THAT.  WE BELIEVE ON THE REPUBLICAN   SIDE OF THE AISLE THAT AMERICAN  FAMILIES SHOULD BE ABLE TO KEEP  MORE OF WHAT THEY EARN, MAKE   MORE DECISIONS FOR THEMSELVES,   EMPOWER COMMUNITIES, EMPOWER   SMALL BUSINESSES AND MAKE US   MORE COMPETITIVE AND MAKE US   STRONGER.  I URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO VOTE   FOR THIS BILL, TO SEND A STRONG  MESSAGE THAT WE IN THE HOUSE OF  REPRESENTATIVES HAVE A STRONG  TAX PACKAGE FOR THE AMERICAN   PEOPLE, AND I LOOK FORWARD TO  GETTING THIS BILL SIGNED I

so far congressman jim hymes of connecticut is on the house permanent select committee on intelligence thank you congressman for being here are you going to vote yes on arming and training syrian rebels you know uh at this point uh candidly uh i am a lean no on that issue there are still far too many unanswered questions about the kinds of weapons that would be provided uh are we gonna provide man pads in such a way that civil aviation could be threatened who's going to be overseeing these guys will we have u.s officers uniformed or otherwise on the ground in syria making sure these guys don't commit human rights crimes and by the way or or move weapons to people we don't want to have those weapons you know and another question that simply hasn't been answered yet and i should i should stop here and say you know i do support the president with respect to air strikes against iraq that's a classic counterterrorism mission but with respect to these uh rebels there are a lot of unanswered questions how you fight isis on one day and then the next day do what you've really been doing for the last couple of years which is uh fighting assad uh you know there's one thing worse than being on one side of the civil war of a civil war and that's being on two sides of a civil war and congressman did dempsey and hagel not answer any of those questions today no look i think they're doing the best they can and i actually think they're playing a very healthy role a lot of us have wanted this kind of debate and opportunity to sort of see how they're thinking about it i mean i think one of the headlines from today of course is is important for us to remember and that is that general dempsey said that there would be circumstances under which he would ask the president for ground troops uh and you know historically these missions have crept now that's important for us to consider uh as we as we think about you know where in the last 10 years and where we think we may find it congressman let's actually let's take a listen to exactly that quote this coalition is the appropriate way forward i believe that will prove true but if it fails to be true and if there are threats to the united states then i of course would go back to the president and make a recommendation that may include the use of u.s military ground forces we just heard you raise that as a concern do you think this is giving a lot of other members pause absolutely and look there's two essential questions about ground troops one is simply uh you know do we as representatives of the people are the people supportive of that given where we've been in the last 10 years and of course the other big question is would they at the end of the day make the problem better or worse you know look where we have used our military afghanistan iraq and libya and our military is absolutely first-rate but it's hard to look at the experience in those three countries in the last 10 years and say that our application of military force has in the long run in the long run actually made us more secure against groups like isil and the president is also meeting with john allen today uh he's of course expected to lead this military operation if congress doesn't pass this title 10 authorization to train these forces on the ground do you think that the 2001 and 2002 authorizations of the use of military force will cover what the president wants to do largely i do not believe that they do and this is another topic that is you know important and it's worth taking it up even as i suspect the majority of the congress would support again we'd have to talk about syrian rebels but would support aggressive action against isil as we undertake around the world against groups like isil but you know you really have to stretch legally to say as the president does that he thinks that the authorization of 2001 2002 covers this and look this is worth getting right you know if we how far will we stretch things you know someday when uh a guerrilla group in colombia members of al-qaeda now are we at war in colombia i mean that may be you know a ridiculous example but it's a question that we have to ask and you're certainly not alone in saying that that is a stretch uh look one thing stood out to me today hegel saying very clearly that isis could be a threat to the homeland not just to u.s interests if left unchecked still some careful language and caveatting there but very different tone from the president telling chuck todd just a couple of weeks ago that the intelligence doesn't suggest any credible threat to the us itself just u.s interests what does the intelligence suggest well you know this isn't that hard a question uh the intelligence community and they've been very clear on this uh does not at this point in time see uh any plotting any planning on the part of isil against the united states would isil like to do this of course they would like to do this and by the way that's true of a dozen other groups around the world uh so you know tomorrow that that fact could change none of us should be under the misapprehension that these are anything other than brutal horrible people the question is you know is what the president proposed is that the best way to address it are we comfortable we've got enough commitment by the saudis are we comfortable that we'll find a way to work even if we don't admit it with the iranians you know this is there has to be a long conversation about something we all agree on which is that these guys should go away but that conversation has to point us to something that's actually going to work congressman jim hymes appreciate your joining and we'll be watching what you and your colleagues vote uh in these coming days thanks ronan you

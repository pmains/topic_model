one of the most important tasks that we will have over the course the next two years is processing nominees that the president puts forward to the courts or the executive branch of the government and you would hope that these would be nominees who would be capable of carrying out the task of Performing the people's business but that hasn't been the case with a number of bite Administration nominees in fact there was a huge story in the last couple of weeks about a Biden nominee for a judgeship who couldn't answer basic simple questions about the Constitution that performance as a matter of fact went viral there have been nominees who have been soft on crime anti-police that have been put forward for important positions on the Judiciary and so it's important for us as a senate to do our diligence when it comes to vetting and processing these nominees and one that I would like to speak to is one that is was before the Senate Commerce Committee this morning and that is Gigi son to be a commissioner on the Federal Communications Commission Miss zone is somebody who has a record of far-left activism of rank partisanship she has expressed disdain for Republicans including supporting contributing to something we've never seen before Democrat Senate campaigns this year she has gone after in demonized conservative media Outlets she has been part of a there was a campaign back in 2016 where the then chairman of the FCC Tom wheeler asked her to leak information to the to the Press which scuttled a deal that a bipartisan deal that the commission had agreed to so she's just got a record of partisanship and activism that doesn't suggest that she would be able to perform her job in a non-partisan way and and do the kind of work that we expect an agency with that kind of jurisdiction that impacts so much of our daily lives to do she is somebody who should be rejected by the United States Senate and I hope there are enough Discerning Democrats out there that will come to that conclusion right now the FCC is 2-2 it's functioning in a perfectly normal way they're they're getting things done and um putting her on the on the FCC would add partisanship make it increasingly difficult I think for the FCC to do its job and the way the American people expected

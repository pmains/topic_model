Thank You mr. chairman mr. Lu welcome and I was interested this morning staff came in and said that they done account that since 2001 the Congress has passed 137 laws changing the tax code now as you know almost always these laws have helpful provisions nobody disputes that but with each one of these changes the tax system gets more incomprehensible more dysfunctional and more Byzantine so my question to you is do you support the idea that it's now time for the Congress to make a break with this idea of just passing these piecemeal changes actually put a hold on these piecemeal tax changes and actually move to the kind of long-term bipartisan tax reform that's nor Baucus and Senator hatch and and chairman camp are talking about should we put a hold on these piecemeal approaches senator I definitely agree that we should do the big job of tax reform and I think Western should we put a hold on the piecemeal approaches because as long as we keep passing them I think it's going to be tough to get the long-term reform I hadn't actually thought about whether there was an approach like the one you described a bit happy to have discussion with you about it my my own predisposition is we should just get the big job done and anything that makes it easier to do is worth considering okay you're going to have a large role in determining whether health care coverage is affordable for workers and families because the IRS determines who's eligible for tax credits for health care and how much they'd be eligible for now the IRS has already determined that affordability is going to be based on the cost of a workers individual coverage not the cost of family coverage so we are going to have millions of workers and spouses and dependents in a kind of regulatory no man's land now in the Affordable Care Act a provision was added that would have allowed an employee to take their employers contribution either the individual or the family and shop for a policy that best fit their needs at a price that they could afford as we talked about in the office that provision is no longer there so we've got millions of people these working-class middle-class people that are pinched there in the middle there unable to afford the family coverage offered through their employer and ineligible for the subsidy that could be used by dependence on the exchange what do you think ought to be done to help him senator I think that getting the Affordable Care Act in place there are a lot of hurdles between now and 2014 job number one is to get it up and running I would look forward to working with you and the members of this committee to ask and answer the questions about are there gaps that need to be addressed after that there are many things in the Affordable Care Act that require a lot of work to get in place and I must say my first focus would ban making sure we implement the law but then I'd be delighted to pursue with you looking at solutions two remaining problems the New York Times and others in the Press said that millions of low and moderate income families are going to be affected by this IRS decision so this is not an abstract question I appreciate your saying that you're going to work with me and others on it this is an urgent matter these are not people that ought to get hammered they have done nothing wrong we had a provision that would have made a real difference to those families it's not there anymore I think it has to be a priority let me ask you about one other area we talked about it in the office and that is the electioneering that now takes place by tax-exempt social welfare organizations and this stems from the wake of the citizens united a case there's been a proliferation of these entities that are organized under 501 C 4 of provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and they're really doing politics they get a tax break as social welfare organizations but they're really ripping off Xcode because they're not social welfare organizations they're doing a politics and I think some of my colleagues had a little bit of a case of how outrageous this has gotten now Senator Murkowski and I are going to be introducing bipartisan legislation to stop this to take away that tax break when these organizations don't disclose but I was very troubled by the fact that the IRS what's called the priority guidance plan basically doesn't make cleaning this abuse up a priority I question to you is when confirmed I believe you will be I'm certainly supporting you will you make it a priority to drain the slop here this is not a partisan issue this is an abuse of flagrant abuse of the tax code these aren't social welfare organizations they're electioneering and they're doing it with the taxpayers dime and they're not disclosing we make it a priority to fix this senator as a general proposition I believe that the tax laws should be enforced and forced fairly if there's something wrong here it should be looked at you know there's a appropriate distance between the Treasury secretary and the IRS on enforcement matters but on policy matters I think it's entirely appropriate to ask that question this this is something that's way wrong and my time is up this chairman thank you thank you

let me ask mr. Hertz are the fines that are being paid by the penalties being paid by the federal government to the utilities are those are their penalties involved are those mostly for the costs of the utilities storage of the nuclear waste that the federal government should be paying for their on-site storage they're not fines and penalties their damages and their damages that are being incurred what the court does is engages in an exercise of looking at the breach world and the non breach world what would have been the utilities expense if the Department of Energy had not breached the contract that's the base then you look at what the utilities expense is in the breach world because because energy has not picked up the spent nuclear fuel compared the two the difference is damages so the government is paying essentially the increased storage capacity that is necessary at various utilities because the government has not come and picked up the spent nuclear fuel will those costs increase in the future as more and more utilities sue the federal government and effectively Brent you know I don't know what case we've got stand on or what ground we've got stand on we've breached contract the as I've said the Federal Circuit has said there's been a partial breach of the contract until we begin performing under the contract until we begin breaking up waste at what the court of the Federal Circuit has decided was the contractual rate of acceptance that the government had agreed to that we will in keep will keep incurring damages the amount of damages in any given cases is very individualized you know it depends on the configuration of the utility it depends on what kind of storage they engage in what their physical plant looks like at some point you would think that utilities build I mean they put spent nuclear fuel in pools they have to remove it from the pools and put it on slabs they have to store it they incur expense to secure that at some point the current utilities will stop operating they'll stop producing spent nuclear fuel they'll if the federal government doesn't pick up doesn't begin picking up the spent nuclear fuel you'll incur costs to secure those things on site currently the damage is being paid out of the judgment fund correct there's 24 billion dollars sitting in the nuclear waste disposal fund that the ratepayers and also the rest of the taxpayers have paid into that fund if we are if we don't move forward with a with completing this geological repository can those funds be used to pay the to pay the utilities for their on-site storage of the SNF that we have not taken charge of probably not without legislation the the government had argued that when early on when we settle the case for increased costs that we should be able to pay those increase costs that settlement out of the nuclear waste fund the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit disagreed with that under the nuclear under the Act saying that those funds were only available essentially to design and build a repository they weren't designed for on-site storage which in effect that settlement was so unless there is legislation changing that and legislation can change it I mean it you know it is decision of the court interpreting the act as it existed at the time did we stop charging the ratepayers for the for the construction of a waste repository when we're not doing it the you mean the fee the annual fees right right well I mean there is litigation that has been filed by some of the utilities challenging that challenging the secretary determination not to reconsider setting the rate and that litigation is being defended by the Department of Justice I think you know under the act as it exists now the cost to build a repository or to ultimately dispose of this are to be borne by the utilities if you know this is a question if if you were to stop what if the secretary would determine that and then the Blue Ribbon Commission came up with another solution and that was going to cost a certain amount you would just have to ramp up the rate at that point under the at least unless the law change and some other respect but under the law now the utilities have to bear the cost through this through this fund congressman dr. Johnson let me go I might I add to that under the while I don't want to discuss the details of the litigation obviously I thought I might express the Department of Energy's view on this in our view we are absolutely required and committed to taking and disposing of spent nuclear fuel we believe we have an obligation that is commensurate with the obligation to take the fuel to charge the fee to be able eventually to dispose of it we view the two obligations as inextricably linked in law and that's why we are continuing with the spent nuclear fuel fee we think our obligation to take it is thi as a matter of law to our obligation to charge the fee I could ask one last question mr. chairman dr. Johnson this year the mark-up in the energy and water subcommittee and also I believe in the Senate energy and water subcommittee included no funds to proceed with with yucca mountain for the licensing application should the NRC rule as I believe they correctly will that that the administration cannot unilaterally withdraw the application what will the Department do in terms of hundred to two hundred million dollars that will be necessary to proceed with license application will they come in and ask for reprogramming to do that or will they just ignore it and say we don't have any funds thank you very much for the question if the NRC were to rule and we would follow the rulings and we would follow appropriate appropriation processes and we would do what we need to do to to follow what we been directed to do by Congress in the NRC anything we wise to put that hundred million dollars in there now and then if we don't have to spend it that'd be a wonderful thing I think that we feel confident that we have the authority to withdraw the application therefore we need to plan for what what the President's budget which calls for no funding for continued with the licensing having said that we do have funds in nuclear energy to continue to look at research and how to manage the back into the fuel cycle we do have funds allocated in legacy management to continue with the records and the management of the records so that we don't lose the knowledge we have funds allocated in general counsel in order to continue processing of the contracts so I I believe we are following a very well thought out process in order to be prepared to when we get the recommendations from Blue Ribbon Commission to carry those out out with your help and operations if the if the department if the NRC rules that they cannot withdraw the license application will the department still have the personnel in place or is it being dismantled at a rate that we will have to appropriate money to put everybody back in place to proceed with the license application certainly we've been following a path to take care of the people to make sure that they have opportunities as we believe that we have the right to withdraw the motion and to close down Yucca Mountain so we've had to move and make sure that the employees can find other positions so therefore we will not have employees as of October one and we would have to restart that process thank you as Macomb

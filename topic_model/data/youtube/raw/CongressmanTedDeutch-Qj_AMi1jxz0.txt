I spent a lot of time since the shooting in Marjory Stoneman Douglas with the students you survived and they've been very clear that what they want is back and I am heartened by what you say about the need for presidential leadership you can do this I understand mr. president that you met with the NRA what matters here is not the NRA what matters here is preventing another one of these mass shootings and so I'm so grateful to hear that senator Toomey and Senator mansions bill not might be I would suggest must be a part of this for universal background checks there are so many things that we can do right now the only thing I would add you started mr. president by pointing out that there would be differences of opinion please know that there are great differences of opinion on the question of whether having teachers armed with guns firing back at a potential mass shooter is the answer I don't think it is many others don't please also know that there are the majority of people in this country now understand that there are limitations on the Second Amendment you cannot own an automatic weapon you cannot own a bazooka and so there is no reason to continue to sell to people a weapon of war like this I know there are differences of opinion I just hope that we can act that we can show the American people and the kids and their grieving families in my district that with presidential leadership it doesn't matter what Congress says that you can help push this forward and that we will consider everything including like that and I appreciate that

DOESN'T BELIEVE CHINA WILL TAKE  ADDITIONAL ACTION AS IT  ESCALATES TENSIONS FOLLOWING  HOUSE SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI'S  VISIT TO THE SELF-GOVERNING  ISLAND OF TAIWAN, WHICH CHINA  CLAIMS AS ITS OWN. LISTEN TO THIS. >> I'M NOT WORRIED BUT I'M  CONCERNED THAT THEY'RE MOVING AS MUCH AS THEY ARE, BUT I DON'T  THINK THEY'RE GOING TO DO  ANYTHING MORE. >> LET'S DISCUSS WITH RAJA  KRISHNAMOORTHI OF ILLINOIS. HE JOINED THE HOUSE SPEAKER  NANCY PELOSI ON HER  CONTROVERSIAL VISIT TO TAIWAN. CONGRESSMAN, THANKS SO MUCH FOR  JOINING US. THESE CHINESE MILITARY DRILLS  THAT ARE ONGOING RIGHT NOW MARK  A SIGNIFICANT ESCALATION. IS IT A MISTAKE FOR PRESIDENT  BIDEN TO SUGGEST THAT CHINA IS  GOING TO STOP THIS SHOW OF  FORCE? >> NO, NOT NECESSARILY. I THINK HE'S CORRECT. I THINK THAT THIS IS  IRRESPONSIBLE AND IT'S RECKLESS  OF THE PRC TO DO WHAT IT'S  DOING. BUT THEY DID THIS LONG BEFORE WE VISITED TAIWAN, AND THEY'RE  DOING IT AGAIN NOW. BUT IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT WE  HAVE VISITED TAIWAN BECAUSE IN  LIGHT OF UKRAINE, IT'S  ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO MAKE  SURE THAT WHAT HAPPENED IN  UKRAINE DOES NOT HAPPEN IN  TAIWAN. AND WE HAVE TO STAND SHOULDER TO SHOULDER WITH THE TAIWANESE AND  OTHER PARTNERS IN THE REGION  AGAINST ANY AGGRESSION BY THE  CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY. >> YOU SAY THAT IN CHINA'S VIEW, CONGRESSMAN, THERE WOULD NEVER  BE A GOOD TIME FOR YOUR TRIP TO  TAIWAN. BUT THIS HAS CERTAINLY GIVEN  CHINA THE EXCUSE IT NEEDS TO SET A MORE DANGEROUS STATUS, MORE  DANGEROUS STATUS QUO. DO YOU AND HOUSE SPEAKER BEAR  SOME RESPONSIBILITY FOR PUTTING  THE NATIONAL SECURITY OF TAIWAN  POTENTIALLY AT GREATER RISK? >> NO, AND I THINK IF YOU ASK  THE TAIWANESE WHETHER IT WAS A  GOOD IDEA FOR US TO VISIT THEM,  THEY WOULD ANSWER 100% YES. YOU ONLY HAVE TO LOOK AT THE  THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THAT GREETED SPEAKER PELOSI AND OUR  DELEGATION AT THE AIRPORT AT  MIDNIGHT AND ALONG THE STREETS  OF TAIPEI AS WE CAME INTO TOWN. THESE FOLKS, WOLF, ARE JUST  ISOLATED BY THE REST OF THE  WORLD RIGHT NOW. THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY IS  THREATENING THEM EVERY DAY. THIS IS ONE OF THE FREEST  DEMOCRACIES ON EARTH. AND SO US BEING THERE WAS A  POWERFUL SYMBOL OF OUR UNITY  WITH THE TAIWANESE PEOPLE, AS  THEY TRY TO PROTECT THEMSELVES,  AND THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO  THEM. >> HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO  CONCERNS, CONGRESSMAN, THAT BY  TAKING THIS TRIP, THE HOUSE  SPEAKER UNDERMINED LONG-STANDING U.S. POLICY ON TAIWAN? >> OH, IT'S ABSOLUTELY  INCORRECT. UNDER THE TAIWAN RELATIONS ACT,  WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO SUPPORT THE SELF-DEFENSE OF TAIWAN, AND  WE ALSO HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO  MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE  CAPACITY OURSELVES, OUR FORCES,  TO RESIST ANY FORCE OR  AGGRESSION BY THE PEOPLE'S  REPUBLIC OF CHINA. AND WE BELIEVE IN THE TAIWAN  RELATIONS ACT, ALONG WITH THE  JOINT COMMUNIQUES AND THE SIX  ASSURANCES AND OTHER JOINT  AGREEMENTS MADE WITH THE  PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA WITH  REGARD TO TAIWAN, BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, IT'S ABOUT CALM AND  STABILITY ACROSS THE STRAIT --  ACROSS THE TAIWAN STRAIT, AND  RIGHT NOW, IT'S THE PEOPLE'S  REPUBLIC OF CHINA THAT IS  DESTABILIZING THAT REGION, NOT  THE TAIWANESE. >> LET ME ALSO WHILE I HAVE YOU, CONGRESSMAN, GET YOUR REACTION  TO THE SENATE PASSING THIS  SWEEPING CLIMATE, TAX, AND  HEALTH CARE BILL. WILL THIS BE ENOUGH FOR  DEMOCRATS TO OVERCOME SOME  SERIOUS HURDLES IN THE UPCOMING  MIDTERM ELECTIONS AND MAINTAIN  CONTROL OF THE HOUSE? >> I DON'T KNOW, BUT IT'S THE  RIGHT THING TO DO, WOLF. YOU KNOW, THIS INFLATION  REDUCTION ACT DOES SO MANY GOOD  THINGS. YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY IT LOWERS  CARBON EMISSIONS. IT LOWERS PRESCRIPTION DRUG  PRICES. IT LOWERS THE DEFICIT. IT LOWERS PREMIUMS ON THE  OBAMACARE EXCHANGES AND OVER  TIME IT LOWERS INFLATION. I WAS TALKING TO MY CONSTITUENTS OVER THE WEEKEND, AND THEY'RE  EXCITED ABOUT WHAT'S IN THERE. AND I THINK THAT THE POLITICS  TAKES CARE OF ITSELF IF WE DO  THE RIGHT THING AND PASSING THIS LEGISLATION IS T

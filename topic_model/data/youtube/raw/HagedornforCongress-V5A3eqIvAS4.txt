we all know that Obamacare is an unmitigated disaster and the dip of the Democrats like walls who voted for it have inflicted enormous pain and punishment on the people of southern Minnesota now they promised we were going to keep our doctors and keep our plans and save twenty five hundred bucks a year most of most of the folks in the audience here would probably be happy if they only had to pay an extra twenty five hundred dollars per year but by and large what the way I look at it is you have to think ideas to make this thing different competition transparency and cost I think we have to change taxes and so forth but when you look at Obamacare and the and the pain and punishments inflicted on the people you know you don't have to go too far I can go four rows deep down here and I've seen the parts of Greg and Merrick and I remember talking to them about how before Obamacare their premiums were X after Obamacare they're paying twenty twenty five thousand dollars a year for premiums with deductibles so high the insurance is worthless who can afford that stuff you go over to Winona I spent some time over there with Bernie Brenner who owns knit Kraft makes these fine st. Croix clothing one of the last great closers in the United States actually when they make things here and for 50 years he had a company small business for the people of his company were provided insurance no deductible where they had profit sharing and that Obamacare came along now that now employers are paying a thousand or two thousand dollars a year they have a deductible and when you have people making sixteen seventeen dollars an hour they just got a reduction in their pay of two bucks or so an hour that's the type of stuff I like no more profit sharing because of Obamacare you know what's been going on in Washington on this issue not good I'm not real happy with where we are the Republicans I think they'll get it together at some point but what we need are competition across state lines to try to put downward pressure and cost competition works every time we need transparency and cost people should be able to figure out what it's going to cost for routine medical services and then pay for those things with pre-tax dollars if we do that we can have shopping we can put regression cost we can have shopping for routine care it will make sense people who move to catastrophic coverage we also need solutions like tort reform and also taking Medicaid and moving it back to the States so our states can figure it out and I would have worked for welfare to that for able-bodied people if we do those types of things we can have a system that's going to put downward pressure on cost we can make these changes I think overall we're very disappointed in what's been going on in Washington on this issue you know the Republicans have failed however the Democrats got it works they've got those solutions to fix Obamacare they're only solutions are single-payer medicare-for-all and you know Medicare for all this VA care for everyone if you think it's bad now wait until the government gives it to you for free the taxes are up it's going to have it we're going to have a exacerbate our doctor shortage going to have long lines it's going to degrade medicine medicare for all single-payer would be a devastating blow to Rochester the Mayo Clinic and all of our fine hospitals across the district so for that many reasons we have a clear contrast on the issue and I look forward to getting out there at some point whether or not they fix all the problem up front there's going to be much to do down the road thank you

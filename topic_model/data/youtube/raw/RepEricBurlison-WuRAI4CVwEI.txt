hi I'm Eric Burleson state represented from the 136 district in Springfield Missouri and today this week we wanted to talk to you about how spill 1639 and with me is the sponsor of the bill Jerry Nolte from the 33rd district in Kansas City North Jerry first I wanted to talk about how 1639 is different from HCR 43 which we passed at the very beginning of the year that was a bill that's now being worked through in the Senate and it has it was a bill that i sponsored and it has to do with keeping the expenditures of the state at a constant rate making sure that government is not growing beyond what it necessarily needs to grow by how is 1639 different different than that bill 1639 is different in that what we're doing there is actually lowering the rate of taxation for all businesses by fifty percent that includes sole proprietorships and family farms as well the idea is that will stimulate growth in those economies and job creation which will in turn increase our intake of tax money and revenues to the state that's great so while the HTR 43 deals specifically with trying to restrict the expenses of government yours deals with the income that's coming in and the tax rates and the revenue that we have as a state it deals with that issue they're the main thrust of course is to put hand the money in the hands of entrepreneurs that is really where wealth is created and jobs are created is in those hands not the government's that's enough I hear all the time people say that you know we're up here to create jobs and and I think that's a refreshing attitude it's it's really the businesses that are creating jobs that's absolutely true if you've used the metaphor of a meal what we do is we set the table but the meat potatoes are brought by a private enterprise that's a great analogy I've not heard that before that's really great so if can you elaborate that go into the details of how this bill works and how it will create jobs well what we're doing is initially we will cut ten percent off of those tax rates so they were it's not a program that they have to apply for it will be automatically when do their taxes once that ten percent is cut revenues will drop slightly but we have to bring them back up to the 2010 income levels once we've hit that benchmark which will which will signal job growth then we do the next cut and each time we go through a cut it has to be tested by growth in job creation see I think what what you're doing is really refreshing because right now we're experiencing a time where we're governments at all levels federal state and local they're seeing the the decline of revenue and their response to that is often to raise taxes because politicians or and bureaucrats they start getting desperate but if they're not getting the money there then they wonder where they're going to get more so their natural inclination is to raise taxes but what you're doing is refreshing you're saying no let's let's look at why we're receiving less revenues because the private sector is hurting let's cut taxes on the private sector and and the result will be growing the pie exactly will grow the pie and I would like to say this is an original idea my part but certainly this is something that has tried and true both Ronald Reagan and John Kennedy employed similar tactics and the result was the the boom that we had in the 60s and the boom do we had the 80s so I think we're looking at something that is not experimental that's something that is a method that has proven its worth that's great have you gotten a lot of feedback on this bill yes particularly the business community obviously there's a good deal of excitement that they will have the opportunity to take this money and invest it where it needs to be which is any capital improvements or in personnel I think that's a great point to be made is that businesses that are already succeeding there that are existing today what better way to you know we often try to craft different programs projects as legislators that you know that we think will really create jobs but jobs are already being created and and really a broad-based tax cut will be you that that money will be utilized to maximum extent because those businesses that are succeeding the most will create the most jobs and you know really one of the criticisms you hear is that we of course pick winners and losers in this particular instance it is for everybody that's a great point well thank you for bringing this bill forward it's been great working with you Jerry I know this is your last year but we're excited to see you move on to bigger and better things and I just wanted to introduce you to my constituents back home and and tell them about them that about your exciting

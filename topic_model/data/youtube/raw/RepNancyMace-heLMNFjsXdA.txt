all right south carolina congresswoman nancy mace is here with us to discuss nancy we've talked about this before you let you know i'm all for affordable housing you're all for infrastructure this is not the right way to go about it no absolutely not and president biden he's done more damage in the first hundred days than i thought possible in four years of his presidency he is pushing nancy pelosi's agenda in every way shape or form and when you look at this infrastructure package i mean i would love to see president biden retake civics 101 the federal government has absolutely no business telling local governments how to zone that's why we elect mayors and city councils to run cities to to try to help and make housing more affordable and to make those decisions at the local level and as you said in your opening the 10th amendment is there for a reason it's called federalism and states have rights too exactly and then and then when you look at what they're trying to push through on it i mean i just was no just when you look at the infrastructure bill they're talking about oh they've made some concession it seems to me like they can what they're talking about as concession is just moving some piece of funding from this bill to another bill anyway and then saying oh look we've moved towards the republicans it's they're just such sort of they're so dishonest in the way they're approaching it absolutely and from what i've heard on the streets of dc is that nancy pelosi has taken over the transportation infrastructure committee that they're not working or looking to work with republicans at all on this package they've already had to rename it to the jobs plan because everyone understood that it had nothing to do with infrastructure and right behind demands for public housing from the federal level to local governments is a hundred billion dollars for school lunches i'm a single mom i want my kids to have good lunches too but that has nothing to do with infrastructure and so they've got a real problem on their hands right now in selling this to the american people and the only way that they can pay for it is by having the largest tax hike in american history and i think that is the worst idea in the middle of a pandemic where businesses and individuals and families are suffering and also some of the things that they that they sort of list under this headache of infrastructure you know they talk about sort of funding for schools and and so on and and i think even transportation they were included in all these bailout bills we've had over the last year and and the state and local governments haven't even spent that money billions and billions of dollars haven't even been spent yet now they want more right and there's been no audit on what's been spent so far and also in that package there is almost 200 billion about 174 billion or so for electric vehicles i don't remember seeing that kind of investment for our energy grid or infrastructure grid at all we just had a cyber attack recently we've got real problems in this country and infrastructure should be the focus of an infrastructure bill 100 percent exactly and and that's you know and i think that you you know you're there fighting for that i mean just very quickly do you think that there's any chance they're gonna listen to your common sense approach to this it's very doubtful at this point with pelosi taking over things within this committee from what i'm hearing republicans have met with the president on multiple occasions we've put forth our own alternatives the senate has and i know ranking member sam graves he's worked on alternatives as well but it's just falling on deaf ears and if there's now is a time than ever to be efficient and common sense with your spending that time is now we need to keep spending into oblivion we're going to increase taxes on corporations individuals and families and it's untenable for the future of this country for my children more than our grandchildren's future we can't do it anymore exactly well um i think we're all pleased to know that you're there um talking sense as always and great that we could you could be with us tonight thank you congressman may see you soon

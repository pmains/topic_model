senator kennedy from louisiana is recognized for five minutes thank you mr chairman thank you mr morristad for being here today you're not clairvoyant and i'm certainly not clairvoyant so i can just share with you what i've observed so far i think with respect to risk rating 2.0 i think you're i think you're presiding over a tire fire uh i think the roll out of of risk reading 2.0 looks like a ferret fire drill i mean here's what i hear fema saying we created this program in 1968 fema has the authority to assign premiums we fema i hear you saying all these years have been doing it wrong we've been assessing risk wrong and now we fema have had an epiphany and we have figured out how to look at every individual property out of all the properties in the united states of america and assign the risk for that particular property but we're not going to tell you how we're going to do it in fact we're going to require the insurance companies who are implementing risk rating 2.0 to sign a gag order we're not going to promulgate a rule we're not going to allow for public comment we're just going to do it because we're smarter than the people who pay the premiums and we're smarter than the united states congress now i need you to explain to the policyholders of america right now not with in glo gauzy platitudes no no disrespect mr administrator but i feel strongly about this because you're not waiting you're going to pull the trigger in august i need you to explain to them this epiphany that fema's had and how if you look at a particular property you're able now to to assign with specificity and accuracy flood risk when all these years you did it wrong tell me what you did wrong and tell me now why it's going to be accurate so fundamentally the methodology is different previously we looked at rating policies based on a zone i get that part i'm sorry to interrupt you but i only have five minutes i get the part in the you're saying i can look at uh senator brown's property now that we've had this epiphany and we've talked to consultants and and know specifically on his property what the risk is how what new factors are you considering how are you going to do it so we don't have much time and i would just point you to the document that we put on the website that in essence is the same as an insurance rate filing that a private insurance company would provide to a state insurance commissioner that would uh be able to validate the methodology associated with the rates that they were going to charge so i would how are you going to do it so that document shows how the and explains how we do it we in essence uh the simplified form would be we're using three different commercially available cap models we've developed two who developed the models the one of them is uh air one of them is uh corelogic and the other is cat risk we combined that with two uh has the public well i'm sorry go ahead excuse me we combined that with with two government developed fema developed cap models include and then we added replacement cost information that we get from corelogic that all the regular insurance companies let me stop you because i got 30 seconds and i'm sorry mr morris did i really apologize i'm going to ask the chairman to hold another hearing on this okay you've got some consultants and they've developed models i get that part they haven't been tested we haven't you you've done no rule you've done no public comment nobody has been allowed to weigh in uh policyholders have no idea what you're talking about you know what i've discovered about consultants and predicting the future for every consultant is an equal and opposite consultant and oftentimes they're both wrong and a lot of them are are their accuracy is about as good as those late-night psychic hotlines on tv and you've done this in secret yeah and it's not right well sir and we don't know whether you've considered other alternatives as senator menendez i'm almost done mr chairman as senator menendez talked about are we paying the insurance companies too much is 30 off the top too much why aren't we doing a better job of requiring people who are supposed to have insurance to have the insurance what about some of these consultants that i've talked to fema about that you could persist in hiring they're thieves yes sir so none of this has been addressed all good points uh look forward to having further discussion with you on all of it i know how important the national flood insurance program is to to your state over the past 16 years uh there have been 260 but i want you to understand mr martin i'm going to get cut off in my state we're not talking about a bunch of wealthy homeowners who have a second and third beach house these are working people they get up every day they go to work they obey the law they try to do the right thing by their kids they try to save a little money for retirement their biggest investment is in their home and now you're doing this to them without explaining it to them this will and we wonder why congress and the federal government ranks and polls right up there with skim milk risk rating 2.0 will assist exactly the people that you're talking about two-thirds of the homeowners and they have pre-firmed uh subsidized homes are going to see a reduction in their in their premium currently low value homes 80 of my people currently low-valued homeowners are subsidizing high-value homes this program addresses the concerns that you have you gotta explain why mr morse dad back to the case a lot of distrust of washington you've got to explain why you can't hide your consultants you've got to be in front of god and country and policyholders you've got to say this is the methodology now let's test it through debate so let's let's clear the consultant issue up first of all uh we've been fema's been working on this for five years uh thousands of hours uh it is probably not a well-known fact but fema has some of the best flood catastrophic actuaries in the country then we ought to test them in public they are top-notch then they ought to come they ought to be disgusted in public data that'll be cross-examined in addition to we did use and uh three cap models the same cap models the reinsurance industry uses to price their product then why is fema trying to hire i told you he was going to cut me off then then the fema shouldn't hide it shouldn't hide your work show your work we've posted show you more information on the website than what's ever been posted before i point you to our our website where statements that's the answer or website well sir and we've done 450 stakeholder engagement since march first why did you make senator senator kennedy your times expired you've gone over eight minutes thank you mr chairman and thank you again mr administrator for being here you referenced in in answering senator tillis's question a private company that he quarterbacked this for you that is also a consultant to other insurance companies uh what what private company is that uh the uh millermann millerman yeah and they didn't spearhead this um they um they they worked for fema and helping us make sure that we are uh in line with the way that a private sector company would go about achieving a a modern risk-based actuarially sound rating system right and how much did meloman charge fema i'll have to get back to you on that was it 10 million i don't i'll have to get back to you you don't know i will get back to you okay was it more than 10 million i'm not going to guess sir okay uh why didn't why didn't fema allow for public comment if you're if you've you've had this epiphany and you've decided that after all these years you've been doing it wrong and melamin has now shown you how to do it correctly why would you not subject that to public comment so not to be argumentative with you sir i mean we we weren't doing it wrong for all those years um it was just a different time in a different and a different way in which to fundamentally price insurance when we when we uh it was determined that we had yes why haven't you you allowed for public comment we've put as i said before we've we've made all the information available we're charged with the responsibility yes sir charged with the responsibility of developing a risk-based actuarially sound site-specific pricing methodology that's what you've told us to do and that's what we've done but by your own admission this this 200 pages report that you put on your website i wrote down what you said here you said you have to be an actuary to evaluate it did i misunderstand you no sir i mean you wouldn't have a plumber do an abdomenectomy either i mean it is it is uh done on the basis of the way in which a rating uh file don't you want people to understand the change so there are other there are other tools that we've also put on the website also we've put a fundamentals of the risk rating 2.0 we've put a video on there we've put the uh so we've we've provided that information also in addition to all the stakeholders that assist us in communicating our problems gonna put in a a a toll-free number where people can call and say okay here's my house at 26 main street uh bucks north america you changed my you increase my premiums because premiums are going to go up by 80 percent they are i mean we might as well be honest with people premiums go up right now average of about ten percent a year not eighty percent and and as i understand what you're saying is millerman in its wisdom has decided they can look at a property and decide the risk in an absolute sense and you can't increase premiums immediately to achieve a premium commensurate with that risk because congress has stepped in and said look you got to consider your customers for god's sakes that's who this is for so you're going to have to do it gradually but will i be able to call millman's and say millman's get you you've now been able to assess the risk and you can look 20 30 40 50 years in the future and see it can you tell me what my risk is and how long i'm going to have these premiums and by the way could i get your advice about the stock market if they're that good so i i maybe have not been clear milliman did not do what you just articulated that's not what i hear well uh didn't we i hear milaman father this child no no they did not and we used multiple sources and it was led by uh the fema chief actuary and so uh fema drove this process miliman supported us in this in this endeavor last question a lot of people buy insurance because they have to i'm glad they do they should buy it the mortgage lender says yep it's in place let's close on the loan and they drop the insurance to follow up on senator warren's question why don't we do a better job of of requiring our moral mortgage lenders to do their job to make sure that people keep their insurance sure and and of course the mortgage lenders are responsible for that and and they're they're they're regulators and we do want people to have the coverage and keep the coverage and as i indicated to you before i want to continue to have discussions with you because i know how important uh the nfip is to louisiana there have been 260 000 claims paid to louisiana policyholders to the tune of 17.7 billion dollars to help those policyholders on the road to recovery over the course of the last 15 years so i want this program and it will work for louisiana in the future as it has in the past thank you thank you

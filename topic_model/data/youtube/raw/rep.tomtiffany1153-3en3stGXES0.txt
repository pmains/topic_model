you know one of the first questions i get brad from people are are we going to be able to handle four years of this you know record inflation record gas prices record crime record illegal border crossings record deficits to foreign policies shambles people are asking the question can we survive this for four years yeah well i think people are truly concerned about that because you know i i forget the the exact number but it was something like 75 percent of the general public lives paycheck to paycheck and all of a sudden their paychecks aren't going nearly as far no inflation has really eaten into people's paychecks and you know it should be looked at as a tax because what has happened here is um the democrats since january 20th of 2021 have said we're just going to spend money we're just going to spend money and the federal reserve has given them the favor of printing that money and rather than doing what they should have done if that's what they were going to do and simply raise taxes inflation serves as a stealth tax and that's what eating people paychecks up you know brad i was just doing a uh uh i was doing a press call for the state of wisconsin with a couple state legislative representatives in regards to agriculture this week and what agricultural economists are saying right now is that farmers can expect their receipts to be down eight percent this year and like milk prices are up like from like 18 100 to 24 100 i believe but it's all getting eaten up and they're actually going to end up with less money as a result of the high cost of inputs and clearly fertilizer diesel fuel and all the rest right well congressman that that's one of the things that i think i was stunned by the other day when i was reading a report and they said if you think the price of food at the at the grocery store is expensive now wait till next year because all of a sudden people are paying a hundred percent more for fertilizer to grow crops uh everything is going to go up yeah there's a lot of farmers that are deciding whether they're going to fertilize the way they normally do which of course will affect crop yield and then of course you have the war going on in ukraine and uh they export a fair amount of food also and uh yes it's all going to affect these global markets and so america better keep growing food because otherwise we're going to be in a world of hurt

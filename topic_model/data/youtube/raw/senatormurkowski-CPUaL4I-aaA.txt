the infrastructure bill has a great deal of importance and priority for places all over the country but for me i look at infrastructure like this hard infrastructure bridges roads the rail connections and i think about what that means to us here in alaska we don't have a lot of road system given the the size and extent of our state there's one bridge over this nana river so making sure that we're maintaining our infrastructure has got to be a priority this is the parks highway this is what is connecting us it's beautiful today it's about 75 or gonna be about 75 but yet in the winter time i could be standing here at 50 below zero probably wouldn't be standing here too comfortably but you think about what that means to your infrastructure and how that wears on extreme temperature variations like we have particularly here in the interior require a level of not only technology it perhaps is a little more reinforced it just becomes more expensive and so how we maintain that how we provide for this level of access this is this is really what the infrastructure bill is all about this is about hard infrastructure that allows alaskans to move around allows us to participate in levels of commerce and allows us to be safe [Music]

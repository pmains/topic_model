i think as we look forward as the american rescue plan is now law i think there are a number of different aspects that we're hoping the people of new hampshire will take a look at because i think there are significant benefits in this legislation that will ensure that we can weather the economic crisis and the health crisis as we move forward and hopefully that light at the end of the tunnel that we all sense is there uh that we can reach it as quickly as possible uh especially as we see vaccinations continue to ramp up in the coming weeks this is a significant bill but so is the crisis that we're experiencing right now and i think the legislation helps meet the moment and ensure that our country will be strong coming out of this um there are some facets of the bill that will ensure we're providing direct support to people who are struggling right now we know that the economic recession is really unequal it's hit our working families and hourly wage earners uh much more so than those at the top and that's why the stimulus checks that are in the bill the expansion of the child tax credit that is in the bill subsidies for individuals to maintain their health insurance extended unemployment benefits and support to safely reopen our schools are all facets of this legislation that will benefit our communities and our families these provisions get direct support to those that need that help and it will ensure that our state can recover from this pandemic as quickly as possible

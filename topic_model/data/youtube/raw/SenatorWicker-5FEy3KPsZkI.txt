thank you and thank you mr. Henry for your testimony in your written testimony you mentioned that you mentioned a constituent of mine mr. Puckett and and mentioned that basically he had to sell the generations-old business because he just couldn't make the compliance cost would you would you explain that to the members of the subcommittee certainly yeah you know the the brick industry news travels pretty fast and a few weeks ago it came out that Columbus brick had decided to sell to General shale a large multinational conglomerate and Al and I spoke about it now said one of the mitigating factors was continually continually increasing costs to comply with new regulations he said with his age and where his family business was they couldn't commit the four or six million dollars he felt like it was gonna cost him to comply in the future without only this rule but other rules being considered for our industry and he just felt like his only choice based on that and some other factors was to sell and so when we when we weigh the pluses and minuses of any of these things we need to weigh the cost of the loss of jobs against the benefit and I'm sure everyone would agree with that also you're a small business mr. Henry you employ 58 people you'd like to get back to 95 people but but that would require bringing plant two back on line and you're just not willing to do that with the with the compliance cost is that correct well it's part of it I mean a lot of its economy driven also I mean the the building sector has been through a horrible nine to ten years it it's been no fun but you know certainly one of the considerations in the soft market is things that you would have to do possibly to to bring that in line and and you know one of the frustrating things I think for us as a company is we currently and have been since 2005 we've been capturing 95% of our hats so 95% of our pollutants we capture this new rule is dealing with three to four percent and so to spend that kind of money on three to four percent more capture rate and not know if the final rule is going to stay like it is it's kind of scary and so let's make sure we understand there was a rule that went into place in 2003 is that correct yes and and you got about the business of complying with that rule yeah and and many of your colleagues around the industry did so in the meantime there was a there was a lawsuit which took till 2007 to get resolved and turns out the court ruled that the EPA was wrong and that the rule could not go into effect am I correct so far that's correct and and so now in 2015 EPA comes now that you've got 95% of your emissions control EPA comes up with another regulation this is you've got to do better and there's a lawsuit about that yes and that's that moving target you're talking about exactly let's see well you know I just hope that that there's there's some way we can do do the balancing act that mr. Whitehouse talked about we always have to we often always have to balance the cost versus the benefit and I'm sorry my colleague has has missed the acknowledgement on both sides of the diets that we need to do that you know electricity can kill you know it's no question about it but we take risks in our society that you know without electricity our economy would would grind to a halt and and so we we established a correct balance of this terrible force called electricity that can kill you and the benefit to society reducing the speed limit to 30 miles an hour nationwide would save lives no question about it but we've taken the position as a society that that would just be too harmful to the economy and so we're willing to take that risk and get our speed limit up to 70 miles an hour on interstates and and whatever the states decide to do on state regulated roads and that's a balancing act and and that's all we're asking EPA to do and I'm sure that's all the plaintiffs are doing in this lawsuit is give us something that will allow this 40% extra number of employees that you'd like to put back to work allow them to have a living and so I hope we can we can work on this legislation and and achieve that sort of sensible balance thank you men

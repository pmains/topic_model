madam Speaker I rise today to reflect on moral character which is essential to the promise of America in order for us to flourish I'm reminded that we stand on the shoulders of so many who have gone before us and impacted our lives in many ways members of our greatest generation who bravely fought tired tyranny and oppression during World War two they were driven by honour duty and country they were selfless not drawing attention to themselves or seeking to be a celebrity or a hero they are models for character that we must always celebrate and remember they never admit it but they are our heroes heroes who bravely and humbly we're doing their part to protect our freedom madam Speaker why is character so important why does it matter it's because our character who we are and the decisions that we make when we are tested it's foundational to the rule of law in this body we talk a lot about the Constitution our god-given rights bills and laws checks and balances the rules and the procedures that govern debate the branches that make up this government and so on all of these pieces of our government are significant but they are lifeless and have no mean meaning without the spirit of good faith if we representatives of the people don't lead with moral character America doesn't stand a chance against corruption and the breakdown of trust with the people we serve it's on us each one of us doing our part for what is righteous what is just and for what will keep America free President Reagan once said freedom isn't passed down in the bloodstream it has to be fought for in other words freedom involves choices and that's precisely why character matters every single day every single moment our character is tested in politics is tested by the temptations of power palace intrigue ambition and personalities I won't blame either side of the aisle madam Speaker but these are the smoldering fires that burn around us that threaten our institutions and our laws did you know that only three percent of Americans trust the government will do the right thing three percent forty six percent of Americans say that they have very little confidence in Congress there is a crisis of confidence and it's a call for Reformation of character so that people will trust can trust that their representatives will always act in good faith on their behalf again it starts with us being better examples not for the glory or the recognition because but because it is the right thing to do we must be countercultural to the divisive 'no stakin hold of modern politics today that means stopping the blame game honoring another's argument even when we disagree and acknowledging and even celebrating our differences without attacking the other side's character that's the way that will come together to find out how we can make tough decisions without kicking the can down the road I fear what may come if things do not change as Abraham Lincoln famously said a house divided against itself cannot stand the strength of our nation our Constitution our laws and our institutions have no greater guardians than us it's this government of the people by the people and for the people we must take this responsibility seriously or again we won't have a fighting chance to rebuild the trust of We the People and keep the promise of America alive I've said it before in the well of this house house this is the promise that will keep us free and empower the next generation to shine for their sake our character the spirit that leads us to do what is right and just must be our guard guide in our house so that it will stand forever thank madam Speaker and I yield back

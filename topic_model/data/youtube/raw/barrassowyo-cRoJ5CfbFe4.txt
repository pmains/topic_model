Wyoming Senator John barrasso is a ranked member of the Senate energy and natural resources committee Senator it's good to be with you so what the White House is proposing is four and a half billion dollars in additional lie Heap assistance and then an additional 9 billion dollars on top of that for people to make their homes more energy efficient uh critics are asking the question if Biden's energy policies had been different on day one when he took office would we be where we are now in terms of needing all this assistance to cope with high prices well this program is not going to help so many Americans who are living the nightmare John of whether they can afford to heat their home versus fill their grocery cart versus fill their gas tank that is the problem that this Administration has from the beginning because their policies continue to keep the overall cost of energy High they've killed the American energy production to a level that has driven up costs has brought on all of this inflation that people are suffering under so the question is what do they do and their goal is not to produce more energy is to actually subsidize people who can't afford the expensive energy remember they tried to do this when gas prices were even higher than they are now with their gas card so you're right this is just for a select group of low-income people but what they're proposing all of this government money will not help the great great majority of Americans because it doesn't do anything to bring down the cost of American Energy the way to do that is to unleash American Energy we have it here in the ground but all these climate crazy Democrats who vote with the president item after item after item their vote is to keep the energy in America the affordable available reliable energy and keep it in the ground yeah this program wouldn't do anything to increase the supply of home heating oil uh either and we know that diesel is at almost critically low levels the president is also as we mentioned at the top Senator taking aim again at his favorite Boogeyman the oil and gas industry whacking them for not reinvesting profits that they are reaping from the high price of oil and gas these days here's what the Wall Street Journal said about that the president who has done everything in his power to limit U.S oil investment is now Furious that he succeeded Mr Biden is miffed in particular the companies are returning cash to shareholders rather than increasing Supply but the progressive climate Lobby in his own administration's climate policies have been urging the opposite and the point is made by people in the industry why would we reinvest profits when this Administration has said Vera to kill us well this Administration and the president just the other day said he wants a new tax a windfall profit tax this Administration in this Reckless tax and spending bill that came out of Congress in August that all the Democrats voted for and every Republican voted against that raised taxes again on oil and gas production in the United States so of course prices are going to continue to go up but if you saw that speech last night that the president gave I mean to me this was a throwback or a remake of that movie Clueless he never mentioned energy costs never mentioned the Border never mentioned crime never mentioned inflation and what he did say is that this election coming up is about democracy John this election coming up is about a report card on each one of these Democrats who have voted for all these policies that have brought US inflation brought us High Energy prices when those guys came into Power two years ago so solution was essentially yeah there was it was not there and we were as a nation energy independent and were not not anymore so let me ask you this question if Republicans take control of the Senate next Tuesday you would become the chairman of the energy and natural resources committee what would you do as chairman of that committee to bring down the price of oil and gas and increase U.S supply yeah well you know the one-two punch to deal with is inflation in the energy crisis that we have right now is to get rid of this wild Washington spending and unleash American Energy and the way we do that is to produce more in the United States so as chairman of that committee we were going to hold this administration's feet to the fire when they slow walk the issue of permits making sure we have the pipelines the drilling permits all of those sorts of things they'll be vigorous oversight over the abuses of this administration of the energy production in this country we will make sure that they're not going to have any of their wild-eyed individuals who love American Energy poverty confirmed to any positions in this cabinet we will block each and every one of them but really the American people have a big say in this as well because the turnout in the election on Tuesday making sure we elect Republicans to take over the house and the Senate is going to send a very strong message to this Administration they're on the wrong track we need need to change direction for the benefit of the future of this country we'll find out in five days if you get your chance Senator John barrasso Wyoming good to talk to you thank you I'll be I'll be in Nevada tomorrow campaigning uh with Adam laxalt in an effort to take back the Senate all right we'll be watching that thank you again

here's my concern that the word going down this debate of immigration reform I don't want to repeat the same mistake we made 1986 where we had that debate they passed that into law and then they did not enforce the border security permit so what my bill was chairman of Homeland Security dad makes sure that that piece that to gain operational control is done first and foremost hey in the good news new I have the serger Cornyn and introducing it you're paying a bill at the same time now these gangs of eights are out there and they're talking about what they want to do but my my judges we need to proceed with caution and we shouldn't do this out of political expediency and which is right and not make the same mistake we made 1986 because if we don't you all right we're going to be having the same conversation 15 years

okay congressman Himes do you believe the special counselor muller in the way that he wrote this report essentially handed the matter of obstruction off to congress and if so what do you think Congress should do about it yeah I absolutely do you know having now read it I'm sort of stunned by the clarity with which Bob Muller said hey and by the way this is directly contradicted by what we heard from the attorney general who you know who said that Muller had not been concerned with the fact that the Department of Justice has this policy against issuing an indictment against the president there's no question that Muller was teeing this up was offering the facts using the phrase that you just said we would so state if we believed that he had not committed a crime he has handed this to the Congress I think out of an understanding that the Department of Justice was not going to be the source of accountability for the president earlier today you indicated that the Constitution would demand that impeachment process at least be initiated here do you want I mean is that what you want I mean if the president potentially committed a crime I assume you know you could argue Congress's constitutionally mandated duty is to hold him accountable but House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer just said I think toward a NEBOSH based on what we've seen to date going forward on impeachment is not worthwhile at this point very frankly there's an election in 18 months and the American people will make a judgement see right yeah Anderson I wish I could give you an answer with intense conviction this is a really difficult box to and for the Congress of the United States and certainly for the Speaker of the House you know on the one hand yes Bob Muller basically teed this up and and and and wink wink you know a crime may have been committed and we're not going to seek accountability in the Department of Justice and so yes the Constitution would say you should at least begin the process of studying whether the president committed and you know enough high crime and misdemeanor to warrant removal so you know the Constitution would would suggest that we mean that would that we start that investigative process that deliberative process here's the problem Anderson there is at least in my mind absolutely no question about how that ends and that ends with the Senate not convicting so again I don't think there is a crime that this president could commit that would cause the Republican Party to turn on him so I say with great certainty that we would get to a point after a lot of time energy and resources only to have the Senate turn around and acquit him as happened in the Clinton administration and then what do we have to show for it the president can claim to have been a martyr we will have been distracted from our other oversight tax and we will not have addressed the issues that we all ran on transportation education retirement security health care so again I wish I could tell you I knew exactly the right answer but the way impeachment proceedings would end at least at this point remember there's lots of other investigations out there there's no question that that that the Senate would vote to keep regardless of the fact pattern to keep the president in office it was reported say that the house intelligence community's authorized subpoenas for five former White House officials including White House Counsel Don Magan I wonder I mean why call them in if at least at this point impeachment is not on the table what is the point of further investigation because to the point of you know Democrats are in a tough corner you know if they go from Pietschmann they can't get it in the Senate you know they've ways they've wasted time and the president can say he's a martyr you could make argument about continuing investigations that are not going to have an end result in some sort of legal action or congressional action yeah I'm not sure I would agree with that for two reasons Anderson number one I was pretty small at the time but when President Nixon resigned because he was facing imminent impeachment and almost certainly conviction you know right up until that moment it looked like there was no chance he could be impeached and so new facts obviously historically have influenced the the congressional temperament now we live in different times where sadly the Republican Party has given itself wholly over to being a cult of personality for the president but the other thing is there is a whole school of thought and I think that steny hoyer is in as a member of the school of thought which is that there's still a political decision for the American people to make and the more facts they have the better they'll be in a position to make a decision in November of twenty

R PRIMARIES, AND THAT HAS WEAKENED THE FOUNDATION. >> Brennan: SCOTT, THANK YOU FOR COMING IN THIS SUNDAY. WE'RE GOING TO GO TO CALIFORNIA CONGRESSMAN ADAM SCHIFF. HE JOINS US FROM LOS ANGELES. MR. CHAIRMAN, GOOD MORNING TO YOU. >> GOOD MORNING. >> Brennan: YOU WEAR A LOT OF HATS, BUT I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE JANUARY 6 COMMITTEE THAT YOU SERVE ON. THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, AS YOU KNOW, ON FRIDAY DECIDED NOT TO PROSECUTE MARK MEADOWS, OR SOCIAL MEDIA DIRECTOR DAN SCAFINO. IS IT YOUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THESE MEN ARE IMMUNE FROM ALL PROSECUTION? >> NO, THEY'RE NOT. AND IT IS VERY PUZZLING, WHY THESE TWO WITNESSES WOULD BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY THAN THE TWO THAT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS PROSECUTING. THERE IS NO ABSOLUTE IMMUNITY. THESE WITNESSES HAVE VERY RELEVANT TESTIMONY TO OFFER IN TERMS OF WHAT WENT INTO THE VIOLENCE OF JANUARY 6, THE PROPAGATION OF THE BIG LIE, AND THE IDEA THAT WITNESSES COULD SIMPLY FAIL TO SHOW UP. AND WHEN THE STATUTE REQUIRES THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TO PRESENT THOSE CASES TO THE GRAND JURY AND THEY DON'T, IS DEEPLY TROUBLING. WE HOPE TO GET MORE INSIGHT FROM THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, BUT, I THINK, A GRAVE DISAPPOINTMENT AND COULD IMPEDE OUR WORK IF OTHER WITNESSES THINK THEY CAN LIKEWISE REFUSE TO SHOW UP WITH IMPUNITY. >> Brennan: IS IT BECAUSE THESE TWO MEN HAD SUCH CLOSE PROXIMITY TO PRESIDENT TRUMP, THE EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE ARGUMENT ACTUALLY APPLYING HERE? >> THAT SHOULDN'T BE THE EXPLANATION HERE BECAUSE, OF COURSE, THERE ARE A GREAT MANY THINGS THESE WITNESSES CAN TESTIFY TO WITH NO EVEN PLAUSIBLE CLAIM OF EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE. THEY WERE BOTH INVOLVED IN CAMPAIGN MATTERS. THEY BOTH HAVE DOCUMENTS THEY COULD OFFER. NONE OF WHICH IS PROTECTED BY PRIVILEGE. THE IDEA YOU COULD REFUSE TO SHOW UP, RATHER THAN SAY TO THIS QUESTION I'M GOING TO ASSERT A PRIVILEGE, THAT JUST INVITES OTHERS TO BE IN CONTEMPT OF CONGRESS OR OF JUDGES IN OTHER COURTROOMS. I THINK IT IS A VERY DANGEROUS PRECEDENT TO SET. >> Brennan: "NEW YORK TIMES" WAS FIRST TO REPORT THAT MIKE PENCE'S CHIEF-OF-STAFF, MIKE SHORT, ACTUALLY WARNED THE SECRET SERVICE THE DAY BEFORE JANUARY 6 THAT HE THOUGHT THE PRESIDENT WOULD TURN ON THE VICE PRESIDENT AND IT WOULD POSE A DIRECT SECURITY RISK. WE KNOW MR. SHORT PLANS TO TESTIFY HIMSELF BEFORE YOUR COMMITTEE. IS THAT SUFFICIENT? DO YOU NEED TO HEAR FROM THE VICE PRESIDENT? >> MARGARET, WE'RE NOT COMMENTING ON SPECIFIC WITNESSES, SO I CAN'T CONFIRM OR DENY WHO WILL APPEAR BEFORE US. I CAN SAY THAT CERTAINLY ONE OF THE THEMES THAT WE WILL BE FLESHING OUT IS THE FACT THAT IN ADVANCE OF THE 6th, THERE WAS AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROPENSITY FOR VIOLENCE THAT DAY OF PARTICIPATION OF WHITE NATIONALIST GROUPS, OF THE EFFECT THAT THE CONTINUED PROPAGATION OF HIS BIG LIE TO RILE UP THE COUNTRY AND RILE UP THE PRESIDENT'S PACE WAS LIKELY TO LEAD TO VIOLENCE. YOU WILL SEEN THAT THEME AMONG THE HEARINGS, BUT AS TO A PARTICULAR WITNESS, I REALLY CAN'T COMMENT. >> Brennan: IF YOU DON'T DELIVER A BOMBSHELL ON THURSDAY, DON'T YOU RUN THE RISK OF LOSING THE PUBLIC'S ATTENTION HERE? >> OUR GOAL IS TO PRESENT THE NARRATIVE OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THIS COUNTRY, HOW CLOSE WE CAME TO LOSING OUR DEMOCRACY. WHAT LED TO THAT VIOLENT ATTACK ON THE 6th. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, I THINK, KNOW A GREAT DEAL ALREADY. THEY'VE SEEN A NUMBER OF BOMBSHELLS ALREADY. THERE IS A GREAT DEAL THEY HAVEN'T SEEN. PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANT IS THE PUBLIC HASN'T SEEN IT WOVEN TOGETHER, HOW ONE THING LED TO ANOTHER, HOW ONE LINE OF EFFORT TO OVERTURN THE ELECTION LED TO ANOTHER, AND ULTIMATELY LED TO VIOLENCE. THE FIRST NON-PEACEFUL TRANSFER OF POWER IN OUR HISTORY. WE'RE AIMING AT PEOPLE AND AN AUDIENCE THAT STILL HAS AN OPEN MIND ABOUT THESE FACTS. WE WANT TO COUNTER THE CONTINUING PROPAGATION OF BUYING LIES. THAT'S WHAT OUR GOAL IS. >> Brennan: I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT INFLATION, WHICH IS A PROBLEM THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. THE SAN FRANCISCO FED SAID THAT THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN CONTRIBUTED ABOUT 3 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO INFLATION. IT IS NOT THE PRIMARY DRIVER, BUT A CONTRIBUTOR TO IT. IN HINDSIGHT, DO YOU THINK DEMOCRATS SHOULD HAVE STRUCTURED THAT $2 TRILLION PACKAGE DIFFERENTLY? SHOULD IT HAVE BEEN SMALLER? >> NO, I DON'T THINK SO. AND THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER STUDIES THAT REACHED THE OPPOSITE CONCLUSION, THAT HE HAD A MORE MINIMAL IMPACT ON INFLATION. >> Brennan: BUT THE CORE GROUP -- >> I UNDERSTAND THAT, BUT THERE ARE SETTINGS THAT SHOW IT HAD A N NEGLIGIBLE IMPACT ON INFLATION. THIS IS BORNE OUT BY ALL OF THE EVIDENCE: THERE IS A GLOBAL INFLATIONARY PRESSURE, A GLOBAL PROBLEM WITH SUPPLY CHAINS. OUR ECONOMY GREW SO FAST IN THE UNITED STATES THAT THAT PROBLEM IS PARTICULARLY ACUTE. BECAUSE THE THE DEMAND, WHEN WE GREW SO QUICKLY, WAS SO PRONOUNCED AS TO LEAD TO THIS INFLATION. BUT PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING FROM IT. WE HAVE TO ATTACK IT IN ANY WAY WE CAN. I THINK REPUBLICANS, SADLY, ARE GETTING IN OUR WAY BECAUSE THEY WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE ISSUE OF INFLATION RATHER THAN DO SOMETHING TO HELP THE COUNTRY. THIS IS WHAT WE'RE CONFRONTING IN CONGRESS AND WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS BATTLING. >> Brennan: THE ADMINISTRATION IS MAKING SOME FOREIGN POLICIES -- WE KNOW THE PRESIDENT WILL TRAVEL THIS SUMMER, AND HE'LL MEET WITH AMAD, THE CROWN PRINCE. THIS IS WHAT YOU SAID IN FEBRUARY OF 2021. >> I THINK HE SHOULD BE SHUNNED. I THINK HE SHOULD BE -- I DON'T THINK THE PRESIDENT SHOULD TALK WITH HIM. I DON'T THINK THE PRESIDENT SHOULD SEE HIM. >> Brennan: SHOULD THE PRESIDENT STILL GO TO SAUDI ARABIA AND MEET WITH THE CROWN PRINCE? >> IN MY VIEW, NO. I WOULDN'T GO AND SHAKE HIS HAND. THIS IS SOMEONE WHO BUTCHERED AN AMERICAN RESIDENT, CUT HIM UP INTO PIECES IN THE MOST TERRIBLE AND PRE-MEDITATED WAY. UNTIL SAUDI ARABIA MAKES A RADICAL CHANGE IN TERMS OF ITS HUMAN RIGHTS, I WOULDN'T WANT ANYTHING TO DO WITH HIM. I UNDERSTAND THE DEGREE TO WHICH SAUDI ARABIA CONTROLS OIL PRICES. I THINK THAT IS A COMPELLING ARGUMENT FOR US TO WEAN OURSELVES OFF OF RELIANCE ON FOREIGN OIL AND OIL MORE GLOBALLY, SO WE DON'T HAVE DISPITS AND MURDERERS CALLING THE SHOTS. NO, I WOULDN'T GO. IF I HAD TO GO TO THE COUNTRY FOR SOME OTHER REASON, I WOULDN'T MEET WITH THE CROWN PRINCE. I THINK HE SHOULD BE SHUNNED. >> Brennan: SO THERE IS NO WAY TO JUSTIFY A TRIP LIKE THIS, IF IT IS AN ATTEMPT TO GET SAUDI ARABIA TO PUT MORE OIL ON THE MARKET AND LOWER GAS PRICES? >> WELL, IN MY VIEW, WE SHOULD MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO LOWER OIL PRICES, BUT GOING HAT IN HAND TO SOMEONE WHO HAS MURDERED AN AMERICAN RESIDENT WOULD NOT BE ON MY LIST. I WOULD WANT TO SEESAWED SAUDI ARABIA INCREASE THEIR PRODUCTION. I W WANT TO SEE THEM MAKE CHANGES IN THEIR HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD. AND I WOULD WANT THEM TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE MURDER OF AMERICANS, BEFORE I WOULD EX

government democratic new jersey congressman bill paschall was in the chamber for the pope's historic speech in fact he was one of the members assigned to an aisle seat my understanding is congressman that you were there to prevent the handshaking and the gesturing and the selfies uh that that that that we might have seen had you not been there blocking is that right well craig i'm now in the witness protection program so so so you're absolutely absolutely correct and there was protocol and uh both sides of the aisle recognized that protocol and implemented and if i may craig if uh i want to just add because you were asking a very pointed question to the previous person you had on that starring thomas merton thomas merton had a fantastic history in fact it's summarized in the seven story mountain where he came from a situation not very different really than darth vader another great american another great catholic thomas merton went through the seven story mound showing how he came to grips with his own future instead of trying to change the world necessarily change yourself first start with your start with yourself what what great great people will the pope refer to as well as abraham lincoln and martin luther king a spectacular speech and i really really appreciated it i want to talk politics for just for just a second here because i had congressman sean duffy on a short time ago we talked about the possibility of another government shutdown i want to get your take on on where the stop gap bill is right now and this idea according to congressman duffy that perhaps perhaps it is worth shutting down the government over uh defunding planned parenthood well it's never worth shutting down the government for any reason whether it's democrat or republican i think sean is absolutely wrong on that i had a nice conversation with uh paul ryan before the pope arrived today i i really believe that paul wants to be part of the leadership that tries to defuse and deflate all possibilities of a shutdown next week and if you're going to do this on one subject with the senate i don't believe you have enough votes to pass this and i think it'd be a message to the house of representatives let's have a clean bill and let's move on to try to bring any kind of compromise we need to in some way affect planned parenthood uh make it fly higher but at the same time we can't shut it down it provides a lot of services for a lot of human beings who deserve them congressman bill pascaro we will leave it there and congratulations again congressman it appears like all of your colleagues were on their best behavior today uh for the play it's something different for us i guess right it is very unusual it is very unusual thank you very much chris as the pope gets ready to depart washington d.c another prominent leader is

recognizers the gentleman from New York Thank You mr. chairman I rise in support of my bipartisan amendment to address the deeply flawed North Shore helicopter out which is impacting communities throughout Long Island especially my constituents on the North Fork the FAS North Shore helicopter route which was made mandatory through an FAA bureaucratic edit in 2010 represents everything that's wrong with our unaccountable federal bureaucracy it lacks fairness transparency and common sense it's not a bright idea to mandate aircraft traffic bound for the tip of an island to make its transition overland when multiple all water routes which mitigate the noise impact are available in addition to being ill-conceived a misguided what makes this FAA mandate so extremely unfair is that it shifts the majority of air traffic in the area over Long Island's North Fork which does not have a busy airport or helicopter pad and this doesn't get any of the economic benefit that the air traffic brings neighboring communities on the South Fork that have an activist seasonal airport to close these loopholes and address this unfairness I offer this critical amendment that will force the FAA to reassess the north shore route and work on replacing it with a true all water route over the Atlantic Ocean this amendment also requires the FAA to hold public hearings on the North Shore out in the communities impacted by this flawed route and open up a public comment period so the people who live with aircraft noise season after season can have a voice the FAA has four years ignore my constituents and the law since long before I was even in Congress by continuing to extend the north shore route through emergency Authority the FAA has been waiving the requirements in the Administrative Procedure Act and other federal laws and regulations that require public comment and the consultation of the impacted local governments before any major regulatory decisions are made I represent a district that's almost completely surrounded by water so it is common sense that aircraft departing New York City bound for airports on the east end of Long Island can reduce noise by following true all water routes my memory nozzle requires the FAA to enforce its own rules regarding altitude restrictions for the aircraft following this flawed route this is not just an issue in my district but also impacts residents who are impacted by noise in Nassau County and Queens that's why I partnered with my Democratic colleagues representatives grace mang and Tom Suozzi on this amendment with that I reserve the balance of my time first is the gentleman from Washington rise I rise in opposition to the amendment Kjell is recognized for five minutes Thank You mr. chairman I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York cement directs the FAA Administrator to offer public comment period in public hearing with respect to the New York North Shore helicopter route would then be required to review the applicable regulations related to the route and assess the noise impacts on communities and the availability of alternative or supplemental routes to reduce those impacts so I posed it on the grounds it's really not good policy to legislate on noise in a piecemeal fashion addressing each region and each Airport one by one that's not the best way to address air traffic noise the committee has been aware of this issue for some time and certainly of the occasionally unreasonable exposure to helicopter noise reported by residents in urban areas the aviation subcommittee held a roundtable on this in October 2011 to explore this issue and perhaps it is time to reap that roundtable to get some movement on this issue but further I have concern about possible unintended consequences of legislative proposals that could lead to the redistribution of air traffic aircraft noise although well-intentioned such proposals have social justice ramifications and Afghan can end up distributing noise over socially socially economically socially associate economically disadvantaged communities we have to make sure that noise is distributed equitably if we're going to make these decisions so I'd be happy to work I think on our side we'd be happy to work with the gentleman and the co-sponsors to try to address these concerns by talking directly with the FAA but I have to oppose taking the solution towards a legislative a legislative resolution so with that I'd ask colleagues to oppose it and I yield back the balance of my time gentleman yields back his time gentleman from New York first off with respect to my colleague on the other side of the aisle it is very important for my constituents to have a voice and what's important to note here is that this route was extended by the FAA putting the Federal Register in the middle of a weekend no one told myself no one told any of the local governments there was no public a hearing there were no public comments accepted actually the FAA in this case went out of their way to ensure that my constituents had zero voice whatsoever that's under the current federal law I'd like to it yield as much time as he may consume to the chairman of the transportation infrastructure committee Jemma's recognized I thank the Chairman I thank the gentleman and rise in support of his amendment again this amendment does address the concerns of the people in the long island as the gentleman pointed out this was put in place without public comment without talking to the folks that that live and have to live under these overflights so I applaud him for his efforts and commitment to his constituents on this issue again his worked tirelessly for the last two congresses on this issue and been a tremendously effective advocate so I thank the gentleman for his continued leadership in and and I thank him for his amendment and encourage members to support a mr. Zell Dan's amendment and yield back gentleman from New York I thank the chairman for his support of this amendment for doing everything in his power to ensure that my constituents have a voice that they're heard that they're represented that they are able to provide their public comments that there are that they're allowed to have a hearing with the FAA really is very much appreciated by the residents of my district and to my colleagues congresswoman grace mang congressman Swasey for everyone on the other side of the aisle who showing leadership in supporting this effort is much appreciate understanding that this was literally jammed through in the Federal Register without all sorts of not just courtesies provided but worse actually muzzling the voice of people that they couldn't even share any any of their comments whatsoever summer after summer the quality of life of East End residents has suffered due to the persistent issue of this noise the FAA Department of Transportation have sole jurisdiction over the aircraft routes that have impacted these communities but from the routes planning to its continued use they have flat out ignored the residents directly affected I'm urging all my colleagues to vote YES on this amendment and I yield back

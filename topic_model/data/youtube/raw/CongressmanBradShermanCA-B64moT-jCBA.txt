mr. secretary half a million people live within just 10 miles of the Santa Susana field nuclear laboratory your department sign the correct the consent order for corrective action in 2007 and the administrative orders on consent in 2010 with the california department of toxic substance control the latter required full cleanup of the site by 2017 so in 2010 your department agreed to full cleanup by 2017 but today no meaningful cleanup has occurred at all so you're supposed to be completed by 2017 you haven't started by 2019 will you come to the San Fernando Valley and explain to people when this site will be fully cleaned up the Sherman I would be more than happy to accompany you and and try to explain well I'll do my best to explain that what happened seven years before I got here and why there wasn't any progress made on that but I don't know if I I don't know if I'll be successful and and I look forward to joining you in the San Fernando Valley and I thank your come making that comment for the record countries that are our friends live by the non-proliferation treaty if they signed it Iran and North Korea have gone toward a nuclear program without the Additional Protocol with the IAEA and we have Saudi Arabia which claims to be our friend but at least when it comes to nuclear matter seems to be acting like a rogue state the South Korean firm Korea Electric Power Corporation is talking to the nor to Saudi Arabia about a large nuclear power a construction project that project nor the South Korean nuclear probably is based on American technology can you state for the record the administration's position on whether this South Korean firm would need to see a one two three agreement between the United States and Saudi Arabia to sell large nuclear reactors to Saudi Arabia assuring what I think we would would be helpful here is that people understand the part 810 and I'm going to get to a part a 10 question but the first question is is South Korea free to build large nuclear plants in Saudi Arabia using American technology here would be my answer is there would be no because they would require part a 10 before they could before they can go into a because that is us technology well I think they'd also need a 1 2 3 agreement but I agree with you it is us technology can you commit to the that the administration won't enter into a nuclear cooperation agreement with Saudi Arabia unless Saudi Arabia signs the Additional Protocol this has been our bargaining position on these since then I desperately that's that's that has been our position in all of our conversations that we have had with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia good answer the Atomic Energy Act section 303 requires that you keep Congress fully and currently informed on subject matters relating to atomic energy you have issued at least 7 Part A 10 authorization to allow US companies to discuss and submit documents to Saudi Arabia seeking their business it took my office about six months to get a cop of these party tens can you promise to provide the 810 authorizations in the future if they relate to Saudi Arabia to both this committee and the Foreign Affairs Committee promptly yes sir and and let me just the caveat on that miss Sharon would be unless the company deems them to be of proprietary information at that particular point in time and I don't know all the specific details but every bit of information that is publicly not disclosable you can bet well I would hope that you keep in mind members of Congress are trusted yes sir with the most secret information of our intelligence and defense agencies and if I'm not gonna reveal what I know from the CIA I think Westinghouse can trust me with that I thank you for your answers good answers thank you thank you the chair recognizes mr.

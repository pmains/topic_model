Mr Speaker I rise today to remember Frank Mitchell a native of Springfield Illinois and the first African American House of Representatives page since reconstruction as a student at fashions High School Frank was asked to interview for a position as a page for then congressman Paul Findley when the school principal my good friend Irv Smith called to say they'd selected Frank according to articles just recently Frank said he went out and he bought some suits got a haircut and headed for Washington after his year-long stint as a house page Frank graduated from fashion's in 1967 and went on to work as a newspaper and TV reporter before accepting positions with the Illinois Attorney General's Office and eventually Cook County's Stroger Hospital he is well known across the state for his work with the Illinois fatherhood initiative Paul Findley son congressman Finley son Craig who now chairs the Illinois Prisoner Review Board he said that Frank's appointment to the house as a page was one of his father's proudest accomplishments he brought credit to the page system Craig said and I admired him for his service and his friendship for decades almost everyone that knew Frank felt that way they admired him for his service and his friendship Frank was a very well-loved part of the Springfield community for years and I had the opportunity to meet many of his family members and also those who helped Frank and who Frank helped through his career in public service when I went to his services in Springfield just a few weeks ago for so many Frank was a role model he was a mentor and he's part of history in this institution that so many of us have had the opportunity to serve in this great nation in the House of Representatives the House of Representatives a better place because of Frank Mitchell and Washington DC is a better place because of Frank Mitchell and everybody that knew Frank Mitchell know that their life has been blessed Frank thank you for your service you will be missed

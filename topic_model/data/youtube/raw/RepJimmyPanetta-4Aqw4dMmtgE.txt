Mr Speaker I rise to the position of the plan to repeal the ACA a recent analysis of this plan concludes that 10 million people would lose their health insurance that is mainly due to the fact that the plan would stop Medicaid expansion and shorten the Medicare trust fund now many people in my district would be affected by this plan 68,000 of my constituents are covered by the Medicaid expansion 23,000 constituents receive assistance to afford health insurance through the exchange if the ACA is repealed and the new plan implemented thousands of my constituents my neighbors and my friends would lose their coverage but don't just take my word for it or my constituents word for it let let's ask the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to look at the plan carefully and to give a report as to who and how many people it will affect if you are going to take on something that affects so many Americans then America deserves to know how our health care and our lives will be impacted by your by your plan

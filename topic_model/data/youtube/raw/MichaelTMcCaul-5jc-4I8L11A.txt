let me just in closing say first of all thank you for being here you provide great insight now we do have four bills going forward this week with respect to the bill that passed out of this committee i do believe it has the core components of the secretary and director of nsa asked for and that is codification of existing legal authorities in an information sharing system through the national cyber security and communications integration center we also have the ice x out there as well i know the intel bill also makes dhs a hub for cyber threat information sharing within the government and i think anytime we deal with the private sector we always have to be careful that balance of incentivizing versus unduly burdensome mandates and it's always a balance between security and that i would always prefer to incentivize it when possible but this is a very very important serious issue and it's my sincere hope as i mentioned to the ranking member of the full committee you being ranking on the cyber security committee that we can work together on this important legislation the issue is too important for the american people and i think everybody standing up here or sitting here at the diocese understands that so with that uh let me thank the witnesses again and without objection this hearing is adjourned

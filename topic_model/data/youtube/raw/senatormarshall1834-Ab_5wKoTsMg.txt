there are quite a few attacks on vaccine mandates and here's another one a group of republican senators trying to block funding for the vaccine mandates senator roger marshall is leading that charge and he joins us now mr senator do you oppose all vaccine mandates coming from the federal government both for federal workers and for private enterprise absolutely stuart look i support the vaccine but not vaccine mandates from the federal government uh whether we're treated they're going to be treating heroes uh like their felons now in the military right and those nurses those doctors that were out there working my phone is just blowing up right now by people i went to medical school with doctors that are concerned about the vaccine mandate you know i can't walk from the the chiefs game to the hot dog stand without getting asked about this i can't go to church i can't go to walmart even without getting just inundated people are so concerned about this vaccine mandate and i'm fighting hard to stop all of joe biden's unconstitutional federal vaccine mandates so you're trying to deny funding for the mandate that's how you're trying to stop it right right stuart uh we're going to use every tool in the toolbox and one of them is to stop funding for the federal government but that's going to be up to uh to senator schumer we're asking him to include in the next funding bill uh language that would prevent osha from using any funding dollars to enforce this unconstitutional executive order from the president so we'll use every tool at our disposal there's also a congressional review out review act that senator braun's leading and senator blackburn is leading a charge also to protect those heroes i was mentioning earlier the governor of your state came out against biden's vaccine mandate um it seemed that she's a democrat uh seems like you're making are you making progress across the aisle no i think we finally are stewards i would encourage all democrat governors to speak to the white house because they're certainly not listening to the people across the country right and what i would do is just encourage our governor to stand up and fight with our attorney general derek schmidt who's fighting hard for kansas and is suing the federal government over this issue as well we need those democrat governors to call the white house we need them to join the lawsuits and stop this but look this is going to drive up inflation it's going to exacerbate our our labor shortages and and even clog our supply chains worse there's so many downsides to this federal vaccine mandate is there anything else that joe biden could make a bad decision on and now all these decisions are piling up one on top of the other and you know stuart i ran a business once upon a time you make three bad decisions and it becomes 27 problems and that's where we're at now

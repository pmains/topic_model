Sam bakeman freed founder of the crypto exchange FTX is in jail in the Bahamas right now after a judge denied his request for bail the former CEO is expected to remain there until his extradition Hearing in February his lawyers are saying they will fight his extradition to the United States as SPF his uh legal problems continue to mount the political Fallout also continues to Rattle lawmakers here in Washington yesterday prosecutors from the southern district of New York laid out the charges against Sam Beckman freed including how he used customer assets for political purposes and all of this dirty money was used in service of bankman Freed's desire to buy bipartisan influence and impact the direction of public policy in Washington joined now and set by Congressman Brad Sherman he's a member of the House Financial Services committee which held that hearing about FTX yesterday Congressman um thanks for coming in good to be with you so this seems the the true cynical way to look at this is that here is somebody who may may or may not have been running a Ponzi scheme we'll wait and find out if it if if it is and the best way to keep the government away was to essentially buy influence left and right don't buy one party buy both parties and this guy wrote substantial checks did a potential Ponzi scheme for a technology that not everybody's convinced is necessary um really you know did they did they use our campaign Finance system to make it real I've been trying to ban crypto for five years now and uh there's no Lobby or pack in town that's working for effective tax law enforcement or the anti-money laundering statutes but it's not just bankmen but others but particularly him was spreading money around on both sides I I I I I I think it's not just the money but the promise that the the whole industry is going to be there with uh with uh with bigger money he spent a lot of money in primaries and lost a lot of money uh in primaries I don't think he spent at all this is turning out not to be his money that he may have spent right and that he may have spent investor money in this which is another level of fraud but what does this mean for the political entities that took this well I think uh some have given it to charity but uh charity the right answer the right answer is back to the investors because it was never bankman's money how do you do that uh I've told the colleague or two to put the money aside and wait until the bankruptcy trustee has a fund that people can return money to and add it to another other other assets the bankruptcy trustees you know he gave some I think 30 million dollars in total no he mostly he he gave a little he did independent expenditures and they were Terror he lost seven million dollars on the backing the wrong candidate in Oregon yeah yeah no but he also gave a six million dollar check to House Majority back I believe yep that's not an insignificant check that isn't then it'll be interesting to see uh what that fact does and whether the bankruptcy uh Court can recover so you want to ban crypto is there no positive thing that comes from Bitcoin do you see any positive thing that comes no is a way to evade Financial well right now it's not a currency at all right it's a pet an electronic pet rock and you bet that you can sell it to someone so my concern is it may become a currency if a concert occurrency it helps you defeat Financial laws now I want to defeat the financial laws of Iran and Russia but to a much greater extent I want to enforce the financial laws of the United States and I'm up against a a Republican party or chunks of it uh every time a uh a billionaire successfully cheats on their taxes a member of the freedom caucus earns his wings that's a that's a I I get the line you're trying to say there but with crypto they've bought off both parties they're significant members of Congress left and right that are pro-crypto here are those of us who are strong crypto Skeptics we've just got to play defense and let the SEC get involved that takes them a long time and I've criticized them for not enforcing particularly on crypto exchanges but I don't think for the reason you point out I don't think we can win playing offense I don't think we can pass good legislation if you regulate crypto then you will legalize crypto forever so and that's I know you want to I mean it does feel like is regulating crypto actually a trap if you impose the anti-money laundering statutes then you take away the one-way crypto can aspire to become a currency how it's going to compete against the dollar what's its advantage crypto means hidden currency so if you don't let them hide if you impose on the entire U.S portion of the ecosystem the anti-money laundering statutes there's no reason for crypto when it goes away it's not as good as Banning it but it's as close as we're going to get it is that do you think that's the most more feasible way to go that that's where you'll get some support from folks that wanna I mean would you accept the idea that crypto is a commodity uh Sam Beckman freed spent all this money for one purpose and that was to keep the SEC out of the crypto world and he was willing to call it a commodity and his bill and I've told my colleagues don't trash sambachman freed and then go pass his bill so uh calling it a commodity again you don't think it's a commodity uh I think it is a security and if it's also a commodity and a second weaker agency wants to regulate it too I'm all for that but the purpose of calling it a commodity from Sam Bateman freed standpoint was to say it's not a security and keep the SEC the bigger and and tougher regulator out of his area in some ways is the fact that everybody there's gonna be a lot of dirtied dirtied up politicians who took all this crypto money you think that actually gives you more of a chance to get something passed because people want to cleanse themselves you don't have many you know he spent money in primaries people lost so they're not nobody sent it to the major people every major party it's not an individual there are a few individuals who are giving back five thousand dollars or five thousand dollars there but as you point out the the big money was independent expenditures and to Independent expenditure committees and you don't face the same heat when your name's not on it yeah maybe that ought to change hey Brad Sherman thanks for coming in Democrat from Southern California

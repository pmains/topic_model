Mr Speaker I rise today to call attention to the administration's proposal its recent attack on some of the most vulnerable Americans the 38 million people that rely in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program otherwise known as snap the USDA the United States Department of Agriculture announced yesterday a rule change to the eligibility for the program this change would kick millions of Americans seniors children and their families off a program that provides critical assistance as a safety net this change would weaken our ability to provide support for working people that are struggling to get by month to month it would have a huge impact in my district unfortunately 25 percent of my constituents depend upon the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program monthly to provide nutrition for themselves and their families as a member of the conference committee that negotiated the 2018 farm bill these suggestions were part of the discussion we opposed them we fought successfully to include an expanded snap eligibility requirements and Congress agreed that's why I fought to expand the employment and training programs that we do in the Supplemental assistance program in Fresno the bridge Academy to equip recipients with the necessary tools to get back on their feet to make them self-subsistent that's what we should be doing and guess what the president supported it when he signed the farm bill into law last December he needs to remain consistent I will fight for families for seniors and for children the bottom line is this Snap is a helpful program to support people in their time of need with achieving self-sufficiency it is a part of America's safety net we must block this egregious attempt to administrative Lee do what Congress did not do last December I urge my colleagues to stand with me and oppose this attack on some of our nation's most vulnerable population

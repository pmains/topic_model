hi I'm Congressman Jimmy Gomez I'm proud to represent California's 34th congressional district in the heart of Los Angeles as we approach 2020 it's important to take a look back at this past year with a Democratic majority we stood up for a constitution and held president Trump accountable for abusing the power of his office and obstructing Congress to cover it up we also passed nearly 300 bipartisan bills including the Elijah Cummings lower drug costs now act our transformational legislation to negotiate lower drug prices so millions of Americans can afford the life-saving medicine they need the Equality Act legislation to extend civil right protections to our LGBTQ family friends and neighbors that Paycheck Fairness Act legislation reaffirming the basic idea equal pay for equal work the climate action now act an urgently needed bill which aims to keep the United States in the Paris climate agreement and the United States Mexico Canada agreement or USM say for short a historic trade agreement with Canada and Mexico this last legislative victory was not easy and it was far from guaranteed in late spring Speaker Nancy Pelosi appointed nine Democratic members including myself to negotiate with the US Trade Representative make significant changes to the administration's version of US MCA a version many people referred to as NAFTA Lite as a former labor organizer I knew we had the opportunity to finally begin to right the wrongs of NAFTA after six months of negotiations meetings phone calls proposals and counterproposals the USMC a working group under the leadership of Speaker Pelosi brokered a new agreement that not only recognized the value of America's workers but also secured measurable and profound progress in the areas of enforcement prescription drugs and environmental protection this unprecedented trade agreement was made possible through the fortitude and resolve of the trade working group and the house Democratic caucus we refused to compromise our values and ultimately we turned President Donald Trump's original trade deal considered weak in almost every measure until a real agreement with teeth that's why the afl-cio a federation of labor unions representing over 12.5 million workers for the first time in almost 20 years endorsed a trade agreement that's why the USMC passed the House of Representatives in support 385 to 41 this new and improved US MCA is a victory for the American people and as an advocate for working families I'm encouraged that this new deal sets the floor and not the ceiling for future trade agreements the new consensus on trade was only made possible because of the new Democratic House Majority as we enter 2020 House Democrats will continue to deliver results for the people and with that I would like to thank you and wish you and your family and your loved ones a happy and healthy new year

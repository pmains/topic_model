hello good evening how is everybody I am so excited this is our first Facebook live from our offices here in Ann Arbor Michigan how's everybody so I guess I have a first question Joyce and Joyce says how do you feel about universal health care well as you know Joyce I am for single-payer health care you know countries that are less affluent than us are able to take care of their citizens health care we need to find a way to cover more people this has to happen at the federal level and if cannot be done at federal we'll do it at the state level all right Kyle wants to know about minimum wage Kyle I want to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour I tell you why I was at in Bay City the other day and I met Tammy now Tammy is a single mom and she has two little girls and Tammy was working for a large manufacturing facility and that manufacturing facility went all automation and Tammy lost her job today she's working in Taco Bell making eight dollars and 30 cents an hour taking care of her two little girls single mom that's no way to live I want people to be able to live in dignity our raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and tied to inflation so our families our working families don't fall behind alright there's a question about unions from todd todd wants to know what are my parts about unions Todd works for GM and he represented by the UAW Todd unions built Michigan and I respect our working families and I support the unions I will work hard to repeal right-to-work and I will work hard to protect preventing wages and I'll raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour Marc wants to know about auto insurance now Michigan is one of the highest paying state in terms of auto insurance rates now Detroit pays higher rates for auto insurance then other places you know why because the insurance companies use non driving factors such as a credit score or the zip code that you live in or your education background and I want to make it such that the insurance companies will not be able to use non driving factors in setting rates for auto insurance Kevin wants to know about legalizing recreational marijuana now Kevin you know there is a valid proposal currently that will appear in the November ballot for legalizing recreational marijuana I was one of the first gubernatorial candidate to support those that position I think we should treat marijuana like alcohol and regulate it like alcohol as a scientist I understand the medicinal effects the good medicinal effects of marijuana and we need to take advantage of that so we will support fully the legalization of recreational marijuana and once that valid proposal passes any nonviolent offender in our prison system that would not be in the prison with the new ballot proposal I would use my power as the governor to pardon the nonviolent offenders offenders that are there in the prison system for small position charges and I would expunge their record so that they will not be discriminated for housing that they will not be discriminated for employment or any other reason we need to help our returning citizens by providing them skillsets so they can get good-paying jobs and be a part of our society once again Alison wants to know about education well Alison I want to be known as the education governor a governor that will promote our education more than any other governor in the history of our state of Michigan to begin with you know I have a grandson my grandson is 15 months old his name is Kai and I see how he learns and how perceptive he is at that young age children between the age of 1 to 4 have a tremendous capacity to learn and I want to start building and providing for our children by instituting a universal pre-k which will empower our children to learn knowledge at a very early stage and prepare them for great schools we need to invest more money in education we spend nine thousand dollars per student and we spend forty one thousand dollars per prisoner and that math just doesn't work for me the other day I was in office max and I make two teachers Rachel and Julie now these two teachers were buying supplies for their classroom and they're buying those supplies out of their own pocket and Judy told me that her salary has an increase for the last seven years and they had tears in their eyes when they explained to me how humiliated they are the way they get evaluated in the classroom we need to provide sufficient money so that our teachers can teach and focus on teaching that means we need to make our schools safe and that starts with ensuring there are no guns in our schools and that includes no guns for our teachers we need to use technology and we need to use security and keycard access to make our schools safer

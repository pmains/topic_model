thank you Mr chairman and good afternoon my name is Eric Sorensen I was born and raised in Rockford Illinois and attended Northern Illinois University where I studied Communications and meteorology I served my communities as a meteorologist from 1999 to 2021. my job was to help my community by sharing the best information about upcoming severe weather and our changing climate when people have access to accurate weather forecasts and climate data we know that they make good decisions about their personal safety and about their own future so I want to extend a special welcome to my fellow meteorologist on the panel Dr drogmeyer for being here and uh I do want to very quickly uh thank my colleagues in Oklahoma for safely keeping people ahead of the storms in the past 24 to 36 hours they saved lives and that's the power of uh of meteorology I'm thrilled to join not only this committee but become the first meteorologist in Congress in nearly half a century today I would like to focus on the structure of the U.S approach to Science and Technology how our approach really differs from that of other countries including China and how we can use these differences to our advantage so I'll start with our meteorologist esteemed Dr drogogemeyer research institutions at our nation's universities like in my district Monmouth College and Augustana College um provide critical s t uh research much does owe you this type of research is often built upon the Private Industry developing these new Advanced Technologies and Investments the Private Industry is building on the advanced technology often develop in geographical proximity to the university that developed the basic technology this relationship benefits the community and the economy around the University so my question how do we ensure that private companies that utilize the free-form nature of s t r d locate around the producing University thus giving back to the community that produced the technology well thank you so much for your your good question and for your kind remarks there um we we do a lot of this at OU in fact we have companies locating on our campus and how do you incentivize them to to stay there and a lot of times they'll develop it I started a private company and it got I got purchased but it's still you know in in Norman I think the key thing is to make sure you lower the barrier to entry to interact with the university in terms of if they're on the campus you provide space for them at rates that did not undercut what they could get in the community but in fact our commitment but the value of being there is perhaps sort of co-marketing of being able to go to seminars getting access to students having students work in your company and so on as you're developing the technology the university kind of becomes your r d arm so if you're a small business you don't have an r d component of your company well hey the university could do that and it doesn't necessarily require you to have a funded research relationship with the the university it might be that you're serving on a graduate students committee and you deconflict yourself you don't have a conflict of interest but you're providing a private sector perspective on the work that they're doing and you might involve them doing an internship in your company for maybe not a lot of money but all of a sudden then you're able to hire them because you've vetted them you know exactly their capabilities you've developed their capabilities and all of a sudden they're your employee so you've not made a huge investment in them you've reaped the benefits of being at the University that's I think the power of the Local Economic Development I think the key thing is to have the university not see itself in competition with the Local Economic Development authorities you want to have a partnership to where we say the university plays an important role the the Chamber of Commerce plays an important role a lot of times there's economic development organizations that play a role we at in oak Oklahoma and Norman we have a triumvert of those things and they all work together if somebody comes to the campus great if they don't come to the campus great if they're in Norman or they're nearby we call that a win so it's it's about I think being a a good partner in this and not wanting to have everything for yourself but growing with a community in mind as you say my district consists of rural parts of Western Illinois smaller Suburban areas we know that smaller universities tend to attract much less funding we have to make sure that more funding gets to smaller schools What policies can Congress install to ensure that a diverse set of universities get up their funding their piece of that funding pie I'll give this to anyone I'll just tell you one thing that NSF is doing it's got a new program called granted it stands for if I get this right growing research actually access for nationally transformative equity and diversity and the idea basically is to say that small University Small colleges they they have the capability to compete in terms of personnel but they don't have the administrative structures to to manage grants to do proposal submissions to meet all the compliance rules and regulations so the idea is that if we as a federal government could invest in that capability through part helping build Partnerships with other institutions then we Empower them to unleash the capabilities of their faculty without putting them in Jeopardy of getting an audit report on a grant that they somehow mismanage without any ill intent but they simply didn't have the people who knew what they were doing and they weren't used to doing it they didn't have a history so that kind of program which is not super expensive uh it's it's leveraging the existing capabilities that R1 and R2 schools to build an ecosystem of Partnerships of administering Grant proposals and Grant Awards once they're funded that will really Empower a lot of institutions thank you I'm out of time

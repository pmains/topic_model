are representing Ohio the best in fact the best area of Ohio he represented Rob Portman good to have you on Senator spoken as a true Cincinnati true Cincinnati why can't I believe that the Bengals are foreign keeps wearing uh when it's not Halloween not last week so you know and then you ask about the inflation number it is at 8 30. and pollsters say it's going to be a really friendly number so run holsters God almighty um so what what are you hearing about you're a senator obviously what's going to happen with the house low 220s is that what the scuttlebutt is right now yeah do you know anything we don't know probably not but I do think you know the countries divided American people are divided kind of right down the middle and and that's reflected in these house numbers it'll be a republican majority unless something changes dramatically and but it'll be a bare majority and a difficult majority to hold together in the Senate um you know it's still up in the air depends on Nevada I think it's possible in Nevada that lack salt stays it's possible he keeps his lead and if he keeps his lead and then Georgia uh then it's a republican majority but it's but my point is it's right on the nice Edge and and people ought to pay attention you know when Joe Biden ran for president uh he actually talked about bringing people together in fact he won a primary saying I'm going to be the adult in the room work with Republicans as they always have and then at his inaugural address he used the word unify or some synonym times and he's never done it in my view so this is an opportunity now if Republicans had won big which a lot of people expected frankly I think it would have been harder for him because he would have been under a lot of pressure from the left well they they should have won big and abortion was definitely was definitely a factor but so were crappy candidates it shouldn't have been in there in the first place and we know how that happened yeah yeah right quality matters quality matters is is Herschel a quality candidate well he came very close you know to to winning an answer in in the general he's I mean he's he can he can certainly win he can no win do you think he's a quality candidate uh I think he let the people of Georgia decide that I mean I don't know what you mean by quality he got a lot of votes I mean he almost got 50 of the vote the football players some I guess there's been in the past where they've done well but someone some people might question you know a celebrity doctor a although uh he was he's not just a celebrity doctor he was a pretty good surgeon uh Oz but I don't know if he'd be a good senator now I guess what I'm getting at could Georgia and we're seeing it we still love Sea Island I love Sea Island we know about uh about Georgia uh do you so we you probably know have some insight down there could it be different this time if if Donald Trump doesn't get involved it could be different yes Brian can could be a rest you ever get the Georgia Republican establishment behind him everybody's in uh and Camp one by eight points and he's got you know some momentum right now he's going to be helping everybody's going to be helping and I do think that what happened last time was Donald Trump convinced a lot of Republicans not to vote so we could lose twice because of one one person uh well something like four out of the five congressional districts where we had the lowest turnout last time were the best Republican districts in the state so that's what happened last time there's no question about it this time that's not going to happen Franklin's just came on and said that that Trump is just a shoe-in for the nomination for 2024 I think everything changed I disagree I disagree with you everything changed though Frank's a smart guy but I disagree on that one I don't think Donald Trump's going to run now that puts me in a distinct minority I know what do you think he's going to say next week on the 15th well we'll see I mean change he's hyped it before and and not come through look I think what he's going to do is look at the polls and the polls show that his approval rating is quite High among hardcore Republicans certainly among Republicans in Ohio and other states but when the second question is asked do you think he ought to run for president the numbers are much you know less compelling for him and in fact head to head as you know with Governor DeSantis he's losing in some of these Republican polls so could you be a spoiler I mean I think that you know I don't know who could lose to President Biden probably if you're got a hardcore 30 or 25 percent in the Republican party you're going to lose in 2024. could he be a spoiler if someone that if he's unhappy if it does he become a third party candidate if the Santa's right no I don't I don't think so I don't think I don't think it'll be a scorched Earth no I mean look I I think he's likely to look at the polling data and say you know he he doesn't want to lose and uh so I I don't think he goes through this at the end of the day he's still a powerful force in the party though and again his favorability rating is high he can play out constructive role in his administration what he did on tax policy regulatory policy foreign policy even building up the military I mean a lot of good things he can talk about that's what the role is that he ought to be playing if he does it'll really help them you've got a truly unifying guy here so you can ask you know he has some questions about whether whether the country could be closer to I think that's because Democrats did so well you're ready although that's why Democrats did well is that the Republicans who were who were in the most populous of the sort of trumpian camp but the Santa he didn't do well you think it's a real Fringe candidate well no and the question the question about DeSantis is whether he moved to this whether he moves him look a year ago 12 months ago 18 months ago he was probably closer to being more centered he's actually moved more populist over the past 12 months the question is and to and did that to replace the sort of trumpianism I think to some degree the question is does he move back you may disagree that might be the in the eye of the holder I think you may disagree with that analysis one with big numbers and part of it is the policies and part of it is frankly competent you know I think people are looking for people who know how to manage things competently and he showed that so I think that attributes but I think the question about DeSantis is whether you think he moves more populous in terms of the rhetoric over the next two years like an example what what is an example of what you're doing I don't think it has to Disney that's a populist take that he has on on look I think where the Republican party was related to business and you would say 18 months ago and where it is today immigration is the same kind of thing no immigration he sent those people to Martha I think you focus on crime you focus on the border you focus on immigration generally you focus on the economy obviously and inflation and those are the issues when you look at what happened in this election candidates who talked about those issues including JD by the way you mentioned jade events in Ohio that's what he's talked about all of his ads were about those issues every one of them I think they'll do well particularly the question though is it do you do it you can disagree with people and have completely opposite ends of the Spectrum in terms of what you think needs to be done on each of these issues do you do it in a trolling way or do you do it in a way that says hey I disagree with you I think we should do this or do you do it and say I disagree with you and up yours I mean I totally agree and I think when you look at what happened with the independent vote Republicans did not do well that's where we lost ground it wasn't turnout on our side or turned out on their side it was among these Independents in a place like Ohio we did pretty well you know Mike dewine won by 20 plus points uh and JD Vance won by eight points but in other states we just didn't appeal to Independence anything a lot of its style so how did Independence get out the populist uh let's say that you do perceive but the santis as a populist or someone who trolls how did how did he win by such a margin and what had been a swing state well again competency he focused on issues and he was shown to be a competent manager particularly with regard to covet and I think that's what people are looking for so would it when it comes right down to it in we're in election season you know did you know that 2014. here we are already right it's like uh you know after Labor Day it's it's like we're in the holiday season I think but what do you see how do you see a play you think Joe Biden is a candidate well again I think if Republicans had done as well as was expected um you know he would have been getting a lot of pressure from the left because he would have had some Challengers you would have heard a lot of his potential presidential contenders talking today you know about how it's time to move on because he did pretty well and because you know the country is so divided um I think he's probably likely to run um and I don't think he has to shift so far to the left because I don't think he's as weak as he would have been and then on the other side you think that someone other than Trump you would say DeSantis has the you know I think it's so darn early Mike Pence Mike Pompeo remember when mayor Giuliani was by far the top pick among Republicans um to be a presidential candidate I mean things shift uh I think Phil Graham was at one point too I mean so what about you it's early it's early would you ever think about it I I think I'm I think I'm fine out of this crazy business for a while there's no way you'd ever uh think about that huh I don't think so Joe favorite son from Ohio well yeah I mean Ohio is a state that used to be the Bellwether State we've actually shifted a little more Republican I think and jade events is a I think an example of that yeah absolutely we're using populace as a new Mega term I think right is that is that what should we replace magdal with populists I think like what would you call JD Vance I'm just trying to get to all our term terminology I think he's in he was in the Maga camp and the question is did you stay in that camp and then part of it is whether everybody whether there was a group of Republicans that moved into the Magna Camp yeah because of the pressure from president Trump right and they may be liberated at this point because you know maybe and that's and that's the question about yes it's been defanged in terms of Retribution that was my idea which I thought would be bad for Democrats oh by the way it may be very bad for Democrats right if he's out of here all right Rob Portman again if you look at JJ's campaign

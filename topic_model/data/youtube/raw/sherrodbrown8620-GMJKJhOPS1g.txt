before I ask for your vote I want to tell you where I stand I'm for cracking down on China when they cheat and against trade agreements that put American jobs at risk I'm proud I led the fight to save the auto industry and things student loans should be affordable for the middle class and I'll protect Medicare because workers have paid into the system and now they're relying on it to be there for them I'm sherrod Brown I approve this message and ask for your vote so I can keep fighting for Ohio

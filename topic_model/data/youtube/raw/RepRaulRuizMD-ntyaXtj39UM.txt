am outraged that the cares act stimulus checks the economic impact payments have not arrived to many of my constituents months after being signed into law the stimulus checks provide timely and critical relief to families and individuals across our country who are struggling because of the coronavirus pandemic but many constituents have told me they were forced to wait months for their stimulus checks or have yet to receive them at all to make matters worse when my office has contacted the irs on their behalf the responses have been wholly inadequate merely quoting what is on their website or failing to answer questions altogether this is unacceptable families are unable to make ends meet workers are choosing between keeping the lice on and buying groceries and people have been laid off and are wondering where their next meal will come from my constituents are in dire need of urgent assistance the irs must act immediately to expedite these stimulus checks so the american people can get through this tumultuous time i yield back

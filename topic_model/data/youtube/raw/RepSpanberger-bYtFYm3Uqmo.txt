[Music] my name is greg gaines i'm the commander of vfw post 7819 and crew the vfw is a congressionally chartered veterans service organization consisting of overseas veterans from various combat operations over really over the last 100 years when we were started we have several core values to include promoting patriotism honoring military service and serving our communities we do this in a variety of ways one of which is to help our older veterans get the benefits of service that they have earned over the years one of our recent experiences was with former staff sergeant mark tuck of crew now 92 years young mr tuck is a veteran of the korean war having served in company e 223rd infantry regiment 40th division in the last year of the korean war from july of 1952 to july of 1953. mr tuck like many veterans ended his service came home went to work got married raised family held a job but one thing that we did not know is that he never got his medals every june we have a national korean war recognition day and we were having our picnic at the vfw and we learned that he did not receive his medals and we knew that we needed to take action to help him get those medals with that in mind we found his dd214 his honorable discharge and we reached out to our congressional representative abigail spanberger to see if her office could help us get those medals constituent services as you're probably well aware is a primary function of any congressional office but working with veterans and veterans needs is a high priority for all of them and this was one that they felt needed to be done but congresswoman spanberger was so moved by mr tuck's story that she was moved to to make a one-minute speech on the floor of the house of representatives in mr tuck's otter recognizing his service and the fact that he has not gotten those medals and would get those medals uh very soon we were very honored uh when she did that because that that spoke uh it spoke volumes to us about her concern about about mr tub we were even more surprised and honored when congresswoman spanberger notified us that she would be coming to crew to present those medals personally to mr tuck mr tuck was uh very moved we contacted his church he had not missed sunday school by the way for 42 years straight we contacted the crew kiwanos club that where he had been a very active member and we contacted of course all of our vfw members so we had a packed house that showed up and it turned out to be a very moving and emotional moment not only for mr tuck but also for congresswoman spanberger you could tell when they were when she was giving her speech or giving her talk on mr tuck that she was very moved by his service and by the turnout of folks from our small community to honor him in his service all veterans are entitled to the benefits of service that those benefits may be medical care through the veterans administration where it may be merely the recip receiving the medals that they earned when they were on active duty in overseas combat zones your congressional representative is there to help you need to reach out and in the seventh district your congressional representative is abigail spamberg they have been very helpful to us and i think they'll be very helpful to you

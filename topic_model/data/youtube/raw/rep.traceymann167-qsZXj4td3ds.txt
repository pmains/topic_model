mr speaker i'm humbled to deliver my first speech on the house floor today and discuss the future of our great nation i grew up on a farm south of quinter kansas that my parents and brothers still operate the house my parents live in and the house i grew up in is the same house my great great grandfather ordered from montgomery ward catalog in the early 1900s growing up there meant i spent thousands of hours on a tractor working in the fields and on horseback doctoring cattle in the family feed yard those hours turned into love of country and the lessons of value of hard work my kansas roots run deep and my desire to serve our country is wider than a country mile i ran for congress to advocate for agriculture and our conservative kansas values kansas are good people who carry a pioneering spirit with them in the same way those who settled my state did over 160 years ago the people of kansas one the big firsts know each other look out for each other and sacrifice for each other the district is home to more than 60 thousand farms and are made up of farmers ranchers feedlot managers nutritionists ethanol producers ag lenders and agribusiness owners who feed fuel and clothe the world as congress becomes increasingly more urban the distance from farm to fork has never been greater and the big first depends on strong voices for agriculture and congress and that is why i am honored to serve on the house agriculture committee at the very top center of the big first sits lebanon kansas a seemingly ordinary small town about two and a half miles northwest of lebanon is the exact middle of the contiguous 48 states a few months ago a group of us met in lebanon and prayed for our nation and that god's will would be done and that our future would be bright there's something about being in the middle of the country where farmers pray for rain parents drive 30 miles one way to take their kids to school and communities shrink and grow with oil and gas prices that gives you a great perspective to be real in the middle of it all though we must demand results i've received many calls from family farmers in the big first gravely concerned with president biden's executive order restricting travel from countries like south africa where many of our legal farm workers come from during harvest and i'll tell you if an issue matters to kansans it matters to me i worked with a number of my colleagues here to issue a letter to president biden asking that he exempt essential workers like those in agriculture from his travel ban soon after we were told the president would grant the exemption but to me an exemption to an overreaching executive order is not enough after watching president biden issue 25 executive orders in his first 10 days as president more than the seven presidents combined the last 10 days i decided i could no longer sit idle and watch executive orders dictate the direction of this country with no input from congress the executive branch was not created to legislate congress was we're not up to 42 executive orders from the biden white house that's why earlier this week i introduced the more accountability as necessary now acts six pieces of legislation promoting accountability and transparency to the administration's future executive orders the man acts require that the executive branch notify the american public and congress of his intent to issue any new executive orders pertaining to agriculture energy the environment pro-life provisions the second amendment and immigration the storm impact of legislation like this would be to hold our elected leaders more accountable but for the long term we must never forget that america is the greatest and most noble experiment that has ever been endeavored when our founding fathers used the three words by their creator 245 years ago they unleashed freedom on humanity because for the first time in history people stood up and declared that freedoms do not flow from a king or government they flow from god the power of that truth can never be stomped out because it rings loudly in the hearts and minds of americans from coast to coast and certainly in the big first which in many ways is the pilot light of america in my district the basic values of faith family and freedom are alive and well and is our responsibility to never let that light go out i believe that we get in the middle of issues roll up our sleeves get to work and do the heavy lifting we gain better perspectives and better results being in the middle of it all instead of being stapled to our desks in washington dc makes us all better and is good for america get in the middle of it stand face to face and engage spend time to think pray and reflect like i did that day in the exact center of the country i promise you'll gain a better understanding of where we need to go as a nation i did not run for congress to be a caretaker in the slow demise of america i ran so i could fight and work to make it stronger that's what i intend to do while believing that our brightest days are yet to come i yield back

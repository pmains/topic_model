um this is the known as the capital markets subcommittee our last hearing was on the stock markets this hearing is about the most critical part of the bond markets it's hard to say that we're not focusing on our capital markets though as a philatelist i believe that perhaps we're leaving out the um the market for collectible stamps um so we're covering the bond market covering the stock market the critical element that the cred the bond rating agencies play is exemplified by the fact that if you're putting together a portfolio and you get generate a 5.7 return on uh bonds rated uh either double a or triple a you look good compared to somebody else who uh puts together a portfolio meeting the same requirements who's only getting 5.6 the fact is whether you're putting together a portfolio for an insurance company and trying to please your boss there whether you're putting together a portfolio for a mutual fund the ratings determine what you need to put into that portfolio as to the problem that focused on this hearing we are being told by some that it's on an important problem nine republican members signed the letter urging that this problem be dealt with and i think our witnesses have illustrated how important this problem is and as i say i know i think this uh subcommittee hearing was remarkably effective and that the proposal has been uh withdrawn but that raises the question for our uh witness from s p is this proposal dead or just sleeping for a while thank you mr chairman and i appreciate you giving me the opportunity to give more information on the ongoing request for comment process so on monday the 9th of may we published an faq that announced the withdrawal of one particular section that was describing the way we were proposing to deal with a fairly complex technical issue which is how to assess the thousands of securities uh held by by insurers i'm going to interrupt you there we have an anti-notching statute that deals with asset-based securities is there any reason we shouldn't extend that uh to all bond issuances well i've got no particular view about that what i'm trying to say is that that is the major proposal being considered by this uh uh subcommittee and on our list of uh proposals and uh uh the fact that you aren't here to oppose that proposal uh commends it to all of our colleagues we've got an open we've got an open request for comment that continues we will continue to take in comments there were serious concerns raised we took them into account it's it's everyone i thank you for doing that and knowing that this issue could come up in the months and years to head think that we need legislation um why don't i uh ask uh uh the gentleman from uh uh from fitch um uh one proposal before us is that we prevent the bond rating agencies the united states from raiding any uh new instruments coming out of russia and belarus or particularly or we might limit it to certain uh state-affiliated firms um we could go further with secondary sanctions and turn to the foreign-based bond rating agencies and say if they rated such bonds they could not rate bonds here in the united states or at least american issuers couldn't pay them to do so what effect would denying bond ratings to all future issuances by belarus and russia have on their ability to raise capital uh well for us in russia the the ship has already sailed we we announced a suspension of commercial operations in russia on the 7th of march and we announced on the 23rd of march our intention to withdraw all the ratings in russia um towards the end of march so thank you gentlemen i'll ask the gentleman from s p are you still rating russia no we don't we withdrew all our ratings on russian entities uh are foreign based uh uh bond rating agencies rating them the japanese the europeans you don't know uh they it's agency and based in europe that endorses international ratings that they have to withdraw their ratings by the 15th of april oh okay um next uh i'll ask uh uh our representative from kroll um we've got a system of different ratings instead of saying first best second best third best fourth best all the way up to 18th best uh we've got a weird combinations of plus and minus signs capital and small letters which are absolutely unintelligible what would be the harm to the bond rating agency if you just said first best second best third best would it be a great harm to our society if my constituents could understand what you're saying thank you for your question sharon sherman i don't think it would be i see that my time has expired i'm going to ask you to respond for the record and recognize the gentleman from michigan

mr speaker i remember purpose of minority leader roz i ask unanimous consent to strike the last word gentlelady's recognized thank you very much mr speaker mr speaker at six o'clock across america or at least in the eastern time zone families across america are getting ready to sit down for dinner at their kitchen table many homes in our country parents moms are saying to their children eat your vegetables eat your eat your dinner but in some homes in america there isn't adequate food on the table there isn't adequate nutrition for our children it's hard to imagine that one in five kids in america may go to sleep hungry tonight with pains in their stomachs because they just didn't have enough food to eat in its wisdom our the united states of america established the wic program a while back for women infants and children to make sure our nation was strong was to make sure that we fed our children our country made a decision that feeding our children was a priority sounds so obvious families make decisions about their budgets that they're going to feed their children they wouldn't think of saving money by not feeding their children but for some in low-income areas and for others now this is into the middle class it's very hard to make ends meet and so you wonder these people who are sitting down to dinner how the congress of the united states should decide that in meeting and trying to reduce the deficit which we're all committed to do that's important to our children as well why we would decide to balance that budget on the little tiny backs of our children our children many of whom don't have enough to eat i want to commend congresswoman delauro for her leadership as a member of the ag subcommittee of appropriations of former chair of that subcommittee she successfully passed an amendment in committee which had bipartisan support it would have to have bipartisan support to pass to restore 147 million dollars to the wic program to feed the children i congratulate her for that it is part of the bill that was supposed to come to the floor the republican leadership has decided not to protect that bipartisanly past amendment what we're seeing is a cutting support for children infants and women infinite children is in the context of something bigger at the same time as we are making these cuts we are giving tax subsidies to big oil the price at the pump is also an imposition on the budgets of these families and that is something that we can do something about by ending speculation harmful speculation and doing but you have to do that we have to fund the commodities futures trading commission which is in this bill as well and the republicans are saying they want to delay delay delay and defeat the enforcement of laws which would end speculation which would reduce the price at the pump goldman sachs says by at least 20 percent at the same time the same republican majority has passed a bill not once but twice to abolish medicare food price at the pump medicare these are assaults on the middle class that are hard to withstand in fact they're hard to understand it's hard to understand why i would say to seniors you're going to pay more for medicare for fewer benefits as we abolish medicare while we give subsidies to big oil we're going to say to seniors in nursing homes you're going to go home and live with your family who can probably ill afford for you to do so so we can give tax breaks to corporations to send jobs overseas we'll say to children who were not feeding that that were cutting education funding as well as making college more expensive for nearly 10 million students and are making it unaffordable to go to college while we give tax breaks to the wealthiest people in our country so they're cutting support for women infants and children while handing a blank check to speculators they're ending medicare while they give subsidies to big oil these do not reflect america's values and priorities these choices these are tough choices they will not bring the growth we need to expand our economy put people back to work as we create jobs they will not make america strong as moms across america are saying to children right now six o'clock in the east eat your vegetables they will make you strong we are acting on this floor to do just the opposite to cut the funding for the initiative that will help feed the children of america it's unthinkable that a family would say we can't afford to feed the children it's unthinkable that a nation committed to the future would say we can't afford to feed the children these families need our help it's not it's a large it's a large amount of money 147 million dollars very small compared to the subsidies to big oil and a small price to pay for the health and well-being of our children and the strength of our country as we go into the future so i commend congresswoman delauro for her tremendous leadership for fighting for this for not taking no for an answer in the committee and i would hope that we could prevail on the floor but the republican majority has left little option for that to happen i also want to commend the ranking member congressman farr now the ranking member on the ag subcommittee probably nobody in the congress knows more there may be some who are as equal i don't know but probably no one knows more about this issue inventing an agricultural issue region as he does and also being committed to the health and well-being the good nutrition of our children so that they can be strong so that they can learn in school so that they can be part of our great country in the best possible way for them so i thank you uh ranking member far for your leadership as well and with that i yield back the balance of my time generally yields back what purpose gentleman from arkansas rise

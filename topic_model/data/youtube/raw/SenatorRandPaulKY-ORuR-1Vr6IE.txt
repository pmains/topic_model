senator paul i'd like to begin by uh wishing a speedy recovery to the two police officers in louisville who were shot yesterday in the line of duty i joined senator scott and others in saying that we have to appreciate our police more generally they're protecting us from the vandals the marauders the arsonists in our cities and it's not just the democrat proposition of defunding the police that threatens us it's also the idea that if we don't appreciate our police we won't have more volunteering to become policemen in the next generation so i think it's absolutely imperative that we do show our appreciation for these people are risking their lives to keep us safe my wife and i know about this personally as you saw from the video going into this we were attacked by a mob in dc just a few weeks ago for those of you who doubt that the mob had violent intent immediately after we were safely into the hotel or somewhat safe in our hotel one of the police officers was assaulted and uh received stitches in his face and i guess what bothered me is a you know i commend them for their heroism that i truly believe they saved our lives but the person who assaulted the policemen was from out of state i think their federal charges were lodged but then he was released on his own recognizance i tweeted out uh somewhat snarkily if you're looking for him you may look in kenosha but i think we do have to investigate these people and we have to put blame where blame is we need to find out who's financing them if you're from out of state you attacked someone in dc i would think that the fbi or federal authorities should investigate you know how did he get there who's paying for it i can tell you that black lives matter is supporting these folks and that we shouldn't shy away from attributing blame where blame goes when we were attacked the head of black lives matter in louisville had this to say she said we can see the fear in their faces and that's how we want them to live their goal is terrorism they're admitting it if you look at their exchanges online in social media they are saying their goal is to terrorize public officials and really anybody many of the people in the restaurants that they're being terrorized are not public officials but their goal is terror now whether or not that equates to something that you can legally investigate i don't know but we should know that and we should let corporate america know that corporate america is giving millions of dollars to something they perceive as an anti-racist group in reality it's a group that is funding terror and funding terrorists to go from city to city i don't think probably anyone can comment directly on the police officer that was assaulted that was protecting my wife and i but i guess in general director ray does a police officer being attacked by someone who came from another state do you think that can fall under the purview of the fbi is the fbi in general investigating cases like this where people from out of state are doing something you would think it would be a local crime to be investigated but if they're from out of state is there a federal angle to an investigation well senator first let me say i appreciate your sympathy and appreciation to that officer uh and uh well we're pleased that the offender was charged uh obviously the release is concerning i would say that when it comes to interstate travel there are sometimes federal charges that we can bring so there are federal rioting charges that have an interstate nexus that we have started trying to use around the country where we can and there are a variety of sort of interstate commerce type hooks that we can look to we are aggressively looking for a lot of the same kinds of things that you're pointing to funding supply chains networks communications uh with others in different parts of the country and certainly the interstate travelers are often some of the most serious offenders i know that in portland for example there were a couple of individuals that i can think of off top of my head who were coming from a different state who um were in one case threatening to blow up a building in another case attempting uh to attack a building uh and charges were brought in both of those instances so wherever we can find a tool or a legal legally available weapon to go after those people we're going to use it because while there are certainly a large number even a majority of people out there who are protesting peacefully it doesn't take very many as as you experienced you and your wife in the the really shocking video that was played it doesn't take very many people to suddenly cause very serious harm and i think the the frustration is is that there's there's one guy on the internet who's i think he's been arrested 26 times and there's got to be some sort of cumulative nature to that many crimes that we've got to be at some point able to hold them i do think rearresting is a good idea and if if i were in portland i would arrest them all every night the ones that are committing infractions and it's not life in prison but you should get 24 hours in a cell and a trial or a hearing the next day and be booked but we've got to do something and i think the the lack of doing anything is encouraging more of this the people who were in the mob that attacked us within like you know how the internet works within 20 minutes people are isolating their faces and saying here's a picture of him in louisville here's a picture of him in memphis here's a picture of him in portland so there is some connection and it costs money you know uh to travel places and there were dozens staying in hotels near the white house that average over 500 a night so i think it's important that we look at it now i'm very concerned about free speech and not going after groups for speech i actually sympathize with some of the reforms i had a a an act called the briona taylor act to get rid of no knock raids because i think they endanger police officers and people behind on the raids and many police officers actually agree that the no knock raids may not be necessary but at the same time if the trail leads to black lives matter there's an important public service to the the corporations who think they're giving money to a peaceful protest or to a peaceful anti-racial group need to be aware if they're being flown around so there's an important um i think call to not having more money flood into a group if that's what's happening and so all i would say is that we should not be afraid of um you know allegations that this is just a peaceful group so we can't touch them that we do need to trace the money from people who are committing crimes and if it's coming from an organization um that may have multi-purposes and say they have a first amendment right they don't have a right to fund mayhem and i hope it will be pursued and feel free to respond to that or or not well thank you senator just two quick points one i couldn't agree more on the repeat offender aspect of it and one of the things that we're doing in portland and in other places is trying to work with our state and local partners to essentially identify who is it who's just going in and out of of the state local system either because they're getting released on bail otherwise and c prioritize those individuals to see if there's some federal charge because often that can result in in uh in detention and more stiff sentences and then on the funding piece following the money is kind of our bread and butter it's something we're looking at as i said uh including which i think goes to a little bit to your your last point including situations where somebody might be misrepresenting what it is they're fundraising for right so certain crowdsourcing activities where somebody contributes thinking they're giving for something that's first amendment activity but in fact it's maybe being used for for something else that's much more uh pernicious and so we're looking at that too and just one quick final comment the people who are being hurt the worst of the people who live in these communities so the people who say i want to help people in the poor sections of chicago or the poor sections of need to realize when you burn down the last pharmacy when you burn down the last mcdonald's or walmart that it hurts the people who live there and many of these businesses won't get back and that can't be emphasized enough from a humanitarian point of view we've got to end the violence because you're hurting the very people you think you're trying to help thank you

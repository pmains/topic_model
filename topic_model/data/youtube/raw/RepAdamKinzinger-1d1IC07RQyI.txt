-- TWO COOPERATING FIGURES.  >> IF WE CAN GET THE AUTHORITIES AND ASSURANCES THAT GO WITH IT,  WE'LL DO IT.  >> I WANT TO BRING IN NOW  REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN ADAM  KINZINGER OF ILLINOIS, A MEMBER  OF THE JANUARY 6th COMMITTEE  INVESTIGATING THE ATTACK ON THE  CAPITOL. IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU.  >> THANK YOU.  >> CAN YOU GIVE US ANY NAMES OR  THE SOECHBS THE TYPE OF  WITNESSES YOU'RE EXPECTING TO  BRING IN? DO YOU THINK IT WILL INCLUDE ANY WHITE HOUSE STAFFERS? GIVE US A SENSE OF THAT? >> I WISH I COULD GIVEN YOU MORE DETAILS. I DON'T WANT TO GET AHEAD OF THE COMMITTEE. I'LL GIVE YOU A LAYER, WHAT IS  THE ROLE AND WHAT DO WE WANT TO  DO. WE WANT TO TAKE THE INFORMATION  WE KNOW AND WE WANT TO BE ABLE  TO PAINT A PICTURE FOR THE  AMERICAN PEOPLE, AND THIS IS THE KEY BECAUSE, YES, ANY POTENTIAL  CRIMINAL REFERRALS, ALL THAT  STUFF IS IMPORTANT, BUT WHAT'S  MOST IMPORTANT FOR OUR  COMMITTEE'S WORK IS TO FIGURE  OUT WHAT LED TO JANUARY 6th, YOU KNOW, DETAILS ABOUT JANUARY 6th, AND WHERE HAVE WE GONE SINCE. AND SO WE'RE GOING TO PUT THAT  DISPLAY IN FRONT OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY'RE THE  AUDIENCE THAT NEEDS TO HEAR  THIS.  >> WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE FACTS OF THE MATTER, FORMER TRUMP  ADMINISTRATION SECRETARY  STEPHANIE GRISHAM TALKED WITH  HER COMMITTEE. SINCE THEN SHE'S PUBLICLY SPOKEN WHAT SHE SPOKE OF IN HER WORDS  GLEEFULLY WATCHING RIOTERS  STORMING FROM THE CAPITOL. DO YOU FEEL LIKE WHATEVER SHE  SAID CLEARED UP QUESTIONS ABOUT  WHAT DONALD TRUMP WAS DOING WHEN THEY WERE SILENT AT THE WHITE  HOUSE? >> SHE AND OTHERS. WE WANT TO GET MORE INFORMATION, TALK TO MORE PEOPLE. I THINK IT SHOWS ONE OF TWO  THINGS. SO EITHER THE PRESIDENT,  PROBABLY IN HIS BEST-CASE  SCENARIO, WAS TOTALLY  INCOMPETENT, TOTALLY INDECISIVE  AND ABSOLUTELY ABDICATED HIS  RESPONSIBILITY TO DEFEND THE  CONSTITUTION, OR, AND THIS IS  WHERE WE CAN GET MORE  INFORMATION, YOU KNOW, HE WAS  PART OF THIS, PART OF  UNDERSTANDING WHAT WAS GOING TO  HAPPEN. THAT'S WHY THE DAYS LEADING UP  TO JANUARY 6th IN TERMS OF HIM  SPECIFICALLY, WHAT DID HE KNOW,  WHO DID HE TALK TO ARE SO  IMPORTANT. YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT -- IT WASN'T  CRAZY TO PREDICT VIOLENCE PRIOR  TO JANUARY 6th. I PREDICTED IT. I KNOW OTHERS DID TOO. YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT SOCIAL  MEDIA. WE KNOW HE STARES AT SOCIAL  MEDIA. IT COMES DOWN TO WHAT DID HE  KNOW. THAT COULD BE THE DEFINING  MOMENT AS TO WHAT HE DID  CRIMINAL OR IS IT JUST TERRIBLY  INCOMPETENT.  >> THIS IS GETTING TO A KEY  QUESTION I HAVE FOR YOU, WHICH  IS -- FOLKS WHO WATCH THE SHOW  KNOW I INTERVIEWED DR. HARRY  DUNN WHO WAS AT THE CAPITOL ON  THE DAY OF THE INSURRECTION. HE SAID, LISTEN, I CAN'T HAVE  CLOSURE UNTIL I KNOW MORE ABOUT  THE FACTS. THERE ARE SOME FACTS THAT COME  FROM, YOU KNOW AND I DON'T KNOW. I WONDER, DO YOU FEEL LIKE IT IS STILL AN OPEN QUESTION THAT  FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS  INVOLVED IN PERHAPS PREPLANNING  AND HAD SOME SORT OF PRIOR  KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT HAPPENED ON  JANUARY 6th? IT FEELS LIKE NOW IS THAT STILL  AN OPEN QUESTION? >> I'LL SAY THIS FROM MY  PERSPECTIVE AND THINGS THAT I  KNOW, THERE WOULD STILL NEED TO  BE FROM A KIND OF DOJ  PERSPECTIVE MORE INFORMATION TO  COME OUT, DEPENDING ON HIM. THAT'S A BIG DEAL DEPEND TONG  FORMER PRESIDENT. BUT I THINK WHAT WE DON'T WANT  TO MISS IS THE FACT THAT THE  PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES  HAS A RESPONSIBILITY, AND HE  WATCHED FOR 180 MINUTES AS THE  CAPITOL WAS BASICALLY OCCUPIED  AND BORDERLINE DESTROYED, AND HE DID NOTHING. WHEN THE VICE PRESIDENT HAS TO  MAKE CALLS TO SEND THE NATIONAL  GUARD AND HE'S WATCHING  TELEVISION AS THE PRESIDENT,  THAT IN AND OF ITSELF SHOULD BE  A HUGE, HUGE RED FLAG TO  ANYBODY.  >> SO GIVEN THAT, IS IT FAIR TO  SAY THAT AT THIS POINT YOU DO  NOT FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE ENOUGH  INFORMATION RIGHT NOW TO SUPPORT A CRIMINAL REFERRAL AGAINST MR.  TRUMP? >> I DON'T WANT TO SAY YES OR NO ON THAT, I REALLY DON'T. WE WANT TO GATHER ALL THE FACTS  WE CAN. AS YOU KNOW, THERE ARE SOME  OUTSTANDING COURT CASES. THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WE  HAVE TALKED TO. I DON'T WANT TO GET OUT AHEAD OF ALL THE INFORMATION WE GATHER  AND HAVE.  >> OKAY. I HAVE A COME MORE QUESTIONS FOR YOU. FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE, ARE THERE PLANS TO HAVE HIM COME IN? I KNOW THERE ARE INDICATIONS YOU WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM HIM.  >> WE CERTAINLY WOULD LIKE HIM  TO VOLUNTARILY COME IN AND TALK  WITH THE COMMITTEE. HIS STAFF HAS BEEN MORE THAN  HELPFUL IN SHEDDING LIGHT ON  THINGS. I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF HE  DIDN'T WANT TO IN SOME WAY  COOPERATE. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT MEANS --  HOPEFULLY NOT A SUBPOENA BUT  MAYBE WRITTEN ANSWERS TO  QUESTIONS OR A VOLUNTARY  INTERVIEW. WE WOULD LOVE TO HEAR FROM HIM. REGARDLESS OF YOUR OPINIONS FROM HIM, HE ACTED NOBLY DESPITE THE  PRESSURE AND COULD HAVE ACTED  WORSE UNDER THE CRISIS BUT  DIDN'T.  >> IS THAT FORMAL REQUEST FOR  VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION GONE OUT YET OR ARE YOU JUST SAYING YOU  WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM HIM? >> I WOULD LIKE TO SEE HIM, HEAR FROM HIM. ANY REQUEST WOULD BE ANNOUNCED  FROM THE COMMITTEE AND WOULD GO  OUT SOONISH.  >> YOU AND I SPOKE TO EXACTLY  ONE YEAR AGO. IT WAS A LITTLE EARLIER, JANUARY 7th, THE DAY AFTER THE ATTACK. WE TALKED ABOUT THE POLITICAL  CLIMATE AND WHAT YOU THOUGHT  HAPPENED. I WANT TO PLAY WHAT YOU SAID A  YEAR AGO, CONGRESSMAN. WATCH.  >> I THINK YESTERDAY IT BECAME  CLEAR THAT THE PRESIDENT IS  UN-MOORED FROM REALITY AND HIS  OATH. A PEACEFUL TRANSFER IS ESSENTIAL RIGHT NOW TO THE CONTINUATION OF THIS STRONG UNION. I THINK IT'S OBVIOUS THAT THEIR  OWN POLITICAL SURVIVAL DEMANDS  WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY AND IT'S GOING LEAD TO SOMETHING LIKE  THIS HAPPENING AGAIN OR MAYBE  WORSE.  >> YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED  YESTERDAY. I KNOW THAT YOU WERE NOT THERE  BECAUSE I KNOW YOUR BABY IS  GOING DOM ANY DAY NOW. YOU'RE ON LABOR WATCH. THE CHENEYS WERE THE ONLY  REPUBLICANS SEEING THE EVENT AT  THE CAPITOL. GIVEN WHERE WE ARE A YEAR LATER, DO YOU RECOGNIZE YOUR PARTY? >> NO, I DON'T. YOU KNOW, IT'S GOTTEN TO A POINT WHERE, YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS 6  YEARS OLD I BECAME A REPUBLICAN  BECAUSE I LIKED THE IDEA OF  STRONG NATIONAL DEFENSE A  LIMITED GO. I STILL BELIEVE IN THAT. WHAT HAS CHANGED IS THE USE OF  CONSPIRACY, THE ABSOLUTE LACK OF COURAGE TO CALL IT OUT, THE FEAR THAT PERMEATES LEADERS OF THE  REPUBLICAN PARTY AGAINST A MAN  WHO IS BASICALLY INSANE SENDING  OUT PRESS RELEASES FROM  MAR-A-LAGO. IT'S UNRECOGNIZABLE. AND IT'S SAD BECAUSE THE  REPUBLICAN PARTY WILL EXIST AND  IT'S A MAJOR POLITICAL PARTY OF  THE UNITED STATES. WE NEED CONSERVATIVE VOICES OUT  THERE AS WELL. AND -- BUT IT IS LOST IN A LOT  OF PEOPLE'S MINDS, ANY  CREDIBILITY, AND IT'S GOING TO  TAKE A WHILE TO GET IT BACK. LOOK, WE HAVE A TRUTH CRISIS IN  THIS PARTY, AND THAT IS THE  FIRST THING WE HAVE TO GET BACK  TO IS TRUTH. YOU CAN HAVE DIFFERENT OPINIONS, BUT YOU CAN'T HAVE A DIFFERENT  TRUTH.  >> YOU DESCRIBE IT AS SAD,  RIGHT? WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THE PARTY. THERE'S ALSO SOMETHING OTHERS  WOULD USE IS SCARY TO DESCRIBE,  AN EROSION OF CONFIDENCE. REPUBLICANS DON'T THINK THEIR  BALLOTS ARE GOING TO BE COUNTED. YOU WROTE YESTERDAY THAT THINGS  FEEL EVEN WORSE THAN THEY DID  WHEN THE INSURRECTION TOOK  PLACE. HOW DO WE GET TO A PLACE NOW  WHERE REPUBLICAN VOTERS' FAITH  IN THE ELECTION PROCESS IS  RESTORED. THE PEOPLE YOU ARE TALKING  ABOUT, THE PEOPLE WHO ARE  IDENTIFYING AS CONSERVATIVE, AS  REPUBLICAN, HOW DO WE GET PAST  THIS MOMENT THIS THE DEMOCRATIC  SYSTEM? >> I MEAN, IT TAKES -- IT TAKES  LEADERSHIP, ACCOUNTABILITY. THE JANUARY 6th COMMITTEE IS  PART OF THE ACCOUNTABILITY. I THINK MEDIA CALLING OUT LIES  IS PART OF THE ACCOUNTABILITY. PEOPLE TAKING RECOGNITION OF  WHAT THEY CHOOSE TO BELIEVE AND  CHOOSE NOT TO, THAT'S  ACCOUNTABILITY. BECAUSE IN SELF GOVERNANCE --  LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING IN  KAZAKHSTAN RIGHT NOW AND SEE  WHAT HAPPENS WHEN PEOPLE LOSE  FAITH IN GOVERNING SYSTEM. THE FAR RIGHT AND FAR LEFT, AND  EVERYONE IN BETWEEN YOU HAVE TO  HAVE THE BASIC CONCEPT THAT YOUR VOTE IS GOING TO COUNT AND COUNT FAIRLY. WHEN YOU UNDERMINE THAT THROUGH  LIES TO PEOPLE VIE LENS IS NOT A SURPRISE. IT IS UP TO LEADERS -- THAT'S  THE NAME. YOUR LEADER.YOU HAVE TO LEAD. AND YOU HAVE TO TELL PEOPLE THE  TRUTH. RIGHT NOW EVERYBODY HAS THEIR  HEAD IN THE SAND. WHAT IS WINNING REELECTION  HONESTLY WORTH IF YOU CAN'T  ACTUALLY DO YOUR JOB OF TELLING  PEOPLE THE TRUTH OR YOU ARE  ASHAMED TO LOOK AT YOURSELF IN  THE MIRROR? I CAN'T ANSWER THAT BECAUSE I  TAKE A DIFFERENT APPROACH. BUT I CAN'T IMAGINE BEING SOME  OF THOSE THAT ARE SCARED TO  DEATH OF TELLING THE TRUTH TO  THEIR OWN PEOPLE.  >> DO YOU HEAR FROM THEM? CANDIDLY, CONGRESSMAN, TO PEOPLE TALK TO YOU MUCH IN YOUR PARTY  ANYMORE THESE DAYS.  >> A FEW LESS CONVERSATIONS. YOU KNOW, WE STILL HAVE  CONVERSATIONS. INEVITABLY THOSE THAT ARE I  WOULD CALL REASONABLE IN WHAT  THEY KNOW AND UNDERSTAND AND MAY SAY PUBLICLY, BUT NOT  AGGRESSIVELY, THEY SAY, IF I  LOSE OUT, SOMEBODY CRAZIER IS  GOING TO REPLACE ME. THAT IS TRUE. BUT NOW IS THE TIME TO SPEAK OUT BECAUSE IT IS EITHER A SLOW  TRAIN TO CRAZY OR A FAST TRAIN  TO CRAZY WHEN YOU HAVE A CHANCE  TO DERAIL IT. >> CONGRESS MAN ADA

which I want to thank gentleman from Massachusetts for yielding and for his leadership on these critical issues I rise in strong support excuse me in strong opposition to the rule h.res 531 and also to the bill HR 4038 the American security against foreign enemies act of 2015 foreign enemies refugees we we all watched with horror as unconscionable violence unfolded in Paris over the weekend but also in Egypt and Lebanon in Nigeria so let me just first say that my thoughts and prayers go out to all of those who have been affected by all of these tragedies but it would be a grave mistake to use these attacks as a pretense to close our doors to the families that are fleeing ISIL in their own countries the overwhelming majority of course you know our women and children just as the unfortunate attacks of 911 required us to step up and lead we're at that moment again where members of Congress need to lead this counterproductive bill would immediately shut down the resettlement of refugees from countries such as Syria and Iraq while significantly slowing down yes shutting down our resettlement process in the future but of course as members of Congress our first goal is keeping our country safe we all are committed to that and we do that each and every day but preventing these people suffering the violence you run signal first to our allies to our own country and really this is not consistent with our national security goals simply put closing our doors to these refugees would really be a betrayal of our nation's most fundamental values mr. speaker the United States already has the lengthiest and most robust screening procedures in the world any refugees seeking to come to the United States goes through a screening process that takes 18 to 24 months before they can even set foot on the United States soil our screening process is already involved multiple federal ma'am another medical asst the initial one minute the gentlewoman is recognized for an additional minute thank you very much a screening process has already involved multiple federal intelligence security and law enforcement agencies including the Department of Homeland Security the Counterterrorism Center and the FBI these agencies subject those seeking refuge in the United States to safeguards such as biometric and bio graphics Syrian refugees are already subjected to additional forms of security screening mr. speaker is worth noting its but said before I'll say it again that of the 2174 Syrian refugees admitted to the United States since sep tember 11 2001 that's 2174 not a single one has been arrested or deported on terrorism-related grounds I am proud that Oakland and my congressional district has resettled more Syrian refugees than any other East Bay Area city in California rather than working to shut out those seeking refuge in our country we should instead be working toward ensuring a reasonably LED comprehensive economic political and diplomatic solution to the conflicts that have led to the worst refugee crisis since World War two this world excuse me this would stop the flow of refugees and give them a chance to live in their own country free of war and violence I heard my colleagues check this rule and this unnecessary bill

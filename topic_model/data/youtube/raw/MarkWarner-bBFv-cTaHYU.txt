hello I'm Senator Mark Warner and I want to express my appreciation in the appreciation of all Virginians to our men and women who have served our nation both currently and as veterans Virginia's bust has as many military installations as we do and with close to 800,000 veterans we have the highest concentration of folks who served in our military than any other state in the country there's a lot that needs to still remain to be done both in terms of care for our veterans in those coming home and those who served in World War two and in Vietnam and in the Korean War I look forward to continuing to work on those issues as we also wrestle with the enormous issues around the debt and deficit which is where I particularly been trying to play time and attention I wanted to take this moment though as we get close to Friday and veterans day just to salute again all of those of you who served as a son of a world war two Marine who served on Iwo Jima I whenever I talk to my dad I he reminds me of the kind of service that he and so many of you who have provided to keep me my family and our country safe thank you and God bless you

more now on the double vote claims in georgia kentucky senator rand paul joins us he sits on the homeland security committee which will soon hold a hearing on voting irregularities i believe that's coming up at 10 a.m eastern time this morning senator thank you and great to have you here this morning so what does all of this mean for the integrity of those georgia runoffs knowing that so much is at stake with with this upcoming election well you'd think that all of this would be investigated and try to be fixed before the election so if you have 1700 people that voted twice you would think that maybe they need to be charged and maybe not allowed to vote in the next election or at least one of their votes canceled out you would think that people who voted illegally from commercial addresses would be purged from the rolls you'd think that they would check the death file and purge those who had died to make sure that they don't vote i mean we're going to hear testimony this morning from nevada where 1500 people were deceased and should not have voted 4 000 people were illegal aliens and fifteen thousand people voted from commercial addresses and you have to vote from senator what are we doing about it well here's the problem courts aren't very good at doing this they just are very reticent to get involved and so far the court has turned down all of these uh appeals to to look at the facts no court has examined the facts and this is sort of historically true courts don't like to do this but even worse than this is it's sort of obama rahm emanuel's playbook they took the crisis of covid and then they changed election law but they changed election law not by changing the law at the state legislature they had secretaries of state and or governors simply by fiat change the law to say oh you can keep counting votes when the law didn't say that so this election really was stolen in a way and it was stolen because what happened is people changed the law how can you change the law without asking the state legislature to do this and i'm disappointed that the courts haven't heard it really interesting we'll follow what comes uh from the 10 a.m gathering where i know that that is going to be discussed senator meanwhile we just topped our hour with two big stories that are seemingly ignored by the mainstream media and that is eric swalwell and hunter biden in the case of hunter biden the ap is reporting this morning that president trump may be considering pushing for a special counsel to investigate hunter biden and his overseas business dealings and specifically taxes paid on some of his income where does this go next what do you want to see happen senator you know the committee that i'm on that will meet in a couple of minutes on electoral fraud we also investigated hunter biden and we submitted a report and i sent the report to the department of justice a month month and a half ago asking for a criminal investigation so i'm glad that it has commenced and i think the only way we can be assured that it won't be swept under the rug is the u.s attorney in delaware who's doing the investigation should not be fired by biden this is going to be a very important thing we're going to find out the first week in the biden administration is he going to fire the prosecutor that is investigating his son or will he let him stay on historically the u.s attorneys are all let go from one administration to the next but i think in this case it will be a show a great deal of bias on biden's part if he fires the prosecutor that's looking into his son real quick because i want to ask you about eric swallow but but what would your expectation be on that considering we've already seen how the president-elect has ignored questions from the media and by by media i i mean simply one of our reporters here from fox news channel asking really important questions about his overseas business dealings in that tax probe i think he's also been dishonest with us when he says he knew nothing of his son's overseas activities i mean we now have emails with hunter biden saying hey make sure you get a key for my dad my mom my uncle and this chinese national that i'm involved with that gave me a 2.8 carat time and uh uncut diamond or whatever so there are a lot of things that we should be allowed to ask the president but a lot of the media is not asking these questions it's really important final thought on eric swawwell now a growing call from many republicans who believe he should be removed from the house intelligence committee till they get more answers on his involvement with that suspected chinese spy and whether or not he's compromised yeah i think to be careful and to cautious he should actually resign from the intelligence committee if he's not willing to do that he should be removed from the intelligence committee but i also think that what hypocrisy this is a guy that was hurling stones and accusations all kinds of false accusations that president trump oh he's controlled by spies and this and that he was the most over-the-top critic of president trump on russia collusion and it turns out he's sleeping with a chinese by i mean my goodness the hypocrisy it's appalling and he really should be red-faced and ashamed of himself and really probably ought to just resign from congress we'll have a lot more on that coming up senator really appreciate your time this morning thank you thank you

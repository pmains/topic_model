New York Republican congressman lead Zeldin with us how are you surprised by the outcry of the president's getting on this I'm not surprised by anything anymore quite honestly Neela you know and with regards to this the the fact is when the president was staying there with Vladimir Putin it is important to stand with our Intel community and to send a strong message to Putin in the rest of the world to stay thousands of miles away from American elections as far as the people who are going so far as to immediately react by you know a John Brennan the high crimes and misdemeanors and the president should be brought up for treason and some of the hysteria that I've seen beyond that that also has been a bit much but at that press conference and at the meeting I would say it's really important to stand a hundred percent shoulder to shoulder with our own Intel community or a law enforcement community but even he didn't do that at all no that's my point yeah yeah so you wish he wouldn't ya know that that's very important that that moment I think that is why people are upset who are even strong supporters of President Trump and that's why and there's been a lot of focus on you know the question and answer part what what is unfortunate is that there were a whole lot of other topics that were brought up at the meeting they were also brought up at the press conference that we're not talking about that this is overshadowed but you know for there to be a dialogue as it relates to Syria North Korea nuclear proliferation the New START treaty scheduled to expire the counter-terror mission all of that there needs to be a dialogue with this other nation which we happen to have the two largest nuclear arsenals as you know in the entire world by far so having dialogue is key having you know pursuing progress is key and unfortunately all of that has been overshadowed with the important point that we must make a stronger send a stronger message to Vladimir Putin the rest of the world not to ever mess around with American elections alright but if he were to make such a comment now and he's going to be you know thousands of miles from Vladimir Putin when he does isn't Lattimer Putin gonna scratch his head and say well where was this tough guy yesterday no III don't I don't think that the president needs to be contradicting himself in well if he did was recommended he would be contraband goods yet and I think that it's going to be important for the president to not to stand shoulder to shoulder with our Intel communities and to send that message now the president has a style Friend or Foe when he is at the lectern standing next to them after these bilateral and and larger meetings he doesn't spend that time punching the person next to him in the face that's just his his style but that obviously comes back in you know and that bit him as it relates to the interaction with what do you think of that style though I mean it's one thing to say and carp about someone you know behind their back or when you're not with them then when you're with them you're very different I guess it's human nature at all but I don't know then the real Donald Trump well I also don't know what was said between the two behind closed doors fair enough me I can't I I wish I'd be able to tell you whether or not behind closed doors he was softer than what we saw at the press conference I wish I would know what would be able to know whether whether he was tougher behind closed doors all right we're gonna say goodbye to you're never gonna trash you when we go to a commercial break are you okay with that no absolutely not no just just joking congressman thank you very very much very good

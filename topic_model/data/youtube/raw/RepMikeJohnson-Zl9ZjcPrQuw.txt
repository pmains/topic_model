S LEGISLATION FOR THREE MINUTES. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE GENTLEMAN FROM LOUISIANA IS RECOGNIZED FOR THREE MINUTES. MR. JOHNSON: I RISE TODAY TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF MY COMMONSENSE LEGISLATION AND I AM PROUD THAT THIS BILL HAS BEEN INCLUDED AMONG OUR VERY FIRST SET OF BILLS THAT WILL PASS. FOR CHAIRMAN NADLER OR RANKING MEMBER NADLER TO SUGGEST THAT THIS DOES NOT FULFILL THE WILL OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IS ABSURD. THIS RESOLUTION IS SIMPLE AND LANGUAGE IS CLEAR AND CONDEMNS THE ATTACKS THAT HAVE BEEN COMMITTED AGAINST PRO-LIFE CENTERS AND CHURCHES IN THE WAKE OF THE LEAKED DOBBS' DECISION AND TAKE ACTION TO BRING THE PERPETRATORS TO JUSTICE. WHO COULD BE OPPOSED TO THAT? THERE HAVE BEEN MORE ATTACKS IN THE WAKE OF THE DOBBS' DECISION. WE HAVE SEEN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN TARGETED VIOLENCE AGAINST PLACES AND PEOPLE WHO PROVIDE CARE FOR PREGNANT WOMEN AND UNBORN CHILDREN. HERE IS A FEW OF THE MORE THAN 100 INCIDENTS. MAY 5, LAST YEAR, A CATHOLIC CHURCH AND SCHOOL IN MICHIGAN WAS VANDALIZED CALLING THE DEATH OF REPUBLICANS. MAY 26, SEVEN HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WERE SUSPENDED AFTER PHYSICALLY ASSAULTED. A PRO-ABORTION EXTREMIST WAS CHARGED WITH ATTEMPTED MURDER. JULY 7, SAN FRANCISCO, A PREGNANCY CARE CENTER WAS THREATENED. A VOLUNTEER WAS SHOT CANVASSING DOOR TO DOOR. JANUARY OF THIS YEAR, SEVERAL DAYS AGO, A PRO-LIFE BILLBOARD WAS DEFACED WITH THE WORDS KILL THEM KIDS. THIS LAST ONE IS PERSONAL, ON JULY 11, PRO-ABORTION ACTIVE IFORTS SPRAY PAINTED ANT LIFE MESSAGES ON THE WALLS. THIS CLINIC HAS OFFERED HOPE TO COUNTLESS PREGNANT WOMEN BY COUNSELING THEM ON ALL OF THEIR OPTIONS AND NOT PUSHING THEM TO ABORT AS THE CLINICS DO. I AM PROUD TO CALL A AND STAND AGAINST VIOLENCE AND VANDALISM AND THREATS OF INTIMIDATION. NATIONWIDE, THEY SERVE MILLIONS OF WOMEN EVERY YEAR AND OVER 10,000 MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS SUPPORTING THEM AND DO NOT DESERVE THE TREATMENT THEY ENDURED AND DESERVE THAT THIS CONGRESS CONDEMN THE VIOLENCE COMMITTED AGAINST THEM. THERE HAS BEEN SO LITTLE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE LEAKED DOBBS' DECISION, WE ARE MAKING THE POSITION OF CONGRESS CLEAR TODAY. WE CONDEMN VIOLENCE, PROPERTY DAMAGE, THREATS AND INTIMIDATION TACTICS AND THESE VIOLATIONS MUST BE PROSECUTED. WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY BEFORE US TO START TO PUSH BACK AGAINST THE MOB THAT TARGET GROUPS THAT PROTECT WOMEN. I THINK 130 REPUBLICANS HAVE CO-SPONSORED THIS. IT WILL PASS AND SHOULD AND WILL BE A SHAME IF OUR DEMOCRAT COLLEAGUES DO NOT JOIN US. THE QUESTION IS, WIL

general in your testimony and throughout your statement i'm sorry general mckenzie uh in your written testimony uh here today and and um throughout the questioning you've made it clear that you consider iran to be the biggest threat to stability in the centcom aor during my travels throughout the region and most recently in israel two weeks ago the recurring theme is the malign influence of iran's proxies you also spoke those in your in your testimony do you consider the irgc to be one of the drivers and facilitators of these proxies the irgc and its elite element the goods force absolutely at the very heart of these activities okay sir um it's been reported and as recently as yesterday in the press that the bond administration is considering de-listing the irgc as a terror organization i know that decision involves a lot of factors that are beyond your lane but but strictly on your military advice do you think that would be a good idea i'll have to i'll i'll defer on that one i would not uh i think they certainly are very disruptive and dangerous in the region that remains my best military advice and we should treat them like that and if they are emboldened or strengthened uh do you think that would make them a more formidable i think anything you do to embolden or strengthen them would have a negative effect across the region sir okay echoing uh some of my other colleagues here with respect to israel people we met with there were crystal clear that historically whether it's been cash payments from the obama administration or any activities that lead to putting money in the coffers of iran there's a direct correlation to the pace of intensity of attacks when that money flows in there is it your opinion that buying iranian oil and lessening sanction on iran would lead to an increase in irgc activity i think any i i think the iranian economy as a whole is penetrated thoroughly by the irgc so it's hard to it's hard to see where money flows inside the arena iranian economy and how much of it is used for legitimate reasons and how much of it is used for illegitimate reasons thank you mr chairman and i i had a couple more questions that i didn't quite get to before and again back to general mackenzie as chairman smith had noted iranian terror activity has been significant whether there's a jcpoa in place or not i understand that whether it's hezbollah in lebanon hamas and gaza the houthis in yemen the codes forces in iraq the common denominator is the neighborhood bully and i hate to use that expression because it's obviously a lot more significant than that but they're the bad guys they're the bad actor in the neighborhood they're the ones that want to destabilize everything um i hate to ask this ques i wouldn't normally ask this question but because i understand your place to provide advice and counsel to the administration but based on the way things unfold in afghanistan and knowing now the questions we were asking and we're getting answers to before things are coming out that there was a lot of advice provided by the pentagon that was not heeded by the administration so before we get this this treaty that the administration seems really bent on getting back into into place i think it's really essential that the details are discussed um has the white house engaged you for your regional security expertise in the negotiation process of this iran deal so i might the person i engage with is the secretary of defense and policy okay and we have a constant dialogue with the secretary and all issues within the centcom aor and i understand the secretary's got a lot on his plate but where he's getting his primary source of the boots on the ground feedback is going to be from you i think he gets it from me i think he gets it from policy you know a variety of sources okay so my concern is what we're seeing on the press out there in the press of what may be coming out delisting irgc buying iranian oil those from what you've told us here would not be in alignment with your advice on what's best from a military perspective and i don't i don't expect you to comment on that but it's either that or they're not asking for your advice at all and i find either of those to be very concerning and we're going to watch very closely on how this treaty develops but uh i thank you all and um i would i i'm assuming that this will be the last time the two of you testified before us but i want to thank you as a former military member for your decades of service it's a lot of hard work and not very gratifying a lot of times but your nation appreciates your work and i yield back

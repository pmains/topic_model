I think the Chairman let me also thank chair actually this entire committee but particularly mr. Lungren for his hard work on this bill he and I both served on the speaker's task force for cybersecurity while this may not be perfect I think it's a very good step forward and i look forward to moving this bill to the house for this amendment is similar to the file of the amendment although i have directed staff to make small technical change the first paragraph should reference subparagraph b rather than a and i've added the term for cyber security purposes to the first paragraph as that is but what this language is for and i believe it should be made clear in the language that this is using cyber security technology for cyber security purposes finally I've added a definition for the term countermeasures to be sure there's no confusion as to what is authorized by this language again thank you mr. chairman for the opportunity offer this amendment as you know it is critical that any cybersecurity legislation include explicit authority for the deployment deployment of consolidated intrusion detection prevention and other similar capabilities to protect federal civilian agencies it is also crucial to add legal clarity around the ability of the federal government to deploy such capabilities this very targeted Amendment allows the government to make the most efficient use possible of cybersecurity technology in accordance with the comprehensive national cybersecurity initiative began under the Bush administration and continued today DHS has been working to deploy the Einstein intrusion detection and Prevention capabilities the Einstein system supplements agency's own defense capabilities by detecting and blocking malicious actors from accessing federal agency systems the system's capabilities are part a key part of the federal government's strategy to protect federal agencies from a range of cybersecurity threats including sophisticated enemies unfortunately deploying Einstein to two agencies has frequently been slowed due to the need for lengthy and cumbersome legal reviews and interagency agreements there are still agencies that have not fully deployed the system due only to the uncertainty in the current law agencies very much want to add these protective capabilities to secure their otherwise vulnerable systems but unfortunately they are stymied by uncertainty and bureaucratic negotiation as DHS prepares to begin deployment of the next generation a protective capabilities known as Einstein 3 it is critical legal uncertainty not delay delivery of advanced capability to agencies my amendment resolves the issues by clarifying the Secretary's Authority to obtain use and disclose agency communications and other system traffic for the limited purpose of protecting agency systems this legislation also contains strong privacy and civil liberties provisions to protect the rights of federal employees and other users of federal systems particular protections include the creation of Attorney General approved policies and procedures to govern DHS activities very specific and restricted requirements regarding the collection retention use and disclosure of information obtained by DHS and a certification requirement by DHS it's important to note that this amendment and this legislation was drafted in close coordination with the Department of Justice and DHS and will follow federal agencies will allow federal agencies to more easily gain the cyber security protection they need for malicious and actors and with that mr. Chairman I yield back the gentleman from Texas yields back is there any further discussion of the amendment chairman gentlelady from Texas Chairman I have an amendment to the mccall amendment at the dance and I'm offering that amendment at this time clerk will read the amendment the amendment amendment to mccall 001 offer by Miss Jackson Lee without objection the gentleman I reserve a point of order against a member and could we have a written copy the moment someone reserves a point of order general generally from Texas my good friend from Texas and I've had long discussions I know of his work and I certainly appreciate it I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment be dispensed with objection the issue is for us to see this as both securing America but as well reinforcing the importance of homeland security in the issue of cybersecurity thing mr. Lungren said that I know the ranking member has said that over and over again and administration agrees and chairman King I think by this markup today you agree of our importance in this issue so my good friend is offered an amendment that would vest great new authority in the Department of Homeland Security to acquire intercept retain use and disclose communications and records that are transiting to or from or stored on federal systems that is a reaffirmation of the importance of why we even created the Homeland Security Department but we've also noted that a large percentage of the cyber security system is in the private sector but that the federal system should also have a short up process of protection and the ability to ensure our the integrity of a cyber security system while it makes sense the DHS have authority to be aware of cyber threats it is important that there are safeguards in place to make sure that the privacy rights of federal employees or Americans will use federal websites are not violated we have often heard though it has not been in the context of terrorism the enormous faulting of privacy issues dealing with veterans at the Veterans Administration while the Makah language does seem to track somewhat with language proposed by the administration in may 2011 it leaves out to vary important limitations on this broad grant of new authority that are critical to protecting privacy first it leaves out the Pacific requirement that DHS must certify that any monitoring by only the only of federal systems this is critical because the legal underpinning of this whole warrantless wiretapping program is that it is limited to government networks and those who use the networks have consented to the monitoring second it does not require pacific guidelines to be written to minimize a collection of sensitive and personal information not impacting the national security of this nation nor require that information be deleted if a porn review it is found to have no relevance to the cybersecurity purpose my colleagues I'd only argue that this is a bipartisan amendment in terms of the underpinnings that does not limit mr. McCall's intent in fact I believe that it enhances our work and our authority as both the Homeland Security Department and the Oversight Committee believe me I am a champion of the responsibilities or the authority of this committee in terms of national security these missing components make them a call amendment substantially different from the previously agreed language and jeopardizes of privacy if mr. McCall amendment is enacted without my second-degree amendment it would it would mean that in addition to monitoring the communications of all federal employees DHS would be able to monitor communications from average Americans non-threatening Americans when they visit government websites are communicating with the government maybe we're talking about those who are engaging in inquiries dealing with health and human services private issues dealing with Medicare and Medicaid or other issues are that they are seeking information about Social Security I believe that DHS hand must be strengthened to help protect federal networks and that new authorities must be granted to department to the department to do suggest that but coupled with any new authority there must be safeguards for the people that spend long stretches of their days working and playing on the internet or urge a yes vote on my second-degree amendment mr. McCall of course has long years as a US Attorney I served as an investigatory attorney on the investigation of the assassinations of Martin's the King president john f kennedy no i was not on the warren committee but the subsequent congressional committee that was in place was at that time we were dealing with FBI taps we had no concept of this but I can assure you having experienced such processes as COINTELPRO and seeing what we can do I know that there is a balance of securing information on behalf of the government and I know there's a limit to protect America's privacy you go back into the history books of COINTELPRO you would understand the basis of this amendment as well as going forward to ensure minimal privacy but also the integrity of the DHS mr. McCall's amendment I asked for bipartisan support on the Jackson Lee a secondary amendment to mr. McCall's Amendment Chairman I yield back general a deal's back mr. chairman John from California mr. chairman them in my five minutes I would like to ask the gentleman from Texas first of all whether or not this language was the product of his work with the Justice Department and department of homeland security of this administration yeah I think it's important to note and I appreciate the gentlelady's comments but having said that this applies to federal government networks only does not apply to the private sector for cyber security purposes only has nothing to do with wiretaps i'm not sure where that's all coming in and in fact this amendment was crafted in close coordination with this administration with the Department of Justice with the Department of Homeland Security and I find it odd on supporting an amendment that was crafted in close coordination with this administration yet we're finding objection to it on the other side of the aisle with that I yield back to the heaven and my understanding is this allows agencies to implement the Einstein program which already exists a number of government agencies the purpose of which is detect illegal intrusions into government computer networks in other words if someone is attempting to make an intrusion and capture the program or put malware on or somehow go I in Stein is supposed to detect that is that correct that is correct in this amendment simply gives legal authorization to the Einstein program and the Einstein program exists in a number of different agency I think we've had hearings in which we've asked why the Einstein program has not been implemented in some of the government agencies have we not we have and again this will advance that effort in fact as I recall we've even criticized the fact that there's been a slow implementation and one of the answers that's come back to us is that it takes illegal negotiations between the I guess DHS because they're the operator the program and the government agencies and that that has slowed it up and as my understanding that's what your amendment attempts to try and deal with is that right and precisely the bureaucratic negotiations have slowed down the process this gives legal authority it will move it forward to hardened federal networks from intrusions which happened every day against the federal government this has nothing to do with any offensive program by the federal government to go out and go into private networks for information that rather is a protection about intrusion into already existing government networks not private net where the gentleman is correct okay I thank the gentleman I yield back show me his back let's tear further discussion on Jackson Lee Amendment gentleman from Mississippi is recognized yes I think one of the things we we're concerned about is while we agree about the federal system but I we don't have within this amendment the motion the the ridden authorities that DHS should do it and what they need to come with I think just giving them the blanket authority out the direction I think some of us are concerned about we agree with the federal system but it leaves out the specific requirement that they must certify their monitoring so in other words this this reach that government is doing I think you need to certify whatever they going to do well the gentleman yield on that point yes because this amendment as I point in my statement does have a certification requirement by the Department of Homeland Security and and again this was a draft in a way to give DHS flexibility and it was drafted in close coordination with this administration both the Department of Justice in Department of Homeland Security there is a certification requirement in this well legislation and I got good oh well thank you I think there's some question about it as we read it we're not able to to get that but I appreciate the gentleman's clarifying that issue there's another point that it does not require specific guidelines be written to minimize the collection of sensitive and personal information nor require that the information be deleted upon review so some of this information that's collected we don't have any direction as to what they do with it should they not agree that it's is usable I think if you could help us craft something that we could assure that we'd be all right okay I think this gives again greater flexibility to the department are you buddy how you and I apologize will the children yield that all right this does not apply to the private sector it only applies to federal government networks for cyber security purposes only and we made that point i'd be happy to work with the ranking member at a later date but I do intend to offer this amendment I yield back ranking member yields back training further discussion mr. chairman generation New York yes I'd like to yield some time to miss Jackson Lee the author of this secondary amendment I thank the gentlelady from New York ranking member of the cyber security committee and let me let me just clarify and just call it look forward to what may ultimately be a continuing discussion but let me be very clear mr. Lungren was making a series of inquiries that this is a Amendment Oh mr. McLeod's amendment is dealing with the federal system which I'm very clear of and recognize that it's not dealing with the private system and my amendment is very clear it says the encounters of Americans the federal system inquiring are seeking information any of us who have constituency services recognize that we are seeking information private information everyone knows that they have constituents I do in my office sign privacy forms allows us to seek information from their veterans files their social security files their Medicare files so the question that I am that we are suggesting here is the privacy necessary to protect those that are using the federal system we're not talking about having this apply to the private sector secondarily I respect the fact that mr. McCall worked with the Department of Justice and Homeland Security it is a responsibility of this committee to markup a bill and the language does not tie to the original administration language on privacy and there are only two Pacific points which is to ensure the protection against getting information that is not relevant to what you have sought to gather and I think it is a complementary amendment to mr. McCall's amendment and if the ANC's is that we have just sive this language then we have also just received as mr. Lungren has indicated a totally new bill that is not the bill that was passed by the Subcommittee on cybersecurity but as mr. Lungren is offered to say we're doing our job here and i believe the job is to secure this nation to secure the system of the federal government but it is also to respect the millions of Americans who use this system and not to line up material that is not my final point is mr. McCall in in citing COINTELPRO no I was not suggesting the Equality of your amendment with COINTELPRO what I was suggesting in a metaphoric an analytical way is that the COINTELPRO of decades ago could be compared to where we are today in the life that we live then and as a council for the select committee on assassinations reviewing COINTELPRO it was as frightening then about intrusion and getting information on civil rights leaders that was not relevant to what the FBI was trying to secure I was only using that again as an anecdotal story to say that we always must put in the parameters around our work we now live in a different life terrorism protecting the cyber security or and I think that this simple process and maybe we'll have an opportunity to work together it is simple amendment later you'll be happy to yield to this let me just say that this amendment does provide privacy protections which was the very concern that you're talking about this really deals with advancing the Einstein program which has been implemented since the last administration is supported by this administration it hardens the federal networks which are attacked every day enormous amount amounts of data are being stolen primarily from well-kept trees I won't mention but enormous amounts of data have been stolen in the past several years including from the Pentagon well we claim it and so what this is hard in the network's know me just say late the Jays offer this amendment at the very hladik you're on my time so I'm trying to reclaim it and I'm gonna ask more time for me alright if you if you will and go at it generally to be claims the time it first let me just say that your amendment leaves out the Pacific requirement that DHS must certify that any monitoring be only of federal systems and second it does not require specific guidelines and that's what we're saying written guidelines to minimize the collection of sensitive and personal information nor require that information be deleted if a pawn review it is found to have no relevance to cybersecurity purpose I know I don't want to put words in dr. Brown's mouth but I know that many people from both sides of the aisle have a privacy concern no matter what we're doing and I'm just saying that this is too simple points it does not take away mr. McCall from your Amendment I'd ask my colleagues to support the amendment I thank the gentlelady for yielding to but I want to make sure that that it was clear that I was not talking about the private system and second I wanted to be clear that I understand the difference between wiretap having been a lawyer dealing with investigatory matters for the House of Representatives as a young staff or some few years ago younger than I may be today let me yield back to the distinguished chairman and ranking member and thank you for the time i asked the support of the Jackson Lee amendment gentlelady from Texas for the gentlelady from New York yields back and as chairman gentleman from Georgia I yield to mr. McComb I thank the gentleman from Georgia Umi just read two provisions in this amendment the in my amendment the content of communications will be collected and retained only when the communication is associated with a known or reasonably suspected cybersecurity threat and communications and system traffic will not be subject to the operation of a countermeasure unless associated with such threats and finally says information obtained pursuant to activities authorized under this subsection will only be retained used or disclosed to protect federal systems from cyber security threats mitigate against such threats or the approval the Attorney General for law enforcement purposes when the information is evidence of a crime which has been or as being are about to be committed I I don't know how anybody could be opposed to that language but let me just say this as a matter of fairness I object to the gentlelady's amendment I intend to offer this amendment given the timing of the gentlelady's amendment I would like to offer to work with her in terms of that there's some way we can come to some sort of agreement or compromise before this bill goes to the floor and with that mr. Chairman I yield bag now you let mr. Brown gentle from Georgia yields back there any further discussion on the Jackson Lee amendment to the amendment okay if there's no further discussion the question is on agreeing to the amendment to the amendment offered by mr. Jackson Lee of Texas all those in favor signify by saying aye aye all those opposed signify by saying no no how the penny of the chair the noes have it and the amendment to the amendment is not agreed to no not now proceed with discussion on the mccole amendment is there any further discussion on agreeing to the amendment off by mr. McCall if there is not questions on agreeing to the amendment all those in favor signify by saying aye aye opposed he'd share the eyes have us the amendment is agreed to

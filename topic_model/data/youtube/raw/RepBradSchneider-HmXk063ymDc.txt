Mr. Speaker,
I rise today, joining families and friends in Santa Fe, Texas grieving for another ten
lives, tragically cut short by senseless gun violence. Yesterday, this body held the now routine
moment of silence in respect for the victims. Just as we did after the Waffle House shooting
in Nashville; Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland; First Baptist Church in
Sutherland Springs; Route 91 Harvest Music Festival in Las Vegas; and the list goes on
and on and on. Forty-six times this chamber stood to remember
the victims. And every single time, Congressional obstruction
has stood in the way of doing anything concrete to change this deadly pattern. We haven’t considered universal background
checks, or bans on the sale of assault weapons, or gun violence restraining orders to keep
firearms out of the hands of the mentally-ill, or even, for goodness sake, bump stocks. I sit on the Judiciary Committee – we haven’t
held even a single hearing about reducing gun violence and working to keep our children
safe. We can’t prevent every tragedy, but there
are actions we can take—right now—today—to save lives. We have that power. I urge my colleagues to find the courage to
act. Our kids are counting on us.

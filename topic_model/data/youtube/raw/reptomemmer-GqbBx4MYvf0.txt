a special guest in the studio today is congressman tom emmer who was sworn in for his first term in the united states house of representatives on january 6 2015 is currently serving his fourth term he's also chairman of the national republican uh congressional committee for the 117th congress he currently sits on the house financial services committee he's also a member of the republican deputy whip team and the house republican steering committee congressman ember welcome back to minnesota military radio as always tom it's great to be back and more importantly it's great to uh see an old friend it's good glad you're still doing the show well 12 years later tom we're still here even though you but you did sit in that chair for a couple of years way back when i did so it should feel pretty comfortable being then being back in the studio again uh and we appreciate you stopping in um this has been a crazy time the last couple of years we've had the worldwide pandemic now we've got a war between russia and ukraine there's all kinds of things happened and and through it all you were out in the out in the congress fighting the good fight what was it like out there through all of these troubles you know it's a it's been an interesting time as you say it and i think you got a choice uh as human beings we all have a choice we can either look at it uh from the standpoint or the perspective that the glass is half empty or we can look at it from a standpoint that the glass is half full and for me the challenges are enormous uh we we got to start getting along again we got to start talking to one another again we got to start recognizing that uh we are not enemies we are friends who have different perspectives but we all basically want the same things in this country and i i see hope tom so you're asking me how it's been it has not been good uh the the challenges the the vitriol amongst party amongst people uh here at home back in washington dc uh at times it's been uh very difficult right people take their politics into a very aggressive form nowadays but there's some signs over the last month or two despite the uh what i believe is a tragedy in ukraine uh despite that despite other challenges around the globe i have hope i think as we're moving forward i you can't stop the clock it's going to continue to move i we hopefully have hit that bottom where you know we all have to start looking at ourselves in the mirror and then looking at each other and saying we're the solution together uh so i i have good uh i see good things coming but if i didn't i wouldn't be in washington tom i certainly hope you're right and i recall from one of your previous visits here that even though the it seems like the press picks up on all the fighting and all the arguments and all the disagreements but you've told me in the past when it comes to certain issues like veterans issues that both parties reach across the aisle and and they try to do what's right and and work together to to do some things are you seeing that still yeah most of the time there is no aisle when it comes to uh issues that affect our military men and women our veterans those that have not only made the sacrifice but the families who have experienced the ultimate sacrifice right no i i think that has not changed in fact that i believe is getting stronger and if you want me to complain about anybody i'll complain about our press but we can do that some other time you know they're selling papers so they want a it's you know we're from minnesota uh nobody in minnesota likes conflict but boy they sure like to peek at it when it happens and i think uh that's kind of the way our papers do it they're looking for the stories that show the most conflicts show the most disagreement uh when in fact you know what the minnesota delegation as an example in washington d.c is probably one of the most cohesive uh working groups that there is in washington dc and especially on issues like the ones we're going to talk about today we're speaking with congressman tom emmer on minnesota military radio congressman i would think that if our elected officials can work together on veterans issues maybe they can find a way to work together on some other issues and and i know when you mention the minnesota elected officials there are things that come up such as the uh c-130s from the 133rd airlift wing and i'm sure you've been involved in some of those discussions as well well we all got together on that last year they were going to try and shrink that that group here in uh in at the air air wing in st paul and this is really important for tactical deployment of uh not only equipment but personnel right uh so the entire delegation got together i authored a letter but it was more than that right putting your name on a piece of paper is important but all of us advocating together that that was a bad decision it actually made a difference they decided not to reduce it instead that went to a different state in a different uh air wing which i think it's a great example of when minnesotans regardless of their political perspective get together to get something done it can happen they all pull together and you all have your sphere of influences and you can bring other forces to bear and it's it's great to hear that those things happen when it comes to veterans issues that you've had to vote on over the last year or two are there any of them that have stood out any of them that seem more important to you well i think every one of them is important but you know before i came today because i i told you i brought some notes because there's so many things that we work on in this area and i i guess i took it from the perspective of which are the ones i'm most proud of it's the ones that we succeeded on right uh the uh colonel john m mchugh tuition fairness for survivors act which provided va education benefits including tuition housing and book stipends to children or spouses of a service member who's permanently disabled due to a service-connected disability or died while on active duty uh prior to 9 11 or who dies in service i'm sorry who dies as the result of a service-connected disability their survivors can get these benefits and that actually passed the house and the senate and became law another one was the protecting moms uh who served act which requires the va to improve their coordination of maternity care another example of a bill that passed both the house the senate by the way with democrats and republicans and crossed the president's desk and became law there's another one that you and i talked about very briefly before the show started the patient advocate tracker act which has already passed the house this would allow veterans to better track any complaints they have that they filed against the va to make sure that those complaints are being i processed and addressed right i that has passed the house but uh and i know be from our discussion but i also know beforehand that senator klobuchar believes it's going to pass the senate and tom when it does that's another one that will become law i'm proud of all of those and so much more keep in mind we have an incredible team of caseworkers on staff that help dozens of veterans every month to obtain benefits uh obtain records and whatever support might be available to them and i hope people utilize not only our office but the other congressional offices in this state as well so our for our veterans here in minnesota's sixth district which is your district if they've got some issues and they need some help you've got people on staff that are that are and know how to get that help and know how to give the help and do things to take care of our veterans yeah i'm proud of the work that we do alejandra and barb and everybody who's in that office they have a wealth of experience again we're lucky in minnesota because we have all of our congressional offices i believe have some pretty solid staff but i'm really proud of our people they they show up every day and any service member who's got an issue in minnesota's sixth congressional district should contact us if if they think we can help very good sir tom we're going to have to take a short break when we come back we're going to speak more with congressman tom emmer from minnesota's 6th district on minnesota military radio please stay with us we'll be right back welcome back to minnesota military radio i'm your host tom lyons we've been speaking with congressman tom emmer who was sworn in to his first term in the united states house representatives on january 6 2015 currently serving his fourth term in the sixth district of minnesota and tom's sixth district that covers quite a bit of the kind of the west side of the twin cities can you can you describe it for our listeners yeah today and this will change effective january 1st of next year because of the redistricting that we just went through but today the the sixth district of minnesota includes the northern half of washington county about 90 to 95 percent of anoka county uh it includes all of sherburne county it includes saint cloud or stearns county out to the eastern border of paynesville it includes all of wright county and it includes the western half of carver what will change as we go into the next congress is the sixth district will now going from west back to east i just did east to west it will include all of carver it will still include all of wright county and all of sherburne and i'm sorry i left out benton it includes benton uh but then saint the stearns county will push all the way in from the west to just the west side of sartell so we'll have the bulk of the population from stearns county but most of that rural minnesota part of that county is going into the seventh district and then as you go across it'll have anoka county still but interesting they carved out just the city of anoka why i'm not sure but just the city of anoka has been put into uh the third district which is currently dean phillips and then the uh northern half of washington county will go into uh minnesota's eighth congressional district which is pete stauber so ours will now no longer go all the way to the wisconsin border it will stop uh with anoka county but in that district that you just described there's some great folks live out that way oh i i'm telling you there's great folks all across minnesota but the uh the two i do find it interesting that we took uh that our supreme court or our court that did the redistricting took just the city of anoka and put it in the third because it doesn't seem to fit there uh and that's great we'll continue to do work for uh the folks in anoka and i'm sure uh the current representative in the third will will do good work uh assuming he's there starting the next congress the one that's interesting to me is think about minnesota's eighth congressional district now represented by pete stauber out of herbentown minnesota it's now about five to six hours of a drive from the north half of washington county all the way to the angle in minnesota the northern angle all right tom we're getting close to violating that first rule no politics here but oh i'm sorry i was just doing geography yeah geography we're good but within the the territory and all the people you take care of we're lucky here in minnesota to have a couple of really great va medical centers in the twin cities and in saint cloud compared to the rest of the country that a lot of folks like down in arizona they're having a terrible time no i i'm i'm very fortunate and privileged honored to be able to represent one of those uh two vas that we're talking about obviously the minneapolis va has a phenomenal reputation it's a wonderful uh a resource and institution that provides uh so many things to our veterans here in minnesota and beyond i would argue but saint cloud is right there with it and saint cloud is uh you know obviously i've gotten intimately familiar with saint cloud over the last almost decade of serving the people in the district uh we are very fortunate i think uh i won't try to improve on your words we're really fortunate to have not just one great uh va in the state but two and then all the related entities that uh that spin off of that and of course the dav in minnesota has got about 40 vans out there helping those veterans get to their medical appointments and minnesota is way ahead i think of the rest of the station our states and taking care of our veterans and getting their medical appointments and and uh just looking out for them so that's gotta make you feel good as a as an elected official out in congress that dates all the way back to my short time in the minnesota state legislature i think elected officials in this state because remember a lot of uh elected officials one of my great colleagues who's retiring is bob detmer out of the forest lake area bob brought his experience his decades of military experience with him to the legislature which helped a lot of us that didn't have that background understand issues specific to those veterans and their families and i think i think you're right i think minnesota has always been ahead of the curve but we're still getting better and in the second half of the show we're going to talk about the veterans omnibus bill that the state legislature passed this year first time ever i think tom we're speaking with congressman tom emmer on minnesota military radio congressman i understand you're a member of the national guard caucus can you tell us what that's about and and what you do there well the our national guardsmen and women not only defend our freedom tom as you know but they also serve as an important connection between our communities and the armed services right our communities in general i we were talking about a couple of kids who are close to me who i know their future probably will involve transitioning from active duty service right into a national guard position where they will continue to serve not only the state of minnesota but beyond and at the same time be embedded in our communities i so the national guard uh pretty pretty important not just to our country not just to our state but our local communities and uh you and i just talked about one i mean i could be talking about uh our folks up in saint cloud but very quickly we'll talk about the 133rd because that was something that the uh the national guard caucus was involved in not only the uh the minnesota delegation but in trying to advocate so they did not reduce the uh the uh c-130s uh that we had at the uh at the air wing in st paul that's some of the things that this caucus gets involved in to try and make sure that our those that are our military decision makers in washington dc have the full benefit of our experience from the local communities and on the ground and congressman i'm sure you're aware that our former agent general lieutenant general john jensen is now the director of the army national guard for the united states and he's out in d.c i imagine you run into him once in a while that poor guy yeah the uh we're i'm happy for him but uh you know moving out to the swamp that's uh that's pretty tall uh service uh and by the way uh kudos to him and his bride they have given above and beyond not only to our state but our country uh and we're better for knowing him i think you would agree well and i think it's it's valuable for the state of minnesota to have one of our former agent generals out there and in that position for the united states and got to be helpful for you and you've got a question once in a while let's with without getting uh overt about it let's just say it certainly is helpful serious sir it's good to have friends in high places tom tom we just got a couple of minutes left i know that you work to help veterans at every opportunity are you do you think we're doing enough are we taking care of the veterans that have been injured and and hurt while they were while they were in service are are you satisfied with what congress is doing on that on that whole sheet if i were satisfied i should retire right i i think jackie and i you my bride i when we uh we started this political thing more than a decade ago almost two decades ago i veterans were the issue it was really interesting jackie took to the veterans without getting political in a certain statewide race i was involved in more than a decade ago and we knew this was going to be our issue if we did that job and we didn't end up doing that job i did radio i ended up getting elected to congress it has been the issue since we've been in congress and it will continue to be the issue no i i think we're doing good things for our veterans tom but i don't think you can ever do enough i think uh it's up to the veterans to be telling us if they think that we're doing the job that they expect and you know god forbid that anybody like me would say well yeah i'm satisfied boy uh we're doing everything we can for you no no trick question for your time trick question yeah you know we've got about a minute left and we appreciate all the things you've done for veterans while you've been out in congress and back here in minnesota you've got a big family but you've got a couple of children that are serving now i do i was bragging about them earlier my i love them both obviously but they're uh numbers uh five and six out of seven uh joe is a just completed his third year at the naval academy uh he's on his way to uh test out that seal training in san diego in the next couple of weeks uh and then bill uh william justice because after all who could be against justice he just uh he's a marine he just got back from six months uh in okinawa and uh i'll say this because everybody who's listening to this show might appreciate this i was pepper and bill with questions last fall before he left on his deployment you know what what's it like what's the life like who are the people like what's the job like everything else bill finally stopped me looked at me and said hey dad if you have any humility at all the marines are easy [Laughter] tom we just got a few seconds left but uh i know that if you had a chance you'd be telling all of our listeners that if you're a veteran you need some help you need anything in the at congress get a hold of your office and your people will take care of them yeah remember you've got 12 customer service representatives two senators and eight members of the u.s house of representatives and tom lyon's rule no politics involved these offices are all set up to help you the veteran and his or her family you have a need you have something that comes up whether it involves the va benefits anything that you might be challenged with utilize us we're there for you we're supposed to be helping you give us a chance to do that tom thanks for serving and thanks for joining us today thank you tom as congressman tom emmer on minnesota military radio

you are presided over what is perhaps the least productive and certainly one of the least popular Congress is in history how do you feel about that well Bob we should not be judged on how many new laws we create we ought to be judged on how many laws that we repeal we are who we say we are and we plan to stick with repealing it is our obligation to go down this path it's not symbolic we're not going to give up our quest to try and replace a remove and replace Obamacare if you feel like you've seen the show before you're probably right US House Republicans tried again today to repeal President Obama's health care law but the move comes around the same time that the law also known as Obamacare is proving that it's working the fact that we are headed towards the 38th vote the rear Erie repeal Obamacare sorry say people finding time to re re re repeal we have never had a vote on the jobs act in the house House Republicans though meantime have continued to try to repeal or replace health care more than 30 times is that not the definition of always fun House Republicans have truly lost their minds this isn't what the 40th time they will do it isn't it was 38 39 40 41 Republicans in the House voting once again to repeal Obamacare i believe it's no joke the 39th attempted that what's the deal there we've got a 70 new members that not have the opportunity to vote on the president's health care law the guys who've been up here last year up here we've got we can go home and say listen we've we voted 36 different times to repeal or replace Obamacare tell me what the what the new guys are supposed to say yeah come on mom the older Congress got to vote against Obamacare why can't we have hollow partisanship what am I going to tell my friends I hate you and just like the last three dozen times the Senate won't take up this legislation and President Obama won't even consider it so we can expect more of it absolutely you're gonna see a lot more of it you

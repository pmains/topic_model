the chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas mr. Williams for five minutes Thank You mr. speaker as this president comes closer to his final year in office it is no secret that he only cares about shaping and molding his legacy when discussing the Iran deal last year his deputy national security advisor said to reporters quote this is probably the biggest thing President Obama will do in his second term on foreign pop this is health care for us four years earlier that health care or Obamacare was described our vice president's quote a big expletive deal but only time will shape this president's legacy 75 years ago Winston Churchill proclaimed that Neville Chamberlain had quote a precision of mind and an aptitude for business which raised him far above the ordinary levels of our generation and although this description is far too generous to describe our current president who has no aptitude for business mr. Chamberlain was portrayed in a very different light than he is today if he could be characterized in one word today it would be appeaser regardless of his intellect mr. Chamberlain's incorrect decision to concede to Adolf Hitler's demands for the purpose of avoiding a conflict in Europe overshadowed anything else he ever accomplished as Prime Minister Mr Speaker the Iran deal I believe as President Obama's Chamberlain moment as the associated press reported two weeks ago under this deal Iran quote will be allowed to use its own inspectors to investigate a site it has been accused of using to develop nuclear arms these reported secret deals acknowledged what many of us have known to be true and confirms that President Obama and his administration still deny that this deal is based on trust this deal is based on trusting the Iranians that they will not break their promise to build a nuclear bomb how can we trust Iran's supreme leader who chants death to America and death to Israel how can we trust a supreme leader who said this week Israel will not exist in 25 years as the former Democratic Chairman the Senate Foreign Relations Committee appropriately said this deal would be quote the equivalent of having an athlete accused of using performance-enhancing drugs submit an unsupervised urine sample any deal with must protect America's interest at home and abroad and this deal does not as israel's prime minister warned in his speech before this very chamber only a few months ago Iran's regime poses a grave threat not only real but also to the Peace of the entire world the president and his deal supporters have ignored these warnings this deal will shift the balance of power in the Middle East this deal goes against the wishes of Israel our greatest ally in the region and I challenge all of my Democratic colleagues who support this deal to come to the floor and look into the Cameron quite frankly look in the mirror so when history comes full circle the American people will know who in this body let our Neville Chamberlain give Iran the bomb despite the warnings from those within his own party and leaders of Al I nations this president has made it clear he is not concerned about the safety of Americans this president his administration has made it clear they are not concerned about Israel this president his administration has made it that well known that they are not concerned about the fate of the world and this president and his administration are only concerned with the legacy they have in the future for that reason i ask you mr. speaker is this president prepared to suffer the same legacy as Neville Chamberlain I urged President Obama and his administration to simply let their conscience be their guide and God We Trust I yield back the gentleman from Texas yields back

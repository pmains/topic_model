reiterate what I said the the onset of this so this is government shutdowns as a senator portman more eloquently explained are just simply bad for a holster reasons this ID has been kicking around for years and it has not been acted on we've certainly considered different approaches in this committee trying to get to this point we we did come up by the way with peace legislation that is an our committees jurisdiction absent the appropriation component which we've now added with the substitute amendment so I completely analysis you know with as amended this falls under primary jurisdiction of the appropriation committee but again we need to get a result and so I'm I'm trying to not again not step on anybody's toes not take over somebody some other committees jurisdiction but force the issue we've had these bills out there there's been a lot of discussions this is from my standpoint and the reason I wanted to move it in our committee is this is the first time we've really had a strong bipartisan effort in a situation where you might actually get a result and again I it is interesting that you had bipartisan support until all of a sudden we have you know different president I guess I'm not exactly sure what the dynamic is right so I would like to pass this as is out of this committee today to continue the discussion to force the issue to actually get a result and I think that's the main thing that this committee will do is we've raised the issue there's been a lot of work there's more complicating factors to this there's other ideas but I would rather get this out to force the issue to move it in the appropriation committee but show the Senate show the Congress that this desire to end government shutdowns and the harm they caused in government with federal employees and through our economy is something we all support and so this committee then would I think speak with very loud loud voice that we don't want to play politics with this this is a non partisan issue and let's move forward and let's finally pass this and let's end government Downs forever so I guess what I would ask the committee is you know no further discussion no amendments let's just pass this out of committee with bipartisan support and then let James and Maggie and and the appropriation committee take this thing up and actually get a result

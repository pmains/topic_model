thank you mr chairman and thank you to our witnesses for taking the time to be with us here this afternoon as another freshman member really one of the privileges i've had in this first term is the opportunity to get out and visit some of your sites i've spent the day out at darpa i've been at the naval research laboratory dr shuyu and i have we talked over the pentagon and heard some of your ideas there on some of the changes that we need to make in the acquisition process i walk away from each of those tours fascinated with the things we have going on but also frustrated when i hear the operators on the other end of the pipeline uh just exasperated at the time it takes to field these technologies and just the we've already been we've highlighted some of these challenges here but i want to dive into that a little bit more secretary shu should the programming or planning programming budgeting and execution resource allocation process be changed to encourage rapid innovation or agility and research absolutely so i'm all for changes in in the uh i would say the cold war ppbe process that's there right and this is dialogue i had with secretary austin a year ago he asked me the exact same question you asked namely heidi why the heck why is it i see all this innovation outside and i can't get on the inside the department so one thing i said to him sir let's just say you see some really great prototype and you want to buy a particular product did you have the foresight two years ago to put it into your palm request if you didn't guess what you have no authority so that's the problem so by the time you get the authority put it into your palm it's two to three years down the line the product that you're buying is already obsolete right right so this process absolutely has to change there's plenty of innovation on on the s t side it's the bottleneck getting into the hands of the warfighter that the ppbe process has to change to reflect the agility that's utterly needed so how do we go about doing that well i hear there's a ppbe commission that's ongoing so i do hope that they're looking this very very seriously in coming of this great idea to compress the timeline the other thing you look at china how are they able to accelerate so fast they invest heavily in their s t and r d enterprise and test enterprise right they rapidly test things out and they filled it and they go right on to the next idea test it out and field it they don't take a decade right so we can we absolutely must compress this timeline i'm i'm utterly passionate about it this is why i want to leverage the raider activity that we have ongoing to be able to take the prototypes we need test it out rapidly and push it into rapid fielding so you mentioned that you know the chinese i would say the old adage of fail quickly and you know fail forward and learn from that our system seems to have inherently built into it a fear of failure and we you're rewarded for not screwing up more than you are rewarded for success it seems like and that may be unfair but um you talked some about the raider program but um you know are there structural changes you would recommend that would allow the department's s t ecosystem to take risks better and to learn faster and fail faster and move forward i think the s and t area we do test things out and failure is okay it's like darpa right failure is absolutely expected in things that you're doing because you're pushing the edge of the envelope it has to be okay to fail but once you get into a program of record okay you have the schedule that you have laid out you have the uh unit costs that you've laid out you have the development cost that's laid out you have to predict what your maintenance and sustainment costing logistics is going to be even though the system is not even designed yet everything is baked in very conservatively and if you fail guess what you get called in to say tell me why did you fail your career is dead okay it will be more and more beating congress will slam you on the top of your head why did you fail on that program how did you screw that up so badly right the press jumps on your neck so it's a death spiral so if we want to be able to fail fast and accelerate we have to change the entire mentality you can't tell just the program manager i'm going to grade you how well you deliver cost and schedule and performance and not screw up this is how you get promoted right so incentive structure is not there okay so there's a lot of things that has to change unfortunately thank you mr chairman i yield back

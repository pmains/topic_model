you know these days uh headlines probably need to be reclassified for what they often are clickbait if you believe this one nevada's u.s representative mark amity votes against bill protecting marriage equality which is designed to make you think that he's opposed to it which there's more to the story and that's usually the case and that's why i say uh click bait you know the headlines supposed to get you to check it out but often the headline is misleading and i think that is the case here which is why we invited congressman mark amada to join us with that and all the other fun stuff going on in washington dc i see you escaped at least for the weekend huh you bet any chance you get to go home with the people who hired you is one that we're going to take dan good to have you here as always congressman uh so this bill you know repeals and replaces uh provisions that define i guess for purposes of federal law marriage between a man and a woman and and etc etc but that's a that's a pretty misleading headline tell me why you voted against the bill let's just start with that well let's start with the bill which is a misleading bill this is a this was a bill that was introduced 24 hours before we voted on it now we can't do we can't do anything for energy we can't do anything for the border we can't do anything for other parts of the economy um in 24 hours if our life depended on but here you go you skip it all on this and it's a bill that was basically a solution that didn't have a problem right this was a knee-jerk reaction to oh my god maybe the supreme court's gonna do with with same-sex marriage what it did with abortion not that they're directly related but you know it's like but then the other thing dan is the only reason you're talking to me is because the voters of nevada have said amity we're going to give you the responsibility we're going to elect you to be responsible for representing us you know at the same time they were doing that dan they also the voters through the initiative process said here's what we want the rules in nevada to be for same-sex marriage there's not a problem with same-sex marriage law in nevada dan it's the law of the land in nevada right but nonetheless it's like well here we go 24 hours we're going to ignore what people in nevada did oh by the way dan the people in nevada also said here's what we want the rules to be for pro-choice versus pro-life and so disregard that disregard what they've done on same-sex marriage here you go 431 people although we're not up to full strength who are not from nevada are going to vote to say thank you nevadans for expressing your will in the purest democratic form possible through initiative petition and setting the rules for nevada and so it's not a problem here oh we want to pass a bill that says here's what the rules should be and forget about what you people in nevada voted for oh and by the way dan that's before you say well is the senate gonna do anything so of course i'm gonna i'm gonna every chance i get to protect the initiative process in nevada which is basically the election process i'm gonna do that that's what my press release said i know you have a copy of it yep um and and so you know when you read the headlines like oh emily votes against this it's like wow um somebody i guess in vegas is writing the headlines um and and so i mean you know in one sense though it's like hey this is uh this is business as usual in in some of the media circles and so there you go yeah i don't i don't know a whole lot about the you know how how the newspaper business works in an actual newsroom but if i understand it correctly the usually the writer of the story is not the person that writes the headline that's that's separately done right so you can't you can't blame the writer the story in in the newspaper was accurate but the headline in you know in my mind wasn't and and by the way the supreme court right 2013 i think it was uh held that the uh the current provisions that were in effect were unconstitutional uh it seems like that should have negated everything right at that point well i think it does to anybody with a reasonable mind thinking you know regardless of what your preference is it's like it's a it was a listen let's be really blunt here okay this is all about trying to take people's attention away from the abysmal job that nancy pelosi and joe biden and and chuck schumer and those folks have done because there's an election here and it's like hey if we can if we can build false issues around sexual preference around pro-choice versus pro-life you know you name it it's all about hey what's going on with sex what's going on with abortion what's going on with uh you know um uh who you decide you you want to be in love with um instead of what the real issues are these issues are settled in nevada and they're settled almost in all of them by voters remember how people were fired up when it's like oh we're going to do a national the house passed a national elections law it's like nevada handles that even if we're upset with what's going on the last thing we want is whatever the political party that's in power in d.c telling us how to hold elections in nevada so let's let's distract let's uh let's misrepresent and um and let's do an editorial in in the space of a headline touche very very similar to to you know the roe v wade to do which here in the silver state once again didn't change anything we we had you know our abortion law is in place it's what the people wanted it's it's not changing the thing here changed nothing and and so and i get people are very well but what about other states and bob obama's like well um fine if we need to work that out but you really want the feds in charge of it because if you like the way the feds are now obviously i'm not one of those people what about when you don't like the people who are the feds mm-hmm you know it's some of that stuff they went through in the senate well we don't like what they're doing so let's get rid of the filibuster it's like you know these worms inevitably turn yeah um and and so um thanks for kind of uh thanks for kind of being on the watch for that though because it's it's one of those things where when people read the press release um they're like oh okay i get that um as opposed to um amadeus opposed to what the people of state of nevada voted for that you know nobody even mentions that i know you and i are similar with that common sense thing you know kind of matters to us a lot of other people could could do better with that congressman mark abbott is our guest listen inflation is still the number one concern most americans have the the you know the white house and the politicians on the left don't seem to get this a 40-year high in inflation the latest uh cpi report and and all of this seems to be eluding them um i think everything that's actually impacting americans is eluding them at the moment why aren't we talking more about this well because first of all the national press controls what they talk about and and let's be honest once again the national media i'm going to be as friendly as i can appears to have a very significant um lean towards uh the administration and speaker pelosi and and and the whole agenda that is green new deal and and things like that yeah so because they control that they control what you don't hear about and they control like we're talking about what you do hear about and so i i mean if this was if this was a republican administration that they'd be doing backflips on my god and inflation and you're killing the middle class and all that stuff that we know to be true and why are we shooting ourselves in the foot on energy then why is nobody on duty at the border and it's not because of the border patrol um you know all that stuff but instead we get oh my god gas is down to you know the second lowest level in in the last five years or something like that yeah like that's nothing to do with these guys um and and oh um you know i know it's like well employment's good in nevada and and stuff like that and it's like well you talked to those small business owners that have been yelling at me for the last two weeks about we need workforce what the heck yeah blah blah blah it's like well if the whole if the whole private sector who by the way dan let's not forget from time to time people forget this the private sector is the people who pay the taxes which allow us to run government so the better the private sector is doing the better paying taxes is doing i don't understand this thing of uh well it's really okay and and all that other sort of stuff and it's like it's not okay and if these people are locking their doors and they're not paying employees and they're not providing health insurance benefits and they're not providing retirement options then it falls to who and and we know how that works because we've just taken on a heck of a lump in the first coveted bill to get us through that even though a lot of people who keep want to send in covet bills um and it's like you can't just keep it they got the cart in front of the horse so i mean i guess between now and november the the more that the the media can um can produce the scenario they want for their team uh the national media then then you know what um they're helping them all they can and they have been for quite a while now yeah he's congressman mark ambode with us on news talk 780 koh uh when we come back yeah what's going on on the border speaking of what you may not be seeing from some of the national news media stand by more with the congressman coming up it's friday afternoon i'm dan mason here on news talk 780 k which with our guest congressman mark amade yesterday a congressman i had a senatorial candidate adam laxalt on and and he told us what he saw in his trip what last weekend um to the border and and i see a lot of it and i know a lot of what's going on but to to hear some of what he described going on down there um i'm even more scared than i was and i i said this yesterday the fentanyl problem by itself should unite everybody to do something about this and it just doesn't seem to be the case well one of the bewildering things about about this period that we're struggling through is is that political agendas have totally eclipsed hey we need to get the policy right on on some what used to be fairly common sense uniting things and so when you when you concentrate on hey fentanyl where it's coming from what its effects are and what the consequences are just in our country um it's like that's a no-brainer and it's like no no the political agenda is and i don't really under but it's like we want as many folks acrossing the border as we can it's like you know it's not even quality i mean i mean this it's just we want as many as we can get and the heck with public safety to heck with public health to heck with uh you know uh the people who have come over previously and followed the rules it's just open the gates and and it's not even you know as well as humanitarians like well it's not humanitarian in mexico the mexican government has made tremendous strides in building a middle class and doing economic development in their neighborhood so it isn't like it was 20 years ago there and so you're going well the stuff in central america is like well let's look at that and have some sort of we're supposed to basically have some sort of system where where we we administer that and that's before you get to all the terrorists from every place else other than than south and and central america where it's like this serves no common sense purpose other than maybe somebody's idiotic theme well the more people we get across there the more of them we we think will vote for us and when you look at the folks from central i mean they are pro faith um personal responsibility pro family values folks for the most part it's like i don't even know what they're thinking about that so it's it's just i mean that alone should get a whole bunch of people fired not only in the administration but that are facilitating this from a legislative standpoint well based on you know a lot of what we're seeing of polling and even what happened in in the last election um a lot of those very people they're assuming are going to be future voters are starting to turn on them so the plan might not be working real well well and that that brings you to the point where you and hey the people that are most affected by it those folks that that are legitimate folks who who are coming here for reasons that we can all understand when they're starting to go hey this is not the policy we want to see then you ask the geniuses that have no real connection with blue collar america and the border what are you doing it's like well we just want the power and and we want to we want to maintain these perceptions kind of like that headline we want people to believe the perceptions because we want the power i mean you look at what they've done with it dan i mean look at look at speaker pelosi hey we're trading we're trading in the stock market for personal gain we're i mean and listen but i never talked to my husband about it you just wonder why people sit there and shake their heads and why they all hate dc yeah you know i mean my god and and so you're sitting there going well i'm part of that even though and you're just it's a let me just put it to you this time it's a it's a good time to go watch rocky or or some of the top gun movies we'll watch top gun yeah we're good ends up winning in the end because we're still fairly seriously involved in the middle and now at the end right now congressman mark amity is our guest uh you're out on the campaign trail you had to be disturbed like most people are about what uh almost happened to congressman zelda yesterday well and and you know what i i mean we are everybody understands that and and i i think i think you have to lead by example and and so one of the things that i think has been a strength for us is we're available i'm not out with a detail or an entourage or anything else like that um which i think is is one of the strengths in terms of of our record our service and and just you know kind of keeping things down to earth and and so you continue to do that but make no mistake there's a there's a risk in that and so it just adds another element of challenge um but you know things are what they are and um let's just continue to hope that the vast majority of people are which i'm sure they are are good people whether you agree with them politically or not and we need to get through this and and do the right thing uh one more thing i want to get to you before we go you're on house appropriations uh of course what's the latest news on the 2023 budget bills well i i mean the all the republicans are going to vote against them we voted against most of them uh yesterday the first minibus the second one will do next week they will leave as they did last time with no republican votes in the house including the appropriators and then we'll see what the senate does when they finally engage but you know the problem there is that they did some good work but there's nothing public or transparent about it um they don't meet like we did in markup so you can see who voted for what and what the what the amendments were um so they'll engage uh what maybe start kind of in in the committee process uh in august but for the most part when we're getting towards the end of the fiscal year in september that then you know they'll say well here's our deal um and and we'll have to do a continuing resolution i hope i'm wrong yeah um to get for a while and and then the and the the end result last year i didn't think was a bad result and i voted for it because of that because it was much less than than the ds had wanted and it did some good things for the troops it did some good things for money to the border um it did some good things for us locally in terms of of uh of wildland fire in terms of initial attack resources and rehab stuff for the stuff that has burned so we'll see what they come out with but for right now the house will have their appropriations worked through the house by the end of next week with essentially no republican votes the main issue what it usually is too much spending and not in the right places well yeah i mean defense will be at an all-time low uh and some of the domestic uh programs which are and it's not like domestic spending is evil dan but the problem is is a lot of its agenda stuff to carry out agendas like the green new deal and and things like that and and government funding of uh taxpayer funding of of abortions or i should say taxpayer borrowing uh to support that and and so those are things and and by the way then those aren't new things no you know everybody's screaming oh my god it's like the height amendment's like 30 years old wasn't a problem until recently so anyhow the appropriations process is out of the house no republican votes we'll see what the senate does to set up the whole conference process stay tuned all right congressman mark hamilton uh as always i appreciate your time thanks for checking in with us yep good to talk to you dad we'll be in touch all right you got it 775 852 talk 800 564k

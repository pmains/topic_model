i'd like to thank the gentleman from louisiana um for his um remarks and uh appreciate him being uh involved in tonight's uh special order i'm not surprised that he would be here on such an important important topic he has demonstrated numerous times his commitment to young people and their aspirations and motivating them to do the right thing and be successful uh as he has been yeah one thing that comes to my mind mr speaker is um as we talk about this issue what is it that we find these 1.5 million men missing and they're human beings they're americans what is what is the difference about these 1.5 that they're african-american does it go back in our history of 300 years does it have something to do with us as a race i just wonder sometimes what is the difference but i won't i won't go there mr speaker in closing i'd like to thank the members of the congressional black caucus here tonight for sharing their profound insights and observations your participation was greatly appreciated every monday night in this house we have remarkable opportunity to speak about the important work of the cbc to advance full equality and justice for african americans and all communities in this nation one of the most significant challenges our communities face is that of the missing black male once again to quote the new york times more than one out of every six black men today should be between 25 and 54 years old have disappeared from daily life many of these men are incarcerated others have died from homicide and from disease that disproportionately affects african american males the consequences of these missing men are severe not just for the men themselves but for their families and for the entire society strong communities laid the foundation to strong societies but when our criminal justice system emphasizes incarceration over rehabilitation we make it increasingly difficult for those individuals to become productive members of society we need a system that holds criminals accountable while focusing on rehabilitation of non-violent criminals if we are truly to make our communities more secure we also need to address health disparities among african-american men health disparities are a burden to african-american communities african-american men suffer from a number of diseases including colorectal cancer and high at its highest rates than at higher rates than their white counterparts part of the problem has to do with stigmas and this is in and this is an area which i have been working hard to address in my capacity as co-chair of the congressional men health caucus along those lines we need to eliminate the stigmas around mental health and make sure that those suffering from mental illness have the resources they need no one's struggling with mental illness should feel isolated and that they have nowhere to turn it is clear that we're not doing enough as a society to get them the help they need we should be seeking we we should be seeing an uptick in the number of african-american boys dying from suicide we should not be seeing an uptick in that dreaded suicide rate for these young boys and for others we need to listen and we need to encourage them not to be afraid to seek help the problem of the missing black male is not going to be resolved overnight but closing the gap is a goal we all need to aspire to for ourselves for our community and for our nation and with that mr speaker i yield back the balance of my time

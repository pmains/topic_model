I should also say Who I am I'm a ranch kid I actually was raised only about 50 miles from right here in downtown burns burns was the big city we would we would come here to shop every once in a while we would also come here for the County Fair and I took my my my 4-h sheep here to to Hardy County the first year we did it I got Reserve grand champion it was a great big deal and and Burns was it was an exciting place in and it's it's interesting it's changed over the years and and I hope I hope that if I make it into Congress I can help burdens survive as a valuable community you know getting up at 5:30 every morning on the ranch and working 10-hour days six days a week and we pretended we didn't work on Sunday but we still haven't built the cows had to feed the calves up in a lot and had to do other things but we were allowed to go fishing and and do things on our own on Sundays after we went to church so that I'm I'm a right-to-life guy because my family is Catholic and and we've been raised that way so I also know how hard and change in farming is I know how hard it is to stack hey I know how hard it is to build a fence I know how hard it is to cap out cavy heifers and because I know just exactly how hard ranching is I decided to become a lawyer and and then come back into the rural areas and help ranchers and farmers with their legal matters which I've done for the past past 40 years I've been a Republican my entire life i i'm i think republican values fit cd2 perfectly everyone realizes you're going to rise or fall on your efforts but you also always willing to step in and help your neighbors and that's it's one of the most valuable things you learn out here and i think republicans are just like that and you see that happening right now in washington DC as our president steps up and tries his best right away about stopping the economic tailspin we're finding ourselves in because of his virus [Applause] [Music]

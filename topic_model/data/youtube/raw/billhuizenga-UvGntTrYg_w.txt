madam speaker i rise today with an opportunity for this body and the united states congress to save lives the hyde amendment has been an essential safeguard that has defended the unborn and protected millions of lives for more than 40 years a recent a a recent estimate credits the height amendment with saving more than 2.4 million precious and innocent lives historically measures which prevent taxpayer dollars from being used to perform abortions have garnered strong bipartisan support in fact president biden was a vocal supporter of the hyde amendment during his decades of service in the u s senate however it's clear that democrats in washington have changed their mind as they have recently made it their mission to eliminate these long-standing protections and force families in west michigan and across the nation to violate their deeply held beliefs by funding abortions on demand with their hard-earned tax dollars i believe as millions of michigan and as millions of michiganders and those across america believe we must embrace a culture that protects the values of life using tax taxpayer dollars to end their lives innocent children is wrong i therefore ask unanimous consent that the committees on energy and commerce ways and means and the judiciary be discharged from further consideration of h.r 18 and ask for its immediate consideration in the house as the chair previously advised that request cannot be entertained absent appropriate clearance

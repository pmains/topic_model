mr. speaker and two managers three good men I rise in opposition to the rule I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question so that we can offer an amendment to consider my legislation HR 851 bring jobs home act yesterday passed in the Senate 93 27 now there's something fundamentally wrong if we can't get a boost here and it passes 93 27 for sure across the board Democrats and Republicans so what are we talking about here and an aye vote for the previous question is a vote to keep giving corporate America a tax break for every job they ship overseas to China let's start there I heard a lot of our corporate welfare in reference to the export-import bank over the last few weeks before we debate it next week it costs the government not one dime to help out the businesses in fact in your in your state the manager through the chair your state has in jeopardy in Oklahoma 255,000 jobs at risk bring jobs home at ends taxpayer write-offs that pay moving costs when companies ship jobs abroad we as a body have supported in the past giving money to businesses expressions that send jobs overseas that does not make sense what we want to do is help those companies to come back because these are good-paying jobs that's how manufacturing jobs primarily left this country over the last 10 years 2.4 million American jobs have been shipped overseas and US taxpayers have helped foot the bill that to me is insanity it's like paying someone for the rope they're going to hang you with economists estimate that across country over 21 million jobs are at risk of being outsourced 500,000 of them come from my own state will come from my state of New Jersey at a time we're trying to create good-paying manufacturing jobs in the United States it quite simply makes no sense for the US taxpayers they'll help foot the bill for companies that want to outsource jobs instead my bill ends this taxpayer subsidy once and for all instead bring jobs home act will provide a new twenty percent tax credit for companies that bring jobs back to the United States of America this will provide a substantial incentive for more and more companies to create jobs and invest right here in our own country we already seen a trend towards in sourcing manufacturing employment is up by 600,000 jobs since the end of the Great Recession and for the first time in 2013 companies were reshoring jobs at the same rate that they were off showing them we still got a big hole to dig ourselves out of from 2003 went up to 150,000 jobs are being offshored each month we're still out of balance by a million jobs companies like masterlock caterpillar for GE Walmart even not one of my favorites but Walmart starting to see the value in bringing manufacturing back to this country we've got the rd the infrastructure the educated workforce and we've got the consumers and again we have the most productive workers in the world and it's not just the big guys more than eighty percent of companies bringing work back up 200 million or less in sales so let's give these companies a little extra incentive to make it in america by providing them with this tax credit to help our manufacturing economy continue its rebound a robust manufacturing based economy will lead it's comes very nice Thank You mr. speaker will lead to widespread prosperity for businesses and the people who work there manufacturing jobs paid twenty twenty three percent more than workers in other parts of the economy every dollar and manufacturing sales creates one dollar and forty cents worth of economic impact mr. speaker it's time to stop these short-sighted policies that stifle investment here in America and focus on what we can do to incentive investment and job creation I urge a no vote on the previous question I yield back and I thank you for your time sir

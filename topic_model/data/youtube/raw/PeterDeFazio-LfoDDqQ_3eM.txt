well there you have a real life example Ben & Jerry's relabeling all of their their product didn't cost and it won't cost consumers ascent that's the fact but that's not the campaign they have run the campaign they will run Oregon we're going to be on the ballot you know Washington and California started out far ahead and then by the end they convinced people very narrow margin in Washington state which the press still continues to misrepresent the initial returns were forty five percent for the final returns were forty nine percent couldn't have been narrower and there was over 20 million dollars spent by Monsanto grocery manufacturers and others to to turn this measure around and stop the labeling but this is something that will not be stopped American people simply want to know what's in their food this is you know on any other day my Republican colleagues mr. Pompeo among them would say we're for states rights and we're for capitalism okay well states rights would say you're not going to preempt Vermont or any other state that wants to require just simple disclosure on the label and and capitalist markets free markets require that the consumer have the information they want to make their purchases why deny consumers this information on the label as Jerry said 64 countries we haven't seen any of the detrimental impacts that they're talking about over there this is being driven by some very narrow very powerful very well-funded special interest Monsanto and others and those of user potentially could hear none of that has ever been done so but they just have declared it safe and the federal bureaucrats at the FDA have accepted that it's not any different well it and they say it happens in nature all the time oh really when's the last time a tomato plant made it with an arctic char

the senate banking committee's top leaders have released the broad outline of mortgage demand and freddie mac leaving the question what will the nation's future housing finance system actually look like joining me right now connecticut democrat representative jim hines uh he wanted to wind down the housing giants long before this bill came out you've been talking it for talking about this for quite a a while congressman hines uh why do we not need a fannie and freddie in the system your view well it's important to know what to be clear about what we're talking about we certainly don't need a fannie and freddie that are guaranteeing at this point something like 90 percent of all residential mortgages obviously the private market can play in a much larger way than it is playing today with the government of course backstopping those entities so you've got a whole bunch of different proposals out there uh our argument and as you may know uh congressman delaney have put forward a proposal for a new structure that our idea is that you need the government in there for its scale and for its size and to be there when the heart when the housing market falls apart because the private sector won't be there and you probably need it for reasons of affordability and other things but what you really ought to do at least according to our proposal is make sure that you are pricing the guarantee using the private market to price that because at the end of the day it's the market that best understands risk and that will best price uh the exposure that the government has in guaranteeing these 30-year fixed mortgages or whatever it might be yeah you're trying to introduce a little market discipline into this however the real concern representative times is that if you don't have a fannie and freddie there if you don't have a government backstop you're running the risk that your average homeowner is just going to get decimated by this because there will not be as big a market for loans or if there is the market for loans it's going to cost everyone more to get the loan in the first place so what does this do fundamentally to the american dream yeah no your your point is exactly right and that's why our proposal as well as the proposal that just came out today or yesterday out of the senate the johnson crapo proposal it does have government participation you could have a market with no government participation most economists would tell you that market would only extend uh mortgage loans to people with very good credit ratings uh the uh the price of a 30-year fixed mortgage would probably be two three maybe four percentage points higher than what americans are used to so yeah in theory you can have a housing market without any government guarantee but in reality you know we like the ideas we have for generations that actually mortgages should be affordable to americans but you're still reducing government exposure here well you have to reduce government exposure today right the government is 90 of the of the residential housing market today i don't think anybody on either side of the aisle think that thinks that's a good idea look in the house we have a proposal that basically eliminates the government guarantee this is what came out of the financial services committee is called the path act you know again that is theoretically possible but it would make mortgage largely unavailable to most middle-class americans our proposal as well as the proposal that has been developed over in the senate has a role but a much more disciplined role uh for the government in this market a backstop if you will you know not every country has a fannie or freddie uh you look at canada and i've mentioned this before on the show they haven't had quite the same problems we have had uh and and europe hasn't uh well you know they have their own issues of course but they hadn't had quite the housing uh problem that we had uh back in 08. um you know it it seems like it this comes at a cost shall we say fannie and freddie and and the ability of the u.s government to be there as the eventual backstop uh makes all these loans more plentiful and more available but at the same time do you want them that plentiful and available yeah look and it's important to distinguish between what fannie and freddie did from about 2006 on when they made you know just unconscionable poorly underwritten loans started competing for some very very you know toxic frankly mortgages and what they did for generations before that remember fannie and freddie have for a couple of generations been there um to to help americans get started in home ownership which is how most americans accumulate assets so you're right there's lots of different models out there um as to how you can do this but our idea is the key the key here is that the government be there but it be but that it's there in a disciplined way that the guarantee that it provides is priced well enough so that when things go wrong as they do hopefully not like they did in 2008 but when they go wrong there's a reserve there i guess i guess the problem is that you know a lot of people feel it's sort of all or nothing because the minute the government is there there's always that temptation for the government to be there in a bigger way uh that whole too big to fail argument um but to your point you want something so it's a challenging issue yeah and uh and and one that we look forward to continue talking with you about we appreciate you joining us today sounds good

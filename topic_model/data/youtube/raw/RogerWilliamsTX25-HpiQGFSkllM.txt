now recognize the gentleman from texas mr williams thank you mr chairman and thank all of you for being here today and uh i'm a small business owner in texas a job creator for 44 years main street guy and in full disclosure i'm an auto dealer and i understand that they're squeezing you to get to me i get it when a new regulation is put into place or a new law is enacted banks or credit unions have to increase the amount of resources they devote to compliance more regulators i'm told are hired more by some bankers than more loan officers while the stated purpose of these new laws and regulations to protect consumers the opposite is actually happening increasing regulation means two things fewer products and fewer services for example take dublin texas the home of dr pepper population just shy of four thousand bankers have told me that because of regulatory overreach they won't make loans for homes valued a hundred and fifty thousand or more much less for fifty thousand more which is the average price in dublin and who know you know who does this impact we know who it impacts it impacts the seller impacts the buyer and the bank trying to make the loan but what about the plumbers what about the carpenters and electricians and local contractors and hardware stores that would benefit if we if we sold a home so it goes on and on and on and regulations are not just hurting banks but the customers who depend on them and for the customer relationships matter my constituents want to bank with people who they can trust and that's not the federal government and they want a bankrupt have relationships that are built not in a week or a month or a year but over a lifetime and i will tell the i tell everybody the federal government being a small business owner reputation is the most important thing all of us have at the end of the day something that this administration just doesn't get now in texas we're not immune to the impact of dodd-frank the other day or as we've talked about in texas alone and mr williams you'll probably back me up on this uh we've uh have 115 fewer community banks we did four years ago in texas and that's an economy that's the best in the world yes and uh so just yet we had secretary lou here yesterday and we were talking about dodd-frank and he was expounding on how great it was and said that we had we'd also talked about there's a possibility that he can just with a stroke of a pen take the 50 billion dollar guys and get him out even barney frank agrees with that but he thinks he has to he has to continue to get dodd-frank in full implementation before he would do that and i asked him that uh i would like for him not to do that because if we go that long we could lose banks we could lose uh all lending institutions we could lose businesses we could lose jobs so i hope he considers that and then there's the worry and the fervor and the fear over fair lending evaluations and the use of desperate impact is a viable theory to evaluate all this it's reported limiting the number of banks willing to make small dollar loans we understand that and someone is in the automobile business i'm very sensitive the idea that some think that uh people are given different rates based on race religion or gender so uh i support reform in the consumer protection financial bureau's mortgage rules but i also want to make it easier on you to be recognized for your performance and not penalized so i guess i would ask a question uh really yes or no to all of you i want to get back to what secretary lou said should we wait for full implementation of dodd-frank or should we try to reform it and get and get you guys out of it if it's broke fix it reform it we definitely need to reform it we weren't the bad actors reform it get us out of it and it would also help mitigate the cost of consumers that we have to pass along right i think it really depends on the provision okay thank you uh now we've talked to about one of the questions i had was how much this is affecting your bottom line we talked a lot about that uh i heard a thing the other day it says there's more it uh it takes more man-hours to meet dodd-frank now halfway through it than it did to build all the man-hours in the panama canal so that puts it in perspective uh we also just heard from the from the uh professor that it's hard to measure compliance cost uh in a business uh i would think that uh is that right uh mr miller that is correct sir uh but you also might one may have measured is it's cutting into your bottom line yes you're having to hire somebody it can't loan money does cut in the bottom line tremendously well i'll be brief real quick the economy is not fixed uh i think that main street america is still hurting risk reward is being attacked and i guess i would ask any one of you just to respond real quick if we reduce burdensome regulations on you all don't you think it would help small business guys like me take risk get reward put people to work get em off unemployment get net worth back in america yes it is that would decrease your cost of doing business all right thank you very much thank you for being here mr chairman i yield back

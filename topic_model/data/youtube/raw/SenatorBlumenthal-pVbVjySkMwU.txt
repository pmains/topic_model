a practice that was revealed recently a practice involving employers coercing and compelling the disclosure of login information usernames and passwords to private accounts and private systems by job applicants and the same kind of coercion and compulsion applied to current or existing employees as a condition of their continuing in their jobs that kind of practice is a porn and it is the reason that yesterday along with a number of my colleagues from both this body and others from the House of Representatives introduced the password Protection Act of 2012 these practices are unacceptable for a number of reasons an employer has plenty of ways other than accessing private accounts gmail storage data and accounts on Facebook or other social networking sites to obtain information that's relevant to employer needs and interests in offering a position to someone there are means other means that are adequate and acceptable what's not acceptable is coercing and compelling that access to an applicant's email account which could contain all kinds of personal information that is inappropriate and unnecessary for an employer to know information that is irrelevant in fact to the terms and duties of a person's employment second the disclosure itself in dangers the security of that applicants personal data as well as the websites themselves too many careless companies too often have lost customer data or employee information allowing it to be breached through poor security practices that is a reason that I proposed a measure that would require safeguards of that data a separate measure that is before this chamber now to assure adequate remedies when there are breaches to require systems in place by employers to guard that information an applicant who takes care to use encrypted networks or other personal safeguards may find his or her personal information financial data medical information breach through no fault of his own simply because the company fails to take adequate steps to safeguard it the password protection act also very very importantly prohibits retaliation which is a danger with current employees that retaliation can take all kinds of forms but the demand for login information usernames or passwords certainly creates a kind of presumption that the refusal to do so prompts action that can be regarded as a retaliation and an employer who violates these duties legally required duties is subject to a penalty of ten thousand dollars per violation it does not prevent an employer from controlling the company's own system its own Facebook account for example and it provides that states may exempt certain categories of employees such as individuals who deal with children who are under 13 years of age or federal employees who may have access to classified or secure national security information and it also provides for reasonable exemptions that state law may make for state employees who are involved for example in law enforcement or correction like many in this body I've heard from countless Connecticut citizens who are not only offended but outraged by these practices reported in the press fortunately many employers have shown they get it they understand this deeply held value and they have rejected these possible practices and many who might have been contemplating engaging in them have likewise retreated and reversed their decisions and so merely shining a light showing a spotlight and raising the issue has brought many employers to understand the common sense force of objections to these practices

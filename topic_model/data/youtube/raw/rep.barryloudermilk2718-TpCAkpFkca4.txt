[Music] so yesterday uh peter ducey uh his daddy is steve uh he is the morning show host over at fox and friends and uh peter ducey really went after the white house on the illegals coming across the border now this is interesting uh there was a big controversy in the world of tennis one of the major tennis stars was not allowed into the country because he refuses to get the china virus vaccine meanwhile you have tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of illegals coming across our border and none of those people are vaccinated and ducey asked the white house about the double standard participant protocols i refer you to them they have their own specific protocols as well so they're two different things they're two different things but so are how is it two different things somebody unvaccinated comes over on a plane you say that's not okay somebody walks into texas or arizona unvaccinated they're allowed to stay why but that's not how it works like we actually no you know that that's not what you guys want to happen but that is what has happened but that's not it's not like somebody walks over and that's not that's not exactly what's happening thousands of people are walking in a day some of them turn themselves over some of them are caught tens of thousands a week are not that is what is happening so let me just lay out what we have done under this administration we have installed new border technology and set up joint protocols with mexico and guatemala to catch more human traffickers we have already made over 3 000 arrests in the first three months of launching an unprecedented anti-smuggling campaign with regional partners we've secured record levels of funding for the department of homeland security so there you have it uh that was from the white house press briefing yesterday i want to go to the patriot mobile newsmaker line congressman perry loudermilk from georgia joins us congressman i i you hate to call somebody ignorant but i've never heard such an ignorant press secretary before it's it's unbelievable but it's consistent with the entire white house right now everything they do it sort of reminds me of the scene in wizard of oz where dorothy is standing there in front of the wizard and the curtain flies open and you see the guy behind the uh the throne there operating the machines and he says pay no attention to that man behind the curtain this is exactly what it is pay no attention to the truth pay no attention to the fact of what's going on you need to just listen to what we're saying and the entire house of cards is crumbling around them and they don't know how to deal with truth and they just believe that that if they say it the american people are going to accept it because they have the mainstream media on their side but americans eyes are being opened and they really don't know how to deal with reality no they they they don't and uh the the idea that she had no idea people were walking across the border every single day by the tens of thousands is just bizarre to me i mean at least jin saki would have come up with some sort of a an answer i mean jean-pierre has said absolutely nothing and it's deer in headlights every single day but you know what uh she's the spokesperson for a deer and headlights administration so there you go exactly and it's consistent with everything from you know the afghan withdrawal to uh taxi mandates to everything that they're doing student loan handout is don't bother us with logic common sense or fact we're going to do what we want to do and then we'll just sell it to the american people whether it works or not as long as we accomplish it that's that's all that matters looking back a one-year anniversary of afghanistan you mentioned afghanistan congressman what are the lessons that we should have learned from what happened a year ago today well it's lessons that we had already known going into it is that when you pull out of an area that is still embedded and surrounded with people like isis or the uh the the various terrorist groups that were there that's not going to leave a vacuum they're just going to fill it up it's going to turn over and for us to to act like we're naive and we're just going to pull out and the afghans are going to be able to continue with a form of democracy and that we're going all of our citizens will just be able to get out that was naive but again i think it's back to the the president his advisors were being told this isn't going to work but that doesn't matter because i'm going to do what i want to do and it doesn't matter what the outcome is and you can see that happening right now because the president is still proclaiming it was a successful mission when the rest of the world knows it was a debacle but he's still trying i think they're convinced that this was this was successful because we completed what we wanted to do which also tells me the safety and security of american citizens that were there was not a concern of theirs it still isn't a concern of theirs it also tells me that they're really not concerned about how america stands on an international front because right now nobody trusts the united states our allies don't trust us and our enemies are not afraid of us but none of that mattered because they accomplished what they wanted to accomplish which would simply get the troops out it doesn't matter what happens to anyone else oh you're right on the patriot mobile newsmaker line congressman barry loudermilk from the 11th congressional district in georgia uh congressman the president is supposed to be giving a speech later this week talking about democracy under attack and i'm wondering where this is going you know this guy promised to be the great uniter but now you know he's resorted to calling the entire republican party a bunch of fascists this is a more indication is that they are they are blind to the what's going on in the country they're tone deaf to what americans need what they want they failed in every aspect of everything that they said that they would do including uniting the country they have failed on the economy the economy was strong they have destroyed our economy we are now in a recession um and it was obvious we were going to be going into a recession before the numbers came out because all the democrats started going on television and redefining the word of recession that told you hey they knew we were in that way so they just need to redefine it so they can go out and tell americans look it doesn't matter what you're paying it doesn't matter if you can't find baby formula our economy is strong it doesn't matter that you're falling behind the curve as inflation goes up and you're effectively not making more money you're making less money we're fine our economy is strong this is the type of thing that is is it just it amazes me i mean it's beyond logic and so now they're resorting to well even though we're we're effectively destroying democracy and the people are upset about things like the fbi raid on mar-a-lago we'll quit looking at that that even though that violates the constitution we just need to redefine the constitution right and so they're going to go on the attack and say look everything that's wrong it's really the republicans it's not us it's it's not our our failed policy it's the republicans especially those who want to make america great again it's those republicans that are the problem it's i don't know i remember when i was in college and i took a psychology class and i think it was called projection that people will project their own problems on onto somebody else to justify themselves congressman we're going to leave it there always appreciate your great insight and hope you have a great labor day weekend coming up all right todd look forward to seeing you soon all right congressman barry louderbelt from georgia

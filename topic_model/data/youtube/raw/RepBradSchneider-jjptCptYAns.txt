Following a Summer of horrific gun violence,
we can no longer accept Congressional failure to take concrete action. Mass shootings in Gilroy, El Paso, Dayton,
and Odessa, as well as the unceasing daily gun violence in communities across the country,
including close to my home in Chicago defined the Summer of 2019. I hope this Fall will be remembered as the
time when our leaders finally began to address our nation’s gun violence epidemic with
concrete action. The simple fact is, the House already passed
bipartisan bills on universal background checks and closing the Charleston loophole. This is commonsense legislation that more
than 90 percent of Americans support. It would have closed the loophole that the
Texas shooter used to acquire his weapon. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell
astonishingly continues to carry water for the NRA and refuses to even allow a simple
up or down vote on this bill. We need to tell Mr. McConnell and the NRA
that “enough is enough.” People are needlessly dying. The victims and their loved ones deserve more
than thoughts and prayers. We must act now.

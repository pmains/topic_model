you know it's completely outrageous that this administration continues to tie the hands of our law enforcement i visited the border a year ago and cbp was begging for support they're saying please tell this administration that we are unable to do our jobs that we are being overrun by the drug cartels that we are sitting here processing paperwork instead of actually securing the border and now here we are a year later they want to make the problem worse uh by lifting title 42 but in addition to that we're seeing how record levels of fentanyl are streaming over a border it is the number one killer of americans 18 to 45 year olds we are seeing individuals from over 160 countries come to up through our border including those who have even been on the terrorist watch list those who are convicted criminals that have been previously deported i mean it's outrageous that this administration refuses to put the safety of the american people first and next month when title 42 is lifted the expectation is that thousands more illegal migrants will stream into this country i mean it almost seems like there's no end in sight this administration clearly wants to do nothing about it you think about how reckless this was throughout the entire course of this pandemic that they allowed millions of people to cross our borders illegally they flew them at the taxpayer expense all over the country and of course this spread various uh variants of covid so now they're they want to continue to put mandates and restrictions in place for the american people while lifting title 42 which they ignored by the way to begin with it is reckless it is incompetence and it is sad for the american taxpayers who have to foot the bill for this entire disaster everything from flying america flying these migrants all over the country to giving them free attorney to housing to health care it is so unfair at a time when the american people are struggling they are struggling economically they can afford inflation they are paying their taxes and they're getting little in return and then on top of it have to pay for other individuals who are here illegally it is unfair especially uh in the state of new york and we've seen some of those videos where these migrants are flown into westchester for example and they're released into the communities and you say to yourself our state is in so much trouble and when it comes to new york city for example there's so many other things that we could be doing with the taxpayer dollars yet we're taking on this extra burden while i have you i want to switch gears speaking of new york city and talk a little bit about mayor eric adams because he is blaming woke progressive policies for democrat-run cities soaring crime rates listen to this major mistakes made throughout the years that destroyed the trust that the police commissioner is talking about we have to rebuild that trust but we can't rebuild that trust by allowing those who are dangerous and that have they have a repeated history of violence to continue to be on our streets and some of the woke policies he's talking about for example here in new york city our district attorney doesn't want to incarcerate people who commit serious crimes um your take on this it's just another example as whether it's at the southern border or whether it's here in the city of new york democrats continue to villainize the the police officers law enforcement they continue to tie their hands and of course if you have policies that say you know 50 of those who are caught with an illegal a firearm or released back onto the street if you have district attorneys that say they refuse to prosecute crimes and if you murder somebody you won't have life without parole sentence and if you have city council members who keep calling to defund the police or people like alexandria casio cortez who fights back when you want to put police on the subway system to keep commuters safe of course that's going to invite crime we you know it started with the broken windows the mayor de blasio decided to eliminate penalties for smaller crimes and what has happened is attracted a larger criminal element so it has made new york city a target unfortunately these policies that have led to you know police being more reactive because they've had their hands tied they're not proactively policing because they're not allowed to hopefully under this mayor it's changing a bit and we're seeing the uh plain clothes not the plain clothes unit but the anti-crime unit uh in full force in certain precincts we need that throughout the entire city uh but he has to look at this idea of putting metal detectors in all that subways i don't think that is feasible i don't think that's a realistic answer i think the realistic answer is to put laws on the books and then enforce them and we need judges we need prosecutors and we need elected officials who will be on the side of law and order yeah and another issue with alvin bragg is you could put the people behind bars or at least uh you know make sure there's some penalty for jumping their fare because i i wonder of all the crimes that are committed down in the subway how many of those folks were paying their fare i mean it's these little things also um that set the tone and and make people realize in the city there are consequences for their actions um as well you know it's something that so many people here feel is is a huge quality of life issue um just walking around not being able to travel safely not not not feeling safe in this environment and this is a state and city congresswoman that have dealt with you know so so much of the exodus from the pandemic trying to rebuild this economy will never get on track if we don't start to make our streets safer that's absolutely correct people need to feel safe they need to be safe when they're going to work when they're traveling to school when they're going about their daily business and if you don't have safety you have nothing that's the reality we won't be able to get this economy back on track businesses will continue to flee and new yorkers will continue to flee new yorkers are paying 220 billion dollars in a budget this year for our state double the twice double the size of florida where florida has millions of more residents and they have nothing to show for it quality of life is deteriorating public safety is deteriorating and so is our economy so keep voting democrat that's what you're going to get it is troubling congresswoman good to see you this morning nicole

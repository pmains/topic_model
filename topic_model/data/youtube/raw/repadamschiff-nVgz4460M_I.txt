congressman adam schiff's a democrat representing california's 28th congressional district he sits on the select committee investigating january 6 just voted to proceed with holding steve bannon in criminal contempt um congressman you have said this in the days leading up to this i don't think it was unexpected that bannon would thumb his nose at the committee but you have said and others in the community said look we're not messing around here and i am struck by the speed at which this is going the vote happened tonight what happens next i expect we'll take this up on the floor very soon uh and i'm not in a position to announce how soon but i think it's going to happen very soon just as we took up this criminal contempt and as the chairman pointed out tonight for anyone else who is watching any other witnesses that request that that we demand to come in and testify um we will hold them in contempt as well if they refuse to do their lawful duty uh so i i'm pleased that we have moved so quickly i think the vice chair uh liz cheney's statement was really powerful tonight uh rebutting and rebuking the big lie and those who continue to push it uh and i'm i'm really pleased we're moving with alacrity i want to just play uh something the chairman said about about moving forward on this step on bannon when there have been many targets of subpoenas who are in various states of full partial or negotiated towards some kind of compliance this is what chairman thompson had to say about why bannon here specifically stands out in his actions take a listen it's a shame that mr bannon has put us in this position but we won't take note for an answer we believe mr bannon has information relevant to our probe and we'll use the tools at our disposal to get that information mr bannon stands alone in his complete defiance of our subpoena that's not acceptable no one in this country no matter how wealthy or how powerful is above the law left unaddressed this defiance may encourage others to follow mr bannon down the same path important is this moment for the overall inquiry that you are involved in well i think it's extremely important and you know we have to take notice of the breadth of what bannon tried to do which is not come to committee and assert some kind of privilege but claim that he doesn't even need to show up that he's somehow absolutely immune uh from legal process well others tried that too and the courts rejected that argument uh it is rejected here uh and i'm confident will be rejected by the justice department uh and the fact that uh that we're referring him for prosecution um will get the attention of others uh now he's important his own right he's got very relevant information the day before the insurrection he was talking about how all hell was going to break loose and for those who you know had talked about wanting to be there during the time of the revolution that here was another opportunity for them to be there for a revolution so he's clearly got information relevant uh to our our committee our country but also he's an important example of what should happen if people refuse their lawful duty i want to play something senator kevin kramer republican said about all this i mean i i think that you know people have noted this before and it continues to be true that in the aftermath of a violent attempt to overturn the election with a with an angry crowd a chanting hang mike pence having erected a gallows uh outside the capital that that some members were shaken understandably but i think a lot of republican members have sort of moved on and as long as the crowd isn't in their ear chanting hang mike pence at that moment uh they prefer to not think about it here's what kevin cramer uh or senate republican had to say about uh today's vote on that i actually think the whole commission is a bit irrelevant i don't see steve bannon being all that dangerous i frankly don't know how many people are paying a lot of attention to it and there aren't very many people paying attention to the january 6 commission is paying attention the point here what is the point well the point is that the rule of law needs to be observed and it's surprising to hear senators uh you know talk so blindly about an attack on our capital that resulted in the deaths of americans uh the beating of police officers but also essentially undermining congress's role in doing oversight undermining uh our oversight into you know the most most brutal attack on our capital in over 100 years so look donald trump sets the the tone and the tone donald trump wants to set is do not consider what happened on january 6 or if you do you should praise those who took up arms against our government their heroes their political prisoners uh we want to you know some way deify them that's donald trump's message and you know like dutiful carriers uh many in his party are trying to carry that message but the the facts are the facts it was a brutal assault uh we still uh have so much to learn about what went into it what the president then president trump knew about it in advance what they do about the participation of these white national groups white nationalist groups in advance and we want to make a set of recommendations to protect the country going forward that's our mission congressman adam schiff who serves on that select committee just voted a report unanimously out of that committee to go to the full floor thank you very much congressman thank you

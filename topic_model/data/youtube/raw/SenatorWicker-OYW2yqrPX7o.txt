Thank You mr. chairman it's my pleasure to introduce Admiral Tim Gallaudet to be the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for oceans and atmosphere president Trump has made an excellent nomination for NOAA deputy administrator Admiral Gallaudet is experienced and knowledgeable about oceans coasts and atmosphere having served 32 years in the Navy dr. Gallaudet got one degree at Annapolis and two at San Diego but we consider him a Mississippian having finished his naval career at Stennis Space Center in my home state of Mississippi is serving as the oceanographer of the Navy and commander of the naval meteorology and oceanography command and that's a mouthful that that post made him the highest-ranking active naval officer in our state of Mississippi so we claim him he knows firsthand the devastation caused by Katrina and the importance of NOAA's mission to provide accurate information and warnings and Merle Gallaudet has been a leader in the development of unmanned systems during his time in the Navy and of course we were headed that way in a big way he participated in the first operational launch and recovery of an undersea glider on a naval oceanographic vessel aboard the USNS Bowditch like ships unmanned systems are vital to the 21st century Navy these unmanned systems capabilities are also needed outside our defense sector so an no doubt Admiral the Gallaudet will incorporate this technology at NOAA Admiral Gallaudet's leadership and employing unmanned systems gave the Navy cutting-edge environmental intelligence and was successful because of his ability to collaborate with industry engage multiple branches of government and utilize the tremendous oceanography assets on the Mississippi Gulf Coast it's my hope that he will continue to draw on this expertise during his time at NOAA mr. chairman president Trump has recognized the suburb superb service of Admiral Gallaudet and he has given NOAA the leadership it needs at this opportunity time so I thank the Admiral for his career of service and of confident that he will be have bipartisan support for confirmation very very soon thank you sir Thank You senator wicker

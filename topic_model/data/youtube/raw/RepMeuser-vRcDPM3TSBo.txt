washington journal continues this is representative damn user republican of pennsylvania a member of the foreign affairs committee uh congressman muser thanks for giving us your time today it's great to be with you thank you where are you on this reported deal on banning russian imports well the idea that we spend two billion dollars a month and we send to putin's government to putin himself uh on oil that we could be creating and drilling for here in the united states is upside down and backwards logic and policy makes absolutely no sense under president trump short 14 months ago we were energy independent on our way to becoming energy dominant as we should be with the reserves that we have we are also the cleanest uh driller and developer of such uh such energy so the idea that we are buying eight percent seven and a half percent two billion dollars a month uh from putin a tyrant um uh causing all kinds of creating all kinds of abuses and atrocities in in the ukraine in a completely outrageous invasion is foolish and it needs to stop and i i think it will zilinski president zielinski asked for that on a recent call among other things and we should certainly appreciate the fact that have it being energy independent is a national security issue the biden administration has no understanding of this and refuses to accept this this fact um so we've lost leverage now on the same note the uh europe is receiving 40 percent of its of its uh energy from uh russia they put themselves in a terrible position and they won't be able to wean off as quickly as we could we need to do it now we need to stop purchasing oil from russia i will tell you this the private sector has already stepped up exxon shell other or u.s oil companies have stopped purchasing russian oil since the invasion took place as far as if this legislation goes through and these bans go into effect already a concern about gas prices you may have heard some of the calls from the previous segment what would be your message then to not only those you represent but the the public is as large well you know what call call the biden white house and tell them to start drilling domestically because it's an outrage the gas gasoline prices were three dollars and 75 cents before the invasion took place now of course they're spiking to four dollars and 17 cents the highest ever higher than jimmy carter congratulations president biden so we um we're in dire straits because of this uh the american people are dealing with this sort of inflation you know oil prices going up effect manufacturers of plastics and all within my district affect our farmers you know it would be nice if the bite administration could uh get into the real world for a few minutes and and uh not be so out of touch as to what the needs are we're all for transitioning towards carbon free energies natural gas is the is the best way to make such a transition this is serious stuff unfortunately we don't we don't have a serious administration if it's eight percent or so that we get monthly from russia and this legislation goes into effect is is the impact symbolic as far as the act is concerned or are there real impacts for not buying russian oil we we should make up for it by drilling domestically as i as i've stated or doing our best to get more imports from canada a friendly country if the keystone pipeline was put back into place uh that would cover more than the energy that we bring in from russia the keystone pipeline alone would bring in more oil than we than we import currently from russia meanwhile the biden administration another upside down and backwards policy uh there in venezuela talking to a ruthless uh socialist a dictator about perch who seized our assets by the way uh years back uh if if they will please uh send uh sell us some oil look i'm i'm not we've got to be constructive critics here in in in congress and in the house but this is kind of outrageous um as you can probably tell by my tone these um these policy uh decisions can happen uh very shortly and we can correct this situation uh 30 seconds of joe biden and his administration speaking favorably about domestic energy production and the plan even if it takes six months or seven months will lower the price of gasoline by by 20 cents overnight because so much of this is based upon futures our guest is uh with us until eight o'clock and if you want to ask them questions uh 202 seven four eight eight thousand for democrats republicans two oh two seven four eight eight thousand one and independence two oh two seven four eight eight thousand two you can text us thoughts at two oh two seven four eight eight thousand three representative muser to this idea of energy independence which you talked about if we're still getting a majority of our oil from canada and still from other sources how do you define energy independence in light of that well again we were energy independent currently our 50 percent of our imports come from canada which which works out it's a very friendly uh ally to us however again 14 months ago no we were gaining all of our energy resources from our own energy resources and that created a lot of things it was a national security issue it kept the price of gasoline very stable gasoline has a lot to do with inflation we see soaring inflation highest levels again so so it creates that stability it gives us national security and when geopolitical events occur we don't see the these spikes um that occurred during during president trump's time because we were in office we were energy independent there were there were world issues uh that were taking place iran was doing its uh terrible deeds they were there were terrorist acts there were there were other things taking place isis was rearing its its rotten head we had we had a syrian issue but you didn't see spikes in in gasoline as you would if we were not energy independent uh as far as the omnibus bill and keeping the federal government funded that's expected to take place or at least action is expected to take place by friday where are you as far as uh supporting that well we got to see the text uh you know we haven't seen the omnibus appropriations bill i do look forward to being supportive uh we need to to analyze it i understand many positive developments have occurred through our republican appropriators on the committee over the last couple of days that the senate is being reflective of so i'm um i'm uh optimistic uh but we shall see as you stated earlier the deadline is uh the 11th uh because the the democrat leadership that controls the senate controls the house and controls the white house has passed three crs continuing resolutions over the last year or so um so they can't even you know come up with a budget but now we seem as if we are there and um i'm um hopefully uh i can support it hopefully there's no poison pills in it uh that make it impossible or or forget about impossible for me to vote for it that make it not in the in the aggregate interests of the vast majority of americans that's pretty much my litmus test is it in the interests of of america's uh strength economically and national security and you know frankly from a public safety law and order standpoint what poison pills would you what would be something that would raise a red flag for you well um in the past when we saw the rescue act we saw the compete act and things of that nature we had we had amnesty put in there we had billions and billions of dollars going to the u.n for a slush fund we we had additional subsidies for wishful uh green energy projects you know as as long as there's nothing glaring and trust me it's never perfect but i'm i'm not in the business of making good the enemy of perfect right i mean if it's if it's close to if it's when the overall within the interest of of our american economy and our national security i'm going to be favorable to it uh a viewer from our twitter feed this morning asked the question as far as the oil and gas leasing i believe it wasn't here in the united states what guarantees do you have that the oil companies would lower gas prices with the implementation of these new leases well it's market it's it's it's supply and demand so if they're opening up and there's more investment taking place in our domestic energy and that is understood uh by the institutional investors and others that the there won't be this frankly assault on our domestic energy industry uh that's that's that's a very encouraging prospect and the futures markets would uh would reduce the price of a barrel of oil and you know that's taking place right now right the level of permits that the dubai administration has issued my understanding is they haven't issued one permit since being in office the biden administration we of course have uh he did his executive order prohibiting any uh development any new development on on federal lands okay but then he cancels the keystone pipeline and we basically have a um a situation where the administration is to to an extent uh threatening and putting all kinds of requirements on our banks uh to to wind back the level of business and investments that they make uh within the fossil fuel industry that's pretty outrageous and frankly it is taking place so those uh those inhibitors to our domestic energy need to be rolled back here's henry in michigan fort graciatt democrats line for our guest representative dan muser republican of pennsylvania dan is another russian putin trump agent who was spreading misinformation jinsaki just told us that there are 9 000 capped wells that the oil industry refuses to drill in why because the oil industry is operating at record levels they have no capacity to hold any more oil yesterday the head of the s p said that the united states is now a net exporter exporter of oil dan you're such a liar and for the russians listen enough i'm not going to sit here and be called a liar sir in all due respect okay and i'm not going to call you a little naive to be listening to gensake all the time all right those 9 000 wells existed well before the price of oil got to 110 dollars a barrel all right uh that they existed when oil was at 45 dollars a bag hold on hold on okay hold on caller go ahead and finish up your commenter question please okay now i have another take on this putin in ukraine thing uh look at the timing of this with the truckers going to dc with the insurrectionist planning another insurrection this time in armed insurrection putin and trump have gotten together and are plotting so to give time to the okay where do you make where do you base that assertion on you know words versus actions right one when when president trump was over in europe he schooled the europeans the eu stating how could you put yourself in such jeopardy and and of purchasing uh oil from russia in that capacity uh putting yourself in such a position of of of weakness should should putin weaponize his energy uh resources and let's face it a country can't operate without its energy so along with that president trump on his way to go visit putin announced then an executive order to continue the shutdown or to keep the shutdown of nordstream 2. okay that's not exactly somebody looking for a friend before he went and visited with putin right before right as his plane was taking off he said we're shutting down nordstrom 2 which which putin invested billions in and was going to receive billions in return okay that set the stage of what their negotiations are going to be like that's how you deal from strength okay the united states is 15 times larger gdp than russia okay so the united states we need to be dealing from strength uh putin seems to have the the the the um not the cards but at least the will to to uh deal from strength and and we've we've um uh uh haven't done that with afghanistan uh we've made uh significant mistakes there and we made significant mistakes we meeting the biden administration uh leading up to uh the uh the the surrounding uh and the p and the invasion which took place of the ukraine i mean this was this been going on for months months since august and it's not monday morning quarterbacking many of us have stated to the bite administration to secretary of defense austin what is being done are we fortifying the re the ukraines zielinski has been asking for assistance ever since we didn't we think we were calling putin's bluff well well clearly he he called hours there was no preparation no foresight no war gaming representative let me let me roll in another call for you this is from chicken sarasota florida independent line go ahead yes good morning congressman i'll try to sound a little more sane than that last caller i think what we need to do is like you said open up the energy sector completely and i'm hoping for a veto proof majority come november with uh the gop i'd ask for two dollar a gallon gas for 87 octane and put that into law along with diesel for the truckers then they can sell whatever we export but do us first this global market stuff has proven to be detrimental to america's natural national security i think we just need to take care of ourselves first if there's something else to sell after that fine but if our economy was booming then we'd have the revenues from taxes and people working to be able to get the american strength back to where it used to be and just override everything biden does if it's at all possible okay that's nick in florida well you know biden's policies are inverted to what actually works if we take on a a an aggressive approach towards drilling and accessing our energy resources in pennsylvania we have the fourth largest reserve of natural gas in the world new york state actually has one of the top that can fuel all of the united states for the next 70 years we've got these reserves we've got access to oil we need to develop the pipelines we need to set a plan on how we're going to utilize our current energy natural resources in that most pollutant-free manner carbon-free manner no not known on earth so as it's clear that drilling oil here is far cleaner than drilling in venezuela or russia or saudi arabia or iran we're actually talking to iran the center of terrorism about purchasing oil from iran somebody's going to tell me that's not an inverted upside down backwards policy rather than drilling here safely creating jobs lowering the price of oil creating national security energy independence and doing it in the most pollutant free manner possible we're going to purchase from iran a country that funds terrorism throughout the world okay that that is calling for the annihilation of israel and they'd call for the annihilation of the united states if they thought they could actually do it that's what this biden administration is working on so yeah yeah we we need a serious plan that is it has puts country first and has looking out for america's interests uh for the short term and the long term this is an energy is a big part of it this is kenneth from wilmington delaware democrats line hi senator uh representative my name is kenneth uh the domestic oil supply could even easily be supplied with the 33 000 oil wells that are in the gulf of mexico it's a simple fact that american oil companies have 33 000 wells in the gulf of mexico also in relation to a domestic carbon-free energy uh we have a nuclear matrium reactor under construction in wyoming that could use the 700 000 metric tons of nuclear waste in paducah kentucky all that has to do is be reprocessed if the reactor does not produce fissile material i don't understand why our government isn't seizing upon these energy resources well you know first with the wells back to the wells look we're at over a hundred dollar barrel of oil price isn't wouldn't it be logical that that these companies if they were sitting on these wells would now access them and and start uh bringing oil reserves from there uh and then if if if the conspiracy that's being stated is true then you know shut it down when when prices got low be because it's what's the price of oil right now 140 147 dollars i mean sky high i mean making making you know the days of jimmy carter look uh look like the good old days so so you know let's just you know look at we're in we're in a supply and demand free market economy companies are going to invest where they can get get a return and as long as it's not crazy regulations that that add to those costs and to the access which which actually do exist but to an extent they figure it out but if there's no pipelines if there's no other if there's not not refinery capacity things of that nature then they're not going to uh to drill but back on the nuclear end sure i i i agree with you we we should we should have a long-term energy plan and nuclear should certainly be a uh a part of that i'd love to see a 10-year energy plan or even 15-year plan you know to be honest with you i was in business for for close to 25 years and boy we didn't start a day we certainly didn't start a month or a quarter or a year with without a plan uh a vision a plan and then the team executes um you know you don't certain you certainly don't see this out of this this white house um and you know i i go back to the trump administration we knew what their plan was we knew what the what the priorities were and what the plan was to strengthen our economy strengthen our national security secure people with their freedoms and uh and be be the united states of america on the world stage uh representative you talk a lot about supply and demand what would you support as reducing demand for oil here in the united states and oil supplies well that that's going to happen over a transit transitionary time period you know yesterday i think it was kamala harris and pete buda judge said hey everybody go buy an electric car uh that's that's really um you know naive and out of touch and you know first of all most electric cars are pretty expensive secondly 97 of america has has gasoline driven cars um and so it's it's it's really the charging stations aren't there most electric cars only go about what about 250 miles on a charge by the way those charging stations are powered by coal plants and oil plants and nuclear plants by the way uh so it's it's it's it's a little um you know they they're not appreciating uh the larger picture here of uh of of the avvs i got nothing against evs who would we've got nothing against cleaner energy we've got to do it in an economically feasible way we can't do it in a manner that weakens the united states weakens our allies and gives strength to clear adversaries not just adversaries how about how about tyrannical brutal dictatorship style um [Music] leaders such as putin and you know china the ccp isn't exactly a uh a a basking of of of human rights right i mean genocide is taking place there um putin is is murdering at will in the ukraine okay um i mean we got a leader in the ukraine zielinski you know was offered a ride by by the biden white house to get out all right uh he said i want bullets i don't need a ride um i mean there they're fighting for freedom putin is fighting against freedom and and and probably that's the most perhaps the most important thing that's what putin fears most are people having freedom let's hear from mark in st charles missouri independent line uh yes well thank you for taking my call first of all congressman i want you to know that i agree with just about everything that you're saying it's really unbelievable what's going on and what i'd like you to do is if you could is i'd like you to comment on the economy under this biden administration the way that i see what's going on i look at this inflation and we haven't seen this in over 40 years our gas prices are going through the roof and out in california i'm seeing prices of seven and eight dollars a gallon our food prices have just gone up tremendously because of the inflation in our goods as well our open borders which is unbelievable we've got millions of people crossing our border we have terrorists coming into our country and they don't even count all the ones that get away and not only that but all of the fentanyl that is coming in and killing hundreds of thousands of united states citizens and the by demonstration just allows it to happen it seems as though to me he walks around a little bit incoherent does not take questions from people won't answer them and then as well as the afghanistan uh debacle the withdrawal there so okay carla let me stop you there because you're putting a lot there but to the point about the economy if you wanted to respond to that representative and also factor in the jobs report from last week 678 000 jobs created yeah well first off um you didn't notice anything that the gentleman just brought up in the president's state of the union uh he referenced uh the border once and jumped right to the dream the dreamers and the dream act which by the way most would would support if we had border security security first so it was really what a state of the union it was really a state of denial uh throughout it um but look related related to our economy and what needs to be done we need to have a vision set a goal for the united states to be the most competitive place in the world to run a business to sustain a business to grow a business and to start a business and that comes through uh taxes regulations in energy independence so we have stability there the right permit uh processing initiatives you know we have a fourth branch of government it's known as the bureaucracy on the state level and the and the federal level uh those tens of thousands of employees within those need to get on board with helping being on the side of job creators and and and all americans and not thinking that their job is to um is to inhibit and and give them hassles frankly um that that's that's a system that that that can be better corrected on a state level so um we we also need through through government uh to assist in the areas where we have lost specific industries to china frankly when it comes to the ingredients in pharmaceuticals or pharmaceuticals as a whole certainly in microchips and semiconductors there's a bill called the excuse me chips usa that i'm very fabled i'm sorry chips usa it will help us develop semi more semiconductor businesses within uh within the united states and and some of the large semiconductor companies are are getting it um and and they're they're willing to really out of patriotism take some of the added costs of doing business in the united states and they're building here in the u.s so so a lot of these corporations are stepping up in a you know frankly a a patriotic matter so intel for instance and others that last jobs report then is that an encouraging trend for you well first of all it was it was it was terrific i was very happy to see it it was three times what even the bite administration thought was going to come out now i will tell you on the same note a lot of the entitlements and extras and supplements that were created during covid and during the rescue plan uh that the bide administration thought was a wonderful thing to do spent another two trillion dollars of of the taxpayers money most of those uh extra benefits ended at the end of uh 2021. so january i think a lot of people not all five percent six percent is enough to to change the unemployment and create a higher level of of employed um and and bring people back to our workforce and that's probably what it was about five percent of those who could afford not to work uh came back to work and and i i i think it's pretty clear what what happened there and and that should that should continue okay one more quick call from john in baldwin merrill and democrats line go ahead john hi uh representative i just wanted to point out a couple misrepresentations that you've made but there's many it's unbelievable but you talked about opening up the keystone pipeline and pumping the oil again the keystone pipeline is only 10 complete and it wasn't pumping any oil and the tar sands oil that is up in canada is coming through by rails so that's a misrepresentation we'll bring in about 100 000 barrels a a day so i don't know what's in the middle congressman let him finish his thought please sure you've been talking a lot congressman let me just say something and then the other misrepresentation is you're talking about stopping the oil leases there are seven 000 oil leases currently held by the oil companies that they are not pumping oil they are making record profits they are refusing to pump oil on the leases that they have and that is why they are that that's that's what's going on there so uh you you're either misrepresented caller thank you thank you well i i certainly would never and i promise anyone this okay republican democrat i'd never deliberately misrepresent there's a chance i could be wrong on occasion but sir if you're pleased with the biden administration's handling of our energy policy well um well then you know um good for you um i am not i don't like that we have 4.17 or whatever it is for a gallon of regular gas i think it's highly detrimental to american families i don't like that russia has us over a barrel uh so to speak uh and and has europe uh i don't i don't like that we could be creating our own energy here far cleaner by the way and create many more jobs i don't like that the heating oil in someone's home including natural gas is up two even three times okay again diminishing the disposable income of american families pennsylvania families families in in my district so i'm going to not only voice i'm going to work for legislation that that corrects that uh we've got only about a minute congressman but i wanted to ask you about the supreme court's decision yesterday to let the reworked congressional map there in pennsylvania stand well it's it's more than just disappointing we have a legislative process in pennsylvania as per our our constitution on how the congressional district map should be derived uh and it wasn't followed um and it went to the supreme court they they've done this once before the state supreme court that is they drew up their their own map okay which is not favorable to republicans as you'd imagine since the governor as a democrat as well as the supreme court uh in pennsylvania tends to be uh very very political and and happens to be democrats so um it's what's done is done okay i won't say it was a uh a a terrible map in the end although although let me even retract that yeah in many ways it was it was worse than it was then it was positive you know in my district i received i retained 70 of my district but i got to tell you that that's that's no consolation when when we lose a a a fabulous uh republican member of um of of the u.s house who's a friend and colleague of mine so no consolation there whatsoever it's wrong the constitution matters not only does it matter it should be followed in a very strict way both state constitutions and u.s constitutions and if it is to be changed it needs to be done by a referendum by the people so um yeah uh when you see something like that happen uh it it it diminishes trust in our in our government system because the rule book i.e the constitution uh is what we must be able to rely upon for the rules of government and for our individual freedoms representative dam user republican of pennsylvania thanks for your time today thank you

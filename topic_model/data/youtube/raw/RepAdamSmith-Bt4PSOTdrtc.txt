that was in coming house sorry Senate leader that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer great to have with us now Democratic congressman Adam Smith from Washington State congressman thank you for joining us first I want to get your take as well in terms of how everything played out today were you at all surprised that the 180 degree change from last night till this afternoon not really I mean there's really an odd way to do it I actually agree with congressman Brooks that you know to bring this out the night before and spring it upon people most people don't understand how the ethics committee works in fact I've heard all day long that the Republicans were proposing to disband the ethics committee that's not what they were proposing to do they were proposing to disband the independent ethics committee which I think also is a mistake but they were still going to be an ethics committee in place but this is not something you do the night before the vote and then the spring on everybody and I think the public reaction let them know that there was strong disapproval to this move and public reaction is certainly one thing no doubt about it it was you know very well documented but do you at all give any credit to Donald Trump president-elect Trump for weighing in today and and whether or not that tweet that he sent out today had an impact not to sound unfair but no well I don't why not can be well because members of Congress are very responsive to their constituents and whether Donald Trump had tweeted or not the constituent outcry was more than enough to get Republicans to battle so I just want to understand are you saying it's a coincidence that you know there was a change by Congress today on this issue despite the fact that Donald Trump was tweeting about it in a kind of sarcastic way it's it's not a coincidence that not sure how that word applies here what I'm saying is that the backlash from the public carried far greater weight and I think even if Donald Trump hadn't tweeted the patent the backlash from the public would have been enough to get them to pull it okay and in terms of how you see this playing out is this an issue that is going to come back at some point or do you think that now this particularly sure has been shell for the time being well I think the way they did it pretty much kills it they could have had a longer debate about the the role of the independent Ethics Commission as they take complaints and how they then forward them to the Ethics Commission and all very exciting stuff but probably you know wouldn't have cared that much about but when you bring it out this way I'm saying you're getting rid of the independent Ethics Commission I think this is pretty much dead for the foreseeable future

the gentleman is recognized for three minutes I thank the gentleman for yielding you know many years ago I worked as a bicycle mechanic so I know how to patch it too but if you get to the point where you can't see the too many more for the patches then it's time for new too well that's where we're at here today we've had study after study that are we are not even investing enough money in our infrastructure to bring it up to a state of good repair let alone build a modern 21st century century infrastructure we were the envy of the world with the eyes and our program we were the envy of the world number one infrastructure in the world where are we now we're number 26 we're down there slugging it out with third world countries in terms of our infrastructure having 40 thousand bridges 140 thousand bridges on the national highway system need repair replacement forty percent of the national highway system is so deteriorated it has to be totally replaced you can't just patch it anymore you can't resurface it anymore and our transit agencies have a 70 billion dollar backlog to bring their existing systems up to a state of good repair not to build new new transit options for Americans no just to bring what we have up to a state of good repair why are we here today because there's people on that side of the aisle oh I actually don't believe it is either the duty obligation or right of the federal government to invest in a national highway system a national transportation system they believe in devolution make the states to it we tried that the 1950s Kansas built a brand-new Turnpike it ended at the Oklahoma border because Oklahoma ran out of money and they didn't build it until the Eisenhower bill went through they want to go back to those good old days the 1950s when you couldn't even have roads that connected between states that's nuts it was bad in the middle of the last century it's nuts for the 21st century so are we just going to kick the can down the road again if they if we pass this Republican proposal to continue the current anemic levels of funding into next May that is not going to bring the states the certainty they need it's not going to bring the industry the robust investment they need it's not going to get us the jobs we need yeah we'll limp along to next May and then they'll be incredible uncertainty about the next construction season there won't be major new projects planned nothing will happen we need to resolve that this year we should stay here as the gentleman from Oregon said every solve it this august five weeks guys five weeks we can't get to this issue and then you got kicking into next year better at least that we're confronted with it before the end of this year then maybe we can get a robust funding source maybe we can make the investments we need maybe we could give the states the tools they need next construction season and the certainty they need next construction season to go forward we just had a study from Standard & Poor's that for every 1.3 billion dollars we put into transportation infrastructure we get with the gentleman yield an additional minute does he have it oh you german edition okay we just had a standard board study twenty-nine thousand jobs are created these are not just construction jobs their engineering jobs their technical jobs their manufacturing jobs for the equipment that goes into this or the steel that goes into this these are small business jobs with a small business set-aside we are foregoing an incredible stimulus to our economy putting hundreds of thousands of Americans back to work or at work building us yet again toward a world-class infrastructure you know it's just shameful it's just shameful this has been bipartisan forever Washington canals and highways Lincoln the Transcontinental Railroad Eisenhower the national highway system and Ronald Reagan put transit into the national highway program and now we're here limpet along with yet another patch that isn't adequate that won't give us the recovery we need won't give us the transportation infrastructure we need to be competitive in the 21st century it's a very sad day we should reject this proposal and get to work the gentleman's time has expired the gentleman from Pennsylvania

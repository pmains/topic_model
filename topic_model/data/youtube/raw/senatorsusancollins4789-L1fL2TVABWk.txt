never would I have guessed that the lowly potato would turn out to be it's such a contentious issue as the chairman of the subcommittee has pointed out the potato the fresh white potato is the one and only fruit or vegetable that is now excluded from the WIC program in a truly perplexing decision by USDA unfathomably the department did not base its rule for the work food packages on the most recent dietary guidelines which reflect the latest science those guidelines found for example that we're not getting enough potassium nor fiber in our diet I passed out a little chart that compares the potato with a banana everyone thinks of bananas when they think of potassium and yet in fact the potato has more potassium in it than a banana be the guidelines that were issued in 2010 also actually called for an increase in the amount of vegetables in the categories in which potatoes fall and yet that was not reflected in the department's decision I do want to point out that we're not talking about french fries or potato chips here these were talking about fresh white potatoes that do not have added sugars fats or oils and so I think that's important to know as well thank you madam chairwoman I wonder if the senator from Iowa is aware of the fact that this bag of potatoes can be but in his state with a WIC voucher at a farmers market I'm very but not at a grocery store how in the world and that make any sense whatsoever you can buy this Adam if you go to a farmers market that accepts a WIC voucher but you can't buy it if you go to a grocery store we're second if you look at the 20 the most recent dietary guidelines in 2010 you will see that the Department chose instead to use guidelines that were written in 2005 rather than 2010 in excluding the white potato the fact is potatoes are cholesterol free fat free sodium free a good source of vitamin B of folate a good source of potassium of fiber and vitamin C and it makes no sense that you're allowed to buy iceberg lettuce with a WIC voucher which has very few nutrients and you cannot buy wholesome affordable potatoes unless of course you go to a farmers market Sarah Lahey Grangier
